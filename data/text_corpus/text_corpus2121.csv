iwue and pfp the present study sheds light on the contributions of these practices clarifies their impacts and provides a basis for evaluating and selecting better management practices for growing potatoes keywords potato nitrogen fertilizer dry matter iwue nue 1 introduction potato solanum tuberosum l is widely cultivated all over the world because it is rich in nutrients easy to cultivate and highly productive it is currently the fourth most important food crop in the world after wheat rice and maize zaheer and akhtar 2016 water and fertilizer are two important factors affecting potato growth and yield in agricultural production badr et al 2012 rational irrigation and fertilization are two of the main ways to increase potato yield gao et al 2015 potato is one of the main crops in the arid area of northwest china qin et al 2014 because of frequent droughts and the lack of rain in northwest china groundwater overexploitation and excessive chemical fertilizer inputs are often used to pursue higher tuber yield tan et al 2016 the excessive application of chemical fertilizers causes a series of problems such as low water use efficiency wue low fertilizer use efficiency and large nitrogen loss and affects the sustainable use of farmland bellarby et al 2018 cui et al 2018 qin et al 2018 rahman and zhang 2018 wang et al 2019b potatoes are very sensitive to soil water so the relationship between the available water in soil and the water requirements of potatoes is considered an important factor in determining potato yield steyn et al 2016 large areas of potato cultivation in northwest china are usually operated under irrigation due to low and unreliable rainfall except in areas limited by topography and irrigation water sources nolan et al 2008 irrigation is the key factor leading to a high and stable yield of potatoes mainly due to the following reasons first the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall in potato planting areas is not uniform resulting in water shortages during the sensitive period of potato water demand wang et al 2006 second summer is the main growing season for potatoes and higher temperatures lead to higher evapotranspiration adavi et al 2018 haverkort and struik 2015 third potatoes are mainly planted in sandy soil because it has good air permeability and is beneficial for tuber expansion but its water and nutrient preservation is poor feng et al 2018 prasad et al 2015 yu et al 2016 most of the water resources in these areas are pumped from groundwater mainly through full irrigation with a drip system yang et al 2017b zhou et al 2018 the extraction of underground water has a great impact on the environment and the groundwater level has fallen seriously in some areas chen et al 2016 2020 kang et al 2017 xu et al 2019 the determination of a reasonable amount of irrigation is an effective measure for alleviating the overexploitation of groundwater therefore maximizing the use of water is particularly important because of the limitations on energy and water resources with the wide application of drip irrigation systems in potato production fertigation is considered an efficient water and fertilizer management technology gao et al 2017 reyes cabrera et al 2016 yan et al 2020 yang et al 2017a fertilization is an important measure for maintaining soil fertility and increasing potato tuber yield ideally the amount of fertilizer applied should be equal to the amount absorbed by the potato because of the environmental impacts of excess fertilization in the potato growing area of northern shaanxi 50 3 of the farmers applied excessive fertilizer which not only increased the planting cost but also posed a potential threat to the soil wang et al 2013 many researchers have studied the effects of irrigation and fertilization on potato growth and yield da silva et al 2018 ierna and mauromicale 2018 ierna et al 2011 kirkham et al 1974 peralta and stockle 2002 sun et al 2015 waddell et al 2000 woli et al 2016 the main findings are as follows 1 there is a significant interaction between the irrigation amount and the fertilization rate on potato tuber yield and water productivity 2 water productivity is negatively correlated with the irrigation amount and positively correlated with the fertilizer application rate 3 fertilizer productivity increases with the increase in the irrigation amount under a medium level of fertilization and excessive nitrogen fertilizer significantly increases the nitrate concentration in groundwater in recent years with the improvement of living standards the requirements for potato quality have also increased although much literature has focused on potato quality and the improvement of quality through conventional breeding and marker assisted selection alamar et al 2017 bradshaw 2017 sverrisdóttir et al 2017 there are few studies on the comprehensive evaluation of potato tuber yield quality wue and fertilizer use efficiency with fertigation in addition understanding the distribution of soil water and nutrients is essential to reducing the input of water and fertilizer in cultivation management without sacrificing yield previous studies mostly focused on the interaction between irrigation level and fertilization rate on potato growth and tuber yield bélanger et al 2000 badr et al 2012 nurmanov et al 2019 zhou et al 2016 and some researchers studied the effects of nitrogen fertilizer rates and timing rens et al 2016 2018 nitrogen fertilizer placement and sources cambouris et al 2016 gao et al 2018 partial root zone drying and deficit irrigation liu et al 2015a different irrigation methods matović et al 2016 and water saving irrigation techniques zin el abedin et al 2017 on the field management of potatoes the dripper discharge rate directly affects the soil wetting area and indirectly affects root growth because of root hydrophilicity mmolawa and or 2000 yang et al 2017a low dripper discharge irrigation is considered to be an effective method of irrigation providing the optimal amount of water and fertilizer directly to the root system trifonov et al 2017 especially under the conditions of fertigation the dripper discharge rate is important because the concentration of the input liquid is the main factor affecting the distribution of soil nitrate n however field studies on the coupling effect of water and fertilizer with different dripper discharge rates have rarely been reported in particularly in arid and semiarid regions there is still more room for research on the comprehensive influence of water and fertilizer supply with dripper discharge rate on potato tuber yield quality water and fertilizer utilization efficiency as well as on a water and fertilizer management strategy that allows these four parameters to achieve a relatively optimal state at the same time the objective of this study was 1 to quantify the interactive effects of irrigation amount fertilizer application rate and dripper discharge rate on soil water and soil nutrient distribution 2 to evaluate the interaction of these three factors on potato tuber yield quality wue and fertilizer utilization efficiency and 3 to determine an optimal combined water and fertilizer management strategy to achieve relatively high potato tuber yield quality wue and fertilizer use

used in evaluating and analyzing the effects of field management techniques in recent years chen et al 2019 hou et al 2018 potato tuber yields are often limited by water shortages and low soil nutrients in sandy soil therefore a more accurate water and fertilizer resource management mode is an effective way to achieve better tuber yield and higher largest tuber weights and commodity tuber weights in this study the tuber weight and commodity tuber weight were more sensitive to fertilizer than to water the tuber yield largest tuber weight and commodity tuber weight increased with increasing fertilizer application rate under the same dripper discharge and irrigation amount fig 3 similar results were also obtained by ayyub et al 2019 and rens et al 2018 however the highest tuber yield largest tuber weight and commodity tuber weight were obtained at the 80 etc for irrigation amount in this study these results differ from those of camargo et al 2015 in which the highest tuber yield was obtained under irrigation at 100 etc this difference occurred mainly because the evaporation loss from sprinkler irrigation is greater than that from drip irrigation many previous studies have been consistent with our result that the yield and yield components with an irrigation amount of 80 etc with surface drip irrigation can be equivalent to those under 100 etc badr et al 2010 ierna and mauromicale 2018 martínez romero et al 2019 montoya et al 2016 previous studies mainly focused on the effects of fertilizer rate and irrigation amount on potato yield chilundo et al 2016 milroy et al 2019 woli et al 2016 we carried out a study on the effect of three factors fertilizer rate irrigation amount and dripper discharge rate on potato yield and found that the potato yield increased with the increase in dripper discharge rate fig 3 this phenomenon may be related to the wide and shallow wet areas formed by high dripper discharge and the narrow and deep wet areas formed by low dripper discharge in sandy soil skaggs et al 2010 low dripper discharge causes deep leakage of water and nutrients liu et al 2015b which leads to low water and fertilizer use efficiency and declines in potato yield thus it is recommended to use a high dripper discharge rate to increase potato yield in sandy soils 4 2 factors affecting potato tuber quality appropriate field management practices are very important for balancing potato yield and environmental impact with the improvement in living standards potato tuber quality has become a necessary parameter for evaluating field management naumann et al 2020 we also found that potato tuber yield was positively correlated with vitamin c content soluble protein content and starch content but potato tuber yield was negatively correlated with reducing sugar content fig 7 many of the findings of other studies are consistent with our research whitworth et al 2016 revealed that the higher the potato tuber yield is the higher the soluble protein and vitamin c content van dingenen et al 2019 also found that limited nitrogen did not affect potato tuber yield or starch content but decreased the tuber sugar content significantly the current results also showed that starch content and reducing sugar content were more sensitive to the fertilizer rate than to the irrigation amount and were least sensitive to the dripper discharge rate on the one hand high fertilizer application significantly increased the accumulation of starch content and reducing sugar content at the later stage of potato maturation illera vives et al 2017 on the other hand water deficiency only caused a change in key carbohydrate metabolism enzyme activity which made the tuber change from its starch synthesis function to its starch mobilization function thompson et al 2008 however the soluble protein content and vitamin c content were more sensitive to the fertilizer rate than to the dripper discharge rate and were least sensitive to the irrigation amount this phenomenon may be related to changes in the soil physical and chemical properties and soil microorganisms with different dripper discharge rates therefore it remains to be further studied whether the effect of different dripper discharge rates on potato tuber quality is caused by soil environmental changes potato tuber quality is closely related to fertilization and irrigation many researchers have studied the effects of water and fertilizer supply on potato quality reducing the water supply can significantly increase the starch content and reduce the vitamin c content shishir and chen 2017 wang et al 2019a zhang et al 2017 our results showed that the starch and vitamin c contents increased first and then decreased with increasing irrigation amount this is similar to some earlier studies in which the relationship between the vitamin c content and the irrigation amount could be described by a quadratic equation yang et al 2017a increasing the amount of fertilizer can increase the content of starch and reduce the content of reducing sugar li et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 our results showed that the contents of starch and vitamin c at the low fertilizer rate were lower than those under the high fertilizer rate on average over all dripper discharge rates and irrigation amounts in addition the reducing sugar content under the low fertilizer rate was higher than that under the high fertilizer rate on average over all dripper discharge rates and irrigation amounts the distribution of crop roots under drip irrigation is limited by the volume of wetted soil perpendicular to the dripper especially in arid or semiarid areas wang et al 2007 too small a volume of wetted soil will reduce the range of root growth further limiting the absorption of nutrients and water de willigen et al 2018 our results showed that at the same irrigation and fertilization levels the soluble protein content and vitamin c content increased with the increase in dripper discharge rate therefore a suitable dripper discharge rate is an important factor in improving potato tuber quality considering only the potato tuber quality the results of this study showed that medium irrigation amount 80 etc high fertilizer rate n240 and high dripper discharge rate 3 l h 1 were the best combinations in sandy soil however it is necessary to study the influence of the dripper discharge rate on potato tuber quality under different soil types 4 3 factors affecting irrigation water use efficiency and partial fertilizer productivity drip fertigation can reduce water usage by 35 and improve nitrogen use efficiency in potato production ullah et al 2019 there were significant differences in iwue between the different irrigation and fertilization treatments in the two years the iwue decreases with the increase in the irrigation amount and increases with the increase in the fertilizer rate these results are consistent with those of previous studies the iwue of the water deficit treatment was higher than that of the full irrigation treatment xiaoli et al 2020 zin el abedin et al 2017 the iwue increases with the increase in the nitrogen fertilizer application rate while it decreases with the increase in the irrigation level alenazi et al 2016 we also found that the iwue first increased and then decreased with the increase in the dripper discharge rate this phenomenon may be related to the range of soil wetting volumes on the one hand broad soil wetting volumes may cause substantial water evaporation losses under a high dripper discharge rate leach water and nutrients and cause a temporary lack of soil oxygen on the other hand narrow soil wetting bodies may cause a large amount of water to percolate into the deep soil under a low dripper discharge rate possibly accompanied by the loss of soil nitrate n fig 4 in addition our study also showed that an appropriate dripper discharge rate was beneficial for improving potato tuber yield and irrigation water use efficiency considering only the iwue the results of this study showed that a low irrigation amount 60 etc a high fertilizer rate n240 and a moderate dripper discharge rate 2 l h 1 were the best combination in sandy soil the pfp of n120 was significantly higher than that of n180 and n240 at the same irrigation amount and dripper discharge rate moreover the pfp increased first and then decreased with the increase in the irrigation amount and dripper discharge rate these results are consistent with previous research results showing that potato tuber yield and partial fertilizer yield can be significantly increased by a suitable irrigation treatment chien et al 2009 saeed et al 2008 sarker et al 2019 we found that the t5 treatment medium irrigation amount 80 etc low fertilizer rate n120 medium dripper discharge 2 l h 1 had the highest pfp in both years in short optimal water and fertilizer management techniques cannot be determined by a single indicator 4 4 selection and evaluation of optimal water and fertilizer management conditions pca is an unsupervised multivariate analysis method used to create a transformation set which converts observed variables into a new set of unrelated variables and reduces their dimensions by designing a new coordinate axis which is called a principal component de mello et al 2016 many researchers suggest that pca be used for data analysis when selecting the optimal combination of parameters in various fields jolliffe ian and cadima 2016 li et al 2018 tyanova et al 2016 dersseh et al 2016 found that improved varieties inorganic fertilizers and strong marketing of products are the best combinations for potato farming systems in chencha ethiopia using pca muthoni et al 2015 used the pca method to select the best genotype and environmental factors suitable for the stability of potato tuber yield and resistance to bacterial wilt in kenya the first two principal components contributing approximately 97 5 of the variance with eigenvalues of 1 0 were employed to draw a biplot graph our results indicated that the first three principal components contributing approximately 89 9 in 2017 and 93 1 in 2018 to the variances with eigenvalues of 1 0 were employed to draw the factor loading distribution map our study and the pca show that t4 medium irrigation amount 80 etc medium fertilizer rate n180 high dripper discharge rate 3 l h 1 ranked first in the two years the t4 treatment had the highest tuber yield and pfp and had relatively high quality in both years in particular the t4 treatment had a moderate nitrate n content in this study therefore t4 treatment is recommended as an optimal water and fertilizer management practice in sandy soil areas this research objectivity selects the optimal water and fertilizer management practices for sandy soil and explores the importance of the dripper discharge rate in regulating potato tuber quality and water and fertilizer use efficiency 5 conclusion the tuber weight largest tuber weight commodity tuber weight dry matter accumulation and vitamin c content increased with increasing fertilizer application and dripper discharge rates the reducing sugar content and pfp decreased with the increase in the fertilizer rate the starch content and reducing sugar content were more sensitive to the fertilizer rate than to the irrigation amount and were least sensitive to the dripper discharge rate the soluble protein content and vitamin c content were more sensitive to the fertilizer rate than to the dripper discharge rate and were least sensitive to the irrigation amount the t4 treatment had the highest tuber yield and pfp and had relatively high quality in both years this method elucidates the contribution and impact of these practices and provides a basis for evaluating and selecting better potato planting management practices these results are of great significance for improving the water and fertilizer input management of field crops and implementing rational drip irrigation and fertilization systems in northwest china and other parts of the world in addition the optimization results of this study were determined before sowing in the future we will focus on irrigation and fertilization levels including more gradient levels to better estimate the input rates of the t2 treatment declaration of competing interest

dry matter accumulation and vitamin c content increased with the increase in the fertilizer application rate and the dripper discharge rate the content of reducing sugar and pfp decreased with increasing fertilizer rate on average across all treatments the potato tuber yield of n240 was 6 7 and 23 9 higher than that of n180 and n120 respectively on average across all treatments the starch content of n240 was 23 8 and 28 9 higher than that of n180 and n120 respectively on average across all treatments the vitamin c content of n240 was 39 8 and 60 higher than that of n180 and n120 respectively the vitamin c content at 3 l h 1 was 6 2 and 7 8 higher than that at 2 l h 1 and 1 l h 1 respectively on average across all treatments the reducing sugar content of n120 was 13 2 and 29 9 higher than that of n180 and n240 respectively on average across all treatments the pfp at 80 etc was 19 8 and 20 3 higher than that of 60 etc and 100 etc respectively the pfp for 2 l h 1 was 11 3 and 12 3 higher than that for 1 l h 1 and 3 l h 1 respectively interestingly the t4 treatment irrigation amount of 80 etc dripper discharge of 3 l h 1 and fertilizer rate of n180 was twice ranked first after combinational evaluations in conclusion the proper application of the t4 i2d3n180 treatment may be a good compromise for growing potatoes in sandy soil with regard to tuber yield and quality iwue and pfp the present study sheds light on the contributions of these practices clarifies their impacts and provides a basis for evaluating and selecting better management practices for growing potatoes keywords potato nitrogen fertilizer dry matter iwue nue 1 introduction potato solanum tuberosum l is widely cultivated all over the world because it is rich in nutrients easy to cultivate and highly productive it is currently the fourth most important food crop in the world after wheat rice and maize zaheer and akhtar 2016 water and fertilizer are two important factors affecting potato growth and yield in agricultural production badr et al 2012 rational irrigation and fertilization are two of the main ways to increase potato yield gao et al 2015 potato is one of the main crops in the arid area of northwest china qin et al 2014 because of frequent droughts and the lack of rain in northwest china groundwater overexploitation and excessive chemical fertilizer inputs are often used to pursue higher tuber yield tan et al 2016 the excessive application of chemical fertilizers causes a series of problems such as low water use efficiency wue low fertilizer use efficiency and large nitrogen loss and affects the sustainable use of farmland bellarby et al 2018 cui et al 2018 qin et al 2018 rahman and zhang 2018 wang et al 2019b potatoes are very sensitive to soil water so the relationship between the available water in soil and the water requirements of potatoes is considered an important factor in determining potato yield steyn et al 2016 large areas of potato cultivation in northwest china are usually operated under irrigation due to low and unreliable rainfall except in areas limited by topography and irrigation water sources nolan et al 2008 irrigation is the key factor leading to a high and stable yield of potatoes mainly due to the following reasons first the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall in potato planting areas is not uniform resulting in water shortages during the sensitive period of potato water demand wang et al 2006 second summer is the main growing season for potatoes and higher temperatures lead to higher evapotranspiration adavi et al 2018 haverkort and struik 2015 third potatoes are mainly planted in sandy soil because it has good air permeability and is beneficial for tuber expansion but its water and nutrient preservation is poor feng et al 2018 prasad et al 2015 yu et al 2016 most of the water resources in these areas are pumped from groundwater mainly through full irrigation with a drip system yang et al 2017b zhou et al 2018 the extraction of underground water has a great impact on the environment and the groundwater level has fallen seriously in some areas chen et al 2016 2020 kang et al 2017 xu et al 2019 the determination of a reasonable amount of irrigation is an effective measure for alleviating the overexploitation of groundwater therefore maximizing the use of water is particularly important because of the limitations on energy and water resources with the wide application of drip irrigation systems in potato production fertigation is considered an efficient water and fertilizer management technology gao et al 2017 reyes cabrera et al 2016 yan et al 2020 yang et al 2017a fertilization is an important measure for maintaining soil fertility and increasing potato tuber yield ideally the amount of fertilizer applied should be equal to the amount absorbed by the potato because of the environmental impacts of excess fertilization in the potato growing area of northern shaanxi 50 3 of the farmers applied excessive fertilizer which not only increased the planting cost but also posed a potential threat to the soil wang et al 2013 many researchers have studied the effects of irrigation and fertilization on potato growth and yield da silva et al 2018 ierna and mauromicale 2018 ierna et al 2011 kirkham et al 1974 peralta and stockle 2002 sun et al 2015 waddell et al 2000 woli et al 2016 the main findings are as follows 1 there is a significant interaction between the irrigation amount and the fertilization rate on potato tuber yield and water productivity 2 water productivity is negatively correlated with the irrigation amount and positively correlated with the fertilizer application rate 3 fertilizer productivity increases with the increase in the irrigation amount under a medium level of fertilization and excessive nitrogen fertilizer significantly increases the nitrate concentration in groundwater in recent years with the improvement of living standards the requirements for potato quality have also increased although much literature has focused on potato quality and the improvement of quality through conventional breeding and marker assisted selection alamar et al 2017 bradshaw 2017 sverrisdóttir et al 2017 there are few studies on the comprehensive evaluation of potato tuber yield quality wue and fertilizer use efficiency with fertigation in addition understanding the distribution of soil water and nutrients is essential to reducing the input of water and fertilizer in cultivation management without sacrificing yield previous studies mostly focused on the interaction between irrigation level and fertilization rate on potato growth and tuber yield bélanger et al 2000 badr et al 2012 nurmanov et al 2019 zhou et al 2016 and some researchers studied the effects of nitrogen fertilizer rates and timing rens et al 2016 2018 nitrogen fertilizer placement and sources cambouris et al 2016 gao et al 2018 partial root zone drying and deficit irrigation liu et al 2015a different irrigation methods matović et al 2016 and water saving irrigation techniques zin el abedin et al 2017 on the field management of potatoes the dripper discharge rate directly affects the soil wetting area and indirectly affects root growth because of root hydrophilicity mmolawa and or 2000 yang et al 2017a low dripper discharge irrigation is considered to be an effective method of irrigation providing the optimal amount of water and fertilizer directly to the root system trifonov et al 2017 especially under the conditions of fertigation the dripper discharge rate is important because the concentration of the input liquid is the main factor affecting the distribution of soil nitrate n however field studies on the coupling effect of water and fertilizer with different dripper discharge rates have rarely been reported in particularly in arid and semiarid regions there is still more room for research on the comprehensive influence of water and fertilizer supply with dripper discharge rate on potato tuber yield quality water and fertilizer utilization efficiency as well as on a water and fertilizer management strategy that allows these four parameters to achieve a relatively optimal state at the same time the objective of this study was 1 to quantify the interactive effects of irrigation amount fertilizer application rate and dripper discharge rate on soil water and soil nutrient distribution 2 to evaluate the interaction of these three factors on potato tuber yield quality wue and fertilizer utilization efficiency and 3 to determine an optimal combined water and fertilizer management strategy to achieve relatively high potato tuber yield quality wue and fertilizer use

drip irrigation system is shown in fig 2 each plot was seeded with ten rows of potatoes resulting in a density of 50 000 plants ha 1 the experimental design was the same for both years the same experimental plot was used for both years throughout the potato s growing period plants and pests were managed according to local customs after harvest the drip tapes and plastic film were collected and recycled by the manufacturer alfalfa was then planted in all plots to balance the remaining fertilizer among the different treatments the etc under different irrigation regimes was calculated as 1

to evaluate the effect of different dripper discharge rates irrigation amounts and fertilizer rates on the parameters under study significant differences between the detected parameters were compared by tukey s hsd test at the 95 confidence level p 0 05 in addition the effects of dripper discharge rate irrigation amount and fertilizer rate on the relationships among all the parameters were calculated using bivariate correlation analysis pearson correlation coefficients and a two tailed test of significance spss statistical software 16 0 and sigma plot 14 0 were used for statistical analysis and data plotting 3 results 3 1 potato tuber yield and dry matter accumulation significant differences in potato tuber yield and dry matter accumulation were observed in the different dripper discharge rate irrigation amount and fertilizer rate treatments compared with ck in both years fig 3 the tuber weight per plant was more sensitive to the fertilizer rate than to the irrigation amount and was least sensitive to the dripper discharge rate supplemental table s1 a similar trend was observed in commodity tuber weight and dry matter accumulation but the largest tuber weight was more sensitive to the irrigation amount than to the fertilizer rate in 2017 supplemental table s1 the tuber weight per plant increased with increasing fertilizer application rate under the same dripper

respectively fig 3a b the tuber weight per plant increased with increasing dripper discharge rate but the difference between them was not significant under the same irrigation amount and fertilizer rate fig 3 compared with ck 3 l h 1 2 l h 1 and 1 l h 1 increased the tuber weight per plant by 159 8 157 2 and 142 6 in 2017 and by 165 8 156 and 146 7 in 2018 respectively the largest tuber weight commodity tuber weight and dry matter accumulation showed similar trends in both years fig 3c h 3 2 soil nitrate n content the nitrate n content decreased with increasing soil depth and the nitrate n content under the n240 fertilizer rate was higher than that under the other fertilizer rates on april 27 2017 and april 26 2018 fig 4 a b averaging across dripper discharge rates irrigation amounts

last 4 discussion 4 1 factors affecting potato tuber yield potato tuber yield largest tuber weight and commodity tuber weight are all important parameters of potato productivity and have been widely used in evaluating and analyzing the effects of field management techniques in recent years chen et al 2019 hou et al 2018 potato tuber yields are often limited by water shortages and low soil nutrients in sandy soil therefore a more accurate water and fertilizer resource management mode is an effective way to achieve better tuber yield and higher largest tuber weights and commodity tuber weights in this study the tuber weight and commodity tuber weight were more sensitive to fertilizer than to water the tuber yield largest tuber weight and commodity tuber weight increased with increasing fertilizer application rate under the same dripper discharge and irrigation amount fig 3 similar results were also obtained by ayyub et al 2019 and rens et al 2018 however the highest tuber yield largest tuber weight and commodity tuber weight were obtained at the 80 etc for irrigation amount in this study these results differ from those of camargo et al 2015 in which the highest tuber yield was obtained under irrigation at 100 etc this difference occurred mainly because the evaporation loss from sprinkler irrigation is greater than that from drip irrigation many previous studies have been consistent with our result that the yield and yield components with an irrigation amount of 80 etc with surface drip irrigation can be equivalent to those under 100 etc badr et al 2010 ierna and mauromicale 2018 martínez romero et al 2019 montoya et al 2016 previous studies mainly focused on the effects of fertilizer rate and irrigation amount on potato yield chilundo et al 2016 milroy et al 2019 woli et al 2016 we carried out a study on the effect of three factors fertilizer rate irrigation amount and dripper discharge rate on potato yield and found that the potato yield increased with the increase in dripper discharge rate fig 3 this phenomenon may be related to the wide and shallow wet areas formed by high dripper discharge and the narrow and deep wet areas formed by low dripper discharge in sandy soil skaggs et al 2010 low dripper discharge causes deep leakage of water and nutrients liu et al 2015b which leads to low water and fertilizer use efficiency and declines in potato yield thus it is recommended to use a high dripper discharge rate to increase potato yield in sandy soils 4 2 factors affecting potato tuber quality appropriate field management practices are very important for balancing potato yield and environmental impact with the improvement in living standards potato tuber quality has become a necessary parameter for evaluating field management naumann et al 2020 we also found that potato tuber yield was positively correlated with vitamin c content soluble protein content and starch content but potato tuber yield was negatively correlated with reducing sugar content fig 7 many of the findings of other studies are consistent with our research whitworth et al 2016 revealed that the higher the potato tuber yield is the higher the soluble protein and vitamin c content van dingenen et al 2019 also found that limited nitrogen did not affect potato tuber yield or starch content but decreased the tuber sugar content significantly the current results also showed that starch content and reducing sugar content were more sensitive to the fertilizer rate than to the irrigation amount and were least sensitive to the dripper discharge rate on the one hand high fertilizer application significantly increased the accumulation of starch content and reducing sugar content at the later stage of potato maturation illera vives et al 2017 on the other hand water deficiency only caused a change in key carbohydrate metabolism enzyme activity which made the tuber change from its starch synthesis function to its starch mobilization function thompson et al 2008 however the soluble protein content and vitamin c content were more sensitive to the fertilizer rate than to the dripper discharge rate and were least sensitive to the irrigation amount this phenomenon may be related to changes in the soil physical and chemical properties and soil microorganisms with different dripper discharge rates therefore it remains to be further studied whether the effect of different dripper discharge rates on potato tuber quality is caused by soil environmental changes potato tuber quality is closely related to fertilization and irrigation many researchers have studied the effects of water and fertilizer supply on potato quality reducing the water supply can significantly increase the starch content and reduce the vitamin c content shishir and chen 2017 wang et al 2019a zhang et al 2017 our results showed that the starch and vitamin c contents increased first and then decreased with increasing irrigation amount this is similar to some earlier studies in which the relationship between the vitamin c content and the irrigation amount could be described by a quadratic equation yang et al 2017a increasing the amount of fertilizer can increase the content of starch and reduce the content of reducing sugar li et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 our results showed that the contents of starch and vitamin c at the low fertilizer rate were lower than those under the high fertilizer rate on average over all dripper discharge rates and irrigation amounts in addition the reducing sugar content under the low fertilizer rate was higher than that under the high fertilizer rate on average over all dripper discharge rates and irrigation amounts the distribution of crop roots under drip irrigation is limited by the volume of wetted soil perpendicular to the dripper especially in arid or semiarid areas wang et al 2007 too small a volume of wetted soil will reduce the range of root growth further limiting the absorption of nutrients and water de willigen et al 2018 our results showed that at the same irrigation and fertilization levels the soluble protein content and vitamin c content increased with the increase in dripper discharge rate therefore a suitable dripper discharge rate is an important factor in improving potato tuber quality considering only the potato tuber quality the results of this study showed that medium irrigation amount 80 etc high fertilizer rate n240 and high dripper discharge rate 3 l h 1 were the best combinations in sandy soil however it is necessary to study the influence of the dripper discharge rate on potato tuber quality under different soil types 4 3 factors affecting irrigation water use efficiency and partial fertilizer productivity drip fertigation can reduce water usage by 35 and improve nitrogen use efficiency in potato production ullah et al 2019 there were significant differences in iwue between the different irrigation and fertilization treatments in the two years the iwue decreases with the increase in the irrigation amount and increases with the increase in the fertilizer rate these results are consistent with those of previous studies the iwue of the water deficit treatment was higher than that of the full irrigation treatment xiaoli et al 2020 zin el abedin et al 2017 the iwue increases with the increase in the nitrogen fertilizer application rate while it decreases with the increase in the irrigation level alenazi et al 2016 we also found that the iwue first increased and then decreased with the increase in the dripper discharge rate this phenomenon may be related to the range of soil wetting volumes on the one hand broad soil wetting volumes may cause substantial water evaporation losses under a high dripper discharge rate leach water and nutrients and cause a temporary lack of soil oxygen on the other hand narrow soil wetting bodies may cause a large amount of water to percolate into the deep soil under a low dripper discharge rate possibly accompanied by the loss of soil nitrate n fig 4 in addition our study also showed that an appropriate dripper discharge rate was beneficial for improving potato tuber yield and irrigation water use efficiency considering only the iwue the results of this study showed that a low irrigation amount 60 etc a high fertilizer rate n240 and a moderate dripper discharge rate 2 l h 1 were the best combination in sandy soil the pfp of n120 was significantly higher than that of n180 and n240 at the same irrigation amount and dripper discharge rate moreover the pfp increased first and then decreased with the increase in the irrigation amount and dripper discharge rate these results are consistent with previous research results showing that potato tuber yield and partial fertilizer yield can be significantly increased by a suitable irrigation treatment chien et al 2009 saeed et al 2008 sarker et al 2019 we found that the t5 treatment medium irrigation amount 80 etc low fertilizer rate n120 medium dripper discharge 2 l h 1 had the highest pfp in both years in short optimal water and fertilizer management techniques cannot be determined by a single indicator 4 4 selection and evaluation of optimal water and fertilizer management conditions pca is an unsupervised multivariate analysis method used to create a transformation set which converts observed variables into a new set of unrelated variables and reduces their dimensions by designing a new coordinate axis which is called a principal component de mello et al 2016 many researchers suggest that pca be used for data analysis when selecting the optimal combination of parameters in various fields jolliffe ian and cadima 2016 li et al 2018 tyanova et al 2016 dersseh et al 2016 found that improved varieties inorganic fertilizers and strong marketing of products are the best combinations for potato farming systems in chencha ethiopia using pca muthoni et al 2015 used the pca method to select the best genotype and environmental factors suitable for the stability of potato tuber yield and resistance to bacterial wilt in kenya the first two principal components contributing approximately 97 5 of the variance with eigenvalues of 1 0 were employed to draw a biplot graph our results indicated that the first three principal components contributing approximately 89 9 in 2017 and 93 1 in 2018 to the variances with eigenvalues of 1 0 were employed to draw the factor loading distribution map our study and the pca show that t4 medium irrigation amount 80 etc medium fertilizer rate n180 high dripper discharge rate 3 l h 1 ranked first in the two years the t4 treatment had the highest tuber yield and pfp and had relatively high quality in both years in particular the t4 treatment had a moderate nitrate n content in this study therefore t4 treatment is recommended as an optimal water and fertilizer management practice in sandy soil areas this research objectivity selects the optimal water and fertilizer management practices for sandy soil and explores the importance of the dripper discharge rate in regulating potato tuber quality and water and fertilizer use efficiency 5 conclusion the tuber weight largest tuber weight commodity tuber weight dry matter accumulation and vitamin c content increased with increasing fertilizer application and dripper discharge rates the reducing sugar content and pfp decreased with the increase in the fertilizer rate the starch content and reducing sugar content were more sensitive to the fertilizer rate than to the irrigation amount and were least sensitive to the dripper discharge rate the soluble protein content and vitamin c content were more sensitive to the fertilizer rate than to the dripper discharge rate and were least sensitive to the irrigation amount the t4 treatment had the highest tuber yield and pfp and had relatively high quality in both years this method elucidates the contribution and impact of these practices and provides a basis for evaluating and selecting better potato planting management practices these results are of great significance for improving the water and fertilizer input management of field crops and implementing rational drip irrigation and fertilization systems in northwest china and other parts of the world in addition the optimization results of this study were determined before sowing in the future we will focus on irrigation and fertilization levels including more gradient levels to better estimate the input rates of the t2 treatment declaration of competing interest

10606,water footprint wfp has gained importance due to the increase of water scarcity in the world this paper analyses the wfp the oil palm supply chain cradle to gate which produces oil palm fresh fruit bunch ffb crude palm oil palm kernel and crude palm kernel oil the water accounting and vulnerability evaluation wave method was used this method analyses the water depletion index wdi based on the local blue water scarcity the main contribution towards the wfp at the plantation was the production of ffb from the crop at the mill the burden shifts to the water added during the process which consists of the boiler and process water there was a 33 reduction in the wfp when there was no dilution or water addition after the screw press at the mill when weight allocation was performed the wfp reduced by 42 as the burden was shared with the palm kernel and palm kernel shell at the kernel crushing plant kcp the main contributor towards the wfp came from the palm kernel which carried the burden from upstream followed by electricity used for the process and transportation of the palm kernel two sensitivity analysis was carried out first for mills with biogas capture versus no biogas capture and the wfp had no difference for both scenarios second was comparison between weight economic and energy allocation weight and economic allocation gave a 42 and 38 reduction respectively while energy allocation gave a 60 reduction to crude palm oil the comparison when the kcps operate in the proximity of mills as compared to those operating in the proximity of ports only gave a reduction of 6 for the wfp the milling stage had the most significant impact on the wfp mills should avoid dilution to reduce this impact keywords life cycle assessment water footprint crude palm oil crude palm kernel oil wave method 1 introduction the forecasted increase of the world population will induce a remarkable demand for food production through agriculture which in turn will make this sector the most water demanding sector atzori et al 2019 currently a significant portion of the exploitable waters in the world is being used by the agriculture sector now the question arises if this use is justifiable based on the socio economic and environmental needs turner et al 2004 this is because the manner of how water is consumed now is contributing towards water scarcity the water used in households for drinking and general use is very small as compared to the needs for water to support the growing industries however the most significant water consumption arises from the cultivation and production of food for the ever growing population of the world un water 2007 furthermore climate change is intensifying the challenges faced by the agriculture sector the increase in temperature and changes in the frequency and intensity of rainfall has increased pressure on the water requirements by the agriculture sector to meet the demand of the growing population sayyadi et al 2018 this has triggered an increasing amount of focus and studies on water use and water scarcity which has led to water footprint wfp of products hoekstra 2016 the total volume of the consumption and pollution of fresh water either directly or indirectly along the supply chain is defined as the wfp of a product vlachos and aivazidou 2018 foot printing of products and processes have gained a strong foothold in the market place where customers are demanding to know the environmental footprints of the products that they consume just as how carbon footprint of products which quantifies the greenhouse gas ghg emissions are used the wfp is also being considered now due the water scarcity issues that are widely prevailing in many continents around the world this is because wfp is a good tool to provide information regarding the direct and indirect consumption in the supply chain which addresses the availability of usable water in a region symeonidou and vagiona 2018 in spite of not having a standard benchmark still many studies were carried out on wfp a recent study on the wfp of saffron production in iran was conducted by bazrafshan et al 2019 the findings provided information for policy makers and managers on areas that can be cultivated with good economics and low wfp where the crop can be rain fed with sufficient precipitation bazrafshan et al 2019 rinaldi et al 2016 conducted a comprehensive evaluation for both carbon footprint and wfp of two types of wine similarly a wfp study in thailand was conducted to evaluate the water consumption and irrigation of rice cultivation silalertruksa et al 2017 the study reported that due the high consumption of water for rice cultivation the irrigation water use efficiency needs to be improved and suggested using an alternate wetting and drying system another study compared the wfp for different olive cropping systems which concluded that wfp can be reduced with systems that used the high density cropping method pellegrini et al 2016 these studies show how wfp is used to compare processing systems and products liu et al 2018 conducted an analysis of the blue and green water consumption to show the water usage and the influences of virtual water flows at the hetao irrigation district in china this study found that the consumption actually exceeded the availability and proposed for water pricing and saving practices to be implemented there was also a national wfp conducted in italy to monitor and evaluate the water consumption and flows by economic sectors a baseline of effective impact on the water resources based on water scarcity in a certain region was established in this study bonamente et al 2017 however there were concerns regarding the methodology used for these wfp studies gu et al 2014 highlighted the need for improvements in the existing methodologies specifically the wfp network methodology a study to compare two wfp methods was conducted by zonderland thomassen and ledgard 2012 for the new zealand dairy farming the different methods gave different values due to certain inclusions and exclusions in the methods takawira 2017 found that most methodologies revolved around the amount of water used in producing products and the likely effect on the environment the study concluded that methodologies should be consolidated for easy interpretation and to improve its usefulness gauging the wfp has proven to be more difficult than carbon footprint due the vast differences of waterways and climate from region to region this brings about the difficulty in having a standard benchmark for wfp like the global warming potential which is used to determine the ghg emissions until now there is no standard benchmark that can be used to calculate the wfp the wfp methodologies themselves give rather different values and findings due the differences in the approach and focus that is given by the methods themselves a review by lovarelli et al 2016 showed that most wfp studies were mainly carried out to quantify the wfp of various products while very little studies 22 only analysed the wfp methods this goes to show the wide acceptance of the various wfp methods available in spite of the concerns and the lack of a standard benchmark the wfp of the oil palm industry which is an agricultural industry has also been gauged in malaysia oil palm is an agricultural crop its total planted area has reached 5 81million hectares in 2017 kushairi et al 2018 there are two types of oil produced from the oil palm fresh fruit bunches ffb crude palm oil which is squeezed from the fibrous mesocarp and the crude palm kernel oil which is pressed out of the palm kernel seed both these oils are processed at separate locations the crude palm oil is processed at the palm oil mills while crude palm kernel oils are produced at kernel crushing plants kcps the recent study by subramaniam and hashim 2018 charted the wfp using the ridoutt and pfister 2013 method for the production of crude palm oil and concluded that the water used by the crop had minimal impacts on the contrary two other studies on wfp of crude palm oil by subramaniam et al 2014 in malaysia and suttayakul et al 2016 in thailand used the water footprint t network method both found that the water used by the crop had the most significant impact this showed how diverse findings can be based on different methodologies these previous studies had system boundary that was limited till the production of crude palm oil this study however quantifies the wfp of the whole supply chain individually till the kernel crushing plant and uses a different method the goal of this study is to quantify the wfp for the various stages of the production along the system boundary right from the production of ffb at the plantation crude palm oil at the palm oil mill palm kernel at the palm oil mill and crude palm kernel oil at the kcp 2 methodology the study was carried out in accordance to iso 14046 2014 environmental management wfp principles requirements and guidelines iso tc207 2014 which provided the principles and guidelines to conduct the assessment 2 1 functional unit the assessment was carried out for 1 tonne of product 1 tonne ffb 1 tonne crude palm oil 1 tonne palm kernel and 1 tonne crude palm kernel oil 2 2 area of study malaysia consists of peninsular malaysia and sabah and sarawak malaysia s location near the tropics at 4 2105 n 101 9758 e is such that it experiences humid weather all year round with temperatures ranging from 20 c to 35 c the annual average rainfall in peninsular malaysia is 2540 mm while sabah averages at 2795 mm and sarawak averages at 3050 mm britannica encyclopaedia 2020 due to the high rain fall the water stress index of malaysia averages at below 0 1 indicating low water stress levels hanafiaha et al 2019 2 3 system boundary the system boundary for this evaluation is a cradle to gate study which covers only the oil palm nursery oil palm plantation palm oil mill and kcp the study commences when the oil palm seedlings are grown in the nursery here they are cultivated for about 12 months during this time the seedlings are regularly watered using sprinklers pesticides and fertilisers are also applied to ensure that the seedlings are healthy and have good growth when the seedlings are ready they are transplanted to the plantation to become oil palm trees during this time pesticides herbicides and fertilisers are applied after three years these oil palm trees start to bear fruits that are termed ffbs which are harvested and sent to the palm oil mills irrigation is not performed and so the oil palm trees are dependent on rain fall to fulfil their water requirements oil palm trees have an economic life of 25 years and are cut down after this period to be replanted the land use change in these kinds of plantations are of a continued land use from oil palm to oil palm as most of these plantations have been planted with oil palm for more than 50 years the industry just celebrated its 100 year anniversary in 2017 zunaira and hanim 2017 which further explains the land use change status of these plantations at the palm oil mills the ffbs from the plantations are received weighed and graded after which they undergo sterilisation and stripping of the fruits from the bunches before being pressed to obtain the oil from the mesocarp this oil is called crude palm oil the pressed mesocarp fibre is then used as boiler fuel in the palm oil mill s biomass boiler the nut which is separated from the pressed mesocarp fibre is then cracked to reveal the palm kernel within while the shell of the nut called palm kernel shell is used as fuel in the biomass boilers in the palm oil mill and is also sold for use in other biomass boilers locally and internationally the milling process uses water for processing as well as for boiler the water is required for dilution in the process and also as boiler water to produce steam to run a turbine that in return powers the whole palm oil mill and the surrounding workers quarters and facilities the waste water from the process which is called palm oil mill effluent then undergoes anaerobic treatment which produces biogas that consists of methane and carbon dioxide there is a huge move by the palm oil mills to capture this biogas and use it as power this study uses the scenario of when this biogas is captured at the palm oil mill weight allocation was carried out between the by products at the palm oil mill which is palm kernel and palm kernel shell the palm kernels are transported to the kcps to be pressed in a mechanical press to squeeze out the oil which is called crude palm kernel oil the kcps are normally located near the ports for easy access for export however there are selected kcps which are located near the palm oil mill or even integrated with the palm oil mills the palm kernels which are transported by lorries are first cleaned at the kcp the palm kernels are then squeezed by mechanical press to obtain the crude palm kernel oil double pressing is conducted to obtain as much oil from the palm kernels before it becomes a residue which is called palm kernel cake the system boundary is shown in fig 1 2 4 data collection three years data from 2015 2017 were collected for this study from 78 oil palm nurseries oil palm plantation s that covered 1 2 million ha and 243 palm oil mills this represents about 12 of the nurseries 28 of oil palm plantations and 53 of palm oil mills in malaysia which were at various locations across malaysia the scenarios chosen for the collection of data are as shown in table 1 two scenarios exist at the palm oil mill which is with and without dilution the practise of dilution itself is an old practise where palm oil mills add in water after the screw press stage to enable easier fluidity of the pressed oil slurry which is then taken to the clarification tank for separation however a huge number of palm oil mills have moved away from this practise and do not perform any sort of adding of water or dilution while still being able to maintain a good fluidity and oil separation at the clarification tank the wfp of both scenarios are evaluated the biogas capture scenario is also used at the palm oil mill two scenarios also exist at the kcps kcps are mostly located near the ports but there are a few kcps located near palm oil mills or integrated with a palm oil mill in view of this the wfp of these two scenarios will be evaluated as well 2 5 life cycle inventory the inventory data which was collected and verified was then calculated back for the functional units for ease in computation average data was used the lci for 1 tonne ffb 1 tonne crude palm oil 1 tonne palm kernel 1 tonne crude palm kernel oil were then input into the simapro software to obtain the wfp based on the wave method 2 6 life cycle impact assessment the simapro software version 8 5 was used to carry out the life cycle impact assessment lcia for this wfp evaluation the methodology used to the impact assessment was the water accounting and vulnerability wave evaluation method the method is in built in the software itself this methodology was chosen because it is line with the guidelines provided by the iso14046 standards on water footprint where there is an impact assessment made rather than just reporting volumetric amounts the method uses a water accounting model where the share from atmospheric evapotranspiration recycling is accounted for together with the consumption of freshwater and wastewater dischargers berger et al 2014 the method also evaluates the regional freshwater depletion vulnerability of drainage basins the basin internal evaporation recycling ratio bier has been used in the methodology where more than 11 000 basins were evaluated on a global level fig 2 which varied from 0 in the sahel zone to 38 in the congo basin thus significant shares of the water consumed in a product system due to evapotranspiration can be returned to the originating drainage basin via precipitation in the same way water vapour created in chemical reactions can be returned to the basin of origin to a noticeable extent in order to translate volumes into potential impacts the vulnerability of a basin to freshwater resource depletion is evaluated by means of a new blue water scarcity indicator this denotes the risk of the water consumption in a certain region which will lead to freshwater depletion berger et al 2014 the impacts were presented in the unit of water depletion index wdi for the respective functional units wdi shows the vulnerability of drainage basins to freshwater depletion based on the physical blue water scarcity berger et al 2014 2 7 uncertainties the inventory data has some ranges and they have been analysed and the best average data has been used for ease of assessment these values were used to create the life cycle inventory which were then used to carry out the lcia in the simapro software this may pose some uncertainties due to the slight differences that occurs especially in the type and final quantity of fertilizer and pesticides application values in the oil palm plantation phase the inventory data collected were from malaysia and the methodology s coverage extend and data quality of the region will definitely have some uncertainties as well allocation procedures were carried out at the palm oil mill as there were more than one product the weight allocation was used for the allocation procedures and this also possess some uncertainties in malaysia there are over 450 palm oil mills and almost 30 of these mills have biogas capture facilities some palm oil mills have bio composting plants which is also a form of methane avoidance but there are still more palm oil mills that do not have either biogas capture facilities or methane avoidance the base scenario presented in this study is for palm oil mills is with biogas capture only this poses some uncertainties as well 2 8 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis are normally carried out to address the uncertainties of the study for this assessment two sensitivity analysis were carried first was the allocation procedures in line with iso 14040 and iso 14044 standards on lca sensitivity analysis was carried out to evaluate the wfp results at the palm oil mill with economic and energy allocation procedures the other sensitivity analysis was to evaluate the wfp for crude palm oil with biogas emission because only less than 30 of the palm oil mills have this in place and the process is on going this is to check if there are any differences 3 results and discussion the data for this cradle to gate study was collected from the nursery plantation palm oil mill and kcps the average data were consolidated as a life cycle inventory is as shown in table 2 3 1 water footprint the wfp for the various stages as stated in the system boundary were conducted fig 3 shows the wfp for the production of ffbs at the plantation with the scenario of land use change of oil palm to oil palm and the oil palm nursery the wfp of ffbs seems to be most significant at the plantation stage with a wdi of 0 2377 this impact is caused by the crop water use an oil palm tree has an evapotranspiration rate of 5 5 mm day at normal climatic conditions roslan and haniff 2004 the water used by the crop has the most significant impact at the oil palm plantation stage the next significant impact comes from the wfp of glyphosate this arises from the production and application of herbicides like glyphosate which requires water the water used for the application of the pesticides is the direct water which is used on site at that oil palm plantations the water is sourced from nearby natural water bodies while the indirect water is for the production of the pesticide which is outside the boundary but carried the burden from its upstream process to this system boundary it must be noted that since the oil palm trees are perennial crops the application of pesticides are mostly only when they are younger and if there is a need only the next significant impact arises from and the wfp of the nursery stage the direct water used at the nursery stage comes from irrigation through sprinklers for the seedlings and from the application of pesticides as well in the nursery stage pesticides are applied regularly while the seedlings mature to be transplanted to the oil palm plantations the water for the pesticides application is from the nursery and is a direct water impact the impacts from this stage ranges from 0 2377 to 0 0001 these values denotes that the impacts are on the lower side the most significant impact arises from the water used by the crop but based on the wdi values it is towards the lower side the main reason for this is because the oil palm trees are not irrigated but rather rain fed in most agriculture systems irrigation is part and parcel of the system because irrigation is important for good yields in areas that have poor water availability for the crop studies have shown that the water footprint impacts associated with irrigation is so high that even the increase in yields cannot compensate the negative impacts caused by the water consumption for irrigation abrahão et al 2017 due to the location of malaysia near the tropics with high annual rainfall allows these kinds of perennial crops to survive without irrigation this could be one of the reasons why the impacts or the wdi values are towards the lower side as we move on to the milling stage the wfp is mainly dominated by the water used as boiler water for the production of steam and also for dilution as shown in fig 4 the impact from upstream comes along here with a wdi of 1 8673 but the wdi for the water used at the palm oil mill is almost five times higher as mentioned in the system boundary in the methodology section the biomass boiler uses the biomass namely the pressed mesocarp fibre and palm kernel shell as fuel here water is heated up till steam is produced to run a turbine which generates electricity for the mill the excess electricity is also used to power the workers quarters and other facilities within the mill area the boiler water to produce steam is one of the main sources of water consumption at the mill however this steam is recycled and used for the sterilization process and also for heating auxiliary tanks in the palm oil mill and consumption in our opinion is justified the other source of water consumption at the mill is for dilution as mentioned in section 2 4 water is added after the screw press to enable easy flow of the pressed mush of oil and small solids to the clarification tank for separation this is termed as dilution however in this study 103 palm oil mills out of the 243 have moved away from this practice and do not carry out dilution these mills still are able to get good oil flow of the pressed mush and also good separation at the clarification tank without this additional input of water the only difference in a palm oil mill that practices dilution and no dilution is the water addition after the screw press all other processes are same without dilution there is a wfp savings of over 33 as shown in fig 5 the reduction of the additional water for dilution also reduces their palm oil mill effluent and water usage which is why many mills are moving towards this practise it is proven by palm oil mills that good fluidity and flow can still be achieved without dilution even good oil separation is still obtained without dilution at the palm oil mill besides crude palm oil the other by products generated are the palm kernels and the excess palm kernel shells the palm kernels are sent to kcps to be processed into crude palm kernel oil while the excess palm kernel shells are sold as fuel in order to divide the burdens among these products weight allocation was carried out because this is constant and will not fluctuate as compared to economic allocation the weight allocation made was cpo 58 palm kernel 24 and palm kernel shell 18 as shown in fig 6 with weight allocation the highest share or burden goes to crude palm oil followed by palm kernel and palm kernel shell as predicted with allocation the wfp of 1 tonne cpo is reduced by 42 as shown in fig 7 now the burdens are also carried by the by products energy and economic allocation may give a different result and this will be carried out in the sensitivity analysis section as mentioned above the palm kernels which are one of the by products at the mill carries the burdens from upstream to further downstream right to the kcps the palm kernels are the feedstock at the kcps to produce crude palm kernel oil the wfp of the palm kernels at the palm oil mill with weight allocation is shown in fig 8 these palm kernels are then transported to the kcps to be processed into crude palm kernel oil since now the palm kernels also shares the burdens due to the allocation there is almost a 25 reduction in the wfp of palm kernel when there is no dilution performed at the palm oil mill the palm kernels are transported by trucks to the kcps as explained in the system boundary in section 2 3 at the kcp the palm kernels are cleaned and then they undergo double physical pressing to obtain crude palm kernel oil kcps mostly operate in the proximity of the ports to enable easy access to export their crude palm kernel oil and the palm kernel cake the wfp for one tonne crude palm kernel oil produced at a kcp that operates in the proximity of the port is shown in fig 9 the main impact for the wfp arises from the palm kernels themselves which carries the allocated burdens from the nursery plantation and mill the water consumption at the kcp is very minimal and not used for the process itself but rather for cleaning purposes only the next significant wfp comes from electricity generation which is more of an indirect impact the water used for electricity generation does not happen within this boundary but rather like the palm kernel it carries the burden from its upstream electricity generation process into the system this shows that the impacts arise more from the production of the feedstock at the palm oil mill rather than the process to produce crude palm kernel oil as explained in section 2 3 and 2 4 there are some kcps that operate in the proximity of the mills in malaysia the main advantage for these kcps is that the distance to transport the palm kernels is reduced drastically which brings about savings on diesel consumption some kcps if integrated with the mill use the renewable energy generated from the mill which displaces some of the kcps grid electricity consumption these kcps also do not normally export their products but rather supply them for local consumption however the distance to transport the crude palm kernel oil to the refineries was not considered in this study fig 10 compares the wfp for a kcp operating in the proximity of the port with a kcp operating in the proximity of the palm oil mill there is a 6 reduction in the wfp which is mainly contributed by the reduction in the use of diesel and electricity and has nothing to do with the direct water consumption however the quantum of savings is not that significant as mentioned earlier that the impact was dominated for the production of the palm kernel at the palm oil mill a 19 reduction was reported in subramaniam and choo 2012 relating to the carbon footprint of the kcp operating in the proximity of a mill this shows that findings can differ when only certain impact categories are focused on in this wfp study the burden carried from upstream nursery and plantation accounts for 26 7 while the rest 73 3 is the impact from the water that is consumed at the mill itself the share changes a little when the mill practices no dilution with 40 0 from upstream and 60 0 from the mill but still the bulk of the impact comes from the mill this shows that the milling process contributes the most significant increase in the wfp due to the boiler water consumption for steam production and dilution these findings for the oil palm supply chain differs from other typical agriculture systems for e g the study on the wfp of sunflower by yousefi et al 2017 showed that 82 of the share of the wfp came from the direct water application mostly dominated by irrigation the main reason for this difference to occur in the oil palm supply chain as compared to other agriculture systems is because the oil palm trees are rain fed and not irrigated hence for the oil palm supply chain it is recommended that palm oil mills avoid dilution to reduce the wfp 3 2 sensitivity analysis choo et al 2011 reported a 52 difference in the carbon footprint for the scenarios with and without biogas capture at the mills as explained in section 2 the base case of this study was for a palm oil mill that treats its waste water the palm oil mill effluent with an anaerobic digester tank that captures the capture however there are still many palm oil mills that do not have this system in place the other reason is because the source of the biogas is from the anaerobic treatment of the palm oil mill effluent which may be directly influence by the water usage in the palm oil mill and so a comparison was carried out on the wfp for the scenarios with and without biogas capture at the palm oil mills as shown in fig 11 the wfp does not show any differences for both scenarios this study shows that the biogas is very much dependent on the chemical oxygen demand cod or biological oxygen demand bod values of the palm oil mill effluent rather than the quantity of water itself even though biogas is emitted during the treatment of the palm oil mill effluent the biogas is a gaseous emission from the anaerobic treatment of the palm oil mill effluent which contains methane carbon dioxide and traces of hydrogen sulphide these emissions are dependent on the cod and bod of the pome if the water is more and the cod values are lower the amount of biogas will be less and even if the water amount remains constant but the cod values go higher due to more condensate inside the palm oil mill effluent than the biogas emissions will increase the amount of biogas does not correlate with the amount of water but rather with the cod and bod values in this manner the wfp is not affected by this scenario so these emissions do not have a direct impact on the wfp this is why when both scenarios are compared the wfp does not differ unlike the carbon footprint as a conclusion to this the base care assumption used for this study that palm oil mills practice biogas capture is acceptable the second sensitivity analysis is for the allocation procedure this study used weight allocation and the sensitivity analysis is carried out for economic and energy allocation as well palm kernel prices fluctuates weekly and it differs between five regions as well within the week in malaysia for ease of calculations the average prices of palm kernel crude palm oil and palm kernel shell the average prices used for the calculations were rm 1191 90 per tonne palm kernel rm 2072 9 per tonne crude palm oil and rm 100 0 per tonne palm kernel shell mpob 2020 the allocated wfp is as shown in fig 12 here again the highest share or burden goes to crude palm oil similar to the weight allocation followed by palm kernel and palm kernel shell however here the palm kernel takes a larger share than palm kernel share unlike the weight allocation because the price of palm kernel shell highly fluctuates and is very much lower but still the wfp for crude palm oil is still similar to weight allocation next sensitivity analysis is to compare the results when allocation by energy content is carried out the average calorific values for palm kernel is about 39 mj kg crude palm oil is 40 mj kg and palm kernel shell is 21 mj kg loh 2017 the wfp with energy allocation is shown in fig 13 with energy allocation the burdens are almost equally shared by both palm kernel and crude palm oil and palm kernel shell gets the least this shows that energy allocation will give a very different outcome as compared to weight and economic allocation the final comparisons of the wfp for 1 tonne crude palm oil without allocation and with weight economic and energy allocations is shown in fig 14 weight and economic allocation gave a 42 and 38 reduction respectively while energy allocation gave a 60 reduction to crude palm oil this shows that the weight and economic allocations are similar but for energy allocation more burden is transferred to the by products 4 conclusion different wfp methodologies can give different findings however it is important that even though different methods are used the underlying evaluation is on the consumption pollution and availability of freshwater what can be concluded from this study is that the oil palm trees are rain dependent the impact from the water used by the tree crop itself is low due to the practice of no irrigation at the plantations and the high availability of water from rain fall in malaysia this finding reiterates the importance of planting oil palm trees in regions with high rain fall all year long like the tropics this definitely reduces the impact on the water use since palm oil mills have the most significant impact on the wfp dilution should be avoided by all palm oil mills to reduce this impact this wfp findings are based on the wave method and may differ with the use of other methods declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgement the authors would like to thank the oil palm industry for their cooperation during the data

10606,water footprint wfp has gained importance due to the increase of water scarcity in the world this paper analyses the wfp the oil palm supply chain cradle to gate which produces oil palm fresh fruit bunch ffb crude palm oil palm kernel and crude palm kernel oil the water accounting and vulnerability evaluation wave method was used this method analyses the water depletion index wdi based on the local blue water scarcity the main contribution towards the wfp at the plantation was the production of ffb from the crop at the mill the burden shifts to the water added during the process which consists of the boiler and process water there was a 33 reduction in the wfp when there was no dilution or water addition after the screw press at the mill when weight allocation was performed the wfp reduced by 42 as the burden was shared with the palm kernel and palm kernel shell at the kernel crushing plant kcp the main contributor towards the wfp came from the palm kernel which carried the burden from upstream followed by electricity used for the process and transportation of the palm kernel two sensitivity analysis was carried out first for mills with biogas capture versus no biogas capture and the wfp had no difference for both scenarios second was comparison between weight economic and energy allocation weight and economic allocation gave a 42 and 38 reduction respectively while energy allocation gave a 60 reduction to crude palm oil the comparison when the kcps operate in the proximity of mills as compared to those operating in the proximity of ports only gave a reduction of 6 for the wfp the milling stage had the most significant impact on the wfp mills should avoid dilution to reduce this impact keywords life cycle assessment water footprint crude palm oil crude palm kernel oil wave method 1 introduction the forecasted increase of the world population will induce a remarkable demand for food production through agriculture which in turn will make this sector the most water demanding sector atzori et al 2019 currently a significant portion of the exploitable waters in the world is being used by the agriculture sector now the question arises if this use is justifiable based on the socio economic and environmental needs turner et al 2004 this is because the manner of how water is consumed now is contributing towards water scarcity the water used in households for drinking and general use is very small as compared to the needs for water to support the growing industries however the most significant water consumption arises from the cultivation and production of food for the ever growing population of the world un water 2007 furthermore climate change is intensifying the challenges faced by the agriculture sector the increase in temperature and changes in the frequency and intensity of rainfall has increased pressure on the water requirements by the agriculture sector to meet the demand of the growing population sayyadi et al 2018 this has triggered an increasing amount of focus and studies on water use and water scarcity which has led to water footprint wfp of products hoekstra 2016 the total volume of the consumption and pollution of fresh water either directly or indirectly along the supply chain is defined as the wfp of a product vlachos and aivazidou 2018 foot printing of products and processes have gained a strong foothold in the market place where customers are demanding to know the environmental footprints of the products that they consume just as how carbon footprint of products which quantifies the greenhouse gas ghg emissions are used the wfp is also being considered now due the water scarcity issues that are widely prevailing in many continents around the world this is because wfp is a good tool to provide information regarding the direct and indirect consumption in the supply chain which addresses the availability of usable water in a region symeonidou and vagiona 2018 in spite of not having a standard benchmark still many studies were carried out on wfp a recent study on the wfp of saffron production in iran was conducted by bazrafshan et al 2019 the findings provided information for policy makers and managers on areas that can be cultivated with good economics and low wfp where the crop can be rain fed with sufficient precipitation bazrafshan et al 2019 rinaldi et al 2016 conducted a comprehensive evaluation for both carbon footprint and wfp of two types of wine similarly a wfp study in thailand was conducted to evaluate the water consumption and irrigation of rice cultivation silalertruksa et al 2017 the study reported that due the high consumption of water for rice cultivation the irrigation water use efficiency needs to be improved and suggested using an alternate wetting and drying system another study compared the wfp for different olive cropping systems which concluded that wfp can be reduced with systems that used the high density cropping method pellegrini et al 2016 these studies show how wfp is used to compare processing systems and products liu et al 2018 conducted an analysis of the blue and green water consumption to show the water usage and the influences of virtual water flows at the hetao irrigation district in china this study found that the consumption actually exceeded the availability and proposed for water pricing and saving practices to be implemented there was also a national wfp conducted in italy to monitor and evaluate the water consumption and flows by economic sectors a baseline of effective impact on the water resources based on water scarcity in a certain region was established in this study bonamente et al 2017 however there were concerns regarding the methodology used for these wfp studies gu et al 2014 highlighted the need for improvements in the existing methodologies specifically the wfp network methodology a study to compare two wfp methods was conducted by zonderland thomassen and ledgard 2012 for the new zealand dairy farming the different methods gave different values due to certain inclusions and exclusions in the methods takawira 2017 found that most methodologies revolved around the amount of water used in producing products and the likely effect on the environment the study concluded that methodologies should be consolidated for easy interpretation and to improve its usefulness gauging the wfp has proven to be more difficult than carbon footprint due the vast differences of waterways and climate from region to region this brings about the difficulty in having a standard benchmark for wfp like the global warming potential which is used to determine the ghg emissions until now there is no standard benchmark that can be used to calculate the wfp the wfp methodologies themselves give rather different values and findings due the differences in the approach and focus that is given by the methods themselves a review by lovarelli et al 2016 showed that most wfp studies were mainly carried out to quantify the wfp of various products while very little studies 22 only analysed the wfp methods this goes to show the wide acceptance of the various wfp methods available in spite of the concerns and the lack of a standard benchmark the wfp of the oil palm industry which is an agricultural industry has also been gauged in malaysia oil palm is an agricultural crop its total planted area has reached 5 81million hectares in 2017 kushairi et al 2018 there are two types of oil produced from the oil palm fresh fruit bunches ffb crude palm oil which is squeezed from the fibrous mesocarp and the crude palm kernel oil which is pressed out of the palm kernel seed both these oils are processed at separate locations the crude palm oil is processed at the palm oil mills while crude palm kernel oils are produced at kernel crushing plants kcps the recent study by subramaniam and hashim 2018 charted the wfp using the ridoutt and pfister 2013 method for the production of crude palm oil and concluded that the water used by the crop had minimal impacts on the contrary two other studies on wfp of crude palm oil by subramaniam et al 2014 in malaysia and suttayakul et al 2016 in thailand used the water footprint t network method both found that the water used by the crop had the most significant impact this showed how diverse findings can be based on different methodologies these previous studies had system boundary that was limited till the production of crude palm oil this study however quantifies the wfp of the whole supply chain individually till the kernel crushing plant and uses a different method the goal of this study is to quantify the wfp for the various stages of the production along the system boundary right from the production of ffb at the plantation crude palm oil at the palm oil mill palm kernel at the palm oil mill and crude palm kernel oil at the kcp 2 methodology the study was carried out in accordance to iso 14046 2014 environmental management wfp principles requirements and guidelines iso tc207 2014 which provided the principles and guidelines to conduct the assessment 2 1 functional unit the assessment was carried out for 1 tonne of product 1 tonne ffb 1 tonne crude palm oil 1 tonne palm kernel and 1 tonne crude palm kernel oil 2 2 area of study malaysia consists of peninsular malaysia and sabah and sarawak malaysia s location near the tropics at 4 2105 n 101 9758 e is such that it experiences humid weather all year round with temperatures ranging from 20 c to 35 c the annual average rainfall in peninsular malaysia is 2540 mm while sabah averages at 2795 mm and sarawak averages at 3050 mm britannica encyclopaedia 2020 due to the high rain fall the water stress index of malaysia averages at below 0 1 indicating low water stress levels hanafiaha et al 2019 2 3 system boundary the system boundary for this evaluation is a cradle to gate study which covers only the oil palm nursery oil palm plantation palm oil mill and kcp the study commences when the oil palm seedlings are grown in the nursery here they are cultivated for about 12 months during this time the seedlings are regularly watered using sprinklers pesticides and fertilisers are also applied to ensure that the seedlings are healthy and have good growth when the seedlings are ready they are transplanted to the plantation to become oil palm trees during this time pesticides herbicides and fertilisers are applied after three years these oil palm trees start to bear fruits that are termed ffbs which are harvested and sent to the palm oil mills irrigation is not performed and so the oil palm trees are dependent on rain fall to fulfil their water requirements oil palm trees have an economic life of 25 years and are cut down after this period to be replanted the land use change in these kinds of plantations are of a continued land use from oil palm to oil palm as most of these plantations have been planted with oil palm for more than 50 years the industry just celebrated its 100 year anniversary in 2017 zunaira and hanim 2017 which further explains the land use change status of these plantations at the palm oil mills the ffbs from the plantations are received weighed and graded after which they undergo sterilisation and stripping of the fruits from the bunches before being pressed to obtain the oil from the mesocarp this oil is called crude palm oil the pressed mesocarp fibre is then used as boiler fuel in the palm oil mill s biomass boiler the nut which is separated from the pressed mesocarp fibre is then cracked to reveal the palm kernel within while the shell of the nut called palm kernel shell is used as fuel in the biomass boilers in the palm oil mill and is also sold for use in other biomass boilers locally and internationally the milling process uses water for processing as well as for boiler the water is required for dilution in the process and also as boiler water to produce steam to run a turbine that in return powers the whole palm oil mill and the surrounding workers quarters and facilities the waste water from the process which is called palm oil mill effluent then undergoes anaerobic treatment which produces biogas that consists of methane and carbon dioxide there is a huge move by the palm oil mills to capture this biogas and use it as power this study uses the scenario of when this biogas is captured at the palm oil mill weight allocation was carried out between the by products at the palm oil mill which is palm kernel and palm kernel shell the palm kernels are transported to the kcps to be pressed in a mechanical press to squeeze out the oil which is called crude palm kernel oil the kcps are normally located near the ports for easy access for export however there are selected kcps which are located near the palm oil mill or even integrated with the palm oil mills the palm kernels which are transported by lorries are first cleaned at the kcp the palm kernels are then squeezed by mechanical press to obtain the crude palm kernel oil double pressing is conducted to obtain as much oil from the palm kernels before it becomes a residue which is called palm kernel cake the system boundary is shown in fig 1 2 4 data collection three years data from 2015 2017 were collected for this study from 78 oil palm nurseries oil palm plantation s that covered 1 2 million ha and 243 palm oil mills this represents about 12 of the nurseries 28 of oil palm plantations and 53 of palm oil mills in malaysia which were at various locations across malaysia the scenarios chosen for the collection of data are as shown in table 1 two scenarios exist at the palm oil mill which is with and without dilution the practise of dilution itself is an old practise where palm oil mills add in water after the screw press stage to enable easier fluidity of the pressed oil slurry which is then taken to the clarification tank for separation however a huge number of palm oil mills have moved away from this practise and do not perform any sort of adding of water or dilution while still being able to maintain a good fluidity and oil separation at the clarification tank the wfp of both scenarios are evaluated the biogas capture scenario is also used at the palm oil mill two scenarios also exist at the kcps kcps are mostly located near the ports but there are a few kcps located near palm oil mills or integrated with a palm oil mill in view of this the wfp of these two scenarios will be evaluated as well 2 5 life cycle inventory the inventory data which was collected and verified was then calculated back for the functional units for ease in computation average data was used the lci for 1 tonne ffb 1 tonne crude palm oil 1 tonne palm kernel 1 tonne crude palm kernel oil were then input into the simapro software to obtain the wfp based on the wave method 2 6 life cycle impact assessment the simapro software version 8 5 was used to carry out the life cycle impact assessment lcia for this wfp evaluation the methodology used to the impact assessment was the water accounting and vulnerability wave evaluation method the method is in built in the software itself this methodology was chosen because it is line with the guidelines provided by the iso14046 standards on water footprint where there is an impact assessment made rather than just reporting volumetric amounts the method uses a water accounting model where the share from atmospheric evapotranspiration recycling is accounted for together with the consumption of freshwater and wastewater dischargers berger et al 2014 the method also evaluates the regional freshwater depletion vulnerability of drainage basins the basin internal evaporation recycling ratio bier has been used in the methodology where more than 11 000 basins were evaluated on a global level fig 2 which varied from 0 in the sahel zone to 38 in the congo basin thus significant shares of the water consumed in a product system due to evapotranspiration can be returned to the originating drainage basin via precipitation in the same way water vapour created in chemical reactions can be returned to the basin of origin to a noticeable extent in order to translate volumes into potential impacts the vulnerability of a basin to freshwater resource depletion is evaluated by means of a new blue water scarcity indicator this denotes the risk of the water consumption in a certain region which will lead to freshwater depletion berger et al 2014 the impacts were presented in the unit of water depletion index wdi for the respective functional units wdi shows the vulnerability of drainage basins to freshwater depletion based on the physical blue water scarcity berger et al 2014 2 7 uncertainties the inventory data has some ranges and they have been analysed and the best average data has been used for ease of assessment these values were used to create the life cycle inventory which were then used to carry out the lcia in the simapro software this may pose some uncertainties due to the slight differences that occurs especially in the type and final quantity of fertilizer and pesticides application values in the oil palm plantation phase the inventory data collected were from malaysia and the methodology s coverage extend and data quality of the region will definitely have some uncertainties as well allocation procedures were carried out at the palm oil mill as there were more than one product the weight allocation was used for the allocation procedures and this also possess some uncertainties in malaysia there are over 450 palm oil mills and almost 30 of these mills have biogas capture facilities some palm oil mills have bio composting plants which is also a form of methane avoidance but there are still more palm oil mills that do not have either biogas capture facilities or methane avoidance the base scenario presented in this study is for palm oil mills is with biogas capture only this poses some uncertainties as well 2 8 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis are normally carried out to address the uncertainties of the study for this assessment two sensitivity analysis were carried first was the allocation procedures in line with iso 14040 and iso 14044 standards on lca sensitivity analysis was carried out to evaluate the wfp results at the palm oil mill with economic and energy allocation procedures the other sensitivity analysis was to evaluate the wfp for crude palm oil with biogas emission because only less than 30 of the palm oil mills have this in place and the process is on going this is to check if there are any differences 3 results and discussion the data for this cradle to gate study was collected from the nursery plantation palm oil mill and kcps the average data were consolidated as a life cycle inventory is as shown in table 2 3 1 water footprint the wfp for the various stages as stated in the system boundary were conducted fig 3 shows the wfp for the production of ffbs at the plantation with the scenario of land use change of oil palm to oil palm and the oil palm nursery the wfp of ffbs seems to be most significant at the plantation stage with a wdi of 0 2377 this impact is caused by the crop water use an oil palm tree has an evapotranspiration rate of 5 5 mm day at normal climatic conditions roslan and haniff 2004 the water used by the crop has the most significant impact at the oil palm plantation stage the next significant impact comes from the wfp of glyphosate this arises from the production and application of herbicides like glyphosate which requires water the water used for the application of the pesticides is the direct water which is used on site at that oil palm plantations the water is sourced from nearby natural water bodies while the indirect water is for the production of the pesticide which is outside the boundary but carried the burden from its upstream process to this system boundary it must be noted that since the oil palm trees are perennial crops the application of pesticides are mostly only when they are younger and if there is a need only the next significant impact arises from and the wfp of the nursery stage the direct water used at the nursery stage comes from irrigation through sprinklers for the seedlings and from the application of pesticides as well in the nursery stage pesticides are applied regularly while the seedlings mature to be transplanted to the oil palm plantations the water for the pesticides application is from the nursery and is a direct water impact the impacts from this stage ranges from 0 2377 to 0 0001 these values denotes that the impacts are on the lower side the most significant impact arises from the water used by the crop but based on the wdi values it is towards the lower side the main reason for this is because the oil palm trees are not irrigated but rather rain fed in most agriculture systems irrigation is part and parcel of the system because irrigation is important for good yields in areas that have poor water availability for the crop studies have shown that the water footprint impacts associated with irrigation is so high that even the increase in yields cannot compensate the negative impacts caused by the water consumption for irrigation abrahão et al 2017 due to the location of malaysia near the tropics with high annual rainfall allows these kinds of perennial crops to survive without irrigation this could be one of the reasons why the impacts or the wdi values are towards the lower side as we move on to the milling stage the wfp is mainly dominated by the water used as boiler water for the production of steam and also for dilution as shown in fig 4 the impact from upstream comes along here with a wdi of 1 8673 but the wdi for the water used at the palm oil mill is almost five times higher as mentioned in the system boundary in the methodology section the biomass boiler uses the biomass namely the pressed mesocarp fibre and palm kernel shell as fuel here water is heated up till steam is produced to run a turbine which generates electricity for the mill the excess electricity is also used to power the workers quarters and other facilities within the mill area the boiler water to produce steam is one of the main sources of water consumption at the mill however this steam is recycled and used for the sterilization process and also for heating auxiliary tanks in the palm oil mill and consumption in our opinion is justified the other source of water consumption at the mill is for dilution as mentioned in section 2 4 water is added after the screw press to enable easy flow of the pressed mush of oil and small solids to the clarification tank for separation this is termed as dilution however in this study 103 palm oil mills out of the 243 have moved away from this practice and do not carry out dilution these mills still are able to get good oil flow of the pressed mush and also good separation at the clarification tank without this additional input of water the only difference in a palm oil mill that practices dilution and no dilution is the water addition after the screw press all other processes are same without dilution there is a wfp savings of over 33 as shown in fig 5 the reduction of the additional water for dilution also reduces their palm oil mill effluent and water usage which is why many mills are moving towards this practise it is proven by palm oil mills that good fluidity and flow can still be achieved without dilution even good oil separation is still obtained without dilution at the palm oil mill besides crude palm oil the other by products generated are the palm kernels and the excess palm kernel shells the palm kernels are sent to kcps to be processed into crude palm kernel oil while the excess palm kernel shells are sold as fuel in order to divide the burdens among these products weight allocation was carried out because this is constant and will not fluctuate as compared to economic allocation the weight allocation made was cpo 58 palm kernel 24 and palm kernel shell 18 as shown in fig 6 with weight allocation the highest share or burden goes to crude palm oil followed by palm kernel and palm kernel shell as predicted with allocation the wfp of 1 tonne cpo is reduced by 42 as shown in fig 7 now the burdens are also carried by the by products energy and economic allocation may give a different result and this will be carried out in the sensitivity analysis section as mentioned above the palm kernels which are one of the by products at the mill carries the burdens from upstream to further downstream right to the kcps the palm kernels are the feedstock at the kcps to produce crude palm kernel oil the wfp of the palm kernels at the palm oil mill with weight allocation is shown in fig 8 these palm kernels are then transported to the kcps to be processed into crude palm kernel oil since now the palm kernels also shares the burdens due to the allocation there is almost a 25 reduction in the wfp of palm kernel when there is no dilution performed at the palm oil mill the palm kernels are transported by trucks to the kcps as explained in the system boundary in section 2 3 at the kcp the palm kernels are cleaned and then they undergo double physical pressing to obtain crude palm kernel oil kcps mostly operate in the proximity of the ports to enable easy access to export their crude palm kernel oil and the palm kernel cake the wfp for one tonne crude palm kernel oil produced at a kcp that operates in the proximity of the port is shown in fig 9 the main impact for the wfp arises from the palm kernels themselves which carries the allocated burdens from the nursery plantation and mill the water consumption at the kcp is very minimal and not used for the process itself but rather for cleaning purposes only the next significant wfp comes from electricity generation which is more of an indirect impact the water used for electricity generation does not happen within this boundary but rather like the palm kernel it carries the burden from its upstream electricity generation process into the system this shows that the impacts arise more from the production of the feedstock at the palm oil mill rather than the process to produce crude palm kernel oil as explained in section 2 3 and 2 4 there are some kcps that operate in the proximity of the mills in malaysia the main advantage for these kcps is that the distance to transport the palm kernels is reduced drastically which brings about savings on diesel consumption some kcps if integrated with the mill use the renewable energy generated from the mill which displaces some of the kcps grid electricity consumption these kcps also do not normally export their products but rather supply them for local consumption however the distance to transport the crude palm kernel oil to the refineries was not considered in this study fig 10 compares the wfp for a kcp operating in the proximity of the port with a kcp operating in the proximity of the palm oil mill there is a 6 reduction in the wfp which is mainly contributed by the reduction in the use of diesel and electricity and has nothing to do with the direct water consumption however the quantum of savings is not that significant as mentioned earlier that the impact was dominated for the production of the palm kernel at the palm oil mill a 19 reduction was reported in subramaniam and choo 2012 relating to the carbon footprint of the kcp operating in the proximity of a mill this shows that findings can differ when only certain impact categories are focused on in this wfp study the burden carried from upstream nursery and plantation accounts for 26 7 while the rest 73 3 is the impact from the water that is consumed at the mill itself the share changes a little when the mill practices no dilution with 40 0 from upstream and 60 0 from the mill but still the bulk of the impact comes from the mill this shows that the milling process contributes the most significant increase in the wfp due to the boiler water consumption for steam production and dilution these findings for the oil palm supply chain differs from other typical agriculture systems for e g the study on the wfp of sunflower by yousefi et al 2017 showed that 82 of the share of the wfp came from the direct water application mostly dominated by irrigation the main reason for this difference to occur in the oil palm supply chain as compared to other agriculture systems is because the oil palm trees are rain fed and not irrigated hence for the oil palm supply chain it is recommended that palm oil mills avoid dilution to reduce the wfp 3 2 sensitivity analysis choo et al 2011 reported a 52 difference in the carbon footprint for the scenarios with and without biogas capture at the mills as explained in section 2 the base case of this study was for a palm oil mill that treats its waste water the palm oil mill effluent with an anaerobic digester tank that captures the capture however there are still many palm oil mills that do not have this system in place the other reason is because the source of the biogas is from the anaerobic treatment of the palm oil mill effluent which may be directly influence by the water usage in the palm oil mill and so a comparison was carried out on the wfp for the scenarios with and without biogas capture at the palm oil mills as shown in fig 11 the wfp does not show any differences for both scenarios this study shows that the biogas is very much dependent on the chemical oxygen demand cod or biological oxygen demand bod values of the palm oil mill effluent rather than the quantity of water itself even though biogas is emitted during the treatment of the palm oil mill effluent the biogas is a gaseous emission from the anaerobic treatment of the palm oil mill effluent which contains methane carbon dioxide and traces of hydrogen sulphide these emissions are dependent on the cod and bod of the pome if the water is more and the cod values are lower the amount of biogas will be less and even if the water amount remains constant but the cod values go higher due to more condensate inside the palm oil mill effluent than the biogas emissions will increase the amount of biogas does not correlate with the amount of water but rather with the cod and bod values in this manner the wfp is not affected by this scenario so these emissions do not have a direct impact on the wfp this is why when both scenarios are compared the wfp does not differ unlike the carbon footprint as a conclusion to this the base care assumption used for this study that palm oil mills practice biogas capture is acceptable the second sensitivity analysis is for the allocation procedure this study used weight allocation and the sensitivity analysis is carried out for economic and energy allocation as well palm kernel prices fluctuates weekly and it differs between five regions as well within the week in malaysia for ease of calculations the average prices of palm kernel crude palm oil and palm kernel shell the average prices used for the calculations were rm 1191 90 per tonne palm kernel rm 2072 9 per tonne crude palm oil and rm 100 0 per tonne palm kernel shell mpob 2020 the allocated wfp is as shown in fig 12 here again the highest share or burden goes to crude palm oil similar to the weight allocation followed by palm kernel and palm kernel shell however here the palm kernel takes a larger share than palm kernel share unlike the weight allocation because the price of palm kernel shell highly fluctuates and is very much lower but still the wfp for crude palm oil is still similar to weight allocation next sensitivity analysis is to compare the results when allocation by energy content is carried out the average calorific values for palm kernel is about 39 mj kg crude palm oil is 40 mj kg and palm kernel shell is 21 mj kg loh 2017 the wfp with energy allocation is shown in fig 13 with energy allocation the burdens are almost equally shared by both palm kernel and crude palm oil and palm kernel shell gets the least this shows that energy allocation will give a very different outcome as compared to weight and economic allocation the final comparisons of the wfp for 1 tonne crude palm oil without allocation and with weight economic and energy allocations is shown in fig 14 weight and economic allocation gave a 42 and 38 reduction respectively while energy allocation gave a 60 reduction to crude palm oil this shows that the weight and economic allocations are similar but for energy allocation more burden is transferred to the by products 4 conclusion different wfp methodologies can give different findings however it is important that even though different methods are used the underlying evaluation is on the consumption pollution and availability of freshwater what can be concluded from this study is that the oil palm trees are rain dependent the impact from the water used by the tree crop itself is low due to the practice of no irrigation at the plantations and the high availability of water from rain fall in malaysia this finding reiterates the importance of planting oil palm trees in regions with high rain fall all year long like the tropics this definitely reduces the impact on the water use since palm oil mills have the most significant impact on the wfp dilution should be avoided by all palm oil mills to reduce this impact this wfp findings are based on the wave method and may differ with the use of other methods declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgement the authors would like to thank the oil palm industry for their cooperation during the data

10607,the central valley of california relies on irrigation for crop production but water resources particularly groundwater have reached a critical state due to extended drought periods and overuse by irrigated agriculture the purpose of the grape remote sensing atmospheric profile and evapotranspiration experiment grapex project is to improve efficiency in vineyard irrigation through field measurements and modeling efforts using remote sensing in this study we analyze multi year timeseries of ground based soil moisture and evapotranspiration et measurements collected during grapex to identify patterns that may inform future irrigation recommendations based on remotely sensed et the study focuses on field data collected in two adjacent pinot noir vineyards near lodi ca from 2013 to 2017 the data used for this analysis are reference evapotranspiration etref actual evapotranspiration eta mean daytime soil water content swc measured to a depth of 90 cm precipitation and irrigation the relationship between swc and the ratio of eta etref used as a soil moisture proxy indicator changes throughout the spring and summer months due to advancing phenological stages and management practices in early spring when the interrow cover crop is the primary source of et eta is strongly correlated with swc as the vine canopy grows in the strong correlation breaks down as the vines begin to access to water beyond the depth of the soil moisture sensors as the soil profile dries out during the summer the correlation between eta and swc once again emerges as the vines become strongly dependent on irrigation the dynamic interaction between the upper and lower root zone profile and evaporative demand means that the key to understanding vineyard water status using relatively shallow swc observations is to use them in conjunction with eta data so that when both swc and eta timeseries are highly correlated vine water status is well defined this suggests delaying the initiation of irrigation during the period of rapid vine growth until a clear relationship between swc and eta emerges would both reduce the total amount of water used and give the grower more control over vine growth and grape quality affected by water status keywords actual evapotranspiration reference evapotranspiration irrigation root zone soil moisture precipitation vine water status 1 introduction agriculture is the largest consumer of water in california using an estimated 75 of the total water supplied to the state in 2005 2010 california department of water resources 2015 the central valley is a highly prioritized user of water due to the high economic value of crops produced but resources are still limited as highlighted by drought in recent years it is therefore beneficial from both an economic and environmental perspective for growers to reduce the amount of water used for irrigation the grape remote sensing atmospheric profile and evapotranspiration experiment grapex project is a partnership between scientists at the usda hydrology and remote sensing laboratory e j gallo wineries and several other university and research entities to develop practical remote sensing techniques for monitoring plant water status and developing efficient irrigation plans in vineyards an overview of the grapex project is provided by kustas et al 2018 the ultimate goal of grapex is to reduce water usage while maintaining or improving grape yield and quality for wine production micrometeorological measurements relevant for vineyard irrigation management include soil water content swc actual evapotranspiration et a and the ratio of actual to reference et eta etref swc is a key variable governing the decision to commence irrigation in the spring this irrigation decision is typically triggered when available water content falls below a fixed threshold e g 50 after irrigation starts et a provides a measure of water consumed by the vineyard throughout the growing season guiding decisions on rate of replenishment via irrigation the ratio of daily values of actual to reference et eta etref is used in viticulture as a measure of vegetative stress often referred to as the crop coefficient optimal guidelines have been developed by grape varietal for target stress levels quantified in terms of eta etref for different phenological stages of vine development furthermore remotely sensed eta etref has been used as a proxy indicator or metric of the soil moisture status reflecting the control of soil moisture on evaporative fluxes hain et al 2009 hain et al 2011 the grapex project has collected field measurements of these and other micrometeorological and biophysical variables in vineyards nearly continuously since april 2013 providing a long baseline for assessing interrelationships between swc eta etref and remote sensing indicators initial assessments of the relationship between swc and eta etref for study years 2013 2016 indicated that eta etref decreases with swc below a mean swc threshold of about 0 35 m3 m 3 see fig 8 in kustas et al 2018 the relationship between these two variables also depends on phenological stage eta etref and swc show correlations both before bloom and after harvest but not during the main part of the growing season when eta etref is largely independent of swc the primary purpose of this paper is to explain these changes in the eta etref vs swc relationship throughout the growing season by way of a detailed study of the soil moisture evapotranspiration and irrigation timeseries data collected during grapex after a review of the field site and measurement methods we present the overall trends of et and swc throughout the study period of 2013 2017 then we analyze the relationship of these two quantities by month which roughly aligns with phenological stage finally we put these results into context using the quantities and timing of precipitation and applied irrigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study site part of the grapex project consists of two adjacent vitis vinifera l vineyards of the pinot noir variety in the california central valley near the city of lodi 38 29 n 121 12 w see fig 1 these vineyards were originally associated with the borden ranch kustas et al 2018 but currently are considered part of sierra loma ranch the first growing seasons for the north and south vineyards were 2009 and 2011 respectively both vineyards are drip irrigated with a dripper 0 35 m distance on either side of each vine and the vines are planted in east west rows spaced 3 35 m apart with 1 5 m between vines along each row the soils in the two vineyards are slightly different the north vineyard has an average texture content of 29 sand and 32 clay making it a clay loam in the usda soil texture triangle in the south vineyard the average texture is 39 sand and 22 clay hence classified as loam a more complete description of the vineyards including canopy structure may be found in kustas et al 2018 2 2 seasons and phenology fig 2 shows a general timeline of phenology and management in these vineyards providing temporal context for the measurements and findings presented below during february and early march which is typically the end of the rainy season the interrow grass cover crop a perennial mixture is active while the vines are dormant the cover crop grows and actively transpires thought april and is typically mowed several times in april and early may by end of may early june with no rain and into the dry season the cover crop undergoes senescence and turns into dry grass stubble through the remainder of the growing season see fig 2 on the other hand march through june is the period of active vine canopy growth and contains the phenological events of bud break bloom and fruit set sufficient soil water is critical during this period to achieve appropriate canopy size and berries per cluster veraison the stage where berry color changes and the grapes start to mature occurs in july during the canopy maintenance period when there is typically less irrigation finally harvest occurs in late august or early september about a month before the next rainy season begins 2 3 eddy covariance towers starting in 2013 continuous eddy covariance and surface energy balance measurements as well as standard meteorological observations have been collected in each vineyard table 1 is a description of the instrumentation and measurement height used in determining the surface energy balance and estimates of et a complete description of instrumentation on the towers is provided by kustas et al 2018 post processing of the raw 20 hz eddy covariance data and soil heat flux and net radiation data is described in detail in alfieri et al 2019 towers in the north site 1 and south site 2 vineyards are approximately 1 5 km apart and are located at the east edge of the vineyards see fig 1 to maximize fetch since winds are predominately from the west alfieri et al 2019 2 4 precipitation as shown in table 1 tipping bucket rain gauges were initially installed at 5 m above ground level agl at each tower however during the 2016 growing season it was discovered that the rain gauges were substantially under capturing water at this height likely due to the effect of wind as described by pollock et al 2018 the rain gauges were lowered to 3 m following the 2016 growing season precipitation input prior to january 2017 used in this study is a combination of data from another rain gauge onsite maintained by nasa and the fair oaks station of the california irrigation management information system cimis fig 3 shows the cumulative precipitation recorded by the nasa and cimis stations for the overlapping period of october 2013 through february 2015 while the two series are not identical they are similar enough to use the cimis for gap filling in the nasa data 2 5 soil moisture profiles in addition to the surface soil moisture measured for the soil heat flux installations three vertical profiles of soil moisture measurements were established in each vineyard near the tower locations each profile consists of hydra probe sensors stevens water monitoring systems portland oregon at depths of 30 60 and 90 cm below ground level bgl under the irrigation drip line hydra probes measure the dielectric permittivity of the soil and calculate volumetric soil water content swc m3 m 3 using a calibration curve of the following form stevens water monitoring systems inc 2007 1 θ a e r b where θ is swc er is the real dielectric permittivity and a and b are constants for this study the standard loam calibration constants of a 0 110 and b 0 180 seyfried et al 2005 were used 2 6 leaf area index the leaf area index lai of vine and interrow cover crop when green and active was estimated on a 30 m spatial scale for the grapex project using satellite imagery and the method of gao et al 2012 briefly this method uses a regression tree based on homogenous modis lai retrievals to obtain lai estimates at 30 m resolution from the reflectance bands measured by landsat application of this remote sensing based lai retrieval over the two vineyards was evaluated by sun et al 2017 and found to give fairly reliable estimates compared to ground based lai measurements derived from licor lai 2000 and lai 2200 measurements white et al 2019 2 7 evapotranspiration daily evapotranspiration et changes throughout the year due to varying radiation and meteorological inputs soil moisture content and biophysical characteristics of the vines and cover crop the reference evapotranspiration etref which varies due radiation and meteorological conditions is viewed as the maximum actual evapotranspiration eta a crop can achieve under well watered conditions and is used to normalize eta the resulting quantity eta etref is therefore a practical indicator of water stress in the vineyards etref is calculated using the local meteorological data from the tower and the fao penman monteith reference evapotranspiration equation allen et al 1998 2 e t r e f δ r n g γ 900 t a 273 u v p d δ γ 1 0 34 u where 3 δ 4098 e s a t 237 3 t a 2 and 4 γ 0 0016286 p λ equation 2 is evaluated at the hourly scale using the hourly post processed tower data and the daily etref is the sum of hourly values for each day this method of calculating etref results in a local reference rather than a reference for a standard grass surface since the tower measurements are used as input to eqs 2 4 the quantities and units for the symbols in equations 2 through 4 are shown below in table 2 there are two ways of arriving at the actual daily evapotranspiration eta based on the tower data the first is to use the latent heat le measured directly from the eddy covariance measurements the second is to close the energy balance using either the bowen ratio or residual technique twine et al 2000 for daily values using the bowen ratio method for nighttime fluxes can cause spurious le estimates when the bowen ratio is near 1 therefore the residual method was used computing l e r n g h where rn g and h are the net radiation soil heat flux and sensible heat flux respectively since eta is likely to fall somewhere between the uncorrected le derived from eddy covariance measurements leec without invoking energy balance closure and energy balance closure using residual limits namely lere rn g h e g leuning et al 2012 for this analysis we used the average of the residual lere and leec computed directly from the eddy covariance measurements or 6 l e a v g 0 5 l e r e l e e c leavg was then converted from w m 2 to eta in mm d 1 using the expression shown for rn and g in table 2 in these vineyards there are three possible sources of latent heat et from vines et from the cover crop and bare soil evaporation while we are primarily concerned with vine et we cannot easily separate this source from the other two attempts at quantifying the transpiration and evaporation partitioning between the vine canopy interrow bare soil and cover crop using both modeling and measurement methods have been applied to this vineyard site kustas et al 2019a kustas et al 2019b the results suggest that during the initial emergence of the vine canopy in april et is a combination of all three sources however once the cover crop senesces by late may early june see fig 2 these studies suggest that the vines are main source of et on the order of 80 to 90 percent 2 8 soil moisture field dataloggers for the soil moisture profiles recorded mean hourly soil moisture for each of the three sensors in each profile the winter month measurements were used to estimate the field capacity or maximum amount of water the soil can hold without losing water to gravity drainage since the vines and cover crop are dormant during the winter months the decrease in soil moisture at the below ground sensors is primarily due to drainage which stops when the soil moisture reaches field capacity therefore a visual inspection of the data was performed to find the level at which following a precipitation event the 24 h change in soil moisture became zero these values were averaged for each sensor in a profile to obtain a mean field capacity for each measurement location the main analysis of the soil moisture data requires an estimate of the swc as it would be sensed by the vines drip irrigated grapevines such as the ones in the sierra loma study vineyards are known to have roots concentrated close to the surface and with sensors at 30 60 and 90 cm below the surface we do not know swc above 30 cm depth however we do have surface soil moisture 5 cm bgl under the drip line associated with the soil heat flux transects within 10 meters of the flux towers see table 1 while not in the exact same location as the soil moisture profile sensors see fig 2 from kustas et al 2018 this surface value is a reasonable estimate for swc under the drip line throughout the vineyard proceeding with the readings at 5 30 60 and 90 cm the hourly values between 0700 and 1800 hrs local time were averaged to get a daily value for each sensor for the hours when the vines were actively transpiring during the growing season to get a single daily value for the entire profile the values for each two adjacent sensors 5 and 30 cm 30 and 60 cm 60 and 90 cm were averaged to estimate the swc for the soil layer between the two sensors finally the resulting values for the three layers were weighted according to an assumed root distribution of 0 6 0 3 0 1 based on the work of bassoi et al 2003 we initially assume minimal root presence beyond the soil measured by the 90 cm sensor for two reasons these vineyards have been drip irrigated since planting leading to most roots developing near the surface where water is applied and a known hard pan layer on the order of 1 5 to 2 meters with high clay content prevents most roots from penetrating deeper into the soil 2 9 irrigation irrigation is typically reported by the growers in gallons of water applied per vine per day to compare this value to precipitation and et fluxes irrigation is converted to mm day 1 using the area formed by vine and row spacing of 1 5 and 3 35 m respectively 6 irr mm day 1 irr gal vine 1 day 1 1 v r 3 79 where v is the vine spacing 1 5 m r is the row spacing 3 35 m and the constant 3 79 is the combined conversions of gallons to cubic meters and meters to millimeters it is worth noting here that while precipitation is an area source of soil water over the entire vineyard irrigation is a line source along the center of each vine row additionally the soil moisture sensors are located in the vine row therefore a given depth of irrigation will cause a larger increase in recorded soil moisture under the vine than the same depth of precipitation 2 10 time scale as described above most values are initially recorded or calculated at an hourly or daily increment however fluctuations in meteorological variables and the resulting etref and eta make trends and patterns of swc in the root zone and et difficult to discern from daily data as a result the majority of analyses and visualizations in this study use a weekly time scale 3 results and discussion 3 1 annual et cycle fig 4 shows the annual cycle of weekly etref eta and eta etref over the 2013 2017 timeframe at both vineyard sites since etref is driven primarily by radiation it peaks during the summer months and is lowest during the winter additionally since etref includes meteorological conditions such as temperature wind speed and vpd eta for a given biomass level is widely viewed as a function of etref and water availability as such for these vineyards eta roughly follows etref due to generally well watered conditions in the wet winter months typically november through march the main sources of eta are the rain fed grass interrow cover crop and bare soil evaporation as the cover crop grows vigorously followed by vine canopy growth during march and april eta etref increases during this period due to increased photosynthetically active area and high available water reserves this behavior continues through may as the winter reserves are slowly drawn down as etref peaks in the summer months eta remains similarly high due to the irrigation applied to maintain eta etref at or above 0 7 comparing the two vineyards we see that eta in the south vineyard was lower than that of the north vineyard in the first year of the study period but this difference diminished over time one possible reason for the difference and trend is the relative age and maturity of the vineyards the 2013 season was the fifth season for the north vineyard but only the third for the south so the north vineyard would be expected to have a larger canopy and be more productive than the south this is verified by alfieri et al 2019 relating differences in et between the north and south vineyards to differences in lai by 2017 the ninth and seventh seasons for the north and south vineyards respectively the two year age difference would have a smaller impact on differences in canopy and productivity 3 2 soil moisture profiles while the two vineyards have three soil moisture profiles each only one profile in each vineyard has near continuous measurements for the full study period accordingly fig 5 gives the summary of soil moisture at the study site with one profile per vineyard along with the weighted average previously described the field capacity values estimated from winter soil moisture values are 0 37 m3 m 3 for the north vineyard and 0 29 m3 m 3 for the south vineyard consistent with the higher clay content of the north vineyard and higher sand content in the south the primary significance of this difference in field capacity is that given the same assumed root zone depth the north vineyard could have a 31 larger store of available water at the start of the growing season than the south vineyard this difference can affect when irrigation needs to begin fig 5 reveals several insights regarding soil moisture at these two vineyards first from the perspective of the soil there are two wet seasons one that is driven by precipitation in the winter months and one that is irrigation fed in the summer months in the south vineyard soil moisture tends to be mostly uniform throughout the root zone during the winter months but in the summer there tends to be some separation between the soil moisture of the 5 cm and 30 cm depths compared to the 60 cm and 90 cm depths with the 90 cm probe often showing little increase from irrigation in the 2015 2017 growing seasons in the north vineyard on the other hand all four sensors generally show increases in soil moisture from irrigation this difference in soil moisture behavior with depth between the two vineyards reflects the higher rate of irrigation applied in the north vineyard see fig 9 despite the south vineyard having less ability to store water in the root zone the weighted averages in fig 5 show that soil moisture is consistently higher in the north vineyard than in the south vineyard which follows from the lower capacity and apparently lower irrigation in the south vineyard this difference in soil moisture is another probable cause of the difference between eta of the two vineyards alfieri et al 2019 also reached this conclusion regarding differences in the eddy covariance le measurements at these sites 3 3 et and soil moisture the relationship between swc and et changes throughout the year based on meteorological conditions vineyard management and vine phenological stage weekly eta etref versus swc along with weekly values of etref in the north vineyard for the months of february through september are shown in fig 6 in february and early to mid march the shallow rooted cover crop and bare soil are the primary sources of et so eta is strongly dependent on soil water content of the upper layer of soil during this period furthermore since the soil remains relatively wet due to frequent precipitation the measured soil moisture is generally uniform throughout the root zone during these months see fig 5 in other words the measured swc is representative of the soil water available to be evaporated into the atmosphere april characterized by vigorous canopy growth and flowering is a transition month from the cover crop to the vine canopy as the primary source of et and also a transition from lower to higher etref values this transition leads to difficulty in determining a clear relationship between swc and et in may when rapid canopy growth continues and fruit set occurs we begin to see swc dropping into the range of 0 2 to 0 3 m3 m 3 as the root zone dries out and before consistent irrigation has begun despite the rapid drop in swc eta etref generally remains above 0 7 while there is still a contribution to et from the interrow bare soil the shallow cover crop roots and drying soil make it unlikely that these sources significantly contribute to the high eta etref this maintenance of high eta etref at low values of swc therefore implies vine access to deeper moisture pools under the vines and in the interrow i e that the measurements are not representative of the full effective root zone this result is significant because in these vineyards a single soil moisture sensor at approximately 90 cm depth is commonly used to determine the amount of available water in the root zone indeed pellegrino et al 2004 indicate that total transpirable soil water ttsw for vines should be calculated from measurements of soil moisture content over the rooting profile of the plant which they suggest to a depth of at least 2 5 m consequently if more water is available to the vines than the 90 cm sensor indicates irrigation may start too early in the season causing the application of more water than required for vine development vines using water from deeper than the measured zone immediately calls into question our assumption of minimal root presence below the 90 cm sensor but since both the root distribution and swc below this depth are currently unknown we continue with our weighted swc estimate continuing with fig 6 the months of june and july show similar behavior with eta coming primarily from the vines and with the year s highest values of etref consistent irrigation typically 5 to 6 days per week begins in june and veraison occurs in july a weak positive relationship emerges between swc and eta etref in the north vineyard during this period but irrigation keeps swc generally above 0 25 m3 m 3 and eta etref above 0 7 the lack of decrease in eta etref with swc also seems to indicate continued access to water deeper than the 90 cm measurement by august we see a lower range of swc values and a stronger relationship between eta etref and swc this stronger relationship may also indicate that the measured soil moisture is more indicative of what is available to the vines or that the deeper stores are becoming depleted and the vines are more dependent on irrigation than in earlier months harvest occurs in late august or early september and a combination of reduced canopy biomass and lower evaporative demand result in lower et values the sharp drop in eta etref in september 2017 for example indicates full dependence of the vines on irrigated water essentially the intensive irrigation during the main part of the growing season delays the drying out of the root zone preventing observations of very low soil moisture and low eta etref until after harvest in september fig 7 shows an analogous representation of seasonal behavior in eta etref with swc for the south vineyard while the relationships are similar to those of the north vineyard there is one prominent difference the apparent negative correlation between swc and eta etref in may and june within the south vineyard is not observed in the north vineyard at both the north and the south vineyards may and june are typically the months associated with a rapid increase in vine biomass or lai sun et al 2017 and as a result causes an increase in eta alfieri et al 2019 at the same time swc in the measured portion of the soil profile for the south vineyard shows a decrease in swc with increasing eta etref for these two months fig 7 whereas the north vineyard shows little or slightly positive trend these contrasting eta etref versus swc relationships strongly suggest that vines in the south vineyard must have access to available water deeper in the soil profile in the vine row and possibly in the interrow than what the current array of soil moisture probes measured which was only in the vine row and to a depth of 90 cm can detect since the contribution to et from the drying interrow cover crop is typically minimal in may and june kustas et al 2019a b this could not account for the trend observed in may and june for the south vineyard taking june 2017 as an example the vines would not be able to maintain eta etref above 0 8 for an entire month with swc near or below 0 2 m3 m 3 while the data in these two figures reveal that the relationship between swc and eta etref are driven by vine phenological stage and or point in time during the growing season there are also clear clusters by years that correspond with management activities for example the 2013 swc values circles for both vineyards are higher than the swc values of other years from may through september this observation is consistent with the reported irrigation for the north vineyard see fig 9 below conversely the 2017 swc values plus symbols tend to be lower than other years for may through september in both vineyards which is consistent with the lower irrigation levels observed that year taken together figs 6 and 7 indicate that the array of soil moisture probes used in this study are not fully representative of the root zone swc and that the irrigation regime can significantly influence the relationships between swc and eta etref 3 4 annual soil water storage to further investigate the differences in the swc and eta etref relationships between years fig 8 shows the cumulative increase in soil water storage deficit starting 1 april for each study year in each vineyard where the weekly storage deficit is eta less precipitation p and irrigation irr 1 april was chosen as the start date for accumulation because rainfall has typically stopped by this point and the vine canopy has not yet emerged significantly meaning the soil water storage is typically near its maximum value at this point the storage deficit is shown as a positive value because for any given year its maximum value indicates the minimum amount of water stored in the soil at the beginning of the growing season these plots demonstrate two general behaviors first an increasing storage deficit value typically indicates eta irr with a steeper slope indicating less irrigation in other words an increasing storage deficit means non irrigated water is being consumed by the vines in the soil profile second a flatter temporal trend or plateau indicates irrigation approximately equal to eta which is an intentional management practice the sharp drop in the deficit in most years observed before doy 250 indicates harvest and subsequent irrigation to recharge the soil profile for all years across both vineyards the deficit increases through april and may as the canopy develops and irrigation has not yet begun in the north vineyard the deficit remained mostly flat for the remainder of the growing season in 2013 2015 and continued to increase in 2016 and 2017 the south vineyard showed a general increase in the deficit until harvest in each year for both vineyards 2017 had the greatest cumulative storage deficit while the actual root zone depth is not known the maximum storage deficit allows us to estimate a minimum total root zone depth using zr dmax θf θr where dmax is the maximum storage deficit θf is the estimated swc at field capacity and θr is the residual swc based on the soil type rawls and brakenseik 1985 for the north vineyard respective values of these quantities of 285 mm 0 37 m3 m 3 and 0 08 m3 m 3 yield a minimum root zone depth of approximately 0 98 m for the south vineyard the values of 353 mm 0 29 m3 m 3 and 0 03 m3 m 3 yield a minimum root zone depth of approximately 1 4 m which supports the earlier conclusion that the roots extend beyond the assumed rooting depth of 90 cm it is important to keep in mind that these estimates represent a lower bound on the total root zone depth once irrigation matches or exceeds eta the storage deficit cannot increase making it difficult to know how much more additional water was available in the soil moreover the water stored at deeper layers in the interrow from winter precipitation is also unknown 3 5 precipitation and irrigation deficit as previously mentioned during the peak growing season of june through august the typical irrigation practice for these vineyards is to keep eta etref at or above 0 7 as shown in fig 8 the change in the storage deficit flattens out in june when irrigation typically begins particularly for the north vineyard fig 9 illustrates the annual variability in water balance components storage inputs and outputs for the june august irrigation period for both vineyards specifically the figure shows the starting storage estimate given by october through may precipitation plus irrigation less eta along with june august eta and irrigation each year with irrigation data has a deficit of irrigation compared to eta during this time period comparing this deficit to the starting storage estimate can indicate how much available water in the root zone was not used for example the north vineyard had nearly depleted soils by 1 june in 2014 fig 9 and the little available water was used up by the deficit between eta and irrigation june august this scenario is water efficient but leaves little room for error in avoiding stress conditions on the other hand in 2016 for both the north and south vineyards the june august deficit was small compared to the available storage on 1 june fig 9 indicating that there was likely water available in the soil profile that could have been used instead of the applied irrigation in 2017 the high winter and spring precipitation led to a large surplus of available water on 1 june and the lower irrigation for that year in both vineyards appears to indicate that the vineyard manager took this into account in scheduling the irrigation this result shows that given rainfall measurements and estimates of eta the irrigation strategy can be adjusted to account for increased or decreased stored water 3 6 precipitation and lai the soil water storage at the start of the growing season determines how long onset of irrigation can be delayed and is a direct result of the amount and timing of precipitation that occurs during the winter rainy season additionally spring water availability affects canopy development generally higher swc will lead to a larger canopy more leaf area leads to higher transpiration rates and higher total et in other words winter precipitation can have a direct effect on the maximum eta etref during the summer accordingly fig 10 shows the maximum lai for each year of the study period in relation to the full rainy season oct may precipitation along with date of peak lai marker color and the amount of spring mar may precipitation marker size in general maximum lai increases with the amount of oct may precipitation the exceptions to this trend are 2015 and especially 2013 in the south vineyard when the spring precipitation was relatively low the lack of precipitation late in the rainy season combined with the lower field capacity of the south vineyard means less water was available to support canopy growth leading to low peak lai on dates earlier in the growing season by contrast 2017 had the largest wet season precipitation leading to high lai peaking later in the growing season in addition to the 708 mm of precipitation in october february 114 mm of precipitation fell between march and may as a result the root zone was likely completely full when the vine canopy emerged and hence able to fuel an extended period of canopy growth therefore both the amount and timing of the rainy season precipitation affect the amount of stored water in the soil and resulting maximum lai 3 7 synthesis eta etref swc precipitation irrigation and lai we have seen that the relationship between swc and eta etref in the sierra loma study vineyards varies based on phenology local conditions and management practices we have also observed differences between the two vineyards and between years regarding the amount of water that can be stored in the soil and the impacts of that stored water on canopy growth these observations are synthesized in figs 11 and 12 showing weekly timeseries of precipitation p irrigation irr and eta all as fractions of as a fraction of weekly etref along with lai and the weighted root zone soil moisture each year and vineyard have their own unique relationship between these variables based on the conditions present and irrigation actions taken some generalized comments regarding these figures will facilitate interpretation in each figure precipitation blue bars and high swc dark color of the eta etref dots in the spring is followed by a period of no or little precipitation or irrigation as lai green triangles increases and swc is drawn down by the developing vines once irrigation begins eta etref in excess of irr etref orange bars indicates that water is being drawn from storage conversely irr etref larger than eta etref means excess water was applied that week finally the drop in eta etref in each year near doy 240 is due to harvest starting with the north vineyard fig 11 in 2013 high winter precipitation 383 mm combined with high irrigation levels led to high eta etref and swc throughout the growing season eta etref values near 1 in july and august indicate that there was likely stored water available in the soil in 2014 which had substantially less winter precipitation 182 mm and slightly lower irrigation significant rainfall late in the wet season fueled another year of high eta etref values in 2015 there was greater annual precipitation compared to 2014 but most of the precipitation occurred during the winter months rather than in the spring the upper root zone dried out early as a result but eta etref remained high presumably due to deeper available water for both 2016 and 2017 the lai was greater than the other years for 2016 it was due to spring precipitation and irrigation and for 2017 it was due to the combined winter and spring precipitation being nearly twice the amount of other years in these two years eta is greater than irrigation for the entire growing season until harvest and 2017 does so with less irrigation than 2016 therefore not only was the 2017 precipitation and resulting water store large enough for the vines to produce a larger canopy but it was also large enough to maintain high eta etref that was uncorrelated to swc in the upper layer of soil throughout the growing season in fig 12 the south vineyard et swc relationship differs from the north vineyard due to the combination of different soil and different management decisions in 2013 and 2014 the two years without irrigation data swc and eta etref are high during the main part of the growing season despite low lai we attribute this to the relatively young age of the vineyard combined with the high irrigation that would have been required to maintain the high swc for growing seasons 2015 2017 the south vineyard received less irrigation than the north vineyard in 2015 as a result of the lower irrigation there is a stronger relationship between eta etref and swc eta was greater than irrigation for most weeks indicating the use of stored water in 2016 and 2017 as in the north vineyard eta etref remained high despite low irrigation and the resulting low swc however 2017 seems to be a special case as there was little irrigation until august notice the decline in lai and eta etref prior to the start of irrigation which indicates depletion of plant available water deeper in the root zone profile than the measured 0 90 cm depth once irrigation commenced there was an immediate response in increased eta etref and lai additionally despite the delay of irrigation onset there were still weeks in which eta exceeded irrigation implying that the full root zone profile was not yet completely depleted these results indicate that in 2017 eta etref and swc for the 0 90 cm depth were almost completely uncorrelated for most of the growing season due to the entire root zone profile starting the season at field capacity combined figs 11 and 12 show that the relationships between irrigation eta and measured swc are highly variable and are strongly dependent on the late winter spring precipitation in years with precipitation that is lower than average or more skewed towards the winter instead of spring e g 2014 and 2015 the period before irrigation begins allows swc to decrease to the point that irrigation and eta are more tightly coupled this is particularly evident in the north vineyard on the other hand in years such as 2016 and 2017 with more spring overall precipitation eta remains higher than irrigation due to the larger amount of stored water in the soil 4 conclusion the preceding analysis of soil water content et precipitation irrigation and lai for two adjacent vineyards revealed several interesting features first there is typically a disconnect between the swc measured by the installed soil moisture profile sensors and the eta etref estimated for the vines with the latter showing little response to significant changes in swc this result particularly the maintenance of high eta etref for low measured swc values suggests that the vines can access water deeper than the 90 cm measured by the installed soil moisture profiles in the vine row and perhaps access to available water in the interrow indeed the minimum root zone depths estimated by the maximum growing season storage deficit are approximately 1 m and 1 4 m for the north and south vineyards respectively there are a number of assumptions that underpin these estimates including the estimated field capacity residual swc and starting point for the storage deficit calculations therefore these season storage deficit estimates suggest that future investigations should include deeper soil moisture measurements down to at least 1 5 m close to the nominal depth of the hard pan and soil profile measurements in the interrow to determine if there is available water for the vines in the interrow from winter precipitation with these observations a significant correlation between vine stress and swc might be achieved as suggested by the findings from pellegrino et al 2004 where a single relationship between predawn leaf water potential a metric for vine stress and fraction of total transpirable soil water ftsw was obtained for two vineyards they concluded that ftsw could be used as an indicator of the water deficit experienced in vineyards provided that ttsw can be accurately determined more recently using ftsw as a stress indicator simulated by a water balance model yielded significant correlations with yield and berry quality for various cultivars and pedoclimatic conditions in mediterranean vineyards gaudin et al 2014 another primary conclusion is that control over eta can only be achieved when the soil water profile is depleted to the point that the vines do not have abundant access to deeper stores of water estimating the available water depends on the root zone depth as discussed above as well as the amount and timing of precipitation during the rainy season in wetter years particularly those with more precipitation in the early spring months delaying the start of irrigation helps achieve the depletion necessary to control eta one possible way to deplete the water to a desired level would be to test the water status by comparing weekly swc eta and any applied water looking for the point at which changes in swc have a measurable effect on eta however one must still be cognizant of the critical period surrounding fruit set when water stress would have a significant negative impact on berry development 4 1 future work as part of the grapex project several other field sites have been established throughout california with the same data being collected at each site the next step along this line of study will be to perform the analyses of the present work on the data from the other field sites to observe similarities and or differences in the patterns observed at the sierra loma vineyards the ultimate goal is to develop a strategy for when to initiate irrigation based on rainy season precipitation swc eta and lai ideally these hydrometeorological and biophysical states of vineyards can be derived from remote sensing in order to have the capability of applying an irrigation strategy over multiple vineyards knipper et

10607,the central valley of california relies on irrigation for crop production but water resources particularly groundwater have reached a critical state due to extended drought periods and overuse by irrigated agriculture the purpose of the grape remote sensing atmospheric profile and evapotranspiration experiment grapex project is to improve efficiency in vineyard irrigation through field measurements and modeling efforts using remote sensing in this study we analyze multi year timeseries of ground based soil moisture and evapotranspiration et measurements collected during grapex to identify patterns that may inform future irrigation recommendations based on remotely sensed et the study focuses on field data collected in two adjacent pinot noir vineyards near lodi ca from 2013 to 2017 the data used for this analysis are reference evapotranspiration etref actual evapotranspiration eta mean daytime soil water content swc measured to a depth of 90 cm precipitation and irrigation the relationship between swc and the ratio of eta etref used as a soil moisture proxy indicator changes throughout the spring and summer months due to advancing phenological stages and management practices in early spring when the interrow cover crop is the primary source of et eta is strongly correlated with swc as the vine canopy grows in the strong correlation breaks down as the vines begin to access to water beyond the depth of the soil moisture sensors as the soil profile dries out during the summer the correlation between eta and swc once again emerges as the vines become strongly dependent on irrigation the dynamic interaction between the upper and lower root zone profile and evaporative demand means that the key to understanding vineyard water status using relatively shallow swc observations is to use them in conjunction with eta data so that when both swc and eta timeseries are highly correlated vine water status is well defined this suggests delaying the initiation of irrigation during the period of rapid vine growth until a clear relationship between swc and eta emerges would both reduce the total amount of water used and give the grower more control over vine growth and grape quality affected by water status keywords actual evapotranspiration reference evapotranspiration irrigation root zone soil moisture precipitation vine water status 1 introduction agriculture is the largest consumer of water in california using an estimated 75 of the total water supplied to the state in 2005 2010 california department of water resources 2015 the central valley is a highly prioritized user of water due to the high economic value of crops produced but resources are still limited as highlighted by drought in recent years it is therefore beneficial from both an economic and environmental perspective for growers to reduce the amount of water used for irrigation the grape remote sensing atmospheric profile and evapotranspiration experiment grapex project is a partnership between scientists at the usda hydrology and remote sensing laboratory e j gallo wineries and several other university and research entities to develop practical remote sensing techniques for monitoring plant water status and developing efficient irrigation plans in vineyards an overview of the grapex project is provided by kustas et al 2018 the ultimate goal of grapex is to reduce water usage while maintaining or improving grape yield and quality for wine production micrometeorological measurements relevant for vineyard irrigation management include soil water content swc actual evapotranspiration et a and the ratio of actual to reference et eta etref swc is a key variable governing the decision to commence irrigation in the spring this irrigation decision is typically triggered when available water content falls below a fixed threshold e g 50 after irrigation starts et a provides a measure of water consumed by the vineyard throughout the growing season guiding decisions on rate of replenishment via irrigation the ratio of daily values of actual to reference et eta etref is used in viticulture as a measure of vegetative stress often referred to as the crop coefficient optimal guidelines have been developed by grape varietal for target stress levels quantified in terms of eta etref for different phenological stages of vine development furthermore remotely sensed eta etref has been used as a proxy indicator or metric of the soil moisture status reflecting the control of soil moisture on evaporative fluxes hain et al 2009 hain et al 2011 the grapex project has collected field measurements of these and other micrometeorological and biophysical variables in vineyards nearly continuously since april 2013 providing a long baseline for assessing interrelationships between swc eta etref and remote sensing indicators initial assessments of the relationship between swc and eta etref for study years 2013 2016 indicated that eta etref decreases with swc below a mean swc threshold of about 0 35 m3 m 3 see fig 8 in kustas et al 2018 the relationship between these two variables also depends on phenological stage eta etref and swc show correlations both before bloom and after harvest but not during the main part of the growing season when eta etref is largely independent of swc the primary purpose of this paper is to explain these changes in the eta etref vs swc relationship throughout the growing season by way of a detailed study of the soil moisture evapotranspiration and irrigation timeseries data collected during grapex after a review of the field site and measurement methods we present the overall trends of et and swc throughout the study period of 2013 2017 then we analyze the relationship of these two quantities by month which roughly aligns with phenological stage finally we put these results into context using the quantities and timing of precipitation and applied irrigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study site part of the grapex project consists of two adjacent vitis vinifera l vineyards of the pinot noir variety in the california central valley near the city of lodi 38 29 n 121 12 w see fig 1 these vineyards were originally associated with the borden ranch kustas et al 2018 but currently are considered part of sierra loma ranch the first growing seasons for the north and south vineyards were 2009 and 2011 respectively both vineyards are drip irrigated with a dripper 0 35 m distance on either side of each vine and the vines are planted in east west rows spaced 3 35 m apart with 1 5 m between vines along each row the soils in the two vineyards are slightly different the north vineyard has an average texture content of 29 sand and 32 clay making it a clay loam in the usda soil texture triangle in the south vineyard the average texture is 39 sand and 22 clay hence classified as loam a more complete description of the vineyards including canopy structure may be found in kustas et al 2018 2 2 seasons and phenology fig 2 shows a general timeline of phenology and management in these vineyards providing temporal context for the measurements and findings presented below during february and early march which is typically the end of the rainy season the interrow grass cover crop a perennial mixture is active while the vines are dormant the cover crop grows and actively transpires thought april and is typically mowed several times in april and early may by end of may early june with no rain and into the dry season the cover crop undergoes senescence and turns into dry grass stubble through the remainder of the growing season see fig 2 on the other hand march through june is the period of active vine canopy growth and contains the phenological events of bud break bloom and fruit set sufficient soil water is critical during this period to achieve appropriate canopy size and berries per cluster veraison the stage where berry color changes and the grapes start to mature occurs in july during the canopy maintenance period when there is typically less irrigation finally harvest occurs in late august or early september about a month before the next rainy season begins 2 3 eddy covariance towers starting in 2013 continuous eddy covariance and surface energy balance measurements as well as standard meteorological observations have been collected in each vineyard table 1 is a description of the instrumentation and measurement height used in determining the surface energy balance and estimates of et a complete description of instrumentation on the towers is provided by kustas et al 2018 post processing of the raw 20 hz eddy covariance data and soil heat flux and net radiation data is described in detail in alfieri et al 2019 towers in the north site 1 and south site 2 vineyards are approximately 1 5 km apart and are located at the east edge of the vineyards see fig 1 to maximize fetch since winds are predominately from the west alfieri et al 2019 2 4 precipitation as shown in table 1 tipping bucket rain gauges were initially installed at 5 m above ground level agl at each tower however during the 2016 growing season it was discovered that the rain gauges were substantially under capturing water at this height likely due to the effect of wind as described by pollock et al 2018 the rain gauges were lowered to 3 m following the 2016 growing season precipitation input prior to january 2017 used in this study is a combination of data from another rain gauge onsite maintained by nasa and the fair oaks station of the california irrigation management information system cimis fig 3 shows the cumulative precipitation recorded by the nasa and cimis stations for the overlapping period of october 2013 through february 2015 while the two series are not identical they are similar enough to use the cimis for gap filling in the nasa data 2 5 soil moisture profiles in addition to the surface soil moisture measured for the soil heat flux installations three vertical profiles of soil moisture measurements were established in each vineyard near the tower locations each profile consists of hydra probe sensors stevens water monitoring systems portland oregon at depths of 30 60 and 90 cm below ground level bgl under the irrigation drip line hydra probes measure the dielectric permittivity of the soil and calculate volumetric soil water content swc m3 m 3 using a calibration curve of the following form stevens water monitoring systems inc 2007 1 θ a e r b where θ is swc er is the real dielectric permittivity and a and b are constants for this study the standard loam calibration constants of a 0 110 and b 0 180 seyfried et al 2005 were used 2 6 leaf area index the leaf area index lai of vine and interrow cover crop when green and active was estimated on a 30 m spatial scale for the grapex project using satellite imagery and the method of gao et al 2012 briefly this method uses a regression tree based on homogenous modis lai retrievals to obtain lai estimates at 30 m resolution from the reflectance bands measured by landsat application of this remote sensing based lai retrieval over the two vineyards was evaluated by sun et al 2017 and found to give fairly reliable estimates compared to ground based lai measurements derived from licor lai 2000 and lai 2200 measurements white et al 2019 2 7 evapotranspiration daily evapotranspiration et changes throughout the year due to varying radiation and meteorological inputs soil moisture content and biophysical characteristics of the vines and cover crop the reference evapotranspiration etref which varies due radiation and meteorological conditions is viewed as the maximum actual evapotranspiration eta a crop can achieve under well watered conditions and is used to normalize eta the resulting quantity eta etref is therefore a practical indicator of water stress in the vineyards etref is calculated using the local meteorological data from the tower and the fao penman monteith reference evapotranspiration equation allen et al 1998 2 e t r e f δ r n g γ 900 t a 273 u v p d δ γ 1 0 34 u where 3 δ 4098 e s a t 237 3 t a 2 and 4 γ 0 0016286 p λ equation 2 is evaluated at the hourly scale using the hourly post processed tower data and the daily etref is the sum of hourly values for each day this method of calculating etref results in a local reference rather than a reference for a standard grass surface since the tower measurements are used as input to eqs 2 4 the quantities and units for the symbols in equations 2 through 4 are shown below in table 2 there are two ways of arriving at the actual daily evapotranspiration eta based on the tower data the first is to use the latent heat le measured directly from the eddy covariance measurements the second is to close the energy balance using either the bowen ratio or residual technique twine et al 2000 for daily values using the bowen ratio method for nighttime fluxes can cause spurious le estimates when the bowen ratio is near 1 therefore the residual method was used computing l e r n g h where rn g and h are the net radiation soil heat flux and sensible heat flux respectively since eta is likely to fall somewhere between the uncorrected le derived from eddy covariance measurements leec without invoking energy balance closure and energy balance closure using residual limits namely lere rn g h e g leuning et al 2012 for this analysis we used the average of the residual lere and leec computed directly from the eddy covariance measurements or 6 l e a v g 0 5 l e r e l e e c leavg was then converted from w m 2 to eta in mm d 1 using the expression shown for rn and g in table 2 in these vineyards there are three possible sources of latent heat et from vines et from the cover crop and bare soil evaporation while we are primarily concerned with vine et we cannot easily separate this source from the other two attempts at quantifying the transpiration and evaporation partitioning between the vine canopy interrow bare soil and cover crop using both modeling and measurement methods have been applied to this vineyard site kustas et al 2019a kustas et al 2019b the results suggest that during the initial emergence of the vine canopy in april et is a combination of all three sources however once the cover crop senesces by late may early june see fig 2 these studies suggest that the vines are main source of et on the order of 80 to 90 percent 2 8 soil moisture field dataloggers for the soil moisture profiles recorded mean hourly soil moisture for each of the three sensors in each profile the winter month measurements were used to estimate the field capacity or maximum amount of water the soil can hold without losing water to gravity drainage since the vines and cover crop are dormant during the winter months the decrease in soil moisture at the below ground sensors is primarily due to drainage which stops when the soil moisture reaches field capacity therefore a visual inspection of the data was performed to find the level at which following a precipitation event the 24 h change in soil moisture became zero these values were averaged for each sensor in a profile to obtain a mean field capacity for each measurement location the main analysis of the soil moisture data requires an estimate of the swc as it would be sensed by the vines drip irrigated grapevines such as the ones in the sierra loma study vineyards are known to have roots concentrated close to the surface and with sensors at 30 60 and 90 cm below the surface we do not know swc above 30 cm depth however we do have surface soil moisture 5 cm bgl under the drip line associated with the soil heat flux transects within 10 meters of the flux towers see table 1 while not in the exact same location as the soil moisture profile sensors see fig 2 from kustas et al 2018 this surface value is a reasonable estimate for swc under the drip line throughout the vineyard proceeding with the readings at 5 30 60 and 90 cm the hourly values between 0700 and 1800 hrs local time were averaged to get a daily value for each sensor for the hours when the vines were actively transpiring during the growing season to get a single daily value for the entire profile the values for each two adjacent sensors 5 and 30 cm 30 and 60 cm 60 and 90 cm were averaged to estimate the swc for the soil layer between the two sensors finally the resulting values for the three layers were weighted according to an assumed root distribution of 0 6 0 3 0 1 based on the work of bassoi et al 2003 we initially assume minimal root presence beyond the soil measured by the 90 cm sensor for two reasons these vineyards have been drip irrigated since planting leading to most roots developing near the surface where water is applied and a known hard pan layer on the order of 1 5 to 2 meters with high clay content prevents most roots from penetrating deeper into the soil 2 9 irrigation irrigation is typically reported by the growers in gallons of water applied per vine per day to compare this value to precipitation and et fluxes irrigation is converted to mm day 1 using the area formed by vine and row spacing of 1 5 and 3 35 m respectively 6 irr mm day 1 irr gal vine 1 day 1 1 v r 3 79 where v is the vine spacing 1 5 m r is the row spacing 3 35 m and the constant 3 79 is the combined conversions of gallons to cubic meters and meters to millimeters it is worth noting here that while precipitation is an area source of soil water over the entire vineyard irrigation is a line source along the center of each vine row additionally the soil moisture sensors are located in the vine row therefore a given depth of irrigation will cause a larger increase in recorded soil moisture under the vine than the same depth of precipitation 2 10 time scale as described above most values are initially recorded or calculated at an hourly or daily increment however fluctuations in meteorological variables and the resulting etref and eta make trends and patterns of swc in the root zone and et difficult to discern from daily data as a result the majority of analyses and visualizations in this study use a weekly time scale 3 results and discussion 3 1 annual et cycle fig 4 shows the annual cycle of weekly etref eta and eta etref over the 2013 2017 timeframe at both vineyard sites since etref is driven primarily by radiation it peaks during the summer months and is lowest during the winter additionally since etref includes meteorological conditions such as temperature wind speed and vpd eta for a given biomass level is widely viewed as a function of etref and water availability as such for these vineyards eta roughly follows etref due to generally well watered conditions in the wet winter months typically november through march the main sources of eta are the rain fed grass interrow cover crop and bare soil evaporation as the cover crop grows vigorously followed by vine canopy growth during march and april eta etref increases during this period due to increased photosynthetically active area and high available water reserves this behavior continues through may as the winter reserves are slowly drawn down as etref peaks in the summer months eta remains similarly high due to the irrigation applied to maintain eta etref at or above 0 7 comparing the two vineyards we see that eta in the south vineyard was lower than that of the north vineyard in the first year of the study period but this difference diminished over time one possible reason for the difference and trend is the relative age and maturity of the vineyards the 2013 season was the fifth season for the north vineyard but only the third for the south so the north vineyard would be expected to have a larger canopy and be more productive than the south this is verified by alfieri et al 2019 relating differences in et between the north and south vineyards to differences in lai by 2017 the ninth and seventh seasons for the north and south vineyards respectively the two year age difference would have a smaller impact on differences in canopy and productivity 3 2 soil moisture profiles while the two vineyards have three soil moisture profiles each only one profile in each vineyard has near continuous measurements for the full study period accordingly fig 5 gives the summary of soil moisture at the study site with one profile per vineyard along with the weighted average previously described the field capacity values estimated from winter soil moisture values are 0 37 m3 m 3 for the north vineyard and 0 29 m3 m 3 for the south vineyard consistent with the higher clay content of the north vineyard and higher sand content in the south the primary significance of this difference in field capacity is that given the same assumed root zone depth the north vineyard could have a 31 larger store of available water at the start of the growing season than the south vineyard this difference can affect when irrigation needs to begin fig 5 reveals several insights regarding soil moisture at these two vineyards first from the perspective of the soil there are two wet seasons one that is driven by precipitation in the winter months and one that is irrigation fed in the summer months in the south vineyard soil moisture tends to be mostly uniform throughout the root zone during the winter months but in the summer there tends to be some separation between the soil moisture of the 5 cm and 30 cm depths compared to the 60 cm and 90 cm depths with the 90 cm probe often showing little increase from irrigation in the 2015 2017 growing seasons in the north vineyard on the other hand all four sensors generally show increases in soil moisture from irrigation this difference in soil moisture behavior with depth between the two vineyards reflects the higher rate of irrigation applied in the north vineyard see fig 9 despite the south vineyard having less ability to store water in the root zone the weighted averages in fig 5 show that soil moisture is consistently higher in the north vineyard than in the south vineyard which follows from the lower capacity and apparently lower irrigation in the south vineyard this difference in soil moisture is another probable cause of the difference between eta of the two vineyards alfieri et al 2019 also reached this conclusion regarding differences in the eddy covariance le measurements at these sites 3 3 et and soil moisture the relationship between swc and et changes throughout the year based on meteorological conditions vineyard management and vine phenological stage weekly eta etref versus swc along with weekly values of etref in the north vineyard for the months of february through september are shown in fig 6 in february and early to mid march the shallow rooted cover crop and bare soil are the primary sources of et so eta is strongly dependent on soil water content of the upper layer of soil during this period furthermore since the soil remains relatively wet due to frequent precipitation the measured soil moisture is generally uniform throughout the root zone during these months see fig 5 in other words the measured swc is representative of the soil water available to be evaporated into the atmosphere april characterized by vigorous canopy growth and flowering is a transition month from the cover crop to the vine canopy as the primary source of et and also a transition from lower to higher etref values this transition leads to difficulty in determining a clear relationship between swc and et in may when rapid canopy growth continues and fruit set occurs we begin to see swc dropping into the range of 0 2 to 0 3 m3 m 3 as the root zone dries out and before consistent irrigation has begun despite the rapid drop in swc eta etref generally remains above 0 7 while there is still a contribution to et from the interrow bare soil the shallow cover crop roots and drying soil make it unlikely that these sources significantly contribute to the high eta etref this maintenance of high eta etref at low values of swc therefore implies vine access to deeper moisture pools under the vines and in the interrow i e that the measurements are not representative of the full effective root zone this result is significant because in these vineyards a single soil moisture sensor at approximately 90 cm depth is commonly used to determine the amount of available water in the root zone indeed pellegrino et al 2004 indicate that total transpirable soil water ttsw for vines should be calculated from measurements of soil moisture content over the rooting profile of the plant which they suggest to a depth of at least 2 5 m consequently if more water is available to the vines than the 90 cm sensor indicates irrigation may start too early in the season causing the application of more water than required for vine development vines using water from deeper than the measured zone immediately calls into question our assumption of minimal root presence below the 90 cm sensor but since both the root distribution and swc below this depth are currently unknown we continue with our weighted swc estimate continuing with fig 6 the months of june and july show similar behavior with eta coming primarily from the vines and with the year s highest values of etref consistent irrigation typically 5 to 6 days per week begins in june and veraison occurs in july a weak positive relationship emerges between swc and eta etref in the north vineyard during this period but irrigation keeps swc generally above 0 25 m3 m 3 and eta etref above 0 7 the lack of decrease in eta etref with swc also seems to indicate continued access to water deeper than the 90 cm measurement by august we see a lower range of swc values and a stronger relationship between eta etref and swc this stronger relationship may also indicate that the measured soil moisture is more indicative of what is available to the vines or that the deeper stores are becoming depleted and the vines are more dependent on irrigation than in earlier months harvest occurs in late august or early september and a combination of reduced canopy biomass and lower evaporative demand result in lower et values the sharp drop in eta etref in september 2017 for example indicates full dependence of the vines on irrigated water essentially the intensive irrigation during the main part of the growing season delays the drying out of the root zone preventing observations of very low soil moisture and low eta etref until after harvest in september fig 7 shows an analogous representation of seasonal behavior in eta etref with swc for the south vineyard while the relationships are similar to those of the north vineyard there is one prominent difference the apparent negative correlation between swc and eta etref in may and june within the south vineyard is not observed in the north vineyard at both the north and the south vineyards may and june are typically the months associated with a rapid increase in vine biomass or lai sun et al 2017 and as a result causes an increase in eta alfieri et al 2019 at the same time swc in the measured portion of the soil profile for the south vineyard shows a decrease in swc with increasing eta etref for these two months fig 7 whereas the north vineyard shows little or slightly positive trend these contrasting eta etref versus swc relationships strongly suggest that vines in the south vineyard must have access to available water deeper in the soil profile in the vine row and possibly in the interrow than what the current array of soil moisture probes measured which was only in the vine row and to a depth of 90 cm can detect since the contribution to et from the drying interrow cover crop is typically minimal in may and june kustas et al 2019a b this could not account for the trend observed in may and june for the south vineyard taking june 2017 as an example the vines would not be able to maintain eta etref above 0 8 for an entire month with swc near or below 0 2 m3 m 3 while the data in these two figures reveal that the relationship between swc and eta etref are driven by vine phenological stage and or point in time during the growing season there are also clear clusters by years that correspond with management activities for example the 2013 swc values circles for both vineyards are higher than the swc values of other years from may through september this observation is consistent with the reported irrigation for the north vineyard see fig 9 below conversely the 2017 swc values plus symbols tend to be lower than other years for may through september in both vineyards which is consistent with the lower irrigation levels observed that year taken together figs 6 and 7 indicate that the array of soil moisture probes used in this study are not fully representative of the root zone swc and that the irrigation regime can significantly influence the relationships between swc and eta etref 3 4 annual soil water storage to further investigate the differences in the swc and eta etref relationships between years fig 8 shows the cumulative increase in soil water storage deficit starting 1 april for each study year in each vineyard where the weekly storage deficit is eta less precipitation p and irrigation irr 1 april was chosen as the start date for accumulation because rainfall has typically stopped by this point and the vine canopy has not yet emerged significantly meaning the soil water storage is typically near its maximum value at this point the storage deficit is shown as a positive value because for any given year its maximum value indicates the minimum amount of water stored in the soil at the beginning of the growing season these plots demonstrate two general behaviors first an increasing storage deficit value typically indicates eta irr with a steeper slope indicating less irrigation in other words an increasing storage deficit means non irrigated water is being consumed by the vines in the soil profile second a flatter temporal trend or plateau indicates irrigation approximately equal to eta which is an intentional management practice the sharp drop in the deficit in most years observed before doy 250 indicates harvest and subsequent irrigation to recharge the soil profile for all years across both vineyards the deficit increases through april and may as the canopy develops and irrigation has not yet begun in the north vineyard the deficit remained mostly flat for the remainder of the growing season in 2013 2015 and continued to increase in 2016 and 2017 the south vineyard showed a general increase in the deficit until harvest in each year for both vineyards 2017 had the greatest cumulative storage deficit while the actual root zone depth is not known the maximum storage deficit allows us to estimate a minimum total root zone depth using zr dmax θf θr where dmax is the maximum storage deficit θf is the estimated swc at field capacity and θr is the residual swc based on the soil type rawls and brakenseik 1985 for the north vineyard respective values of these quantities of 285 mm 0 37 m3 m 3 and 0 08 m3 m 3 yield a minimum root zone depth of approximately 0 98 m for the south vineyard the values of 353 mm 0 29 m3 m 3 and 0 03 m3 m 3 yield a minimum root zone depth of approximately 1 4 m which supports the earlier conclusion that the roots extend beyond the assumed rooting depth of 90 cm it is important to keep in mind that these estimates represent a lower bound on the total root zone depth once irrigation matches or exceeds eta the storage deficit cannot increase making it difficult to know how much more additional water was available in the soil moreover the water stored at deeper layers in the interrow from winter precipitation is also unknown 3 5 precipitation and irrigation deficit as previously mentioned during the peak growing season of june through august the typical irrigation practice for these vineyards is to keep eta etref at or above 0 7 as shown in fig 8 the change in the storage deficit flattens out in june when irrigation typically begins particularly for the north vineyard fig 9 illustrates the annual variability in water balance components storage inputs and outputs for the june august irrigation period for both vineyards specifically the figure shows the starting storage estimate given by october through may precipitation plus irrigation less eta along with june august eta and irrigation each year with irrigation data has a deficit of irrigation compared to eta during this time period comparing this deficit to the starting storage estimate can indicate how much available water in the root zone was not used for example the north vineyard had nearly depleted soils by 1 june in 2014 fig 9 and the little available water was used up by the deficit between eta and irrigation june august this scenario is water efficient but leaves little room for error in avoiding stress conditions on the other hand in 2016 for both the north and south vineyards the june august deficit was small compared to the available storage on 1 june fig 9 indicating that there was likely water available in the soil profile that could have been used instead of the applied irrigation in 2017 the high winter and spring precipitation led to a large surplus of available water on 1 june and the lower irrigation for that year in both vineyards appears to indicate that the vineyard manager took this into account in scheduling the irrigation this result shows that given rainfall measurements and estimates of eta the irrigation strategy can be adjusted to account for increased or decreased stored water 3 6 precipitation and lai the soil water storage at the start of the growing season determines how long onset of irrigation can be delayed and is a direct result of the amount and timing of precipitation that occurs during the winter rainy season additionally spring water availability affects canopy development generally higher swc will lead to a larger canopy more leaf area leads to higher transpiration rates and higher total et in other words winter precipitation can have a direct effect on the maximum eta etref during the summer accordingly fig 10 shows the maximum lai for each year of the study period in relation to the full rainy season oct may precipitation along with date of peak lai marker color and the amount of spring mar may precipitation marker size in general maximum lai increases with the amount of oct may precipitation the exceptions to this trend are 2015 and especially 2013 in the south vineyard when the spring precipitation was relatively low the lack of precipitation late in the rainy season combined with the lower field capacity of the south vineyard means less water was available to support canopy growth leading to low peak lai on dates earlier in the growing season by contrast 2017 had the largest wet season precipitation leading to high lai peaking later in the growing season in addition to the 708 mm of precipitation in october february 114 mm of precipitation fell between march and may as a result the root zone was likely completely full when the vine canopy emerged and hence able to fuel an extended period of canopy growth therefore both the amount and timing of the rainy season precipitation affect the amount of stored water in the soil and resulting maximum lai 3 7 synthesis eta etref swc precipitation irrigation and lai we have seen that the relationship between swc and eta etref in the sierra loma study vineyards varies based on phenology local conditions and management practices we have also observed differences between the two vineyards and between years regarding the amount of water that can be stored in the soil and the impacts of that stored water on canopy growth these observations are synthesized in figs 11 and 12 showing weekly timeseries of precipitation p irrigation irr and eta all as fractions of as a fraction of weekly etref along with lai and the weighted root zone soil moisture each year and vineyard have their own unique relationship between these variables based on the conditions present and irrigation actions taken some generalized comments regarding these figures will facilitate interpretation in each figure precipitation blue bars and high swc dark color of the eta etref dots in the spring is followed by a period of no or little precipitation or irrigation as lai green triangles increases and swc is drawn down by the developing vines once irrigation begins eta etref in excess of irr etref orange bars indicates that water is being drawn from storage conversely irr etref larger than eta etref means excess water was applied that week finally the drop in eta etref in each year near doy 240 is due to harvest starting with the north vineyard fig 11 in 2013 high winter precipitation 383 mm combined with high irrigation levels led to high eta etref and swc throughout the growing season eta etref values near 1 in july and august indicate that there was likely stored water available in the soil in 2014 which had substantially less winter precipitation 182 mm and slightly lower irrigation significant rainfall late in the wet season fueled another year of high eta etref values in 2015 there was greater annual precipitation compared to 2014 but most of the precipitation occurred during the winter months rather than in the spring the upper root zone dried out early as a result but eta etref remained high presumably due to deeper available water for both 2016 and 2017 the lai was greater than the other years for 2016 it was due to spring precipitation and irrigation and for 2017 it was due to the combined winter and spring precipitation being nearly twice the amount of other years in these two years eta is greater than irrigation for the entire growing season until harvest and 2017 does so with less irrigation than 2016 therefore not only was the 2017 precipitation and resulting water store large enough for the vines to produce a larger canopy but it was also large enough to maintain high eta etref that was uncorrelated to swc in the upper layer of soil throughout the growing season in fig 12 the south vineyard et swc relationship differs from the north vineyard due to the combination of different soil and different management decisions in 2013 and 2014 the two years without irrigation data swc and eta etref are high during the main part of the growing season despite low lai we attribute this to the relatively young age of the vineyard combined with the high irrigation that would have been required to maintain the high swc for growing seasons 2015 2017 the south vineyard received less irrigation than the north vineyard in 2015 as a result of the lower irrigation there is a stronger relationship between eta etref and swc eta was greater than irrigation for most weeks indicating the use of stored water in 2016 and 2017 as in the north vineyard eta etref remained high despite low irrigation and the resulting low swc however 2017 seems to be a special case as there was little irrigation until august notice the decline in lai and eta etref prior to the start of irrigation which indicates depletion of plant available water deeper in the root zone profile than the measured 0 90 cm depth once irrigation commenced there was an immediate response in increased eta etref and lai additionally despite the delay of irrigation onset there were still weeks in which eta exceeded irrigation implying that the full root zone profile was not yet completely depleted these results indicate that in 2017 eta etref and swc for the 0 90 cm depth were almost completely uncorrelated for most of the growing season due to the entire root zone profile starting the season at field capacity combined figs 11 and 12 show that the relationships between irrigation eta and measured swc are highly variable and are strongly dependent on the late winter spring precipitation in years with precipitation that is lower than average or more skewed towards the winter instead of spring e g 2014 and 2015 the period before irrigation begins allows swc to decrease to the point that irrigation and eta are more tightly coupled this is particularly evident in the north vineyard on the other hand in years such as 2016 and 2017 with more spring overall precipitation eta remains higher than irrigation due to the larger amount of stored water in the soil 4 conclusion the preceding analysis of soil water content et precipitation irrigation and lai for two adjacent vineyards revealed several interesting features first there is typically a disconnect between the swc measured by the installed soil moisture profile sensors and the eta etref estimated for the vines with the latter showing little response to significant changes in swc this result particularly the maintenance of high eta etref for low measured swc values suggests that the vines can access water deeper than the 90 cm measured by the installed soil moisture profiles in the vine row and perhaps access to available water in the interrow indeed the minimum root zone depths estimated by the maximum growing season storage deficit are approximately 1 m and 1 4 m for the north and south vineyards respectively there are a number of assumptions that underpin these estimates including the estimated field capacity residual swc and starting point for the storage deficit calculations therefore these season storage deficit estimates suggest that future investigations should include deeper soil moisture measurements down to at least 1 5 m close to the nominal depth of the hard pan and soil profile measurements in the interrow to determine if there is available water for the vines in the interrow from winter precipitation with these observations a significant correlation between vine stress and swc might be achieved as suggested by the findings from pellegrino et al 2004 where a single relationship between predawn leaf water potential a metric for vine stress and fraction of total transpirable soil water ftsw was obtained for two vineyards they concluded that ftsw could be used as an indicator of the water deficit experienced in vineyards provided that ttsw can be accurately determined more recently using ftsw as a stress indicator simulated by a water balance model yielded significant correlations with yield and berry quality for various cultivars and pedoclimatic conditions in mediterranean vineyards gaudin et al 2014 another primary conclusion is that control over eta can only be achieved when the soil water profile is depleted to the point that the vines do not have abundant access to deeper stores of water estimating the available water depends on the root zone depth as discussed above as well as the amount and timing of precipitation during the rainy season in wetter years particularly those with more precipitation in the early spring months delaying the start of irrigation helps achieve the depletion necessary to control eta one possible way to deplete the water to a desired level would be to test the water status by comparing weekly swc eta and any applied water looking for the point at which changes in swc have a measurable effect on eta however one must still be cognizant of the critical period surrounding fruit set when water stress would have a significant negative impact on berry development 4 1 future work as part of the grapex project several other field sites have been established throughout california with the same data being collected at each site the next step along this line of study will be to perform the analyses of the present work on the data from the other field sites to observe similarities and or differences in the patterns observed at the sierra loma vineyards the ultimate goal is to develop a strategy for when to initiate irrigation based on rainy season precipitation swc eta and lai ideally these hydrometeorological and biophysical states of vineyards can be derived from remote sensing in order to have the capability of applying an irrigation strategy over multiple vineyards knipper et

10608,estimated reference evapotranspiration eto requires the meteorological attributes to be taken above standardized well watered and vegetation covered surfaces however worldwide such vegetation reference sites are not common this results in mistaken estimates of eto by using the well known and extensively applied fao 56 penman monteith formula consequently the use of inappropriate data for eto estimation from non ideal surfaces leads to significant and systematic cumulative errors introducing uncertainties when determining the crop water requirements in a region additionally the existing climatic stations are not spatially distributed but rather concentrated mostly in non rural urban areas or in local airports operating above non standardized surfaces the purpose of this work is to assess the effect of using daily meteorological data recorded above a well watered short crop compared to data obtained above dry bare soil at the same local environment using two widely used eto models the asce penman monteith and the hargreaves samani the results indicate that the meteorological conditions above the different surfaces are quite different presenting higher temperature and lower relative humidity values above the bare soil surface compared to the well watered short crop and resulting finally to errors in the estimation of reference evapotranspiration these errors appear to enhance as air temperature vapor pressure deficit radiation and atmospheric clearness increases or relative humidity decreases but are diminishing under adequate soil moisture conditions resulting after rainfall events the eto differences vary according to the model each time adopted but the soil substrate influence can be detected by more sophisticated methods such as fao56 pm which consider the energy balance of the surface keywords reference evapotranspiration eto penman monteith method hargreaves samani method bare soil evaporation vegetation covered surface 1 introduction the spatial and temporal variability of essential factors affecting reference evapotranspiration eto makes crucial the standardization of the surfaces on which the agrometeorological stations are established this variability creates difficulties in the use and accurate performance of the proposed eto estimation equations eto is based on potential evapotranspiration from grass or alfalfa crop which presupposes a continuous source of soil moisture and doesn t consider the summer plant dormancy the etp is defined by penman 1948 as the amount of water transpired in a given time by a short green crop completely shading the ground of uniform height and with adequate water status in the soil profile in 1977 fao proposed a methodology for computing crop evapotranspiration based in the use of reference evapotranspiration denoted as eto doorenboos and pruitt 1977 methodology that remains valid at the present day twenty one years later fao published a new manual for computing crop water requirements allen et al 1998 that reformulated the concept of reference evapotranspiration and espoused the penman monteith equation as a standardized method for eto estimation the main factors affecting the eto include solar radiation air temperature relative humidity and windspeed these parameters are related to the nature and properties of the surface above which the measurements are taken and they support the theoretical background of the most reliable model for reference evapotranspiration estimation the fao 56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 is widely used and considered as a benchmark method for estimating reference evapotranspiration eto walter et al 2000 it s data requirements however are high since the model demands air temperature relative humidity windspeed and solar radiation data the meteorological stations measuring these parameters worldwide are few and even fewer are the ones that produce reliable data droogers and allen 2002 allen et al 1994 gives clear definition of eto estimated by employing the penman monteith equation as the evapotranspiration above a specifically defined hypothetical reference crop which has height 0 12 m canopy resistance 70 s m 1 and albedo 0 23 choisnel et al 1992 mention that eto corresponds to the water consumed by an active grass lawn cover without restrictions in water availability or nutrients uptake and droogers and allen 2002 raise concerns on the eto estimates accuracy by using the penman monteith method under arid conditions since the meteorological data recorded are originating from dry environments with insufficient water supply while the eto should represent water demands above well irrigated soil surfaces in the same work the authors suggest the use of modified hargreaves formulas which take into account the monthly precipitation regarding that monthly precipitation represents relative levels of humidity instead of the penman monteith formula allen et al 2011 describe the common errors from the measurement systems and underline the importance of collecting and using good quality data for the estimation of eto addressing also the importance of the type of setting and the conditions from which the weather measurements are acquired the authors also state that in humid and semi humid climates the evapotranspiration is dominated more by net radiation availability than by aerodynamics and vapor deficit compared to arid or semi arid climates pereira et al 2015 address two main requirements for the application of the penman monteith eto equation that computation of the parameters follow standardized procedures as proposed in fao56 guidelines and that weather data are of good quality and represent weather conditions to be found over a green grass area consistent with the eto definition emphasizing to the weather data quality assessment and control they also mention that combination methods including the pm are sensitive to errors induced by not representative weather data suggesting that the data should be of good quality and representative of well watered conditions moreover pereira et al 2015 state that most eto equations for use with meteorological data collected primarily over and downwind of dense fully transpiring grass or similar vegetation exhibiting behavior similar to the definition of the reference surface condition suggesting that the weather stations should by centered within large surfaces with uniform vegetation supplied with sufficient water to support maximum evapotranspiration rates a station situated above a dry bare soil will measure higher temperature and correspondingly lower relative humidity values compared to a station on a well irrigated and vegetation covered site allen 1996 yoder et al 2000 as referred in the sitting section at the cimis network cimis water ca gov the placement of a weather station will affect the accuracy and reliability of the eto calculation for that surrounding area the absence of healthy green grass under a weather station can affect net radiation and humidity which will adversely affect eto similar findings are presented by eching et al 2002 giving also specific guidelines in placing weather stations in a recent work awal et al 2020 point out the potential uncertainties of eto estimates by the fao56 pm equation using weather data from non reference stations discussing also that many of the west texas mesonet stations do not meet the criteria of the reference surface for eto estimation the authors also mention that the use of such data may induce an increase in air temperature and a decrease in relative humidity respectively resulting in an overestimation of eto jensen et al 1997 underlines also that the use of relative humidity and air temperature data from non irrigated and inadequately irrigated sites may introduce a bias in the computed values for eto a similar conclusion has been drawn by temesgen et al 1999 suggesting that the use of weather data from sites which do not comply with the definition of reference may cause serious errors to eto estimates due to the elevated maximum and minimum air temperature and depressed dew point temperature values therefore the weather and the site conditions influence are incorporated in the estimation of the eto and adversely eto is a climatic parameter that expresses the evapotranspiration rate at a specific time and place above a standard vegetation covered and well watered reference site allen et al 1998 worldwide researchers have accepted the use of grass cool season grass blue grasses fescues and rye grasses and alfalfa medicago sativa as reference crops allen et al 2006 due to their adaptability to different climatic regimes and their biophysical similarity with many agricultural crops these reference crop surfaces are not just similar to hypothetical crop described by allen et al 1998 but they are adopted to simulate a common reference between different microclimatic conditions around the world and also produce accurate estimates of water requirements for different crops although the paper of allen et al 1998 has more than 19 000 citations in literature google scholar citations the number of scientists who point out the importance and significance of a standardized vegetation surface is quite limited the well known crop factor kc as well as the dual kc allen et al 2005 are the factors relating eto with the potential evapotranspiration rate for all stages of crop development and represent the influence of four key characteristics crop height reflectivity albedo bulk canopy resistance evaporation from bare soil which differentiate the specific crop from the reference crop at a given place today the need for irrigation water is usually defined through the assessment of reference evapotranspiration and requires the establishment of meteorological stations on standardized vegetation covered surfaces in the mediterranean such sites are rare due to the high installation and maintenance costs this leads to a systematic use of climatic data that are not properly measured resulting to accumulated errors not only in irrigation scheduling but also in the estimation of the energy balance at a region as discussed by temesgen et al 1999 the majority of the weather data around the globe is reported from non reference settings such as airports where sensors may even be on tops of buildings or at stations having dry bare soil surfaces and or concrete surfaces most et equations however were developed using weather data from research locations generally falling into the reference station category this paper aims to highlight and identify the influence of the characteristics of a non ideal surface e g bare soil in assessing the eto a comparative analysis and evaluation of the input parameters included in the estimation methods of eto and of the produced eto estimates for two surfaces bare soil and vegetation covered surface is presented in this paper additionally it is checked whether the aerodynamic adiabatic term of the equation of penman monteith varies under the influence of the different characteristics of the two surfaces 2 materials and

indicating year 2005 as relatively wet with annual rainfall 38 above the climatic average and years 2004 and 2006 as relatively dry with annual rainfall 44 and 35 respectively bellow the climatic

the net shortwave radiation and r n l the net longwave radiation rn which is estimated from the values of the total incoming shortwave radiation rs is different for the two stations due to different surface reflectivity albedo taken equal to 0 17 for the bare soil hnms and 0 23 for the short crop aua respectively the albedo value of 0 17 for the bare soil was measured during an independent experiment conducted in summer of 2008 doy 150 to 250 in the same site data not shown by installing an albedometer lppyra06 above the non irrigated bare soil thus 0 17 represents the real albedo above the non irrigated bare soil and its value was used for estimating rn as if a net radiometer was installed above the bare ground surface the reflectivity affects r n s while the variation of rnl is affected by the temperature and relative humidity conditions prevailing above the surfaces and it is expressed by the trend of actual water vapor ea above them the estimated values of evapotranspiration in the experimental field aua can be considered as very close to eto grass reference height 8 12 cm as the crop coefficient of potato canopy at the maximum growth stage is slightly around 1 0 i e 0 8 1 17 doorenboos and pruitt 1977 allen et al 1998 kashyap and panda 2001 jayanthi et al 2007 mokhtari et al 2019 therefore the maximum values obtained in the experimental field of aua can be considered as equal to the evapotranspiration rates obtained above a grass surface height 8 12 cm under adequate soil moisture conditions near to the field capacity additionally eto was also estimated according to hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 for comparison with the fao 56 pm method to assess its performance in cases that the lack of data makes it impossible to use the proposed penman monteith benchmark method the method eq 2 uses the diurnal temperature range t max t min t a v g and the extraterrestrial radiation r a expressed in mmd 1 2 e t o 0 0023 t max t min 0 5 t 17 8 r a the assessment of the accuracy of the models applied in both stations hnms and aua and the evaluation of the differences between the meteorological parameters were performed by using different statistical indices specifically intercepts b and slopes a of linear regressions were calculated along with commonly correlation measures as r2 however since fox 1981 and willmott 1982 suggest that such measures are often inappropriate or misleading when used to compare models the model efficiency ef by greenwood et al 1985 and the index of agreement d alternatively proposed by willmott and wicks 1980 and willmott 1981 1982 were also employed in this work additionally the mean bias error mbe the variance of differences distribution s d 2 the root mean square error rmse and the mean absolute error mae were estimated further information about the appropriate use of these indices can be found in the work of alexandris et al 2008 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparative analysis of the eto related parameters comparing the daily temperature and relative humidity values between the stations of aua and hnms appears that warmer and drier conditions persist above the bare ground of the hnms station compared to the well watered green surface of the aua station fig 2 this is attributed to the effect of soil moisture and vegetation cover allen et al 2000 underlines the importance of the environments associated with the weather stations that produce the weather data to be used for eto estimation stating that the local environment and general aridity of the area surrounding a weather station i e lack of transpiring vegetation can impact readings of air temperature and humidity in the present work we have shown that in a short distance only 2 4 km between the two sites the offset differences of the mean temperature trend lines are 4 4 4 2 and 2 6 c for the study periods of the years 2004 2005 and 2006 respectively fig 2 a great amount of the latent energy consumed by a surface for evaporation and or transpiration with a potential rate is allocated from the sensible heat of the overlaying to the surface air layer in the case of the bare soil substrate of the hnms station the low soil moisture or completely dry soil surface and the persistence of dry conditions in the overlying to the soil surface air layer results in energy allocation from the ground heat flux g attribute to the overlying to the soil s surface air layer this results to an additional increase of the thermal content of the air sensible heat flux above the dry surface as there is insufficient moisture in the soil to be spent in latent heat of evaporation this changes the daily thermal balance especially during the following 24 hours and becomes critical in warm periods santanello and friedl 2003 point out that the commonly used methods to parameterize soil heat flux g ignore the dependency of g on soil properties and the asymmetry in the diurnal variation the authors examined g as a function of rn for sparse cover and bare soil conditions focusing on patterns of diurnal variation as well as on the effects of soil moisture and soil type and found a strong correlation between g and rn and that the g to rn ratio tends to increase when evaporation starts to be limited due to soil conditions instead of the atmosphere it should be emphasized that another factor that changes the rate of evaporation is the soil texture of the surface layer for example unsaturated flow is interrupted where soil steeply changes from relatively fine to coarse due to the capillary water that is held tightly by the smaller pores of the finer textured layer and cannot move into the larger pores in the overlying coarse textured layer while the water vapor in the pores moves from one point to another within the soil in response to differences in vapor pressure the external ascending movement that occurs at the soil surface is likely to decrease significantly the average temperature and relative humidity values along with the related parameters for estimation of eto with the fao56 pm and the hargreaves samani methods for the two meteorological stations of aua and hnms during the measuring periods of the years 2004 2005 and 2006 are summarized in table 1 daily tavg measurements at the hnms station are higher compared to the aua station by 11 at the wetter and cooler year 2006 16 at the warmer and drier year 2005 and 15 the respective in 2004 tmin differences are even greater varying from 14 in 2005 to 22 in 2004 while for tmax are almost negligible from 0 to 3 this is attributed to the fact that high temperatures recorded during midday are related to higher wind speeds leading to a better mix of the air layers and more uniform temperature conditions on a spatial scale resulting finally to the minimization of the surface effect on temperature however during night or near dawn when tmin is achieved wind speed is lower and the proper air mix is prevented under such conditions the substrate surface can affect the temperature and the relative humidity values on the above to the surface air layers resulting to higher and lower values respectively above the vegetation covered and well watered surface compared to the bare soil the rhavg differences are varying from 4 in 2006 to 23 in 2005 or 25 in 2004 being almost identical during the cool and wet measuring period of 2006 also the dtr presents smaller values at the hnms station by 4 in 2005 to 14 in 2006 compared to the aua station indicating more evident diurnal temperature changes greater range of diurnal temperatures above the vegetation covered and well watered surface compared to the bare soil vpd is considered as essential factor for determining eto since it is depicting the virtual saturation of the atmosphere with water vapor fig 4 presents vpd regime formed above the bare soil compared to a vegetation covered surface with adequate soil moisture which transpires and evaporates at a maximum rate the relationship shows the hypothetical water demand of the atmosphere which is much more increased compared to the quantity required by a well watered short crop on average vpd is higher at the hnms station by percentages varying from 23 in 2006 to 73 in 2004 and 60 in2005 indicating a higher potential for water evaporation above the bare soil substrate which is enhanced under hot and dry conditions the air humidity potential expressed as es is also higher at the hnms station by 16 in 2006 to 22 in 2005 however actual air humidity ea differences are positive during 2006 11 but negative during the relatively hot and dry years 2004 11 and 2005 7 fig 3 3 2 evaluation of eto values and differences daily reference evapotranspiration eto estimated by fao56 pm and h s methods were analyzed for both hnms and aua stations the differences of the meteorological parameters presented above section 3 1 are incorporated in the eto estimates resulting to differences between the two case studies hnma and aua by reviewing the absolute eto values shown in fig 4 it is evident that regardless the method each time adopted eto at the aua station never exceeds 8 5 mm d 1 but there are many much greater values for the hnms station this is very important since the application of the recommended methodologies proposed by allen et al 1998 shouldn t give eto rates that exceeds 8 5 mm d 1 in areas within the mediterranean altitudes even under extreme temperature or radiation conditions alexandris 2003 alexandris et al 2006 the hnms data input recorded above bare soil in the fao56 pm formula results to a systematic overestimation of eto compared to the aua station data measured above an irrigated short crop as is clearly illustrated in fig 4 the comparison of eto estimated by fao56 pm between the two stations hnms vs aua present a linear correlation with high r2 values above 0 91 and rather stable slopes 1 45 on average varying from 1 43 in 2005 to 1 55 in 2004 and offsets 1 1 mm d 1 on average varying from 1 0 mm d 1 in 2004 to 1 4 mm d 1 in 2004 on the other hand the h s eto values correlations give quite similar values between the two stations with slight differences slopes varying from 0 9 in 2004 to 1 04 in 2006 and offsets from 0 3 mm d 1 in 2006 to 0 2 mm d 1 in 2004 despite the relatively large values dispersion r2 from 0 79 to 0 86 more specific quantitative statistical measures are presented in table 2 such patterns indicate that the fao56 pm method is more sensitive to detect the influence of the ground substrate characteristics compared to the h s this is attributed to the fact that fao56 pm expresses the energy balance of a surface in combination with its aerodynamic characteristics whereas h s is affected only by temperature parameters tavg and dtr in the second case the lower dtr values observed above bare soil cancel the effect of the higher tavg resulting to almost identical eto estimates between the two stations fig 4 the eto values with the h s method are quite close to the estimates by the fao56 pm for the hnms station as depicted in fig 5 this is somehow misleading when assessing the performance of different eto models using data above non standardized ground surfaces since errors induced by the use of such no proper data result to overestimations from the real eto values for all methods but also to diminished differences between them as clearly illustrated in fig 5 for all measuring years 2004 2005 2006 the cumulative eto curves show that h s method regardless station and fao56 pm in hnms show similar results the differences from the eto cumulative values with the fao56 pm in the aua station are significant with worst estimates for h s in hnms for the year 2004 134 mm for 99 days and 2005 116 mm for 116 days and fao56 pm in hnms for the year 2006 122 mm for 124 days the performance of the studied methods in the two sites compared to the daily eto estimates by fao56 pm applied in the aua station is presented in table 3 the fao56 pm method when applied above bare non irrigated soil present overestimation varying from 20 in the cooler wetter year 2006 to 23 6 or 25 6 in the warmer drier years 2004 and 2005 respectively regardless of the method the influence of the surface substrate is more evident during the warm dry years under cooler and wetter conditions h s appears to give more accurate estimates compared to fao56 pm at this point it should be mentioned that in most studies the use of inappropriate data above non standardized surfaces is often accompanied by the adoption of an albedo value of 0 23 this mistake upon mistake process seems to result to better estimates with the fao56 pm method in the case of hnms station s bare soil substrate since the overestimation appears to reduce to much smaller percentages 17 in 2004 15 in 2005 and 13 in 2006 if a false albedo of 0 23 is used instead of the 0 17 of a bare soil for assessing the effect of the ground substrate on the eto estimation the difference between eto values hnms aua at the two meteorological stations using the fao56 pm formula was examined with respect to the values of tavg rhavg vpd and rs grouped in appropriate bin classes also the influence of the atmospheric clearness kt and of the days number after rainfall were studied and the results are presented in fig 6 the eto difference hnms aua by employing the fao56 pm method appears to increase with tavg fig 6a and decrease with rhavg fig 6b indicating that under warm and dry weather conditions the influence of the bare soil substrate becomes more sound and the overestimation of eto is enhanced resulting to average daily differences of the order of 2 mm d 1 more evident is the effect of vpd e a e s a parameter that combines air temperature and relative humidity where the eto overestimation is even greater exceeding 2 mm d 1 at very high vpd values as shown in fig 4c however at low vpd and t and high rh values the eto overestimation can be considered negligible the magnitude of the incoming solar radiation which is the main energy attribute for eto and the atmospheric clearness kt rs ra appears to play also an essential role in determining the eto differences for the two case studies hnms and aua the days with overcast sky conditions kt below 0 3 see proutsos et al 2019 or diminished solar radiation flux densities rs correspond to negligible eto differences whereas at days with clear skies kt above 0 7 or high rs flux densities the eto overestimation becomes maximum exceeding on average 1 5 mm d 1 as shown in fig 6d and fig 6e the above mentioned indicate that the ground substrate influence is more evident under warm and dry atmospheric conditions with clear skies and increased incoming solar radiation fluxes under such conditions an irrigated plant covered surface can evaporate and transpire with a maximum rate since adequate soil moisture is available in the rootzone through these natural processes evaporation and transpiration the surface responds to the increased atmospheric demand for water vapor regulating the temperature and air humidity regime of the above to the surface air layer on the other hand a bare non irrigated soil surface under the same atmospheric conditions but with low water availability in the soil cannot sustain a high evaporative pace allowing the air temperature to increase and the humidity to decrease resulting to warmer and drier conditions prevailing in the air layer above the surface as discussed by quinn et al 2018 the evaporation rate depends on external meteorological conditions above the soil layer is noticeable that evaporation from bare soil is an important component of the soil water and energy balance especially in semi arid and arid locations there is comprehensive information about evapotranspiration for well watered crops allen et al 1998 jensen and allen 2016 but less information about bare soil evaporation quinn et al 2018 initially when the soil layer is wet it can supply water to the surface at an adequate rate for evaporation afterwards the evaporation rate decreases below the potential rate progressively since the underlying layer of the soil cannot adequately supply the surface layer with water because the water held tightly by the soil solids and because of the low water potential of the upper soil surface layer the difference in energy level of water from one depth to another between wet soil and dry soil determines not only the direction of movement but also the speed of the water movement no water content in an interphase layer of porous matrix leads to disruption of evaporation of the upper soil surface however the effect of the bare soil under warm and dry atmospheric conditions becomes minor after a rainfall event even at low precipitation magnitudes in fig 6f is depicted the average overestimation of eto at the hnms station compared to the aua against the number of days after a rainfall event the distribution indicates that immediately after rain the eto differences are small 0 4 mm d 1 on average increasing the following days and becoming maximum about 1 5 mm d 1 four days after the rainfall as the dryness of the atmosphere is increased thereafter the overestimation remains high and unchanged until the next rainfall episode the small eto differences the days after rainfall are attributed to the high moisture of the surface soil layer which allow both surfaces bare soil and plant covered to evaporate with high rates the next four days the reducing soil moisture of the bare soil surface enhance the eto difference compared to the plant covered surface until the complete depletion of the available soil water of the soil surface upper layer which is accomplished in the fifth day thereafter there is no available water for evaporation and the eto difference becomes maximum and stable the present work highlights the need of representative weather data to be used for the reference evapotranspiration estimations which is an important issue also addressed by many researchers however the data from the hnms station used in this work and also data from similar weather stations operating above non ideal reference surfaces in the greek peninsula are used for eto estimations e g xystrakis and matzarakis 2011 mardikis et al 2005 kitsara et al 2013 e t c without taking into consideration the impact of the non ideal reference surfaces 4 conclusions the results of the present work indicate that the data derived from common meteorological stations operating above non standardized surfaces well watered short crops cannot produce accurate estimates of evapotranspiration and should be handled with caution by the researchers the higher air temperatures and lower relative humidity values recorded above bare soil substrates compared to the respective values above a well irrigated and covered with vegetation surface are the main reasons for the eto overestimation as result of the different energy budget of the two surfaces the effect of non standardized surfaces i e non green substrates with inadequate soil moisture can be somehow moderated by using appropriate methods for eto estimations the soil moisture of the upper soil layer the frequency of the rainfall events and the magnitudes of air temperature relative humidity water vapor deficit radiation and atmospheric clearness are among the factors that can enhance the eto overestimation due to their influence in determining the energy budget of the surface the eto differences above bare soil mainly overestimations vary according to the model each time adopted but the soil substrate effect can be detected by methods that take into consideration the energy balance of the surface such as fao56 pm in our study area which during the warm season is mainly covered by irrigated crops the use of temperature and relative humidity data from the airport weather station does not represent the climate regime of the broader area the use of such data results to high uncertainties and excessive errors in irrigation scheduling water resources management and climate change studies this work is a first attempt to quantify the effect of ground cover on the estimates of reference evapotranspiration and further research is necessary in order to have safe conclusions and propose specific methodologies to minimize the errors not only in the mediterranean region but worldwide future research will incorporate

10608,estimated reference evapotranspiration eto requires the meteorological attributes to be taken above standardized well watered and vegetation covered surfaces however worldwide such vegetation reference sites are not common this results in mistaken estimates of eto by using the well known and extensively applied fao 56 penman monteith formula consequently the use of inappropriate data for eto estimation from non ideal surfaces leads to significant and systematic cumulative errors introducing uncertainties when determining the crop water requirements in a region additionally the existing climatic stations are not spatially distributed but rather concentrated mostly in non rural urban areas or in local airports operating above non standardized surfaces the purpose of this work is to assess the effect of using daily meteorological data recorded above a well watered short crop compared to data obtained above dry bare soil at the same local environment using two widely used eto models the asce penman monteith and the hargreaves samani the results indicate that the meteorological conditions above the different surfaces are quite different presenting higher temperature and lower relative humidity values above the bare soil surface compared to the well watered short crop and resulting finally to errors in the estimation of reference evapotranspiration these errors appear to enhance as air temperature vapor pressure deficit radiation and atmospheric clearness increases or relative humidity decreases but are diminishing under adequate soil moisture conditions resulting after rainfall events the eto differences vary according to the model each time adopted but the soil substrate influence can be detected by more sophisticated methods such as fao56 pm which consider the energy balance of the surface keywords reference evapotranspiration eto penman monteith method hargreaves samani method bare soil evaporation vegetation covered surface 1 introduction the spatial and temporal variability of essential factors affecting reference evapotranspiration eto makes crucial the standardization of the surfaces on which the agrometeorological stations are established this variability creates difficulties in the use and accurate performance of the proposed eto estimation equations eto is based on potential evapotranspiration from grass or alfalfa crop which presupposes a continuous source of soil moisture and doesn t consider the summer plant dormancy the etp is defined by penman 1948 as the amount of water transpired in a given time by a short green crop completely shading the ground of uniform height and with adequate water status in the soil profile in 1977 fao proposed a methodology for computing crop evapotranspiration based in the use of reference evapotranspiration denoted as eto doorenboos and pruitt 1977 methodology that remains valid at the present day twenty one years later fao published a new manual for computing crop water requirements allen et al 1998 that reformulated the concept of reference evapotranspiration and espoused the penman monteith equation as a standardized method for eto estimation the main factors affecting the eto include solar radiation air temperature relative humidity and windspeed these parameters are related to the nature and properties of the surface above which the measurements are taken and they support the theoretical background of the most reliable model for reference evapotranspiration estimation the fao 56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 is widely used and considered as a benchmark method for estimating reference evapotranspiration eto walter et al 2000 it s data requirements however are high since the model demands air temperature relative humidity windspeed and solar radiation data the meteorological stations measuring these parameters worldwide are few and even fewer are the ones that produce reliable data droogers and allen 2002 allen et al 1994 gives clear definition of eto estimated by employing the penman monteith equation as the evapotranspiration above a specifically defined hypothetical reference crop which has height 0 12 m canopy resistance 70 s m 1 and albedo 0 23 choisnel et al 1992 mention that eto corresponds to the water consumed by an active grass lawn cover without restrictions in water availability or nutrients uptake and droogers and allen 2002 raise concerns on the eto estimates accuracy by using the penman monteith method under arid conditions since the meteorological data recorded are originating from dry environments with insufficient water supply while the eto should represent water demands above well irrigated soil surfaces in the same work the authors suggest the use of modified hargreaves formulas which take into account the monthly precipitation regarding that monthly precipitation represents relative levels of humidity instead of the penman monteith formula allen et al 2011 describe the common errors from the measurement systems and underline the importance of collecting and using good quality data for the estimation of eto addressing also the importance of the type of setting and the conditions from which the weather measurements are acquired the authors also state that in humid and semi humid climates the evapotranspiration is dominated more by net radiation availability than by aerodynamics and vapor deficit compared to arid or semi arid climates pereira et al 2015 address two main requirements for the application of the penman monteith eto equation that computation of the parameters follow standardized procedures as proposed in fao56 guidelines and that weather data are of good quality and represent weather conditions to be found over a green grass area consistent with the eto definition emphasizing to the weather data quality assessment and control they also mention that combination methods including the pm are sensitive to errors induced by not representative weather data suggesting that the data should be of good quality and representative of well watered conditions moreover pereira et al 2015 state that most eto equations for use with meteorological data collected primarily over and downwind of dense fully transpiring grass or similar vegetation exhibiting behavior similar to the definition of the reference surface condition suggesting that the weather stations should by centered within large surfaces with uniform vegetation supplied with sufficient water to support maximum evapotranspiration rates a station situated above a dry bare soil will measure higher temperature and correspondingly lower relative humidity values compared to a station on a well irrigated and vegetation covered site allen 1996 yoder et al 2000 as referred in the sitting section at the cimis network cimis water ca gov the placement of a weather station will affect the accuracy and reliability of the eto calculation for that surrounding area the absence of healthy green grass under a weather station can affect net radiation and humidity which will adversely affect eto similar findings are presented by eching et al 2002 giving also specific guidelines in placing weather stations in a recent work awal et al 2020 point out the potential uncertainties of eto estimates by the fao56 pm equation using weather data from non reference stations discussing also that many of the west texas mesonet stations do not meet the criteria of the reference surface for eto estimation the authors also mention that the use of such data may induce an increase in air temperature and a decrease in relative humidity respectively resulting in an overestimation of eto jensen et al 1997 underlines also that the use of relative humidity and air temperature data from non irrigated and inadequately irrigated sites may introduce a bias in the computed values for eto a similar conclusion has been drawn by temesgen et al 1999 suggesting that the use of weather data from sites which do not comply with the definition of reference may cause serious errors to eto estimates due to the elevated maximum and minimum air temperature and depressed dew point temperature values therefore the weather and the site conditions influence are incorporated in the estimation of the eto and adversely eto is a climatic parameter that expresses the evapotranspiration rate at a specific time and place above a standard vegetation covered and well watered reference site allen et al 1998 worldwide researchers have accepted the use of grass cool season grass blue grasses fescues and rye grasses and alfalfa medicago sativa as reference crops allen et al 2006 due to their adaptability to different climatic regimes and their biophysical similarity with many agricultural crops these reference crop surfaces are not just similar to hypothetical crop described by allen et al 1998 but they are adopted to simulate a common reference between different microclimatic conditions around the world and also produce accurate estimates of water requirements for different crops although the paper of allen et al 1998 has more than 19 000 citations in literature google scholar citations the number of scientists who point out the importance and significance of a standardized vegetation surface is quite limited the well known crop factor kc as well as the dual kc allen et al 2005 are the factors relating eto with the potential evapotranspiration rate for all stages of crop development and represent the influence of four key characteristics crop height reflectivity albedo bulk canopy resistance evaporation from bare soil which differentiate the specific crop from the reference crop at a given place today the need for irrigation water is usually defined through the assessment of reference evapotranspiration and requires the establishment of meteorological stations on standardized vegetation covered surfaces in the mediterranean such sites are rare due to the high installation and maintenance costs this leads to a systematic use of climatic data that are not properly measured resulting to accumulated errors not only in irrigation scheduling but also in the estimation of the energy balance at a region as discussed by temesgen et al 1999 the majority of the weather data around the globe is reported from non reference settings such as airports where sensors may even be on tops of buildings or at stations having dry bare soil surfaces and or concrete surfaces most et equations however were developed using weather data from research locations generally falling into the reference station category this paper aims to highlight and identify the influence of the characteristics of a non ideal surface e g bare soil in assessing the eto a comparative analysis and evaluation of the input parameters included in the estimation methods of eto and of the produced eto estimates for two surfaces bare soil and vegetation covered surface is presented in this paper additionally it is checked whether the aerodynamic adiabatic term of the equation of penman monteith varies under the influence of the different characteristics of the two surfaces 2 materials and

8 months and a dry period of 4 month as determined by the local pluvio thermic diagram derived from long time series of climatic data of the hnms station the mean annual temperature is 14 1 c presenting monthly variation from 5 1 c in january to 24 5 c in july annual precipitation is 780 6 mm with december being the wetter month 135 6 mm and july the dryer 19 9 mm at the years 2004 2005 and 2006 which are analyzed in the present work the precipitation regime was quite not uniform since the respective annual precipitation values were 434 3 mm 1075 1 mm and 505 6 mm respectively indicating year 2005 as relatively wet with annual rainfall 38 above the climatic average and years 2004 and 2006 as relatively dry with annual rainfall 44 and 35 respectively bellow the climatic

the net shortwave radiation and r n l the net longwave radiation rn which is estimated from the values of the total incoming shortwave radiation rs is different for the two stations due to different surface reflectivity albedo taken equal to 0 17 for the bare soil hnms and 0 23 for the short crop aua respectively the albedo value of 0 17 for the bare soil was measured during an independent experiment conducted in summer of 2008 doy 150 to 250 in the same site data not shown by installing an albedometer lppyra06 above the non irrigated bare soil thus 0 17 represents the real albedo above the non irrigated bare soil and its value was used for estimating rn as if a net radiometer was installed above the bare ground surface the reflectivity affects r n s while the variation of rnl is affected by the temperature and relative humidity conditions prevailing above the surfaces and it is expressed by the trend of actual water vapor ea above them the estimated values of evapotranspiration in the experimental field aua can be considered as very close to eto grass reference height 8 12 cm as the crop coefficient of potato canopy at the maximum growth stage is slightly around 1 0 i e 0 8 1 17 doorenboos and pruitt 1977 allen et al 1998 kashyap and panda 2001 jayanthi et al 2007 mokhtari et al 2019 therefore the maximum values obtained in the experimental field of aua can be considered as equal to the evapotranspiration rates obtained above a grass surface height 8 12 cm under adequate soil moisture conditions near to the field capacity additionally eto was also estimated according to hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 for comparison with the fao 56 pm method to assess its performance in cases that the lack of data makes it impossible to use the proposed penman monteith benchmark method the method eq 2 uses the diurnal temperature range t max t min t a v g and the extraterrestrial radiation r a expressed in mmd 1 2 e t o 0 0023 t max t min 0 5 t 17 8 r a the assessment of the accuracy of the models applied in both stations hnms and aua and the evaluation of the differences between the meteorological parameters were performed by using different statistical indices specifically intercepts b and slopes a of linear regressions were calculated along with commonly correlation measures as r2 however since fox 1981 and willmott 1982 suggest that such measures are often inappropriate or misleading when used to compare models the model efficiency ef by greenwood et al 1985 and the index of agreement d alternatively proposed by willmott and wicks 1980 and willmott 1981 1982 were also employed in this work additionally the mean bias error mbe the variance of differences distribution s d 2 the root mean square error rmse and the mean absolute error mae were estimated further information about the appropriate use of these indices can be found in the work of alexandris et al 2008 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparative analysis of the eto related parameters comparing the daily temperature and relative humidity values between the stations of aua and hnms appears that warmer and drier conditions persist above the bare ground of the hnms station compared to the well watered green surface of the aua station fig 2 this is attributed to the effect of soil moisture and vegetation cover allen et al 2000 underlines the importance of the environments associated with the weather stations that produce the weather data to be used for eto estimation stating that the local environment and general aridity of the area surrounding a weather station i e lack of transpiring vegetation can impact readings of air temperature and humidity in the present work we have shown that in a short distance only 2 4 km between the two sites the offset differences of the mean temperature trend lines are 4 4 4 2 and 2 6 c for the study periods of the years 2004 2005 and 2006 respectively fig 2 a great amount of the latent energy consumed by a surface for evaporation and or transpiration with a potential rate is allocated from the sensible heat of the overlaying to the surface air layer in the case of the bare soil substrate of the hnms station the low soil moisture or completely dry soil surface and the persistence of dry conditions in the overlying to the soil surface air layer results in energy allocation from the ground heat flux g attribute to the overlying to the soil s surface air layer this results to an additional increase of the thermal content of the air sensible heat flux above the dry surface as there is insufficient moisture in the soil to be spent in latent heat of evaporation this changes the daily thermal balance especially during the following 24 hours and becomes critical in warm periods santanello and friedl 2003 point out that the commonly used methods to parameterize soil heat flux g ignore the dependency of g on soil properties and the asymmetry in the diurnal variation the authors examined g as a function of rn for sparse cover and bare soil conditions focusing on patterns of diurnal variation as well as on the effects of soil moisture and soil type and found a strong correlation between g and rn and that the g to rn ratio tends to increase when evaporation starts to be limited due to soil conditions instead of the atmosphere it should be emphasized that another factor that changes the rate of evaporation is the soil texture of the surface layer for example unsaturated flow is interrupted where soil steeply changes from relatively fine to coarse due to the capillary water that is held tightly by the smaller pores of the finer textured layer and cannot move into the larger pores in the overlying coarse textured layer while the water vapor in the pores moves from one point to another within the soil in response to differences in vapor pressure the external ascending movement that occurs at the soil surface is likely to decrease significantly the average temperature and relative humidity values along with the related parameters for estimation of eto with the fao56 pm and the hargreaves samani methods for the two meteorological stations of aua and hnms during the measuring periods of the years 2004 2005 and 2006 are summarized in table 1 daily tavg measurements at the hnms station are higher compared to the aua station by 11 at the wetter and cooler year 2006 16 at the warmer and drier year 2005 and 15 the respective in 2004 tmin differences are even greater varying from 14 in 2005 to 22 in 2004 while for tmax are almost negligible from 0 to 3 this is attributed to the fact that high temperatures recorded during midday are related to higher wind speeds leading to a better mix of the air layers and more uniform temperature conditions on a spatial scale resulting finally to the minimization of the surface effect on temperature however during night or near dawn when tmin is achieved wind speed is lower and the proper air mix is prevented under such conditions the substrate surface can affect the temperature and the relative humidity values on the above to the surface air layers resulting to higher and lower values respectively above the vegetation covered and well watered surface compared to the bare soil the rhavg differences are varying from 4 in 2006 to 23 in 2005 or 25 in 2004 being almost identical during the cool and wet measuring period of 2006 also the dtr presents smaller values at the hnms station by 4 in 2005 to 14 in 2006 compared to the aua station indicating more evident diurnal temperature changes greater range of diurnal temperatures above the vegetation covered and well watered surface compared to the bare soil vpd is considered as essential factor for determining eto since it is depicting the virtual saturation of the atmosphere with water vapor fig 4 presents vpd regime formed above the bare soil compared to a vegetation covered surface with adequate soil moisture which transpires and evaporates at a maximum rate the relationship shows the hypothetical water demand of the atmosphere which is much more increased compared to the quantity required by a well watered short crop on average vpd is higher at the hnms station by percentages varying from 23 in 2006 to 73 in 2004 and 60 in2005 indicating a higher potential for water evaporation above the bare soil substrate which is enhanced under hot and dry conditions the air humidity potential expressed as es is also higher at the hnms station by 16 in 2006 to 22 in 2005 however actual air humidity ea differences are positive during 2006 11 but negative during the relatively hot and dry years 2004 11 and 2005 7 fig 3 3 2 evaluation of eto values and differences daily reference evapotranspiration eto estimated by fao56 pm and h s methods were analyzed for both hnms and aua stations the differences of the meteorological parameters presented above section 3 1 are incorporated in the eto estimates resulting to differences between the two case studies hnma and aua by reviewing the absolute eto values shown in fig 4 it is evident that regardless the method each time adopted eto at the aua station never exceeds 8 5 mm d 1 but there are many much greater values for the hnms station this is very important since the application of the recommended methodologies proposed by allen et al 1998 shouldn t give eto rates that exceeds 8 5 mm d 1 in areas within the mediterranean altitudes even under extreme temperature or radiation conditions alexandris 2003 alexandris et al 2006 the hnms data input recorded above bare soil in the fao56 pm formula results to a systematic overestimation of eto compared to the aua station data measured above an irrigated short crop as is clearly illustrated in fig 4 the comparison of eto estimated by fao56 pm between the two stations hnms vs aua present a linear correlation with high r2 values above 0 91 and rather stable slopes 1 45 on average varying from 1 43 in 2005 to 1 55 in 2004 and offsets 1 1 mm d 1 on average varying from 1 0 mm d 1 in 2004 to 1 4 mm d 1 in 2004 on the other hand the h s eto values correlations give quite similar values between the two stations with slight differences slopes varying from 0 9 in 2004 to 1 04 in 2006 and offsets from 0 3 mm d 1 in 2006 to 0 2 mm d 1 in 2004 despite the relatively large values dispersion r2 from 0 79 to 0 86 more specific quantitative statistical measures are presented in table 2 such patterns indicate that the fao56 pm method is more sensitive to detect the influence of the ground substrate characteristics compared to the h s this is attributed to the fact that fao56 pm expresses the energy balance of a surface in combination with its aerodynamic characteristics whereas h s is affected only by temperature parameters tavg and dtr in the second case the lower dtr values observed above bare soil cancel the effect of the higher tavg resulting to almost identical eto estimates between the two stations fig 4 the eto values with the h s method are quite close to the estimates by the fao56 pm for the hnms station as depicted in fig 5 this is somehow misleading when assessing the performance of different eto models using data above non standardized ground surfaces since errors induced by the use of such no proper data result to overestimations from the real eto values for all methods but also to diminished differences between them as clearly illustrated in fig 5 for all measuring years 2004 2005 2006 the cumulative eto curves show that h s method regardless station and fao56 pm in hnms show similar results the differences from the eto cumulative values with the fao56 pm in the aua station are significant with worst estimates for h s in hnms for the year 2004 134 mm for 99 days and 2005 116 mm for 116 days and fao56 pm in hnms for the year 2006 122 mm for 124 days the performance of the studied methods in the two sites compared to the daily eto estimates by fao56 pm applied in the aua station is presented in table 3 the fao56 pm method when applied above bare non irrigated soil present overestimation varying from 20 in the cooler wetter year 2006 to 23 6 or 25 6 in the warmer drier years 2004 and 2005 respectively regardless of the method the influence of the surface substrate is more evident during the warm dry years under cooler and wetter conditions h s appears to give more accurate estimates compared to fao56 pm at this point it should be mentioned that in most studies the use of inappropriate data above non standardized surfaces is often accompanied by the adoption of an albedo value of 0 23 this mistake upon mistake process seems to result to better estimates with the fao56 pm method in the case of hnms station s bare soil substrate since the overestimation appears to reduce to much smaller percentages 17 in 2004 15 in 2005 and 13 in 2006 if a false albedo of 0 23 is used instead of the 0 17 of a bare soil for assessing the effect of the ground substrate on the eto estimation the difference between eto values hnms aua at the two meteorological stations using the fao56 pm formula was examined with respect to the values of tavg rhavg vpd and rs grouped in appropriate bin classes also the influence of the atmospheric clearness kt and of the days number after rainfall were studied and the results are presented in fig 6 the eto difference hnms aua by employing the fao56 pm method appears to increase with tavg fig 6a and decrease with rhavg fig 6b indicating that under warm and dry weather conditions the influence of the bare soil substrate becomes more sound and the overestimation of eto is enhanced resulting to average daily differences of the order of 2 mm d 1 more evident is the effect of vpd e a e s a parameter that combines air temperature and relative humidity where the eto overestimation is even greater exceeding 2 mm d 1 at very high vpd values as shown in fig 4c however at low vpd and t and high rh values the eto overestimation can be considered negligible the magnitude of the incoming solar radiation which is the main energy attribute for eto and the atmospheric clearness kt rs ra appears to play also an essential role in determining the eto differences for the two case studies hnms and aua the days with overcast sky conditions kt below 0 3 see proutsos et al 2019 or diminished solar radiation flux densities rs correspond to negligible eto differences whereas at days with clear skies kt above 0 7 or high rs flux densities the eto overestimation becomes maximum exceeding on average 1 5 mm d 1 as shown in fig 6d and fig 6e the above mentioned indicate that the ground substrate influence is more evident under warm and dry atmospheric conditions with clear skies and increased incoming solar radiation fluxes under such conditions an irrigated plant covered surface can evaporate and transpire with a maximum rate since adequate soil moisture is available in the rootzone through these natural processes evaporation and transpiration the surface responds to the increased atmospheric demand for water vapor regulating the temperature and air humidity regime of the above to the surface air layer on the other hand a bare non irrigated soil surface under the same atmospheric conditions but with low water availability in the soil cannot sustain a high evaporative pace allowing the air temperature to increase and the humidity to decrease resulting to warmer and drier conditions prevailing in the air layer above the surface as discussed by quinn et al 2018 the evaporation rate depends on external meteorological conditions above the soil layer is noticeable that evaporation from bare soil is an important component of the soil water and energy balance especially in semi arid and arid locations there is comprehensive information about evapotranspiration for well watered crops allen et al 1998 jensen and allen 2016 but less information about bare soil evaporation quinn et al 2018 initially when the soil layer is wet it can supply water to the surface at an adequate rate for evaporation afterwards the evaporation rate decreases below the potential rate progressively since the underlying layer of the soil cannot adequately supply the surface layer with water because the water held tightly by the soil solids and because of the low water potential of the upper soil surface layer the difference in energy level of water from one depth to another between wet soil and dry soil determines not only the direction of movement but also the speed of the water movement no water content in an interphase layer of porous matrix leads to disruption of evaporation of the upper soil surface however the effect of the bare soil under warm and dry atmospheric conditions becomes minor after a rainfall event even at low precipitation magnitudes in fig 6f is depicted the average overestimation of eto at the hnms station compared to the aua against the number of days after a rainfall event the distribution indicates that immediately after rain the eto differences are small 0 4 mm d 1 on average increasing the following days and becoming maximum about 1 5 mm d 1 four days after the rainfall as the dryness of the atmosphere is increased thereafter the overestimation remains high and unchanged until the next rainfall episode the small eto differences the days after rainfall are attributed to the high moisture of the surface soil layer which allow both surfaces bare soil and plant covered to evaporate with high rates the next four days the reducing soil moisture of the bare soil surface enhance the eto difference compared to the plant covered surface until the complete depletion of the available soil water of the soil surface upper layer which is accomplished in the fifth day thereafter there is no available water for evaporation and the eto difference becomes maximum and stable the present work highlights the need of representative weather data to be used for the reference evapotranspiration estimations which is an important issue also addressed by many researchers however the data from the hnms station used in this work and also data from similar weather stations operating above non ideal reference surfaces in the greek peninsula are used for eto estimations e g xystrakis and matzarakis 2011 mardikis et al 2005 kitsara et al 2013 e t c without taking into consideration the impact of the non ideal reference surfaces 4 conclusions the results of the present work indicate that the data derived from common meteorological stations operating above non standardized surfaces well watered short crops cannot produce accurate estimates of evapotranspiration and should be handled with caution by the researchers the higher air temperatures and lower relative humidity values recorded above bare soil substrates compared to the respective values above a well irrigated and covered with vegetation surface are the main reasons for the eto overestimation as result of the different energy budget of the two surfaces the effect of non standardized surfaces i e non green substrates with inadequate soil moisture can be somehow moderated by using appropriate methods for eto estimations the soil moisture of the upper soil layer the frequency of the rainfall events and the magnitudes of air temperature relative humidity water vapor deficit radiation and atmospheric clearness are among the factors that can enhance the eto overestimation due to their influence in determining the energy budget of the surface the eto differences above bare soil mainly overestimations vary according to the model each time adopted but the soil substrate effect can be detected by methods that take into consideration the energy balance of the surface such as fao56 pm in our study area which during the warm season is mainly covered by irrigated crops the use of temperature and relative humidity data from the airport weather station does not represent the climate regime of the broader area the use of such data results to high uncertainties and excessive errors in irrigation scheduling water resources management and climate change studies this work is a first attempt to quantify the effect of ground cover on the estimates of reference evapotranspiration and further research is necessary in order to have safe conclusions and propose specific methodologies to minimize the errors not only in the mediterranean region but worldwide future research will incorporate

10609,east african region is susceptible to drought due to high variation in monthly precipitation studying drought at regional scale is vital since droughts are considered a creeping disaster by nature with devasting and extended impact often requiring long periods to reverse the recorded damages this study assessed drought exceedance and return years over east africa from 1920 to 2016 using climate research unit cru precipitation data records meteorological drought where precipitation is the central quantity of interest was adopted in the work standardize precipitation index spi was used to study long term meteorological droughts and also to assess drought magnitude frequency exceedance probability and return years using joint probability density function jpdf also mann kendall trend analysis was applied to precipitation and spi to investigate the trend changes results showed that years with high drought magnitude ranged from 1920 22 1926 29 1942 46 and 1947 51 with values corresponding to 2 2 3 2 3 4 and 2 6 respectively while years with low drought magnitude ranged from 1930 31 1988 89 and 2001 02 with values as 0 2 0 12 and 0 15 respectively the longest droughts occurred from 1926 29 1937 41 1942 46 1947 51 1952 56 and 1958 61 with values in years as 3 4 4 4 4 and 3 years respectively while the shortest droughts occurred in time period of 1 year and ranged from 1930 31 1964 65 1979 80 1981 82 1983 84 1988 89 1991 92 1993 94 1996 97 and 2001 02 also it was demonstrated that probability of drought occurrence is high when severity is low and such droughts occur at short time intervals and not all severest drought took longer periods the spi trends indicate high positive negative pixels above below the zero trend mark indicating that drought prevails in both low and high elevation areas up to 2000 m there was no direct link between enso and drought but arguably the association of drought in most el niño and la niña years suggests that the impact of enso cannot be ruled out since peak enso events occur during october to march periods which coincides with the short son and long mam rainy seasons of east africa the study is particularly relevant in being able to depict continuous and synoptic drought condition all over east africa providing vital information to farmers and policy makers using very cost effective method keywords meteorological drought joint probability density function jpdf spi enso drought risk mapping 1 introduction several studies indicate that droughts are among the most destructive natural disasters negatively impacting livelihoods including crops and livestock as well as other natural resources such as water ecology and biodiversity haroon et al 2016 lei et al 2016 schubert et al 2016 igbawua et al 2018 yao et al 2018 liu et al 2020 the american meteorological society 1997 categorizes droughts into meteorological agricultural and hydrological mainly on the basis of duration impact and recovery rate according to ghulam et al 2007a b and haroon et al 2016 meteorological drought refers to a sustained period of three months or more during which monthly precipitation remains well below the long term average agricultural drought occurs when there is an imbalance between water availability and demand in a farmland ecosystem where water demand by plants is more as compared to supply hydrological droughts occur when deficiencies in surface and subsurface water supplies become evident in terms of reduced stream flow and reduction in ground water for the purpose of this study however the assumption is that drought occurs when precipitation deficit exceeds some critical level beyond which the prevailing adaptive mechanisms fail to cope as defined by tarhule and woo 1997 the occurrence of drought has been recorded across all continents and under all climatic regions with low and high mean precipitation um et al 2017 with varying degree intensity impact and duration in recent decades the occurrence and incidence of drought has been aggravated with the increase in global climate change ipcc 2014 for africa o connor 1995 reported that remotely sensed data analysis from national aeronautics and space administration nasa reveal that about 900 000 km2 of previous savanna grassland in the african region had been severely degraded between the early 1960s and 1986 due to persistent occurrences of drought while bates et al 2008 estimated that one third of african population live in drought prone areas yang and huntingford 2018 revealed historical precipitation estimated by climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps funk et al 2015 shows that during august september and october aso of 2016 most of east africa particularly somalia ethiopia and kenya had a reduction of 40 or more in precipitation compared to a baseline aso period 1981 2015 several studies confirm that the east african region ranks among the most vulnerable drought prone regions of the world with a high potential for increased risk of drought related water and food shortages as recorded in as recent as year 2016 2017 love 2009 masih et al 2014 funk et al 2014 2015 yang and huntingford 2018 the threat of drought is expected to further aggravate the existing widespread poverty and food insecurity funk et al 2008 2013 2015 von grebmer et al 2016 the situation is similar within other regions of sub saharan africa in west africa dai et al 2004 reported that there is about 40 decline in annual precipitation total from the year 1968 1990 as compared with the 30 years between 1931 and 1960 thus frequent drought occurrences within the west african region have caused famine and are threatening the human existence in african savanna regions and consequently making the households highly vulnerable to drought eze 2018 droughts are considered a creeping disaster by nature with devasting and extended impact often requiring long periods to reverse the recorded damages it is therefore crucial that consistent drought monitoring is carried out to provide decisive policy support for long and medium term planning of mitigative measures typically at the turn of the 20th century scientific studies had adopted climatic temperature and precipitation and hydrological soil moisture and stream flow indicators as main input towards the generation of indices for quantitative modelling of drought severity kincer 1919 munger 1916 mcquigg 1954 waggoner and o connell 1956 however further advances in the study of drought beginning from the latter part of the 20th century into the 21st century led to the identification of over 150 indices used for drought studies niemeyer 2008 across various regions with different climatic conditions the most prominently adopted contemporary indices for drought research include but not limited to decile index di by gibbs and maher 1967 palmer drought severity index pdsi by palmer 1968 standardized

drought across the east african region the spi is considered most applicable for this study because it provides for drought analysis in multi temporal levels such as monthly single seasonal multi seasonal and annual basis this level of spatio temporal scale analysis allows for the spi to provide accurate meteorological and agricultural drought analysis 2 methodology 2 1 study area the study area covers eight countries consisting of ethiopia kenya rwanda uganda tanzania burundi somalia and south sudan fig 1 the climate of the region is influenced by a number of factors ranging from combination of the high altitude and the westerly monsoon winds that originate from the ethiopian highlands and rwenzori mountains generally majority of the region s countries experience two distinct precipitation regimes long rains which extend during march may mam and a season with short rains which lasts from october to december ond kalisa et al 2019 fig 1 shows that much of uganda and somalia are humid and arid respectively while much of ethiopia is semi arid and arid south sudan and tanzania are largely sub humid with kenya containing a vast area of aridity rwanda and burundi are largely tropical highlands the major livelihood sources include pastoralism and agro pastoralism rangeland cultivation small holder agriculture milk production and dairy products processing morton and kerven 2013 abbink et al 2014 2 2 data sets and methods the precipitation data set used in this work is the climate research unit cru data developed by university of east anglia the data was retrieved from http data ceda ac uk badc cru data cru ts cru ts 4 00 data at a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 degrees covering a temporal range of 1920 to 2015 the standardized precipitation index spi developed by mckee et al 1993 is a popular index that is used to characterize drought at different time scales spi is computed by fitting a gamma distribution function to precipitation data of given frequency distribution over an area and subsequently transforming the gamma distribution to a normal distribution with a mean and variance of zero 0 and one 1 respectively suryabhagavan 2016 the aim of doing this is to minimize skewness in the data to zero the gamma distribution is widely used to represent precipitation time series guttman 1999 the drought magnitude was obtained as the cumulative spi over the drought months taken as a positive value the intensity drought severity was computed as the magnitude divided by drought duration the general technique for detecting changes in precipitation and drought is trend analysis in this work trend analysis of precipitation and spi will reveal will reveal the trends in drought over east africa since the input parameter for spi computation is precipitation trend analysis of precipitation will be done in order to study the local changes in climate the mann kendall non parametric test was adopted in this work to assess the trends in precipitation and spi and also test the statistical distribution of the data records mann kendall was most preferred because it works well to avoid the problem caused by skewness of which precipitation is a kind of data that may be either negatively or positively skewed due to the existence of extreme values mahajan and dodaman 2015 2 2 1 spi in calculating spi we adopt methods by haroon et al 2016 and guttman 1999 and fit a probability distribution to long term monthly precipitation records the mean x standard deviation s and skew sk are determined as follows 1 m e a n x x n 2

and downward decreasing trends respectively in order to assess the spatio temporal occurrence of drought over east africa the 3 month 6 month and 12 month spi was used to study drought in the long term this period is enough for drought frequency and intensity assessment the spi was computed on monthly scale so that the consistency of drought duration and intensity can be determined according to table 1 from a statistical point of view droughts are considered as multivariate events whose dimension and treatment depends on their characteristics such as the duration severity and frequency gonzález and valdés 2004 most studies have proposed the joint probability distribution function jpdf for determining probabilistic characteristic because drought severity and duration are often

precipitation and precipitation anomaly over east africa from 1920 to 2015 the seasonal characterization of precipitation over the east african region fig 2 reveals that long precipitations occur during the period of march to may mam while short precipitations occur from the period of october to december ond the study analysis revealed that peak annual precipitation from 1920 to 2015 is recorded as 120 mm yr while average seasonal cumulative precipitation from 1920 to 2015 is about 920 mm yr crop production over east africa is highly dependent on the long rainy season which accounts for more than 70 of total annual precipitation it is therefore understandably that fluctuations in precipitation within this period is capable of altering and impacting food production across the region fig 3 shows precipitation anomalies from 1920 to 2015 positive and negative anomalies represent wet and dry conditions respectively over east africa based on the data used from 96 years from 1920 to 2015 there are a total of 41 wet years and 46 drought years the anomaly of the wet years and dry years were obtained when precipitation was above and below normal conditions respectively as seen in fig 3 the years 1961 1967 1997 2007 and 2015 are the wettest while 1943 1983 1993 1997 and 2003 are the driest the annual precipitation anomalies and the corresponding spi s for wet and dry years are presented in table 2 results show that both wet and drought spells coincide with positive and negative anomalies over east africa respectively this shows that the reason for the drought periods was as a result of unavailability of water in the soil the magnitude of anomaly of the wet years was higher than that of the dry years and both wet and dry years were obtained when precipitation was above and below normal conditions respectively a detailed inspection of dry and wet year results also revealed that the chances of occurrence of wet years are greater in comparison to dry years this information is important for the future planning and management of agricultural practices this work has allowed us to identify years within the region that are prone to dry wet conditions using available precipitation data records from 1920 to 2015 3 2 spatial and temporal representation of spatial spi over east africa fig 4 shows the spatial representation of spi for different hydrological years from 1920 to 2015 over east africa results show that fig 4a d and k recorded the highest precipitation while fig 4b e and h recorded the least precipitation it is critical to note that most of the regions that recorded the highest precipitation in some years also recorded the least in other years hence establishing the fact that precipitation across most of the east african region is fluctuating and drought is not peculiar to one region from fig 5 calculated spi at different time scales of 3 6 and 12 months indicated that for shorter time scales i e 3 months 6 months there was a high temporal variability in dry and wet periods whereas at longer time scales 12 months frequency of dry and wet periods were considerably decreased the drought magnitude drought duration and corresponding drought intensity were calculated over the study area table 3 and also fig 6 shows drought magnitude over east africa years with high drought magnitude ranged from 1922 22 1926 29 1942 46 and 1947 51 with values corresponding to 2 2 3 2 3 4 and 2 6 respectively while years with low drought magnitude ranged from 1930 31 1988 89 and 2001 02 with values as 0 2 0 12 and 0 15 respectively fig 7 shows drought duration in years over east africa with the longest droughts occurring from 1929 29 1937 41 1942 46 1947 51 1952 56 and 1958 61 with values in years as 3 4 4 4 4 and 3 years respectively while the shortest droughts occurred in time period of 1 year and ranged from 1930 31 1964 65 1979 80 1981 82 1983 84 1988 89 1991 92 1993 94 1996 97 and 2001 02 also see table 3 a comparison between fig 6 drought magnitude and fig 7 drought duration shows that not all the severest drought took longer and vice versa both drought magnitude and duration showed a negative slope of 0 071 and 0 086 respectively the drought magnitude was obtained as the cumulative spi over the drought months taken as a positive value the intensity drought severity was computed as the magnitude divided by drought duration among the droughts recorded the drought of 1937 41 1942 46 1947 51 1952 56 had the longest duration specifically the results indicated that on one hand the frequency of drought events were high at shorter time scales but lasted for shorter durations at longer time intervals and on the other hand droughts were less frequent but persisted for longer periods of time fig 8 shows the spatial map of drought magnitude across the east african region for different hydrological years the results show that the drought magnitude is highest in 1920 21 1950 51 1970 71 2000 01 and 2014 15 hydrological years in 1920 21 hydrological year regions that recorded high drought magnitude include south sudan uganda kenya rwanda burundi and eastern tanzania in 1950 51hydrological year drought magnitude was highest over ethiopia and south sudan in 1970 71 hydrological year drought magnitude was highest over south sudan ethiopia and somalia in 2000 01 hydrological year drought magnitude was highest in south sudan ethiopia somalia and kenya in 2014 15 hydrological year drought magnitude was highest in ethiopia and tanzania this indicated that besides seasonal variability of spatial drought magnitude there exist a strong variability of spatial drought magnitude across different decades 3 3 drought risk mapping and joint probability distribution function and return years of drought over east africa the spatial drought risk map was got from the spatial spi map and represented in fig 9 it shows the spatial drought levels over east africa across different decades and changes across the region s land mass suggested to be as a result of changes in climate and land cover there is high variability in drought across the decades over the region these droughts could be categorized as ranging from moderate to extreme with different durations and magnitudes nevertheless the total duration severity and magnitude of occurrence of the drought episodes varied from one location to another across the decades from fig 9 it appears as if drought repeats itself in some selected locations after a period of time but all droughts experienced in all locations and at all recorded periods appear to differ see fig 9a k drought may have similar magnitudes or duration but different levels of severity for example the droughts with magnitude duration in years of 1 5 4 3 4 4 2 6 4 and 2 0 4 lasted from 1937 to 1941 1942 1946 1947 1951 and 1952 1956 respectively see table 3 since both drought severity and durations have different distributions the joint probability distribution function jpdf given by eq 9 was used to obtain the probability density function and the joint return years were obtained using equation 10 the jpdf analysis is a useful multivariate tool needed for water resources management based on the drought characteristics duration and magnitude using the 12 month spi the jpdf was estimated as shown in fig 10 from fig 10 it shows that probability of drought occurrence is high when severity is low and such droughts occur at short time intervals also it takes so many years for a severe drought to repeat itself at short time intervals once the jpdf for the bivariate return periods of drought was calculated the drought severity duration frequency curve of east africa was created fig 11 fig 11 is a bivariate analysis of drought severity for east africa region showing return periods and different levels of severity drought severity itself is a function of the different drivers of drought over particular area drought severity characterizes drought magnitude of dry events the jpdf drought based curves were developed for selected recurrence severity levels of 5 10 20 30 40 and 50 years are plotted in fig 11 it is observed that for any given duration severe droughts have more return periods table 4 shows the drought occurrence over east african countries the result shows that the drought mechanism is complex and the drivers highly depend on the local environmental conditions prevailing in a particular country all drought episodes are associated with negative precipitation anomalies low precipitation values closely matching the spi values the spi values depicting drought levels shown in table 1 are applied to reveal the varying levels of drought experienced over specific countries in east africa over the study period the spatial and temporal variability in drought trends is observed in the study area and shown in table 5 as the negative and positive spi trends at multiple time scales across the east african countries of all the spi models tested only spi 12 indicated significant trend values in burundi rwanda and uganda with sen s slope kendal tau values of 0 008 0 143 0 007 0 144 and 0 008 0 149 respectively basically the spi 12 shows the status of year round water shortage caused by drought while spi 6 and spi 3 are appropriate indicators of the status of seasonal water shortage caused by drought tan et al 2015 table 6 shows negative and positive precipitation trends at multiple time scales over east african countries out of eight countries precipitation shows significant positive insignificant positive trends over 1 4 countries and significant insignificant negative trends over 1 2 countries from 1920 to 2015 3 4 spatial trends in drought across east africa fig 12 shows the spatial trend of spi over east africa the approach involves running an ordinary linear regression model to the spi maps generated results show that about 28 22 and 50 of the spi indicated spatial increase no change and decrease in spi trends respectively over the study area from 1920 to 2015 increase decrease of spi trends by our analysis means an increase decrease in moisture conditions corresponding to decrease increase in drought prevalence assessing the mean spi drought characteristics over the region indicates that there were some notable variations in spi consistent with the distribution of precipitation areas with increase in spi were located northeast along the shores of the indian ocean and some few areas in the central part of the study area areas with no trend changes in spi were located in northwest northeast southeast parts of east africa and close to the shores of the ocean also areas with decreasing spi trend pixels were located around in the northwest northeast and southwest and along the shores of the study area the 96 year precipitation records in areas with spatial increase in spi trend were 11 3 136 5 77 3 and 26 5 mm for minimum maximum mean and standard deviation values respectively while the precipitation records in areas with spatial decrease in spi were 539 138 3 56 1 and 29 7 for minimum maximum mean and standard deviation values respectively for areas with no spatial trend changes in spi were 7 2 161 6 93 2 and 31 9 for minimum maximum mean and standard deviation values respectively areas with improvement in drought indicated the low precipitation standard deviation our result confirms that areas with no spi changes in drought were wetter from 1920 to 2015 fig 13 a shows the spatial slope of spi versus latitudes degrees results indicate that high of spi slope are clustered at higher latitudes from latitude 0 to 12 while low trend values are clustered between latitude 2 and 2 south of the study region which is an indication that drought is prevalent in the northern section than southern section of the study area fig 13b shows spi slope versus dem where both high and low slope values of spi are clustered at lower latitudes between 0 1500 m and at the foot hills of mountains the histogram of the spi trends is shown in fig 13c it can be observed that most of the spi trends are clustered around the 0 0 mark which shows that the density curve of the pixels is symmetrical and centered about its mean the spi trends indicate high positive negative pixels above below the zero trend mark implying that drought prevails in both low and high elevation areas up to 2000 m 3 5 enso drought relationship drought is considered as one of the most complex and deleterious natural with severe impacts on natural ecosystems water resources and food security tan et al 2015 in this study we selected the el niño neutral and la niña years based on data from sea surface temperature sst anomalies of the tropical indian ocean in the region 0 5 c and 0 5 c also known as the niño 3 4 region the gridded extended reconstructed sea surface temperature version 4 ersstv4 temperature data was used to study the enso events we considered el niño la niña years as years with average sst anomalies above below temperature values of 0 5 c 0 5 c from october to march the october to march period typically coincides with peak enso conditions neutral years if the sst values are within 0 5 c sst 0 5 c as shown in fig 14 the spi values in neutral el niño and la niña years were studied over east africa from 1920 to 2015 the mean drought characteristics magnitude duration and even the dispersion of drought magnitude in spi 3 spi 6 and spi 12 are very similar in el niño and la niña events while the neutral years presented high dispersion in both drought magnitude and duration fig 15 results shown on fig 15a indicate that the mean drought duration during el niño years were less than 1 5 years while the mean drought duration during neutral la niña years was 3 4 years fig 15b and c in this study there is no direct link between enso and drought over the east african region but the association of drought in most el niño and la niña years suggests that the impact of enso cannot be ruled out our results have supported reports that present teleconnections between drought and enso previous reports have shown that enso events normally peak during october to march periods which coincides with the short son and long mam rainy seasons of east africa this period coincides with the son and mam seasons and increased precipitation in east africa considering the major drought episodes over the east africa our analysis has only agreed with the major droughts of 2011 12 based on our results 2011 12 was captured as an el niño year with drought magnitudes captured by spi 3 and spi 6 as 2 8 and 0 5 respectively with drought duration of 3 and 6 months respectively the drought episode of 2011 12 affected countries like somalia uganda kenya ethiopia south sudan and other nearby countries 3 6 discussion generally the actual precipitation expressed as a percentage deviation from normal or long term average is the most commonly used drought indicator although it has limited use reliability for spatial comparison due to its dependence on the mean kumar et al 2009 according to solanki and parekk 2014 the spi represents a departure from the mean and is thus expressed in standard deviation units as a normalized index in time and space the departure from the mean is a probability indication of the severity of the wetness or drought that can be used for risk assessment the application of data from 1920 in this study is considered most desirable as long records provide more reliable statistics for spi given that it is a statistical approach as a result spi has gained importance in recent years as a potential drought indicator permitting comparisons across different precipitation zones kumar et al 2009 solanki and parekk 2014 this study analyzed spi values between 1920 and 2016 with actual precipitation and precipitation deviation from normal in east africa a generally low precipitation and drought prone region the objective is to establish whether or not spi can be used as a suitable indicator when compared to conventionally adopted precipitation deviation based approach for drought intensity assessment over an extended region such as east africa the results of the analysis show that very low or very high precipitation corresponded to very low or very high spi values thus spi values adequately estimated the dryness or wetness when the precipitation is very low or very high respectively table 2 shows that all periods that experienced dry spells or drought recorded low negative anomaly and spi values with the periods 1942 1943 recording the driest 1 7 followed by 1983 1984 1 6 similarly the periods of wet spells reveal positive anomaly and spi values with the wettest period being 2014 2015 the outcome of this study is in line with the spi classes proposed by mckee et al 1993 however there is a marked variation between drought characteristics of magnitude duration and intensity when viewed against temporal scales in essence no time scale recorded the highest in all 3 drought characteristics throughout the 95 year period of analysis table 3 this is similar to the observation of spi at different time scales of 3 6 and 12 months which reveal that for shorter time scales there was a high temporal variability in dry and wet periods whereas at longer time scales 12 months frequency of dry and wet periods were considerably decreased fig 5 the results of this study indicate that drought characteristics analysis magnitude duration and intensity using spi can be adequately applied for drought intensity assessment particularly in regions such as east africa where low precipitation and vulnerability to droughts is prevalent the precipitation anomalies table 4 mann kendall trend and significance level of spi 3 spi 6 and spi 12 table 5 and mann kendall trend and significance level of precipitation table 6 reveal varying results both temporally and spatially across the eight countries comprising the east african region covered in this study for instance the same drought level spi may be prevalent in a country but the precipitation anomaly values may differ table 4 the drought of 1942 43 was worst hit in countries like burundi rwanda ethiopia uganda and south sudan from 1983 84 ethiopia kenya somalia uganda and south sudan experienced the worst drought episodes also from 1991 92 ethiopia kenya and somalia experienced worst drought spells while in 1996 97 the highest effect was observed in ethiopia table 5 reveals that out of eight countries spi 12 detects significant positive insignificant positive trend over 3 2 countries and insignificant negative trends over 3 countries spi 6 detects insignificant positive trend over 6 countries and insignificant negative trend over 2 countries spi 3 detects insignificant positive trends over 5 countries while insignificant negative trends in 3 stations at regional continental scale there was no significant trend in spi 3 spi 6 or spi 12 the results in table 6 show that most countries experience oscillations between wet and dry conditions while few countries are getting wetter with few others getting more arid at regional continental scale there was no significant trend in precipitation there was no significant change in precipitation in annual rainy seasons during the study period as no annual trend was observed in the precipitation amount we applied spi to study precipitation address potential changes in precipitation extremes there is expected to be some time lag due to the unique vegetation types which according to abbas et al 2014 should have different capacity of water storage the humid area covering most of uganda as shown on fig 1 with predominantly tall and dense forests are expected to have a longest time lag because according to allen 2008 forests possess the best capacity of water retention with deeper roots to tap groundwater conversely arid and semi arid areas such as kenya somalia and ethiopia are covered mostly by grasses and should have shorter time lag due to the lower capacity of water retention for grasses south sudan and a significant area of tanzania are sub humid areas largely covered by crops generally the water storage capacity of crops is likely similar to or even lower than that of grasses and grünzweig et al 2015 posits that artificial irrigation could alter the time lag for regions engaged in irrigation agriculture it is therefore expected that semi arid areas should have a time lag similar to or longer than arid areas cong et al 2017 this pattern is largely similar to the outcome of the study as shown on tables 4 6 and figs 4 8 and 9 4 conclusions in this study the spi approach applied to this study adequately explained the drought conditions across the east african region between 1920 and 2015 the drought characteristics of magnitude duration and intensity collectively explained the severity levels of drought within the study area it is expected that the outcome of this study could be applied elsewhere in sub saharan africa where precipitation is limited and likelihood of drought is high the result from the 96 years from 1920 to 2015 data records shows that there are a total of 41 wet years and 46 drought years the anomaly of the wet years and dry years were obtained when precipitation was above and below normal conditions respectively the years 1961 1967 1997 2007 and 2015 were adjudged the wettest while 1943 1983 1993 1997 and 2003 were adjudged the driest both the positive and negative peak of spi coincided with the positive and negative anomaly peaks respectively the computed spi at different time scales of 3 6 and 12 months indicated that for shorter time scales there was high temporal variability in dry and wet periods whereas at longer time scales 12 months frequency of dry and wet periods were considerably decreased years with high drought magnitude ranged from 1920 22 1926 29 1942 46 and 1947 51 with spi values corresponding to 2 2 3 2 3 4 and 2 6 respectively while years with low drought magnitude ranged from 1930 31 1988 89 and 2001 02 with values as 0 2 0 12 and 0 15 respectively the longest droughts occurred from 1929 29 1937 41 1942 46 1947 51 1952 56 and 1958 61 with values in years as 3 4 4 4 4 and 3 years respectively while the shortest droughts occurred in time period of 1 year and ranged from 1930 31 1964 65 1979 80 1981 82 1983 84 1988 89 1991 92 1993 94 1996 97 and 2001 02 our study also indicated that high values of spi slope are clustered at higher latitudes from 0 to 12 while low trend values are clustered between 2 and 2 south of the study region which is an indication that drought is prevalence in the northern section than southern section of the study area both high and low slope values of spi are clustered at lower latitudes between 0 1500 meters and at the foot hills of mountains the spi trends showed high positive negative pixels above below the zero trend mark indicating that drought prevails in both low and high elevation areas up to 2000 m in terms of enso impacts on drought over the region the mean characteristics magnitude duration and even the dispersion of drought magnitude in spi 3 spi 6 and spi 12 are very similar in el niño and la niña years while the neutral years presented high dispersion in both drought magnitude and duration the mean drought duration during el niño years were less than 1 5 years while the mean drought duration during neutral la niña years was 3 4 years which suggest that there is no direct link between enso and drought over the east african region but the association of drought in most el niño and la niña years suggests that the impact of enso cannot be ruled out since peak enso events occur during october to march periods which coincides with the short son and long mam rainy seasons of east africa furthermore the outcome of this study indicates that spi can be reliably suitable and most applicable in drought studies within the study area as it provides for analysis in multi temporal levels such as monthly single seasonal multi seasonal and annual droughts thereby allowing for a spatio temporal scale of analysis that creates the room for spi to provide accurate meteorological and agricultural drought analysis to this extent the study provides policy makers the necessary information that is critical to local adaptation increased resilience and mitigation measures in the face of a vulnerable eco climatic system triggered by a continuously changing climate within east africa as well as other parts of sub saharan africa our study is particularly relevant in its ability to depict continuous and synoptic drought conditions all over east africa providing vital information to farmers and policy makers using very cost effective method this is particularly the case in view of the assertion by karavitis et al 2011 that effective and reliable information and early warning systems based on indicators such as the spi are the foundation for overall effective drought adaptation and resilience plans finally the adoption of spi for this study demonstrates the fact that it is a robust concept unambiguous in calculation and understanding temporally flexible spatially meaningful and widely applicable a basis for which it is considered a powerful tool for drought studies as clearly amplified by cheval 2015 declaration of competing interest we declare that we do not have any commercial or

10609,east african region is susceptible to drought due to high variation in monthly precipitation studying drought at regional scale is vital since droughts are considered a creeping disaster by nature with devasting and extended impact often requiring long periods to reverse the recorded damages this study assessed drought exceedance and return years over east africa from 1920 to 2016 using climate research unit cru precipitation data records meteorological drought where precipitation is the central quantity of interest was adopted in the work standardize precipitation index spi was used to study long term meteorological droughts and also to assess drought magnitude frequency exceedance probability and return years using joint probability density function jpdf also mann kendall trend analysis was applied to precipitation and spi to investigate the trend changes results showed that years with high drought magnitude ranged from 1920 22 1926 29 1942 46 and 1947 51 with values corresponding to 2 2 3 2 3 4 and 2 6 respectively while years with low drought magnitude ranged from 1930 31 1988 89 and 2001 02 with values as 0 2 0 12 and 0 15 respectively the longest droughts occurred from 1926 29 1937 41 1942 46 1947 51 1952 56 and 1958 61 with values in years as 3 4 4 4 4 and 3 years respectively while the shortest droughts occurred in time period of 1 year and ranged from 1930 31 1964 65 1979 80 1981 82 1983 84 1988 89 1991 92 1993 94 1996 97 and 2001 02 also it was demonstrated that probability of drought occurrence is high when severity is low and such droughts occur at short time intervals and not all severest drought took longer periods the spi trends indicate high positive negative pixels above below the zero trend mark indicating that drought prevails in both low and high elevation areas up to 2000 m there was no direct link between enso and drought but arguably the association of drought in most el niño and la niña years suggests that the impact of enso cannot be ruled out since peak enso events occur during october to march periods which coincides with the short son and long mam rainy seasons of east africa the study is particularly relevant in

drought joint probability density function jpdf spi enso drought risk mapping 1 introduction several studies indicate that droughts are among the most destructive natural disasters negatively impacting livelihoods including crops and livestock as well as other natural resources such as water ecology and biodiversity haroon et al 2016 lei et al 2016 schubert et al 2016 igbawua et al 2018 yao et al 2018 liu et al 2020 the american meteorological society 1997 categorizes droughts into meteorological agricultural and hydrological mainly on the basis of duration impact and recovery rate according to ghulam et al 2007a b and haroon et al 2016 meteorological drought refers to a sustained period of three months or more during which monthly precipitation remains well below the long term average agricultural drought occurs when there is an imbalance between water availability and demand in a farmland ecosystem where water demand by plants is more as compared to supply hydrological droughts occur when deficiencies in surface and subsurface water supplies become evident in terms of reduced stream flow and reduction in ground water for the purpose of this study however the assumption is that drought occurs when precipitation deficit exceeds some critical level beyond which the prevailing adaptive mechanisms fail to cope as defined by tarhule and woo 1997 the occurrence of drought has been recorded across all continents and under all climatic regions with low and high mean precipitation um et al 2017 with varying degree intensity impact and duration in recent decades the occurrence and incidence of drought has been aggravated with the increase in global climate change ipcc 2014 for africa o connor 1995 reported that remotely sensed data analysis from national aeronautics and space administration nasa reveal that about 900 000 km2 of previous savanna grassland in the african region had been severely degraded between the early 1960s and 1986 due to persistent occurrences of drought while bates et al 2008 estimated that one third of african population live in drought prone areas yang and huntingford 2018 revealed historical precipitation estimated by climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps funk et al 2015 shows that during august september and october aso of 2016 most of east africa particularly somalia ethiopia and kenya had a reduction of 40 or more in precipitation compared to a baseline aso period 1981 2015 several studies confirm that the east african region ranks among the most vulnerable drought prone regions of the world with a high potential for increased risk of drought related water and food shortages as recorded in as recent as year 2016 2017 love 2009 masih et al 2014 funk et al 2014 2015 yang and huntingford 2018 the threat of drought is expected to further aggravate the existing widespread poverty and food insecurity funk et al 2008 2013 2015 von grebmer et al 2016 the situation is similar within other regions of sub saharan africa in west africa dai et al 2004 reported that there is about 40 decline in annual precipitation total from the year 1968 1990 as compared with the 30 years between 1931 and 1960 thus frequent drought occurrences within the west african region have caused famine and are threatening the human existence in african savanna regions and consequently making the households highly vulnerable to drought eze 2018 droughts are considered a creeping disaster by nature with devasting and extended impact often requiring long periods to reverse the recorded damages it is therefore crucial that consistent drought monitoring is carried out to provide decisive policy support for long and medium term planning of mitigative measures typically at the turn of the 20th century scientific studies had adopted climatic temperature and precipitation and hydrological soil moisture and stream flow indicators as main input towards the generation of indices for quantitative modelling of drought severity kincer 1919 munger 1916 mcquigg 1954 waggoner and o connell 1956 however further advances in the study of drought beginning from the latter part of the 20th century into the 21st century led to the identification of over 150 indices used for drought studies niemeyer 2008 across various regions with different climatic conditions the most prominently adopted contemporary indices for drought research include but not limited to decile index di by gibbs and maher 1967 palmer drought severity index pdsi by palmer 1968 standardized precipitation index spi applied by mckee et al 1993 reclamation drought index rdi by weghorst 1996 us drought monitor usdm applied by svoboda et al 2002 optimized meteorological and vegetation drought indices omdi and ovdi proposed by hao et al 2015 composite drought indices using multivariable linear regression mcdis developed by liu et al 2020 recent drought studies have relied on the availability of data from different remote sensing platforms due largely to the synoptic coverage it provides for analysis over a wide region numerous methods have been developed for the application of remotely sensed data in drought studies these include normalized difference vegetation index ndvi based conceptualization such as vegetation condition index vci kogan 1995 enhanced vegetation index

perpendicular drought index pdi ghulam et al 2007a modified perpendicular drought index mpdi ghulam et al 2007b effective drought index edi yao et al 2010 and drought severity index dsi proposed by mu et al 2013 and applied by haroon et al 2016 for the purpose of this study the spi proposed by mckee et al 1993 and applied in indonesia by pramudya and onishi 2018 will be adopted for the analysis of drought across the east african region the spi is considered most applicable for this study because it provides for drought analysis in multi temporal levels such as monthly single seasonal multi seasonal and annual basis this level of spatio temporal scale analysis allows for the spi to provide accurate meteorological and agricultural drought analysis 2 methodology 2 1 study area the study area covers eight countries consisting of ethiopia kenya rwanda uganda tanzania burundi somalia and south sudan fig 1 the climate of the region is influenced by a number of factors ranging from combination of the high altitude and the westerly monsoon winds that originate from the ethiopian highlands and rwenzori mountains generally majority of the region s countries experience two distinct precipitation regimes long rains which extend during march may mam and a season with short rains which lasts from october to december ond kalisa et al 2019 fig 1 shows that much of uganda and somalia are humid and arid respectively while much of ethiopia is semi arid and arid south sudan and tanzania are largely sub humid with kenya containing a vast area of aridity rwanda and burundi are largely tropical highlands the major livelihood sources include pastoralism and agro pastoralism rangeland cultivation small holder agriculture milk production and dairy products processing morton and kerven 2013 abbink et al 2014 2 2 data sets and methods the precipitation data set used in this work is the climate research unit cru data developed by university of east anglia the data was retrieved from http data ceda ac uk badc cru data cru ts cru ts 4 00 data at a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 degrees covering a temporal range of 1920 to 2015 the standardized precipitation index spi developed by mckee et al 1993 is a popular index that is used to characterize drought at different time scales spi is computed by fitting a gamma distribution function to precipitation data of given frequency distribution over an area and subsequently transforming the gamma distribution to a normal distribution with a mean and variance of zero 0 and one 1 respectively suryabhagavan 2016 the aim of doing this is to minimize skewness in the data to zero the gamma distribution is widely used to represent precipitation time series guttman 1999 the drought magnitude was obtained as the cumulative spi over the drought months taken as a positive value the intensity drought severity was computed as the magnitude divided by drought duration the general technique for detecting changes in precipitation and drought is trend analysis in this work trend analysis of precipitation and spi will reveal will reveal the trends in drought over east africa since the input parameter for spi computation is precipitation trend analysis of precipitation will be done in order to study the local changes in climate the mann kendall non parametric test was adopted in this work to assess the trends in precipitation and spi and also test the statistical distribution of the data records mann kendall was most preferred because it works well to avoid the problem caused by skewness of which precipitation is a kind of data that may be either negatively or positively skewed due to the existence of extreme values mahajan and dodaman 2015 2 2 1 spi in calculating spi we adopt methods by haroon et al 2016 and guttman 1999 and fit a probability distribution to long term monthly precipitation records the mean x standard deviation s and skew sk are determined as follows 1 m e a n x x n 2

and downward decreasing trends respectively in order to assess the spatio temporal occurrence of drought over east africa the 3 month 6 month and 12 month spi was used to study drought in the long term this period is enough for drought frequency and intensity assessment the spi was computed on monthly scale so that the consistency of drought duration and intensity can be determined according to table 1 from a statistical point of view droughts are considered as multivariate events whose dimension and treatment depends on their characteristics such as the duration severity and frequency gonzález and valdés 2004 most studies have proposed the joint probability distribution function jpdf for determining probabilistic characteristic because drought severity and duration are often

precipitation and precipitation anomaly over east africa from 1920 to 2015 the seasonal characterization of precipitation over the east african region fig 2 reveals that long precipitations occur during the period of march to may mam while short precipitations occur from the period of october to december ond the study analysis revealed that peak annual precipitation from 1920 to 2015 is recorded as 120 mm yr while average seasonal cumulative precipitation from 1920 to 2015 is about 920 mm yr crop production over east africa is highly dependent on the long rainy season which accounts for more than 70 of total annual precipitation it is therefore understandably that fluctuations in precipitation within this period is capable of altering and impacting food production across the region fig 3 shows precipitation anomalies from 1920 to 2015 positive and negative anomalies represent wet and dry conditions respectively over east africa based on the data used from 96 years from 1920 to 2015 there are a total of 41 wet years and 46 drought years the anomaly of the wet years and dry years were obtained when precipitation was above and below normal conditions respectively as seen in fig 3 the years 1961 1967 1997 2007 and 2015 are the wettest while 1943 1983 1993 1997 and 2003 are the driest the annual precipitation anomalies and the corresponding spi s for wet and dry years are presented in table 2 results show that both wet and drought spells coincide with positive and negative anomalies over east africa respectively this shows that the reason for the drought periods was as a result of unavailability of water in the soil the magnitude of anomaly of the wet years was higher than that of the dry years and both wet and dry years were obtained when precipitation was above and below normal conditions respectively a detailed inspection of dry and wet year results also revealed that the chances of occurrence of wet years are greater in comparison to dry years this information is important for the future planning and management of agricultural practices this work has allowed us to identify years within the region that are prone to dry wet conditions using available precipitation data records from 1920 to 2015 3 2 spatial and temporal representation of spatial spi over east africa fig 4 shows the spatial representation of spi for different hydrological years from 1920 to 2015 over east africa results show that fig 4a d and k recorded the highest precipitation while fig 4b e and h recorded the least precipitation it is critical to note that most of the regions that recorded the highest precipitation in some years also recorded the least in other years hence establishing the fact that precipitation across most of the east african region is fluctuating and drought is not peculiar to one region from fig 5 calculated spi at different time scales of 3 6 and 12 months indicated that for shorter time scales i e 3 months 6 months there was a high temporal variability in dry and wet periods whereas at longer time scales 12 months frequency of dry and wet periods were considerably decreased the drought magnitude drought duration and corresponding drought intensity were calculated over the study area table 3 and also fig 6 shows drought magnitude over east africa years with high drought magnitude ranged from 1922 22 1926 29 1942 46 and 1947 51 with values corresponding to 2 2 3 2 3 4 and 2 6 respectively while years with low drought magnitude ranged from 1930 31 1988 89 and 2001 02 with values as 0 2 0 12 and 0 15 respectively fig 7 shows drought duration in years over east africa with the longest droughts occurring from 1929 29 1937 41 1942 46 1947 51 1952 56 and 1958 61 with values in years as 3 4 4 4 4 and 3 years respectively while the shortest droughts occurred in time period of 1 year and ranged from 1930 31 1964 65 1979 80 1981 82 1983 84 1988 89 1991 92 1993 94 1996 97 and 2001 02 also see table 3 a comparison between fig 6 drought magnitude and fig 7 drought duration shows that not all the severest drought took longer and vice versa both drought magnitude and duration showed a negative slope of 0 071 and 0 086 respectively the drought magnitude was obtained as the cumulative spi over the drought months taken as a positive value the intensity drought severity was computed as the magnitude divided by drought duration among the droughts recorded the drought of 1937 41 1942 46 1947 51 1952 56 had the longest duration specifically the results indicated that on one hand the frequency of drought events were high at shorter time scales but lasted for shorter durations at longer time intervals and on the other hand droughts were less frequent but persisted for longer periods of time fig 8 shows the spatial map of drought magnitude across the east african region for different hydrological years the results show that the drought magnitude is highest in 1920 21 1950 51 1970 71 2000 01 and 2014 15 hydrological years in 1920 21 hydrological year regions that recorded high drought magnitude include south sudan uganda kenya rwanda burundi and eastern tanzania in 1950 51hydrological year drought magnitude was highest over ethiopia and south sudan in 1970 71 hydrological year drought magnitude was highest over south sudan ethiopia and somalia in 2000 01 hydrological year drought magnitude was highest in south sudan ethiopia somalia and kenya in 2014 15 hydrological year drought magnitude was highest in ethiopia and tanzania this indicated that besides seasonal variability of spatial drought magnitude there exist a strong variability of spatial drought magnitude across different decades 3 3 drought risk mapping and joint probability distribution function and return years of drought over east africa the spatial drought risk map was got from the spatial spi map and represented in fig 9 it shows the spatial drought levels over east africa across different decades and changes across the region s land mass suggested to be as a result of changes in climate and land cover there is high variability in drought across the decades over the region these droughts could be categorized as ranging from moderate to extreme with different durations and magnitudes nevertheless the total duration severity and magnitude of occurrence of the drought episodes varied from one location to another across the decades from fig 9 it appears as if drought repeats itself in some selected locations after a period of time but all droughts experienced in all locations and at all recorded periods appear to differ see fig 9a k drought may have similar magnitudes or duration but different levels of severity for example the droughts with magnitude duration in years of 1 5 4 3 4 4 2 6 4 and 2 0 4 lasted from 1937 to 1941 1942 1946 1947 1951 and 1952 1956 respectively see table 3 since both drought severity and durations have different distributions the joint probability distribution function jpdf given by eq 9 was used to obtain the probability density function and the joint return years were obtained using equation 10 the jpdf analysis is a useful multivariate tool needed for water resources management based on the drought characteristics duration and magnitude using the 12 month spi the jpdf was estimated as shown in fig 10 from fig 10 it shows that probability of drought occurrence is high when severity is low and such droughts occur at short time intervals also it takes so many years for a severe drought to repeat itself at short time intervals once the jpdf for the bivariate return periods of drought was calculated the drought severity duration frequency curve of east africa was created fig 11 fig 11 is a bivariate analysis of drought severity for east africa region showing return periods and different levels of severity drought severity itself is a function of the different drivers of drought over particular area drought severity characterizes drought magnitude of dry events the jpdf drought based curves were developed for selected recurrence severity levels of 5 10 20 30 40 and 50 years are plotted in fig 11 it is observed that for any given duration severe droughts have more return periods table 4 shows the drought occurrence over east african countries the result shows that the drought mechanism is complex and the drivers highly depend on the local environmental conditions prevailing in a particular country all drought episodes are associated with negative precipitation anomalies low precipitation values closely matching the spi values the spi values depicting drought levels shown in table 1 are applied to reveal the varying levels of drought experienced over specific countries in east africa over the study period the spatial and temporal variability in drought trends is observed in the study area and shown in table 5 as the negative and positive spi trends at multiple time scales across the east african countries of all the spi models tested only spi 12 indicated significant trend values in burundi rwanda and uganda with sen s slope kendal tau values of 0 008 0 143 0 007 0 144 and 0 008 0 149 respectively basically the spi 12 shows the status of year round water shortage caused by drought while spi 6 and spi 3 are appropriate indicators of the status of seasonal water shortage caused by drought tan et al 2015 table 6 shows negative and positive precipitation trends at multiple time scales over east african countries out of eight countries precipitation shows significant positive insignificant positive trends over 1 4 countries and significant insignificant negative trends over 1 2 countries from 1920 to 2015 3 4 spatial trends in drought across east africa fig 12 shows the spatial trend of spi over east africa the approach involves running an ordinary linear regression model to the spi maps generated results show that about 28 22 and 50 of the spi indicated spatial increase no change and decrease in spi trends respectively over the study area from 1920 to 2015 increase decrease of spi trends by our analysis means an increase decrease in moisture conditions corresponding to decrease increase in drought prevalence assessing the mean spi drought characteristics over the region indicates that there were some notable variations in spi consistent with the distribution of precipitation areas with increase in spi were located northeast along the shores of the indian ocean and some few areas in the central part of the study area areas with no trend changes in spi were located in northwest northeast southeast parts of east africa and close to the shores of the ocean also areas with decreasing spi trend pixels were located around in the northwest northeast and southwest and along the shores of the study area the 96 year precipitation records in areas with spatial increase in spi trend were 11 3 136 5 77 3 and 26 5 mm for minimum maximum mean and standard deviation values respectively while the precipitation records in areas with spatial decrease in spi were 539 138 3 56 1 and 29 7 for minimum maximum mean and standard deviation values respectively for areas with no spatial trend changes in spi were 7 2 161 6 93 2 and 31 9 for minimum maximum mean and standard deviation values respectively areas with improvement in drought indicated the low precipitation standard deviation our result confirms that areas with no spi changes in drought were wetter from 1920 to 2015 fig 13 a shows the spatial slope of spi versus latitudes degrees results indicate that high of spi slope are clustered at higher latitudes from latitude 0 to 12 while low trend values are clustered between latitude 2 and 2 south of the study region which is an indication that drought is prevalent in the northern section than southern section of the study area fig 13b shows spi slope versus dem where both high and low slope values of spi are clustered at lower latitudes between 0 1500 m and at the foot hills of mountains the histogram of the spi trends is shown in fig 13c it can be observed that most of the spi trends are clustered around the 0 0 mark which shows that the density curve of the pixels is symmetrical and centered about its mean the spi trends indicate high positive negative pixels above below the zero trend mark implying that drought prevails in both low and high elevation areas up to 2000 m 3 5 enso drought relationship drought is considered as one of the most complex and deleterious natural with severe impacts on natural ecosystems water resources and food security tan et al 2015 in this study we selected the el niño neutral and la niña years based on data from sea surface temperature sst anomalies of the tropical indian ocean in the region 0 5 c and 0 5 c also known as the niño 3 4 region the gridded extended reconstructed sea surface temperature version 4 ersstv4 temperature data was used to study the enso events we considered el niño la niña years as years with average sst anomalies above below temperature values of 0 5 c 0 5 c from october to march the october to march period typically coincides with peak enso conditions neutral years if the sst values are within 0 5 c sst 0 5 c as shown in fig 14 the spi values in neutral el niño and la niña years were studied over east africa from 1920 to 2015 the mean drought characteristics magnitude duration and even the dispersion of drought magnitude in spi 3 spi 6 and spi 12 are very similar in el niño and la niña events while the neutral years presented high dispersion in both drought magnitude and duration fig 15 results shown on fig 15a indicate that the mean drought duration during el niño years were less than 1 5 years while the mean drought duration during neutral la niña years was 3 4 years fig 15b and c in this study there is no direct link between enso and drought over the east african region but the association of drought in most el niño and la niña years suggests that the impact of enso cannot be ruled out our results have supported reports that present teleconnections between drought and enso previous reports have shown that enso events normally peak during october to march periods which coincides with the short son and long mam rainy seasons of east africa this period coincides with the son and mam seasons and increased precipitation in east africa considering the major drought episodes over the east africa our analysis has only agreed with the major droughts of 2011 12 based on our results 2011 12 was captured as an el niño year with drought magnitudes captured by spi 3 and spi 6 as 2 8 and 0 5 respectively with drought duration of 3 and 6 months respectively the drought episode of 2011 12 affected countries like somalia uganda kenya ethiopia south sudan and other nearby countries 3 6 discussion generally the actual precipitation expressed as a percentage deviation from normal or long term average is the most commonly used drought indicator although it has limited use reliability for spatial comparison due to its dependence on the mean kumar et al 2009 according to solanki and parekk 2014 the spi represents a departure from the mean and is thus expressed in standard deviation units as a normalized index in time and space the departure from the mean is a probability indication of the severity of the wetness or drought that can be used for risk assessment the application of data from 1920 in this study is considered most desirable as long records provide more reliable statistics for spi given that it is a statistical approach as a result spi has gained importance in recent years as a potential drought indicator permitting comparisons across different precipitation zones kumar et al 2009 solanki and parekk 2014 this study analyzed spi values between 1920 and 2016 with actual precipitation and precipitation deviation from normal in east africa a generally low precipitation and drought prone region the objective is to establish whether or not spi can be used as a suitable indicator when compared to conventionally adopted precipitation deviation based approach for drought intensity assessment over an extended region such as east africa the results of the analysis show that very low or very high precipitation corresponded to very low or very high spi values thus spi values adequately estimated the dryness or wetness when the precipitation is very low or very high respectively table 2 shows that all periods that experienced dry spells or drought recorded low negative anomaly and spi values with the periods 1942 1943 recording the driest 1 7 followed by 1983 1984 1 6 similarly the periods of wet spells reveal positive anomaly and spi values with the wettest period being 2014 2015 the outcome of this study is in line with the spi classes proposed by mckee et al 1993 however there is a marked variation between drought characteristics of magnitude duration and intensity when viewed against temporal scales in essence no time scale recorded the highest in all 3 drought characteristics throughout the 95 year period of analysis table 3 this is similar to the observation of spi at different time scales of 3 6 and 12 months which reveal that for shorter time scales there was a high temporal variability in dry and wet periods whereas at longer time scales 12 months frequency of dry and wet periods were considerably decreased fig 5 the results of this study indicate that drought characteristics analysis magnitude duration and intensity using spi can be adequately applied for drought intensity assessment particularly in regions such as east africa where low precipitation and vulnerability to droughts is prevalent the precipitation anomalies table 4 mann kendall trend and significance level of spi 3 spi 6 and spi 12 table 5 and mann kendall trend and significance level of precipitation table 6 reveal varying results both temporally and spatially across the eight countries comprising the east african region covered in this study for instance the same drought level spi may be prevalent in a country but the precipitation anomaly values may differ table 4 the drought of 1942 43 was worst hit in countries like burundi rwanda ethiopia uganda and south sudan from 1983 84 ethiopia kenya somalia uganda and south sudan experienced the worst drought episodes also from 1991 92 ethiopia kenya and somalia experienced worst drought spells while in 1996 97 the highest effect was observed in ethiopia table 5 reveals that out of eight countries spi 12 detects significant positive insignificant positive trend over 3 2 countries and insignificant negative trends over 3 countries spi 6 detects insignificant positive trend over 6 countries and insignificant negative trend over 2 countries spi 3 detects insignificant positive trends over 5 countries while insignificant negative trends in 3 stations at regional continental scale there was no significant trend in spi 3 spi 6 or spi 12 the results in table 6 show that most countries experience oscillations between wet and dry conditions while few countries are getting wetter with few others getting more arid at regional continental scale there was no significant trend in precipitation there was no significant change in precipitation in annual rainy seasons during the study period as no annual trend was observed in the precipitation amount we applied spi to study precipitation address potential changes in precipitation extremes there is expected to be some time lag due to the unique vegetation types which according to abbas et al 2014 should have different capacity of water storage the humid area covering most of uganda as shown on fig 1 with predominantly tall and dense forests are expected to have a longest time lag because according to allen 2008 forests possess the best capacity of water retention with deeper roots to tap groundwater conversely arid and semi arid areas such as kenya somalia and ethiopia are covered mostly by grasses and should have shorter time lag due to the lower capacity of water retention for grasses south sudan and a significant area of tanzania are sub humid areas largely covered by crops generally the water storage capacity of crops is likely similar to or even lower than that of grasses and grünzweig et al 2015 posits that artificial irrigation could alter the time lag for regions engaged in irrigation agriculture it is therefore expected that semi arid areas should have a time lag similar to or longer than arid areas cong et al 2017 this pattern is largely similar to the outcome of the study as shown on tables 4 6 and figs 4 8 and 9 4 conclusions in this study the spi approach applied to this study adequately explained the drought conditions across the east african region between 1920 and 2015 the drought characteristics of magnitude duration and intensity collectively explained the severity levels of drought within the study area it is expected that the outcome of this study could be applied elsewhere in sub saharan africa where precipitation is limited and likelihood of drought is high the result from the 96 years from 1920 to 2015 data records shows that there are a total of 41 wet years and 46 drought years the anomaly of the wet years and dry years were obtained when precipitation was above and below normal conditions respectively the years 1961 1967 1997 2007 and 2015 were adjudged the wettest while 1943 1983 1993 1997 and 2003 were adjudged the driest both the positive and negative peak of spi coincided with the positive and negative anomaly peaks respectively the computed spi at different time scales of 3 6 and 12 months indicated that for shorter time scales there was high temporal variability in dry and wet periods whereas at longer time scales 12 months frequency of dry and wet periods were considerably decreased years with high drought magnitude ranged from 1920 22 1926 29 1942 46 and 1947 51 with spi values corresponding to 2 2 3 2 3 4 and 2 6 respectively while years with low drought magnitude ranged from 1930 31 1988 89 and 2001 02 with values as 0 2 0 12 and 0 15 respectively the longest droughts occurred from 1929 29 1937 41 1942 46 1947 51 1952 56 and 1958 61 with values in years as 3 4 4 4 4 and 3 years respectively while the shortest droughts occurred in time period of 1 year and ranged from 1930 31 1964 65 1979 80 1981 82 1983 84 1988 89 1991 92 1993 94 1996 97 and 2001 02 our study also indicated that high values of spi slope are clustered at higher latitudes from 0 to 12 while low trend values are clustered between 2 and 2 south of the study region which is an indication that drought is prevalence in the northern section than southern section of the study area both high and low slope values of spi are clustered at lower latitudes between 0 1500 meters and at the foot hills of mountains the spi trends showed high positive negative pixels above below the zero trend mark indicating that drought prevails in both low and high elevation areas up to 2000 m in terms of enso impacts on drought over the region the mean characteristics magnitude duration and even the dispersion of drought magnitude in spi 3 spi 6 and spi 12 are very similar in el niño and la niña years while the neutral years presented high dispersion in both drought magnitude and duration the mean drought duration during el niño years were less than 1 5 years while the mean drought duration during neutral la niña years was 3 4 years which suggest that there is no direct link between enso and drought over the east african region but the association of drought in most el niño and la niña years suggests that the impact of enso cannot be ruled out since peak enso events occur during october to march periods which coincides with the short son and long mam rainy seasons of east africa furthermore the outcome of this study indicates that spi can be reliably suitable and most applicable in drought studies within the study area as it provides for analysis in multi temporal levels such as monthly single seasonal multi seasonal and annual droughts thereby allowing for a spatio temporal scale of analysis that creates the room for spi to provide accurate meteorological and agricultural drought analysis to this extent the study provides policy makers the necessary information that is critical to local adaptation increased resilience and mitigation measures in the face of a vulnerable eco climatic system triggered by a continuously changing climate within east africa as well as other parts of sub saharan africa our study is particularly relevant in its ability to depict continuous and synoptic drought conditions all over east africa providing vital information to farmers and policy makers using very cost effective method this is particularly the case in view of the assertion by karavitis et al 2011 that effective and reliable information and early warning systems based on indicators such as the spi are the foundation for overall effective drought adaptation and resilience plans finally the adoption of spi for this study demonstrates the fact that it is a robust concept unambiguous in calculation and understanding temporally flexible spatially meaningful and widely applicable a basis for which it is considered a powerful tool for drought studies as clearly amplified by cheval 2015 declaration of competing interest we declare that we do not have any commercial or
