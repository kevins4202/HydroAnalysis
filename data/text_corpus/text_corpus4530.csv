22650,the phenomenon of sloshing consists in the violent liquid motion inside partially filled containers and it is a major concern for the design of a number of structures in naval and offshore industry the use of perforated swash bulkheads is an effective technique to mitigate the sloshing in the present work a comprehensive investigation of the sloshing within box shaped tanks equipped with perforated bulkheads is carried out the investigation considered a broad range of parameters which includes several open area ratios and different filling levels under pitching excitations encompassing the first three sloshing resonant modes of a non compartmented tank as a result a relation of optimized open area ratio as function of the filling ratio is achieved for overall sloshing mitigation the effectiveness of the obtained relation is confirmed by numerical simulations using proposed swash bulkhead geometries that follow the optimized open area distribution as the perforated bulkheads introduces additional complexity to the already challenging sloshing phenomenon the numerical simulations of the present work were performed by adopting a fully lagrangian particle based method which easily deals with phenomena involving nonlinear free surface conditions such as large free surfaces deformation and fragmentation and complex geometries graphical abstract image 1 keywords sloshing mitigation perforated swash bulkhead sloshing loads particle method nonlinear phenomena 1 introduction the liquid containment in partial filling condition and under forced motion is present in a wide range of situations from tuned liquid dampers tld on buildings to offshore oil platforms when it is excited by motions close to the tank fluid system lowest resonant modes an extremely violent flow known as sloshing may occur in tlds the geometry of the tanks and the fluid filling level are set in order to match the resonance frequencies of sloshing and the structural vibration of the building as the action of wind or earthquakes makes the building vibrate the motion of the fluid within the tld out of phase with the structural vibration suppress the motion of the building and improves its comfort and safety to introduce damping in the tank fluid mechanical system perforated screens are a suitable technique with relatively simple implementation but they introduce complex nonlinear behavior as well a deeper understanding about the effects of perforated screens on the fluid motion is important to the design of tlds thus several recent efforts were focused on the modeling of the sloshing in tlds with perforated screens such as tait et al 2005 love and tait 2010 molin and remy 2013 among others simulations of the coupled dynamics of main structures and the tlds and the assessment of optimized system performance were performed by kaneko and ishikawa 1999 and tait et al 2008 in liquid storage and transportation systems such as oil platforms shuttle oil tankers lng carriers and floating liquified natural gas flng platforms the occurrence of sloshing is dangerous and highly undesirable since it may damage the tank structures and affect the motion of the vessel while coupled with the loads due to waves wind and current while the sloshing in tlds usually occurs in a limited frequency range close to the building structural vibration mode a much wider range of frequencies associated to winds waves and current must be evaluated in the transport and storage systems thus classification societies usually define very strict rules for the operation of the floating structures for example operations under filling levels between 10 and 70 must be avoided lloyd s register 2012 within this context the control or mitigation of the sloshing is an important issue to the design of the buildings and the floating structures in order to increase the safety of its operations or even enlarging their operation envelopes one common approach consists on the placement of internal structures within the tanks such as baffles or columns other technique consists upon the compartmentalization of tanks by using non watertight bulkheads such as wire screens slat screens and perforated swash bulkheads which are considered more efficient than baffles or columns for sloshing mitigation faltinsen and timokha 2009 in the 70 s focusing on the design of very large crude oil carriers vlccs akita 1967 and sawayanagi and matsumoto 1977a sawayanagi and matsumoto 1977b and sawayanagi and matsumoto 1978 carried out experimental studies and confirmed the effectiveness of the swash bulkheads regarding the flow through perforated bulkheads laws and livesey 1978 observed that the pressure loss caused by the perforations could be modeled as quadratic regarding the flow velocity through the porous bulkhead tait et al 2005 concluded that the phenomenon is highly nonlinear under large motions that often occur in practical applications more recently firoozkoohi 2013 performed a set of experiments for a two dimensional setup of a tank equipped with a slat screen bulkhead under harmonic sway motion considering solidity ratios s n the ratio between the watertight area of the bulkhead and the tank cross section area above 40 and filling ratios of h l 0 4 and 0 12 where h is the filling level and l is the length of the tank on the other hand analytical and semi analytical models were proposed as well firoozkoohi and faltinsen 2010 faltinsen et al 2011a and faltinsen et al 2011b modeled the problem by a potential flow through a multimodal description the tank was divided into two compartments separated by a slat screen that allows the flow between the compartments the blockage coefficient of the flow on the slat screen is estimated by accounting for the correct geometry of slots and slats for a tank with h l 0 4 the analytical results agree qualitatively with the experimental data for small excitations but it is unable to predict accurately both the free surface elevation in resonance conditions and the frequency of the compartmented resonant mode molin and remy 2013 also adopted the potential flow theory and modeled the bulkhead as a porous boundary with quadratic pressure loss only one perforated bulkhead with open area ratio ф 1 s n of 18 was evaluated considering different excitation amplitudes in a tank with h l 0 4 the results show good agreement with the experiments for small amplitude excitations but discrepancies occur for larger amplitude motions as the nonlinearities of the phenomena become more significant despite the analytical approaches can provide valuable insights regarding the general behavior of the sloshing flow on tanks with non watertight bulkheads the accuracy of their results is limited by the simplification hypotheses of potential flow such as the linearized free surface furthermore usually the pressure drop coefficient adopted to reproduce the effect of the bulkhead must be estimated experimentally in the last decades several numerical modelings and simulations to investigate the effects of the perforated bulkheads on sloshing were reported maravani and hamed 2011 developed a simulation system based on finite difference scheme on a staggered grid and volume of fluid vof method for free surface tracking a two dimensional rectangular tank with a slat screen and shallow water depth was simulated the results show very good agreement with experimental results for the force on the tank under relatively small excitation motions firoozkoohi et al 2015 used the open source finite volume simulation system openfoam to study sloshing in a two dimensional rectangular tank equipped with a slat screen with finite water depth h l 0 4 the numerical results presented good agreement with experiments of tanks under small amplitude motions even for the higher resonant frequencies xue et al 2013 performed numerical simulations and experiments of a tank divided by a perforated bottom mounted baffle with one square shaped hole the numerical method adopted was based on a finite difference method fdm the free surface was tracked using the volume of fluid vof technique and the turbulence was modeled by large eddy simulation les from the free surface elevation data the authors concluded that the perforated baffle provided better sloshing mitigation for low frequency motion i e the first mode xue et al 2017 later performed experiments considering perforted baffles and a watertight baffle and provided dynamic pressure measurements for a wide range of frequencies at the probes located both on the tank wall and on the bulkheads yu et al 2019 performed experiments of slat screen bulkheads by considering different open area ratios different slot sizes and different number of bulkheads within the tank for the highly nonlinear shallow water conditions as a result the authors identified among the several combinations of the three parameters the best ones to mitigate sloshing at shallow water condition recently due to their flexibility and effectiveness in modeling highly nonlinear interaction between complex shaped structures and flows with large free surface deformation fragmentation and merging numerical approaches based on lagrangian meshless particle based methods have been adopted to investigate the effects of baffles and internal structures on sloshing tsukamoto et al 2011 simulated the sloshing phenomenon on a two dimensional rectangular tank equipped with an elastically linked baffle by using the moving particle semi implicit mps method koshizuka and oka 1996 chen et al 2016 used the mps method to assess the effectiveness of bottom mounted baffles and ring shaped baffles to suppress sloshing specifically concerning sloshing in tanks with perforated bulkheads cheng et al 2016 adopted the mps method to investigate the effects of the opening area ratio of the bulkheads the results show a gradual transition of the sloshing behavior from the response of a clean tank to that of a tank with a watertight bulkhead as the open area ratio of the perforated bulkhead decreases also a high open area ratio is better to mitigate the sloshing in the second mode while a low open area ratio is better to the first mode however no further discussion on how those behaviors can effectively be used to mitigate and control sloshing were provided since the sloshing inside tanks with perforated bulkheads is an extremely nonlinear phenomenon that may depends on many parameters other than the open area ratio of the bulkhead the objectives of the present work are to carry out a numerical investigation on the possible influence of other parameters such as shape and arrangements of the perforations as well as a wider range of open area ratios and the nonlinearities due to excitation amplitude to determine the optimal geometry of perforated bulkheads that is effective for the sloshing mitigation for these purposes series of simulations based on the mps method were carried out considering a box shaped tank with several geometries of the perforated bulkheads a wide range of excitation frequencies two excitation amplitudes and three filling levels from shallow to high filling level after that the relation between the sloshing response and the parameters was established based on the results optimized parameter ranges that mitigate the sloshing and a formulation providing the optimal distribution of the perforations that minimizes the sloshing responses in all filling levels were obtained finally three models of perforated bulkheads with optimized geometries capable to mitigate the sloshing in a wide range of filling levels and excitation frequencies encompassing the three lowest resonant modes were introduced and evaluated to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed formulation in this way the mechanisms of the sloshing flow through the perforated bulkhead and the optimized solutions for sloshing mitigation are provided 2 numerical method 2 1 governing equations and algorithm the governing equations of the incompressible flow are the continuity equation eq 1 and the navier stokes ns equation eq 2 1 dρ dt ρ u 0 2 d u dt 1 ρ p ϑ 2 u f ρ g where ρ is the fluid density ϑ is the fluid kinematic viscosity p the pressure g the gravity acceleration f any other given field force and u the velocity of a given fluid particle 2 2 discrete differential operators in the moving particle semi implicit mps method the discrete form of the differential operators is obtained based on a weight function that accounts the contribution on the i th particle of a given j th particle inside a compact support which is defined by a neighborhood radius r e several formulations have been proposed for the weight function in the present study the weight function ω r proposed by koshizuka et al 1995 was adopted 3 ω r r e r 1 f o r 0 r r e 0 f o r r e r where r r i r j is the distance between two given particles i and j an important parameter in the mps method is the particle number density p n d the p n d is the summation of the weight function of all the particles inside the neighborhood radius of a given i th particle given each particle has the same mass the particle number density is proportional to the fluid density ρ thus the incompressibility of the flow can be assured by keeping constant the p n d instead of the density the p n d is defined as 4 p n d i j i ω r j r i the gradient of a φ scalar function is presented by the eq 11 and the laplacian is given by the eq 6 5 φ i d p n d 0 j i φ j φ i r j r i 2 r j r i ω r j r i 6 2 φ i 2 d p n d 0 δ j i φ j φ i ω r j r i where p n d 0 is the particle number density related to an initial cubic arrangement of the particles with neighborhood fulfilled by other particles d is the dimension of the problem the correction parameter δ is calculated based on the initial particle configuration and is given by 7 δ v ω r r 2 dv v ω r dv 2 3 boundary conditions two types of boundary conditions were applied in the present study rigid wall and free surface in the mps method the walls of solid bodies can be modeled by rows of particles in this work two types of solid are considered the fixed solid whose velocities are zero both in normal and tangential directions and the solids with prescribed motion whose position and velocity are imposed according to the motion of the solid for the modeling of the free surface the present work adopted the npcd neighborhood particle centroid deviation technique proposed by tsukamoto et al 2016 to identify the free surface particles this technique is based on the two criteria presented by eq 9 the first criterion is related to the particle number density in the case a particle satisfies the first criterion a second criterion is evaluated the second criterion is based on the asymmetry of the particle distribution inside the neighborhood when a particle satisfies the two criteria it is classified as free surface particle 8 i s p n d i β p n d 0 σ i ε l 0 9 σ i i j x i j w i j 2 i j y i j w i j 2 i j z i j w i j 2 i j w i j where s is the set of free surface particles l 0 is the distance between particles β and ε are threshold coefficients of the criteria and σ is the distance between the i th particle and the centroid of the particle distribution inside its neighborhood for the coefficients koshizuka and oka 1996 suggested β 0 97 and tsukamoto et al 2016 recommended ε 0 2 as the most suitable values due to the lagrangian description the kinematic condition of the free surface is satisfied by the motion of the free surface particles and the dynamic boundary condition is imposed by assigning atmospheric pressure to the free surface particles 2 4 algorithm and pressure calculation in the mps method the algorithm is divided into two main parts one explicit and other implicit the first part comprises the explicit calculation using eq 2 except for the pressure gradient to estimate an intermediate velocity particle position and particle number density of all fluid particles the solid motions are imposed in the explicit part as well thereafter and based on this intermediate state of the particles the pressure is implicitly calculated in the second part of the algorithm the coupling between velocity and pressure is performed by a pressure poisson equation ppe to ensure the incompressibility and satisfy the continuity equation the source term in the right hand side of the ppe is based on a constant particle number density condition which can be related to the local variation of the p n d from the p n d 0 the left side of ppe is the laplacian operator that leads to a linear system to determine the pressure of the particle the poisson equation eq 10 is 10 ² p n 1 i α ρ δ t 2 p i n 1 k ρ δ t 2 p n d i p n d 0 p n d 0 where p n d is the particle number density calculated from the particle distribution after the contributions calculated in the explicit part and δ t is the time step a source term based only on the constant p n d condition could present high frequency numerical oscillations caused by the change in the position and number of neighbor particles inside the compact support which are amplified by a factor 1 δ t 2 so a compressibility factor of α 10 8 and a pressure relaxation coefficient k were introduced to mitigate the pressure numerical oscillations the optimized pressure relaxation coefficient depends on the combination of the distance between particles and time step adopted for the simulation and its value will be presented in the description of the numerical models alongside the other simulation numerical parameters from the pressure obtained after the solution of the ppes linear system the correction of the velocity and position of the fluid particles is carried out for this purpose the pressure gradient is calculated by an improved formulation proposed by koshizuka et al 1998 and presented by eq 11 11 p i d p n d 0 j i p j p ˆ i r j r i 2 r j r i ω r j r i where p ˆ i is the minimum value of the pressure among the neighboring particles of the i th particle adopt the minimum pressure p ˆ i instead of the proper pressure p i of the i th particle results in a gradient that is always positive even for an anisotropic particle distribution so there are only repulsive forces among the particles and particle clustering is avoided which improves the numerical stability of the simulation koshizuka et al 1998 the version of the numerical simulation system used herein also takes advantage of some improvements focused on faster and more cost effective processing techniques for the solution of the linear system a preconditioned conjugate gradient pcg technique based on the intel math kernel library mkl pcg implementation is adopted the pcg is a very efficient technique to the solution of very large sparse linear systems such that obtained from the ppe of the mps method the neighborhood particle search is another important bottleneck of the method and an algorithm based on the cell index method quentrec and brot 1973 was used to enhance the efficiency of the computation on the other hand in order to allow the simulation of very high resolution models involving a very large number of particles a hybrid memory simulation system developed by fernandes et al 2015 was adopted for some cases such technique is based on a domain decomposition with particle renumbering to assure load balancing among the nodes of a computer cluster 3 validation the first step of the study is the validation of the mps based simulation system for the simulation of the sloshing phenomenon in tanks with perforated bulkheads for this purpose the experimental results of xue et al 2017 were used as reference the experiments are based on a box shaped tank equipped with several different types of vertical baffles for sloshing mitigation harmonic linear excitations in y direction with a wide range of frequencies were applied among the different tank configurations three of them are of particular interest for this work the tank without baffle the tank with a watertight baffle and the tank with a perforated baffle the configuration main dimensions and the location of two pressure probes of the tank with perforated baffle are presented in the fig 1 the thickness of the baffle is 6 mm and the perforated baffle has one square hole with side of 8 cm for the tank with watertight baffle and the clean tank the basic dimensions and the locations of the pressure probes are the same the natural frequency of the first mode of sloshing for the tank without baffle is ω 1 6 403 r a d s numerical simulations considering harmonic sway motions in the range of frequencies from 0 5 ω 1 to 1 4 ω 1 and amplitude of a 0 01 m were performed for the three different tank configurations regarding the sloshing flow through perforated bulkheads two aspects must be considered to define the resolution of the particle based model the flow past perforated plates and the sloshing itself notwithstanding the flow through perforated plates consists on the computational bottleneck for such problem cheng et al 2016 amaro junior et al 2015 studied a problem with very similar features the performance of perforated breakwaters by using the mps method in the study the convergence for the flow past circular holes was achieved by using a resolution of d l 0 10 where d is the diameter of the holes and l 0 is the distance between particles of the numerical model fonfach et al 2016 investigated the sloshing in a compartmented tank with a single hole bulkhead by two dimensional mps simulations and achieved the numerical convergence with an even lower resolution of d l 0 5 furthermore the numerical results from fonfach et al 2016 were validated against experimental data and presented good agreement even for the complex cases in which the highly nonlinear phenomenon of wave breaking was dominant in the simulations carried out for the validation of the numerical method the resolution adopted was l 0 5 m m i e l s l 0 8 where l s is the side of the square hole of the tank with perforated baffle the time step is t 5 10 3 s and the pressure relaxation coefficient is k 0 045 the simulations were carried out for 30 cycles of the harmonic sway motion in fig 2 the time series of the pressure registered by the two probes are presented for the case of the tank with perforated baffle under excitation with frequency of ω 1 32 ω 1 and amplitude of a 0 01 m the raw pressure signal obtained numerically shows a sinusoidal profile with amplitude and phase closely related to that measured in the experiment so the numerical results present good agreement with experimental data for both the pressure probes p t k and p b k the high frequency oscillations of the computed pressure are typical of particle based simulations and the results obtained here show oscillation magnitudes significantly lower than those of the physical low frequency dynamic pressure variations the maximum dynamic pressure as a function of the excitation frequency is presented in fig 3 for the three tank configurations in order to estimate the maximum dynamic pressure of the mps results only the last 10 cycles of the harmonic sway motion were accounted for the tank without baffle fig 3 a only the pressure probe p t k located in the tank wall is considered and shown in the figure for the tanks with watertight baffle fig 3 b and with perforated baffles fig 3 c in addition to the pressure on the probe p t k the pressure of the probe p b k which is located on the baffle and just above the square shaped perforation is also presented in fig 3 a the experimental data was not provided in the range from 0 98 ω 1 to 1 06 ω 1 due to water spillage out of the tank xue et al 2017 regardless the lack of experimental data in the most violent resonant frequencies the numerical results for the dynamic pressure are very close to the experimental data for the remaining frequency range in the case of the tank with the watertight baffle fig 3 b the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental data as well in the experiments the maximum dynamic pressure at the probe p b k is slightly higher than that for the probe p t k for frequencies higher than 0 85 ω 1 such behavior is also observed in the numerical simulations and the dynamic pressure sharply increases for frequencies above 1 2 ω 1 in both results however the measured maximum dynamic pressure is slightly higher than the computed one for frequencies higher than 1 3 ω 1 for these frequencies a beating in the pressure signal xue et al 2017 was reported in the experiments but it was not observed in the computed results the beating indeed increases the maximum dynamic pressure also the tank geometries with the baffles are in such a way that the tanks are divided in two parts with width to length ratio of 1 1 which is within the range where complex modes due to the amplification of the perturbations in transverse direction such as swirling might occur nevertheless swirling was not observed in the numerical simulations finally and most important the numerical and experimental results presented good agreement for the tank with the perforated baffle fig 3 c the maximum dynamic pressure at the probe p b k becomes higher than that for the probe p t k as the frequency is higher than 1 1 ω 1 for both the simulation and the experiment hence in general the numerical results obtained by using the mps based simulation system presented good agreement with the experimental data presented by xue et al 2017 4 sloshing behavior on tanks with swash bulkheads 4 1 case of study in the present study the basic geometry of the tanks is a box shaped one with length l of 0 9 m and width w and height h of 0 6 m as presented by fig 4 a perforated bulkhead is placed in the mid length of the tank in the longitudinal direction two different geometries of the holes were considered circular and square holes fig 4 a and fig 4 b respectively cases with a tank without bulkhead fig 4 c and with a watertight bulkhead fig 4 d were simulated as well several different layouts of perforated bulkheads were taken into account to determine the effect of the overall open area ratio φ o of the bulkheads and the distribution of the holes on the sloshing the different arrangements of the holes adopted herein could be divided into three basic layouts the layout a is presented by fig 5 and consists in a cluster of holes distributed along n rows and n columns with n 2 3 4 to obtain bulkheads with larger overall open area ratio in the layout b fig 6 additional holes were inserted amid the rows and columns of the layout a finally the layout c consist on n columns of 4 holes with n 1 2 3 fig 7 the sloshing behavior is highly related to the filling level among other aspects hence the analysis was carried out considering three different filling levels h h of 25 h l 0 167 50 h l 0 33 and 75 h l 0 50 where h is the liquid height the three filling levels will be henceforth defined as low intermediate and high filling levels respectively for some arrangements different hole sizes and hole geometries were adopted as well the complete list of the perforated bulkheads evaluated in the present work and their respective overall open area ratios φ o and submerged open area ratios φ s for the three filling levels are presented by table 1 circular holes and table 2 square shaped holes besides the concept of overall open area ratio of the bulkheads it is interesting to introduce two additional parameters open area ratio at the fluid level φ l which is the open area ratio measured locally considering an infinitesimal strip associated to the still filling level h submerged open area ratio φ s which is the ratio between the open area and the total cross section area of the submerged portion of the bulkhead between the bottom of the tank and a given filling level h the nomenclature of each layout consists in three parts separated by hyphens the first part defines the layout of the holes according to figs 5 7 the second part defines the shape of the holes c ircular or s quare and the third part defines the overall open area ratio of the perforated swash bulkhead the tank without bulkhead is called herein as model p100 or clean tank equivalent to a tank with overall open area ratio of 100 and the tank with watertight bulkhead is called model p0 or compartmented tank equivalent to a tank with overall open area ratio of 0 the fig 8 presents the locations of the pressure and wave probes in each simulation a harmonic pitch excitation was imposed to the tank whose center of rotation c is located in the geometric center of the box shaped tank except specifically stated the amplitude of the excitation is θ 0 6 o the free surface elevation was measured by two wave probes located in the longitudinal center plane of the tank y 0 3 m the h1 wave probe is placed 5 mm from the tank left wall and the h2 wave probe is located 5 mm to the left of the bulkhead the pressure was measured by the pressure probe p1 located on the tank left wall 25 mm from the bottom of the tank and 25 mm from the rear wall of the tank simulations considering frequencies ranging from 0 5 hz to 1 75 hz were performed for each filling level and tank model with an interval of 0 025 hz between successive frequencies the frequency range adopted in this analysis covers the first three lowest sloshing resonant modes which are sketched in fig 9 in the present study the first mode n 1 consists on a standing wave with wavelength l λ 1 2 and is defined as the non compartmented first antisymmetric resonant mode fig 9 a the second mode n 2 consists on a standing wave with l λ 1 and could be both the first symmetric mode for the clean tank fig 9 b and the first antisymmetric mode of the compartmented tank fig 9 c the third mode n 3 consists on the standing wave with l λ 3 2 and is the second antisymmetric mode of the clean tank fig 9 d the resonant periods and frequencies for each mode in each filling level can be estimated analytically from the wave dispersion relation of potential airy waves and the estimated values are given in table 3 initial distances between particles of l 0 10 m m was adopted in the present work in order to obtain d l 0 10 for circular holes with d 11 2 c m and l s l 0 10 for square holes with l s 10 c m for such resolution a time step of 0 5 ms and a pressure relaxation coefficient for the ppe of k 0 05 were adopted given the large number of simulations and aiming to reduce the processing time a mps based simulation system with hybrid parallelization by domain decomposition developed by fernandes et al 2015 was used in the present analysis the hybrid parallelization consists on both shared memory and distributed memory frameworks which allows the use of multiple processors per cluster node and multiple nodes of a computer cluster respectively such simulation system enables a more efficient use of the computational resources given its homogeneous load balancing and supra linear scalability fernandes et al 2015 the hardware used to perform the simulations is the computational cluster of the numerical offshore tank laboratory tpn of the university of são paulo usp the cluster has 48 nodes each one contains 20 cores of amd shanghai processors with 2 66 ghz and 128 gb of shared memory by using only one node for each simulation the processing times for a 40 s simulation range from between 4 0 h low filling level and 12 5 h high filling level 4 2 general behavior in cheng et al 2016 the investigations are limited to perforated bulkheads with the a2x2 layout fig 5 a and a range of open area ratios was verified by changing the size of the circular holes as a result insights about the phenomenon were obtained in the present study a wide variety of parameters which includes perforated bulkheads with different hole arrangements hole geometries number of holes and its size were considered to study a broader range of the flow aspects the focus of the present section is to relate the overall effects of perforated swash bulkheads geometrical parameters to the sloshing mitigation at first simulations using four tank configurations were carried out considering excitation amplitude of 6 and excitation frequencies close to the first antisymmetric resonant mode of the clean tank n 1 for three filling ratios h l 0 167 0 33 and 0 50 the tanks are model p0 compartmented tank a4x4 c p44 a3x3 c p56 and model p100 clean tank in fig 10 the graphs of the left and right columns show respectively the time series of the free surface height at the wave probes h1 close to the tank wall and h2 close to the bulkhead the three rows of fig 8 are associated to the three filling levels according to the computed results in general the largest free surface displacements were observed for the clean tank in all the three filling levels as the open area ratio of the perforated bulkhead decreases the maximum free surface height close to the left wall h1 is increasingly mitigated for all the filling levels fig 10 a c e however the computed free surface heights close to the bulkhead left side h2 show that the mitigation occurs for the low filling level fig 10 b while for the intermediate and high filling levels the effects of the open area ratio is almost negligible fig 10 d f such result regarding h2 could be explained by the sloshing behavior in low filling levels in which a travelling wave is formed in the clean tank and the wave amplitude is reduced by damping and or shift of the resonant frequency provoked by the decreasing open area ratio of the bulkhead on the other hand for the intermediate and high filling levels the sloshing consists on a standing wave and the small free surface elevation observed near the bulkhead wall are because the knot of the standing wave is located exactly in the longitudinal center of the tank the second analysis is concerned on the responses of the tanks excited in the frequencies close to the first symmetric resonant mode of the clean tank and the first antisymmetric mode of the compartmented tank n 2 for each filling level fig 11 shows the time series of the free surface height close to the tank wall h1 and bulkhead h2 for such cases for all the filling levels the largest free surface motion is observed for the tank with watertight bulkhead on the other hand under this excitation almost no difference can be observed among the free surface height at h1 and h2 of the clean tank and the tanks with perforated bulkhead moreover the perforated bulkheads provided large mitigation of the free surface heights in low and intermediate filling levels from the time series of the free surface height close to the tank left wall h1 an average double amplitude of its elevation simply denominated as free surface elevation henceforth can be obtained by subtracting the average value of the minimum free surface heights from the average value of the maximum free surface heights in every cycle except the first 10 cycles of the tank harmonic motion which were considered as transient ones and were neglected in the computation of the average values the fig 12 shows the computed free surface elevation at h1 as function of the excitation frequency considering the three filling levels for the clean tank the tank with watertight bulkhead and tanks with perforated bulkheads with open area ratios ranging from 22 to 75 the vertical axis is made dimensionless by dividing the free surface elevation by the hydrostatic variation of the free surface height due to the pitch motion of the clean tank δ h h m a x h m i n l tan θ 0 by considering a local coordinate system attached to the tank that follows its pitch motion the dynamic longitudinal force is calculated as the average value of the difference between the maximum and minimum longitudinal force at each cycle of harmonic motion fig 13 shows the dimensionless longitudinal dynamic force in the frequency domain obtained using the variation of hydrostatic force due to the maximum and minimum pitch inclinations of the clean tank δf x 2 ρ g h 0 l b s i n θ 0 the frequency domain considered in this study can be divided in two parts to simplify the discussion about the results which are illustrated by the two gray shaded areas in each graph the frequencies of the three resonant modes of the clean tank f n 1 f n 2 and f n 3 calculated analytically from the linear potential airy wave theory table 3 are presented by the vertical dashed lines the first part corresponds to the excitation frequencies between 0 5 hz and 1 0 hz and it is related to the first mode n 1 associated the three filling levels for the low frequencies the clean tank and the tanks with perforated bulkheads show essentially hydrostatic behavior and the dimensionless responses tends to one as the frequency approaches the first mode n 1 larger free surface elevations were computed as the open area ratio of the perforated bulkhead increases moreover the frequencies associated to the maximum free surface elevation increase as the open area ratio of the bulkhead increases the second part consists in the frequencies range from 1 0 hz to 1 75 hz for the three filling levels peaks were computed for the tank with watertight bulkhead close to 1 125 hz 1 25 hz and 1 3 hz for the filling ratios h l of 0 167 0 33 and 0 50 respectively and are related to the first antisymmetric mode of the compartmented tank or the second mode n 2 in addition to this in a higher frequency range but with lower magnitude peaks related to the third mode n 3 were computed for the clean tank for the tanks with perforated bulkheads one peak could be identified in the frequency range between the resonant modes n 2 and n 3 as well in such cases the general behavior of the tank with perforated bulkheads tends to resemble the behavior of the clean tank as the open area ratio of the bulkhead increases and therefore presenting lower peaks at a higher frequency in general for the tanks with perforated bulkheads the behavior of the dynamic longitudinal force shows the same tendencies of the free surface elevation for the clean tank in all the three filling levels large amplifications ranging from 3 5 to 4 times the quasi static response were obtained at the first resonant mode n 1 on the other hand for the tank with watertight bulkhead at the second mode n 2 the dynamic component of the force reduces remarkably as the filling level increases in such cases while the amplification of the dynamic force is around 3 5 times the quasi static one for the low filling level the amplification for the high filling level is about only 1 5 times the quasi static response for the high filling level between 1 0 hz and 1 75 hz fig 13 c the difference between the clean tank and the tanks with perforated bulkheads is almost negligible regarding the longitudinal dynamic force in conclusion as the open area ratio of the bulkhead decreases there is a gradual change of the sloshing behavior from that resembling the response of a clean tank to that of a tank with watertight bulkhead thus aiming to reduce the amplification of the fluid motion within the tank perforated bulkheads of low open area ratio provide better results for frequencies close to the first resonant mode n 1 while tanks with perforated bulkheads with high open area ratios provide better results for frequencies close to the second resonant mode n 2 4 3 effects of excitation amplitude in order to verify the effects of the amplitude of the harmonic pitch motion on the sloshing responses of the tanks with perforated bulkheads cases with harmonic pitch motion and a smaller amplitude of 2 were simulated for the clean tank the tank with watertight bulkhead and the tanks with perforated bulkhead with layout a the fig 14 a b c show the responses in the frequency domain of the dimensionless dynamic longitudinal force for the clean tank fig 14 d e f give the result of the tank with watertight bulkhead while figs 15 a b c provide the results of the tank with perforated bulkhead with high open area ratio of 68 and figs 15 d e f are related to the tank with perforated bulkhead with a small open area ratio of 10 in fig 14 a shows that different excitation amplitudes leads to different dimensionless responses in the two resonant modes in the first mode n 1 a strong nonlinear effect is observed the response amplification in the resonance of the case with larger motion amplitude is reduced due to the damping caused by nonlinear free surface effects such as the wave breaking of the travelling wave for the intermediate and high filling levels the effect of the excitation amplitude is relatively small showing a nearly linear response from fig 14 e f for the tank with watertight bulkhead the amplification of the dimensionless response peak due to the small amplitude excitation is larger in the second mode n 2 and occurs at a slightly higher frequency the tank with perforated bulkhead of low open area ratio of 10 fig 15 d e f has a behavior that resembles the tank with the watertight bulkhead but its resonant peaks in the second mode n 2 has significant lower magnitudes than that observed for the tank with watertight bulkhead similarly the behavior of the tank with perforated bulkhead of high open area ratio of 68 fig 15 a b c resembles that of the clean tank but it has significantly lower response amplifications at the first resonant mode n 1 for both tanks with perforated bulkheads the effects of the excitation amplitude are small for the low and the intermediate filling levels but they are almost negligible for the high filling level 4 4 effects of the geometry and the arrangement of the holes in the present section models of perforated bulkhead with similar open area ratios but different hole geometries size number and arrangements are investigated in order to address the effect of such parameters to the sloshing mitigation fig 16 a presents the local open area ratio and the submerged open area ratio as function of the filling level for two models of bulkhead with the same arrangement and overall open area ratio but different hole geometries a2x2 c p69 circular holes and a2x2 s p69 square holes on the other hand fig 16 b shows the submerged open area ratio for three models of perforated bulkheads with similar overall open area ratio but different hole arrangements thus with holes of different sizes in a different number a2x2 c p44 a3x3 c p56 and b3x3 c p50 the different profiles of the open area distribution for circular holes and for square holes are shown by the curves of the local open area ratio at the fluid level φ l in fig 16 a the local open area ratio at the fluid filling ratios of 0 167 and 0 33 are slightly higher for the model with circular holes than the one with square shaped holes nevertheless despite the small differences in the local open area ratios the submerged open area ratios are very similar between equivalent bulkheads for the three filling levels for the same cases shown in fig 16 and fig 17 provides the time series of the computed pressure at probe p1 in the first resonant mode n 1 of the sloshing the raw pressure time series obtained from the particle based simulations were filtered by a low pass filter with threshold of 20 hz in order to provide a clear view of the main harmonics without spurious numerical noise the pressure time series in fig 17 a shows two peaks at each cycle the first peak with higher magnitude is related to the impact of the travelling wave on the tank wall after the impact the fluid flows upwards along the right wall until reaching a maximum height which is followed by the collapse of the water column that generates the second peak of smaller magnitude in general the difference between the pressure time series for the bulkheads with circular and square shaped holes is almost negligible for the three equivalent models of fig 17 b the magnitudes of the pressure variation are similar the submerged open area ratio of the model a3x3 c p56 below the 0 167 filling ratio is slightly higher than those of the other two models refer to fig 16 b as a consequence it has a pressure peak slightly higher than that computed for the other equivalent bulkheads for this model a second pressure peak due the collapse of the fluid column similar to that occurred in the high overall open area ratio bulkheads of fig 17 a was also computed the graphs of the longitudinal dynamic force as function of excitation frequency for the equivalent bulkheads with different arrangements are presented by fig 18 at the three different filling levels the computed longitudinal dynamic force of the equivalent bulkheads which have almost same overall open area ratio are very similar despite the large difference in number size and arrangement of the holes the general behavior of the longitudinal dynamic force is very close between model a2x2 c p44 and b3x3 c p50 and small differences occur only in the vicinity of the resonant frequencies in the bulkhead with a larger number of holes b3x3 c p50 the fluid flows through a larger amount of edges than in the models with a smaller number of holes a2x2 c p44 and nonlinear effects such as viscous damping flow separation and vortex shedding are expected to be more significant however such tendency was not clearly identified in our results so despite the different number and size of the holes the models with slightly higher open area ratio show higher longitudinal dynamics forces at the first resonant mode on the other hand the models with slightly lower open area ratio presented higher longitudinal forces at the second resonant mode 4 5 discussion about the damping effects of the perforated bulkheads vertical baffles and bulkheads are extensively used to mitigate the sloshing they affect the flow in different ways such as by restraining the flow and intensifying viscous damping through flow separation and vortex formation while the first is related to changes in the added mass of the mechanical system the second is related to its damping thus it is interesting and useful the better understanding of the contribution of each one of these aspects regarding sloshing mitigation by perforated bulkheads in the previous section as square holes have about 12 more perimeter of sharp edges than circular holes with equivalent area it is expected higher formation of vortices in the bulkheads with square holes and as consequence a slightly more damped flow however in general the difference was negligible similar results were observed for the effect of the arrangement of the holes and its number in general regardless the number size and arrangement of the holes bulkheads with similar open area ratios presented very close results for sloshing mitigation fig 18 such results indicate that the vortex formation has a relatively smaller contribution to the damping provided by the perforated baffles if compared to the effects due to the flow restriction in the first and third sloshing resonant modes as the velocities normal to the bulkheads near the free surface are larger than near the bottom of the tank the bulkhead which provides more restriction to the flow close to the free surface is expected to be more effective for sloshing mitigation in order to verify this hypothesis bulkheads with equivalent submerged open area ratio but with nonuniform distribution of the local open area ratio along the tank depth i e with different local open area ratios near the free surface and close to the tank bottom can be considered such is the case of yu et al 2019 experiments which used slat screen bulkheads with three different open area ratios and for each one two different sizes of slots the results show that for equivalent open area ratios the cases using large slots with the slot height about a third of the depth and placed very close to the free surface the amplitudes of free surface motion is higher for the first and third modes than the cases using small slots as a result the experiments corroborated the hypothesis it is important to emphasize the particular aspects of the bulkheads evaluated in the present work first the distribution of the holes was proposed in order to be the most homogeneous and symmetrical as possible to avoid non uniform open area distribution along the depth second the largest holes are only 6 times larger than the smallest holes third even the smallest holes studied are large enough in order to avoid that very complex phenomena become predominant in the flow such as capillarity in the jet flow through the holes viscous damping and sub particle scale effects of the turbulence then for the range of open area ratios and considering the abovementioned features of the bulkheads investigated in the present study the results obtained in the previous sections and from other works in the literature strongly indicate that the most relevant geometrical parameter of the perforated bulkheads is the open area ratio and the restriction of the flow is the most fundamental contribution provided by perforated bulkheads and other vertical baffles in general to the sloshing mitigation such aspect is strongly affected by the relation between the distribution of the open area ratio in vertical direction as the flow velocity amid the tank decreases with the depth thus the focus of the following sections is the investigation of the relation between open area ratio and the tank depth in order to develop a perforated bulkhead with an optimized open area distribution for sloshing mitigation and control 4 6 optimum submerged open area ratio of swash bulkhead for sloshing mitigation according to the responses in the frequency domain of the free surface elevation fig 12 and the dynamic longitudinal force fig 13 the open area ratio of the swash perforated bulkhead affects both the magnitude of the peak resonant response and the frequency at which it occurs so based on the division of the frequency domain into two parts the first part comprising the first resonant mode n 1 from 0 5 hz to 1 0 hz and the second part containing the second resonant mode n 2 and the third resonant mode n 3 from 1 0 hz to 1 75 hz the magnitude and frequency of the peak of the curves were identified for each case and each filling level in fig 19 the resonant frequencies in the two regions of the frequency domain in relation to the perforated bulkhead submerged open area ratio are presented the general behavior is very similar for the three filling levels the resonant frequency increases monotonically as the submerged open area ratio of the bulkhead increases the increase rate is higher for low submerged open area ratios and for submerged open area ratios above 50 the frequency of the peaks tends towards an asympotote in the curve for the first mode the asymptote is the frequency of the first antisymmetric mode f n 1 of the clean tank in the curve for the second mode the resonant peak for zero open area ratio is the frequency of the second mode of the clean tank f n 2 and tends to the frequency of the third mode of the clean tank f n 3 as the open area ratio approaches to 100 the numerical data presented a good correlation with the dashed lines which are regressions curves obtained by adopting an exponential curve in the form f ф c 1 c 2 e c 3 ф where c 1 c 2 and c 3 are positive constant values considering the computed dynamic longitudinal force fig 20 provides the magnitudes of the response amplification of the first and second resonant peaks as function of the submerged open area ratio of the bulkhead besides in fig 21 the magnitude of the free surface elevation amplifications of the resonance peaks in relation to the submerged open area ratio of the bulkhead is presented in both groups of diagrams the results for the three filling levels and the two pitch excitation amplitudes are shown in both figs 20 and 21 regarding the first resonant peaks the amplification magnitude increases monotonically as the submerged open area ratio of the bulkhead increases the increase rate becomes larger as the submerged open area ratio increases concerning the second resonant peaks the opposite behavior is obtained the magnitude of the amplification is reduced monotonically as the submerged open area ratio increases and the decrease rate is larger for small submerged open area ratios similarly to the approximate formulation for the frequency of the resonant peak fig 19 the computed results of the response amplification as a function of submerged open area ratio were approximated by exponential curves which are shown in the graphs by dashed lines with correlation factor above 95 for all the cases focusing on the sloshing mitigation in the entire frequency domain the results indicate a clear tradeoff in relation of the submerged open area ratio of the perforated bulkhead while by reducing the submerged open area ratio of the perforated bulkhead the sloshing is mitigated in the first resonant mode n 1 the sloshing is increased in the second mode n 2 compartmented on the other hand by increasing the submerged open area ratio of the perforated bulkhead the sloshing is mitigated in the second resonant mode n 2 compartmented but increased in the first resonant mode n 1 notwithstanding the two exponential curves in each diagram intersects each other at an optimal point in which the overall minimum value for the amplification at the resonance for a given filling level occurs from this point the so called optimum submerged open area ratio for a given filling level can be obtained it is interesting to observe that the magnitude of the amplification at the optimum submerged open area ratio is lower than two times the quasi static free surface elevation or the hydrostatic variation of longitudinal force for all the filling levels moreover it exceeds 1 5 times only for the low filling level thus the optimum submerged open area ratio is one that results in the lowest overall peak magnitudes of longitudinal force and free surface elevations in the entire frequency range comprising the lowest three resonant modes of sloshing summarizing in the context of the present work considering the case of liquid storage and transportation systems the smaller the liquid motion is the better in the context of tlds kaneko and ishikawa 1999 tait et al 2008 a different concept of optimum open area ratio must be adopted because some level of fluid oscillation is required in order to make the tld work as a dynamic damper and transfer energy from the tank to the main structural system in such case a more complex balance between damping and inertia must be achieved whilst only the damping is the prevalent feature in the present analysis the results obtained in this analysis are consistent with firoozkoohi and faltinsen 2010 the authors studied the case of a two dimensional rectangular tank equipped with a slat screen only for the filling ratio of h l 0 4 for very small motion amplitudes an optimized solidity ratio of s n 90 was obtained which is equivalent of an open area ratio of approximately φ 10 the optimum submerged open area ratio calculated by the present study for the filling ratio of h l 0 5 for the motion amplitude of θ 2 o is around 15 the results of figs 20 and 21 indicate that the optimum submerged open area ratios decrease as the filling level increases fig 22 shows the optimum submerged open area ratio as a function of filling ratio h l the curve with solid circles is related to the free surface elevation in a large pitch motion θ 0 6 o in general the optimum submerged open area ratio is slightly lower for the motion with smaller amplitude however a particular behavior is observed for the free surface elevation at low filling levels and large motion amplitude as consequence of the highly nonlinear phenomenon of a travelling wave which is largely damped by wave breaking and runup along the tank sidewall and the bulkhead notwithstanding the curves associated to the free surface elevation under small excitation amplitude and the curves of the dynamic longitudinal forces show similar behavior and could be approximated by exponential curves as well in order to encompass the optimum submerged open area ratio obtained from the four curves a lower and an upper envelope is defined as a range of optimum submerged open area ratio as a function of the filling level and shown in fig 22 by the shaded area using the average value of the upper and the lower limits of the range of optimum submerged open area ratio the regression curve of optimum submerged open area ratio which is shown as a dashed line in fig 22 is obtained by adopting the exponential equation provided in eq 12 as a result the empirical formula for the optimum submerged open area ratio is obtained as function of the dimensionless filling ratio h l in which c 1 65 3 and c 2 2 5 12 ф o p t c 1 e c 2 h l the fitted relation of eq 12 is suitable for box shaped tanks with the filling ratios from 0 167 to 0 5 as the relation was interpolated from the results obtained in this interval notwithstanding the extrapolation for higher filling ratios h l 0 5 is deemed as suitable as well because it has a logarithmic profile that lean to a constant value as the filling ratio increases moreover despite the lower limit for the deep liquid condition is defined as h l 1 0 faltinsen and timokha 2009 for the case in which h l 0 5 the effect of the tank bottom on the flow is already small 5 swash bulkheads with optimum submerged open area ratio the previous section was focused on the investigation of the sloshing mitigation due to perforated swash bulkheads the models adopted for that purpose were based on several holes distributed in different arrangements along a bulkhead in the longitudinal center of the tank for sake of simplicity arrangements considering uniform distribution of the perforations were adopted so that the open area ratio is almost independent to the filling levels in other words the submerged open area ratio of the bulkheads is almost constant regardless of the filling height and it is also very close to the overall open area ratio nevertheless the results of section 4 6 show that an optimum submerged open area ratio could be defined as function of filling ratio h l as a further step on the investigation of the effects of the perforated bulkheads on the sloshing mitigation the focus of the present section is to apply the insights obtained by the previous results in order to propose and evaluate models of perforated bulkhead with a submerged open area ratio distribution following the optimum submerged open area ratio for all the filling levels and thus being capable of mitigate the sloshing in the entire frequency range comprising the three first resonant modes of sloshing regardless the filling condition 5 1 models the fig 23 presents three proposed layouts of swash bulkhead whose submerged open area ratio is within the range of optimum submerged open area ratio for all the filling levels the model opt a was proposed following the same concept of the previous sections with distribution of the holes in the bulkhead based on the amplitude modulation the holes are circular and the radius of the holes in the lower row are r 2 8 46 c m and the radius of the holes in the intermediate and top rows are r 1 5 24 c m with the dimension of the smaller holes limited by the convergence criteria of the numerical model of d l 0 10 despite not analyzed herein due to much higher computational cost required alternative hole distributions can also be considered using larger amounts of smaller holes based on frequency modulation the model opt b was proposed based on the idea of vertical strips with variable width in order to make the open area ratio fits within the range of optimum submerged open area ratio in the present study only two strips were used to model the bulkhead opt b due to the restriction imposed by the numerical model convergence criteria of δ l l 0 10 that must be matched in the narrowest part of the strip where δ l is the minimum linear dimension of the hole in the fig 23 b c the main dimensions are b 1 18 c m b 2 12 c m b 3 10 c m and b 4 7 5 c m both models opt a and opt b show a watertight section above h l 0 50 because the previous analysis were restricted for filling levels below that so a model opt c following the same concept of opt b was proposed to address such situation with the strip opening reaching the top of the bulkhead fig 24 a shows the local open area ratio in liquid levels for the three proposed bulkhead models fig 24 b illustrates the submerged open area ratio of the bulkheads of the three proposed models as a function of filling level just to remind the submerged open area ratio of the bulkheads consists on the ratio between the total area of the openings below the still water level and the total area of the bulkhead below such level the range of optimum submerged open area ratio is indicated by the gray region on the graphs the dark gray area is between the filling ratios from h l 0 167 to h l 0 50 evaluated previously while the light gray areas were defined by the extrapolation of the tendency for higher and lower filling levels the open area ratio of the submerged area of all the three proposed bulkhead models fits inside the range of optimum submerged open area ratio between h l 0 167 and h l 0 50 5 2 results fig 25 provides snapshots of the particle simulation in the first mode n 1 at the low filling level for the clean tank and the three tanks with optimized swash bulkhead geometries in the time frame presented by the snapshots violent impact of the travelling wave on the side walls occurs in the clean tank while relatively calm fluid motions with only very small free surface displacements were computed for the three tanks with optimized perforated bulkheads the fig 26 shows snapshots of the particle simulation for the tank with watertight bulkhead and other three tanks with optimized swash bulkhead in the second mode n 2 for the high filling level the free surface reaches the tank ceiling for the watertight bulkhead and both opt a and opt b models the impact on the ceiling is violent enough to generate splash in the tank with watertight bulkhead and the opt b swash bulkhead model fig 26 c the jet flow through the circular holes cause the highly nonlinear free surface profile observed in the second frame for the opt a model fig 26 b finally the opt c model presented the smallest free surface displacements for the high filling level at the second mode n 2 the graphs of the dimensionless free surface elevation and the dimensionless dynamic longitudinal force in the frequency domain are given by fig 27 and fig 28 respectively the results were obtained considering harmonic pitch excitation of 6 amplitude in the graphs the responses obtained by using the proposed optimized bulkheads were compared to the responses of the clean tank and the tank with watertight bulkhead the model opt c was simulated only for the high filling level because its behavior for the low and intermediate filling levels is assumed as equivalent of those by the opt b bulkhead for the low and the intermediate filling levels all the proposed models presented remarkable sloshing mitigation in the range of frequencies close to the two resonant modes n 1 and n 2 with amplifications of the free surface elevation not exceeding 1 5 times the hydrostatic free surface displacement as shown in fig 27 a and fig 27 b nevertheless for the high filling level fig 27 c all the proposed models lead to excellent sloshing mitigation in the first mode n 1 while slightly larger free surface elevation amplifications occurs in the second mode n 2 for the models opt a 2 times and opt b 2 5 times in relation to the tank with watertight bulkhead 1 8 times only the model opt c is capable of mitigating the sloshing also in the high filling condition at the second resonant mode n 2 compartmented with free surface elevation amplification less than 1 5 times the quasi hydrostatic free surface displacement in addition to these results resonant frequencies of the first resonant mode n 1 in the models with optimized swash bulkhead geometries are lower than that of the clean tank such result observed for high filling levels indicate that due to runup provoked by the perforated bulkhead besides the open area ratio distribution below the still water level the open area ratio just above this level has also an important effect on the flow and should be considered to achieve better sloshing mitigation in high filling levels since both bulkheads opt a and opt b are watertight just above the height of 75 the flow behavior resembled those of the watertight bulkhead at high filling levels with large fluid motions at the second resonant mode n 2 in conclusion an optimized model of watertight bulkhead was obtained in the model opt c which reduces the amplification of both free surface elevation and dynamic longitudinal force to less than 1 5 times for all the evaluated filling levels in the entire frequency range comprising the first three sloshing modes of a box shaped tank as predicted in section 4 6 as mentioned above other bulkhead models with different perforation geometries such as small holes distributed based on frequency modulation which follow the range of optimum submerged open area ratio can also be considered in order to achieve a similar performance on sloshing mitigation 5 3 full scale test case as recommend by the international towing tank conference 2017 the sloshing pressure obtained from reduced scale models can be scaled to full scale by adopting the froude scaling karimi et al 2014 except for some specific situations such as local impacts close to the free surface in which complex phenomena like air trapping might occur and scaling laws concerning compressibility of the liquid and the gas must also be taken into account karimi et al 2014 since the focus of the sloshing mitigation by the perforated swash bulkheads is the restriction of the global sloshing loads the contribution of the local hydrodynamic impact phenomenon might be neglected however as the perforated bulkheads introduce additional complexity to the sloshing phenomenon it is relevant to verify the validity of the froude scaling in order to extend the obtained optimized open area ratio to full scale naval and offshore structures for this purpose the dimensions of a typical suezmax tanker were considered the cargo tanks of the vessel are around 40 m width and they are divided into two compartments by a watertight bulkhead at its longitudinal center plane based on these dimensions and considering a box shaped tank the relation between the full scale model and the reduced scale model adopted in the present work is 1 45 then in order to investigate the scaling effects numerical simulations with full scale models of the tank with watertight bulkhead model p0 and the tank with optimized perforated bulkhead opt c were carried out fig 29 presents the results for the dimensionless dynamic longitudinal force of the full scale cases 1 1 and the corresponding results previously obtained using the reduced scale models 1 45 the harmonic excitation motion has amplitude of 6 and the dimensionless motion frequencies in fig 29 are defined in relation to the analytical estimation of the first non compartmented mode in fig 29 the dimensionless longitudinal dynamic force of the full scale opt c model is slightly larger than that calculated for the reduced scale model for f f 1 2 0 at the filling ratio h l 0 167 fig 29 a the opposite is observed for f f 1 1 6 at the filling ratio h l 0 5 fig 29 c nevertheless the general behavior presented good agreement between the different scales for both models and the froude scaling worked relatively well hence both the proposed optimized geometry of swash bulkhead and the relation of the optimized submerged open area ratio as function of filling ratio eq 12 could be applied to full scale conditions moreover these results provide further evidence that the nonlinear viscous damping such as skin friction and vortex generation introduce only secondary contributions to the effect of the perforated baffle otherwise larger discrepancies between the reduced scale and the full scale simulation might be expected 6 conclusions the focus of the present work is to investigate the effectiveness of perforated swash bulkheads to mitigate the sloshing for sake of simplicity the basic setup adopted herein was a reduced scale model of a clean box shaped tank and its variants equipped with perforated and watertight bulkheads as the investigation approach numerical simulations based on a fully lagrangian particle based method which is flexible and effective to model phenomena involving large free surface nonlinearities and complex geometries were carried out based on the results from a comprehensive investigation in which the effects of the open area ratio of the bulkhead the filling level of the tank and the excitation frequency were clarified an empirical relation of the optimized submerged open area ratio as function of filling ratio was proposed the optimum submerged open area ratio is defined as the ratio that minimizes the sloshing in the frequency range covering the three lowest sloshing resonant modes concerning the tradeoff between the small open area ratios which are more effective to mitigate the non compartmented resonant mode and large open area ratios which are more effective to mitigate the compartmented resonant mode the effectiveness of the proposed relation was later confirmed by numerical simulations of tank models with perforated bulkheads that follow the optimized submerged open area distributions as the behavior of the phenomenon in full scale models could be assessed by froude scaling the optimized submerged open area ratio distribution obtained using reduced scale models can also be straightforwardly applied for full scale tank designs in a wide range of practical engineering applications other useful insights about the general behavior of the phenomenon could be inferred from the parameter analysis as well first the sloshing behavior was essentially affected by the submerged open area ratio of the bulkhead almost regardless of the arrangement geometry number and size of the holes second despite the non linearity of the sloshing response the general behaviors of the sloshing response are similar for different motion amplitudes finally the shift of the natural period of the non compartmented and the compartmented resonant modes as consequence of the submerged open area ratio of the bulkhead was also addressed such shift of the natural periods provides useful information for some engineering applications such as tlds in which the natural period of the tank should match the resonant period of the building structural vibration for efficient mitigation acknowledgements the authors are grateful to the financial support provided by petrobras during the

22650,the phenomenon of sloshing consists in the violent liquid motion inside partially filled containers and it is a major concern for the design of a number of structures in naval and offshore industry the use of perforated swash bulkheads is an effective technique to mitigate the sloshing in the present work a comprehensive investigation of the sloshing within box shaped tanks equipped with perforated bulkheads is carried out the investigation considered a broad range of parameters which includes several open area ratios and different filling levels under pitching excitations encompassing the first three sloshing resonant modes of a non compartmented tank as a result a relation of optimized open area ratio as function of the filling ratio is achieved for overall sloshing mitigation the effectiveness of the obtained relation is confirmed by numerical simulations using proposed swash bulkhead geometries that follow the optimized open area distribution as the perforated bulkheads introduces additional complexity to the already challenging sloshing phenomenon the numerical simulations of the present work were performed by adopting a fully lagrangian particle based method which easily deals with phenomena involving nonlinear free surface conditions such as large free surfaces deformation and fragmentation and complex geometries graphical abstract image 1 keywords sloshing mitigation perforated swash bulkhead sloshing loads particle method nonlinear phenomena 1 introduction the liquid containment in partial filling condition and under forced motion is present in a wide range of situations from tuned liquid dampers tld on buildings to offshore oil platforms when it is excited by motions close to the tank fluid system lowest resonant modes an extremely violent flow known as sloshing may occur in tlds the geometry of the tanks and the fluid filling level are set in order to match the resonance frequencies of sloshing and the structural vibration of the building as the action of wind or earthquakes makes the building vibrate the motion of the fluid within the tld out of phase with the structural vibration suppress the motion of the building and improves its comfort and safety to introduce damping in the tank fluid mechanical system perforated screens are a suitable technique with relatively simple implementation but they introduce complex nonlinear behavior as well a deeper understanding about the effects of perforated screens on the fluid motion is important to the design of tlds thus several recent efforts were focused on the modeling of the sloshing in tlds with perforated screens such as tait et al 2005 love and tait 2010 molin and remy 2013 among others simulations of the coupled dynamics of main structures and the tlds and the assessment of optimized system performance were performed by kaneko and ishikawa 1999 and tait et al 2008 in liquid storage and transportation systems such as oil platforms shuttle oil tankers lng carriers and floating liquified natural gas flng platforms the occurrence of sloshing is dangerous and highly undesirable since it may damage the tank structures and affect the motion of the vessel while coupled with the loads due to waves wind and current while the sloshing in tlds usually occurs in a limited frequency range close to the building structural vibration mode a much wider range of frequencies associated to winds waves and current must be evaluated in the transport and storage systems thus classification societies usually define very strict rules for the operation of the floating structures for example operations under filling levels between 10 and 70 must be avoided lloyd s register 2012 within this context the control or mitigation of the sloshing is an important issue to the design of the buildings and the floating structures in order to increase the safety of its operations or even enlarging their operation envelopes one common approach consists on the placement of internal structures within the tanks such as baffles or columns other technique consists upon the compartmentalization of tanks by using non watertight bulkheads such as wire screens slat screens and perforated swash bulkheads which are considered more efficient than baffles or columns for sloshing mitigation faltinsen and timokha 2009 in the 70 s focusing on the design of very large crude oil carriers vlccs akita 1967 and sawayanagi and matsumoto 1977a sawayanagi and matsumoto 1977b and sawayanagi and matsumoto 1978 carried out experimental studies and confirmed the effectiveness of the swash bulkheads regarding the flow through perforated bulkheads laws and livesey 1978 observed that the pressure loss caused by the perforations could be modeled as quadratic regarding the flow velocity through the porous bulkhead tait et al 2005 concluded that the phenomenon is highly nonlinear under large motions that often occur in practical applications more recently firoozkoohi 2013 performed a set of experiments for a two dimensional setup of a tank equipped with a slat screen bulkhead under harmonic sway motion considering solidity ratios s n the ratio between the watertight area of the bulkhead and the tank cross section area above 40 and filling ratios of h l 0 4 and 0 12 where h is the filling level and l is the length of the tank on the other hand analytical and semi analytical models were proposed as well firoozkoohi and faltinsen 2010 faltinsen et al 2011a and faltinsen et al 2011b modeled the problem by a potential flow through a multimodal description the tank was divided into two compartments separated by a slat screen that allows the flow between the compartments the blockage coefficient of the flow on the slat screen is estimated by accounting for the correct geometry of slots and slats for a tank with h l 0 4 the analytical results agree qualitatively with the experimental data for small excitations but it is unable to predict accurately both the free surface elevation in resonance conditions and the frequency of the compartmented resonant mode molin and remy 2013 also adopted the potential flow theory and modeled the bulkhead as a porous boundary with quadratic pressure loss only one perforated bulkhead with open area ratio ф 1 s n of 18 was evaluated considering different excitation amplitudes in a tank with h l 0 4 the results show good agreement with the experiments for small amplitude excitations but discrepancies occur for larger amplitude motions as the nonlinearities of the phenomena become more significant despite the analytical approaches can provide valuable insights regarding the general behavior of the sloshing flow on tanks with non watertight bulkheads the accuracy of their results is limited by the simplification hypotheses of potential flow such as the linearized free surface furthermore usually the pressure drop coefficient adopted to reproduce the effect of the bulkhead must be estimated experimentally in the last decades several numerical modelings and simulations to investigate the effects of the perforated bulkheads on sloshing were reported maravani and hamed 2011 developed a simulation system based on finite difference scheme on a staggered grid and volume of fluid vof method for free surface tracking a two dimensional rectangular tank with a slat screen and shallow water depth was simulated the results show very good agreement with experimental results for the force on the tank under relatively small excitation motions firoozkoohi et al 2015 used the open source finite volume simulation system openfoam to study sloshing in a two dimensional rectangular tank equipped with a slat screen with finite water depth h l 0 4 the numerical results presented good agreement with experiments of tanks under small amplitude motions even for the higher resonant frequencies xue et al 2013 performed numerical simulations and experiments of a tank divided by a perforated bottom mounted baffle with one square shaped hole the numerical method adopted was based on a finite difference method fdm the free surface was tracked using the volume of fluid vof technique and the turbulence was modeled by large eddy simulation les from the free surface elevation data the authors concluded that the perforated baffle provided better sloshing mitigation for low frequency motion i e the first mode xue et al 2017 later performed experiments considering perforted baffles and a watertight baffle and provided dynamic pressure measurements for a wide range of frequencies at the probes located both on the tank wall and on the bulkheads yu et al 2019 performed experiments of slat screen bulkheads by considering different open area ratios different slot sizes and different number of bulkheads within the tank for the highly nonlinear shallow water conditions as a result the authors identified among the several combinations of the three parameters the best ones to mitigate sloshing at shallow water condition recently due to their flexibility and effectiveness in modeling highly nonlinear interaction between complex shaped structures and flows with large free surface deformation fragmentation and merging numerical approaches based on lagrangian meshless particle based methods have been adopted to investigate the effects of baffles and internal structures on sloshing tsukamoto et al 2011 simulated the sloshing phenomenon on a two dimensional rectangular tank equipped with an elastically linked baffle by using the moving particle semi implicit mps method koshizuka and oka 1996 chen et al 2016 used the mps method to assess the effectiveness of bottom mounted baffles and ring shaped baffles to suppress sloshing specifically concerning sloshing in tanks with perforated bulkheads cheng et al 2016 adopted the mps method to investigate the effects of the opening area ratio of the bulkheads the results show a gradual transition of the sloshing behavior from the response of a clean tank to that of a tank with a watertight bulkhead as the open area ratio of the perforated bulkhead decreases also a high open area ratio is better to mitigate the sloshing in the second mode while a low open area ratio is better to the first mode however no further discussion on how those behaviors can effectively be used to mitigate and control sloshing were provided since the sloshing inside tanks with perforated bulkheads is an extremely nonlinear phenomenon that may depends on many parameters other than the open area ratio of the bulkhead the objectives of the present work are to carry out a numerical investigation on the possible influence of other parameters such as shape and arrangements of the perforations as well as a wider range of open area ratios and the nonlinearities due to excitation amplitude to determine the optimal geometry of perforated bulkheads that is effective for the sloshing mitigation for these purposes series of simulations based on the mps method were carried out considering a box shaped tank with several geometries of the perforated bulkheads a wide range of excitation frequencies two excitation amplitudes and three filling levels from shallow to high filling level after that the relation between the sloshing response and the parameters was established based on the results optimized parameter ranges that mitigate the sloshing and a formulation providing the optimal distribution of the perforations that minimizes the sloshing responses in all filling levels were obtained finally three models of perforated bulkheads with optimized geometries capable to mitigate the sloshing in a wide range of filling levels and excitation frequencies encompassing the three lowest resonant modes were introduced and evaluated to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed formulation in this way the mechanisms of the sloshing flow through the perforated bulkhead and the optimized solutions for sloshing mitigation are provided 2 numerical method 2 1 governing equations and algorithm the governing equations of the incompressible flow are the continuity equation eq 1 and the navier stokes ns equation eq 2 1 dρ dt ρ u 0 2 d u dt 1 ρ p ϑ 2 u f ρ g where ρ is the fluid density ϑ is the fluid kinematic viscosity p the pressure g the gravity acceleration f any other given field force and u the velocity of a given fluid particle 2 2 discrete differential operators in the moving particle semi implicit mps method the discrete form of the differential operators is obtained based on a weight function that accounts the contribution on the i th particle of a given j th particle inside a compact support which is defined by a neighborhood radius r e several formulations have been proposed for the weight function in the present study the weight function ω r proposed by koshizuka et al 1995 was adopted 3 ω r r e r 1 f o r 0 r r e 0 f o r r e r where r r i r j is the distance between two given particles i and j an important parameter in the mps method is the particle number density p n d the p n d is the summation of the weight function of all the particles inside the neighborhood radius of a given i th particle given each particle has the same mass the particle number density is proportional to the fluid density ρ thus the incompressibility of the flow can be assured by keeping constant the p n d instead of the density the p n d is defined as 4 p n d i j i ω r j r i the gradient of a φ scalar function is presented by the eq 11 and the laplacian is given by the eq 6 5 φ i d p n d 0 j i φ j φ i r j r i 2 r j r i ω r j r i 6 2 φ i 2 d p n d 0 δ j i φ j φ i ω r j r i where p n d 0 is the particle number density related to an initial cubic arrangement of the particles with neighborhood fulfilled by other particles d is the dimension of the problem the correction parameter δ is calculated based on the initial particle configuration and is given by 7 δ v ω r r 2 dv v ω r dv 2 3 boundary conditions two types of boundary conditions were applied in the present study rigid wall and free surface in the mps method the walls of solid bodies can be modeled by rows of particles in this work two types of solid are considered the fixed solid whose velocities are zero both in normal and tangential directions and the solids with prescribed motion whose position and velocity are imposed according to the motion of the solid for the modeling of the free surface the present work adopted the npcd neighborhood particle centroid deviation technique proposed by tsukamoto et al 2016 to identify the free surface particles this technique is based on the two criteria presented by eq 9 the first criterion is related to the particle number density in the case a particle satisfies the first criterion a second criterion is evaluated the second criterion is based on the asymmetry of the particle distribution inside the neighborhood when a particle satisfies the two criteria it is classified as free surface particle 8 i s p n d i β p n d 0 σ i ε l 0 9 σ i i j x i j w i j 2 i j y i j w i j 2 i j z i j w i j 2 i j w i j where s is the set of free surface particles l 0 is the distance between particles β and ε are threshold coefficients of the criteria and σ is the distance between the i th particle and the centroid of the particle distribution inside its neighborhood for the coefficients koshizuka and oka 1996 suggested β 0 97 and tsukamoto et al 2016 recommended ε 0 2 as the most suitable values due to the lagrangian description the kinematic condition of the free surface is satisfied by the motion of the free surface particles and the dynamic boundary condition is imposed by assigning atmospheric pressure to the free surface particles 2 4 algorithm and pressure calculation in the mps method the algorithm is divided into two main parts one explicit and other implicit the first part comprises the explicit calculation using eq 2 except for the pressure gradient to estimate an intermediate velocity particle position and particle number density of all fluid particles the solid motions are imposed in the explicit part as well thereafter and based on this intermediate state of the particles the pressure is implicitly calculated in the second part of the algorithm the coupling between velocity and pressure is performed by a pressure poisson equation ppe to ensure the incompressibility and satisfy the continuity equation the source term in the right hand side of the ppe is based on a constant particle number density condition which can be related to the local variation of the p n d from the p n d 0 the left side of ppe is the laplacian operator that leads to a linear system to determine the pressure of the particle the poisson equation eq 10 is 10 ² p n 1 i α ρ δ t 2 p i n 1 k ρ δ t 2 p n d i p n d 0 p n d 0 where p n d is the particle number density calculated from the particle distribution after the contributions calculated in the explicit part and δ t is the time step a source term based only on the constant p n d condition could present high frequency numerical oscillations caused by the change in the position and number of neighbor particles inside the compact support which are amplified by a factor 1 δ t 2 so a compressibility factor of α 10 8 and a pressure relaxation coefficient k were introduced to mitigate the pressure numerical oscillations the optimized pressure relaxation coefficient depends on the combination of the distance between particles and time step adopted for the simulation and its value will be presented in the description of the numerical models alongside the other simulation numerical parameters from the pressure obtained after the solution of the ppes linear system the correction of the velocity and position of the fluid particles is carried out for this purpose the pressure gradient is calculated by an improved formulation proposed by koshizuka et al 1998 and presented by eq 11 11 p i d p n d 0 j i p j p ˆ i r j r i 2 r j r i ω r j r i where p ˆ i is the minimum value of the pressure among the neighboring particles of the i th particle adopt the minimum pressure p ˆ i instead of the proper pressure p i of the i th particle results in a gradient that is always positive even for an anisotropic particle distribution so there are only repulsive forces among the particles and particle clustering is avoided which improves the numerical stability of the simulation koshizuka et al 1998 the version of the numerical simulation system used herein also takes advantage of some improvements focused on faster and more cost effective processing techniques for the solution of the linear system a preconditioned conjugate gradient pcg technique based on the intel math kernel library mkl pcg implementation is adopted the pcg is a very efficient technique to the solution of very large sparse linear systems such that obtained from the ppe of the mps method the neighborhood particle search is another important bottleneck of the method and an algorithm based on the cell index method quentrec and brot 1973 was used to enhance the efficiency of the computation on the other hand in order to allow the simulation of very high resolution models involving a very large number of particles a hybrid memory simulation system developed by fernandes et al 2015 was adopted for some cases such technique is based on a domain decomposition with particle renumbering to assure load balancing among the nodes of a computer cluster 3 validation the first step of the study is the validation of the mps based simulation system for the simulation of the sloshing phenomenon in tanks with perforated bulkheads for this purpose the experimental results of xue et al 2017 were used as reference the experiments are based on a box shaped tank equipped with several different types of vertical baffles for sloshing mitigation harmonic linear excitations in y direction with a wide range of frequencies were applied among the different tank configurations three of them are of particular interest for this work the tank without baffle the tank with a watertight baffle and the tank with a perforated baffle the configuration main dimensions and the location of two pressure probes of the tank with perforated baffle are presented in the fig 1 the thickness of the baffle is 6 mm and the perforated baffle has one square hole with side of 8 cm for the tank with watertight baffle and the clean tank the basic dimensions and the locations of the pressure probes are the same the natural frequency of the first mode of sloshing for the tank without baffle is ω 1 6 403 r a d s numerical simulations considering harmonic sway motions in the range of frequencies from 0 5 ω 1 to 1 4 ω 1 and amplitude of a 0 01 m were performed for the three different tank configurations regarding the sloshing flow through perforated bulkheads two aspects must be considered to define the resolution of the particle based model the flow past perforated plates and the sloshing itself notwithstanding the flow through perforated plates consists on the computational bottleneck for such problem cheng et al 2016 amaro junior et al 2015 studied a problem with very similar features the performance of perforated breakwaters by using the mps method in the study the convergence for the flow past circular holes was achieved by using a resolution of d l 0 10 where d is the diameter of the holes and l 0 is the distance between particles of the numerical model fonfach et al 2016 investigated the sloshing in a compartmented tank with a single hole bulkhead by two dimensional mps simulations and achieved the numerical convergence with an even lower resolution of d l 0 5 furthermore the numerical results from fonfach et al 2016 were validated against experimental data and presented good agreement even for the complex cases in which the highly nonlinear phenomenon of wave breaking was dominant in the simulations carried out for the validation of the numerical method the resolution adopted was l 0 5 m m i e l s l 0 8 where l s is the side of the square hole of the tank with perforated baffle the time step is t 5 10 3 s and the pressure relaxation coefficient is k 0 045 the simulations were carried out for 30 cycles of the harmonic sway motion in fig 2 the time series of the pressure registered by the two probes are presented for the case of the tank with perforated baffle under excitation with frequency of ω 1 32 ω 1 and amplitude of a 0 01 m the raw pressure signal obtained numerically shows a sinusoidal profile with amplitude and phase closely related to that measured in the experiment so the numerical results present good agreement with experimental data for both the pressure probes p t k and p b k the high frequency oscillations of the computed pressure are typical of particle based simulations and the results obtained here show oscillation magnitudes significantly lower than those of the physical low frequency dynamic pressure variations the maximum dynamic pressure as a function of the excitation frequency is presented in fig 3 for the three tank configurations in order to estimate the maximum dynamic pressure of the mps results only the last 10 cycles of the harmonic sway motion were accounted for the tank without baffle fig 3 a only the pressure probe p t k located in the tank wall is considered and shown in the figure for the tanks with watertight baffle fig 3 b and with perforated baffles fig 3 c in addition to the pressure on the probe p t k the pressure of the probe p b k which is located on the baffle and just above the square shaped perforation is also presented in fig 3 a the experimental data was not provided in the range from 0 98 ω 1 to 1 06 ω 1 due to water spillage out of the tank xue et al 2017 regardless the lack of experimental data in the most violent resonant frequencies the numerical results for the dynamic pressure are very close to the experimental data for the remaining frequency range in the case of the tank with the watertight baffle fig 3 b the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental data as well in the experiments the maximum dynamic pressure at the probe p b k is slightly higher than that for the probe p t k for frequencies higher than 0 85 ω 1 such behavior is also observed in the numerical simulations and the dynamic pressure sharply increases for frequencies above 1 2 ω 1 in both results however the measured maximum dynamic pressure is slightly higher than the computed one for frequencies higher than 1 3 ω 1 for these frequencies a beating in the pressure signal xue et al 2017 was reported in the experiments but it was not observed in the computed results the beating indeed increases the maximum dynamic pressure also the tank geometries with the baffles are in such a way that the tanks are divided in two parts with width to length ratio of 1 1 which is within the range where complex modes due to the amplification of the perturbations in transverse direction such as swirling might occur nevertheless swirling was not observed in the numerical simulations finally and most important the numerical and experimental results presented good agreement for the tank with the perforated baffle fig 3 c the maximum dynamic pressure at the probe p b k becomes higher than that for the probe p t k as the frequency is higher than 1 1 ω 1 for both the simulation and the experiment hence in general the numerical results obtained by using the mps based simulation system presented good agreement with the experimental data presented by xue et al 2017 4 sloshing behavior on tanks with swash bulkheads 4 1 case of study in the present study the basic geometry of the tanks is a box shaped one with length l of 0 9 m and width w and height h of 0 6 m as presented by fig 4 a perforated bulkhead is placed in the mid length of the tank in the longitudinal direction two different geometries of the holes were considered circular and square holes fig 4 a and fig 4 b respectively cases with a tank without bulkhead fig 4 c and with a watertight bulkhead fig 4 d were simulated as well several different layouts of perforated bulkheads were taken into account to determine the effect of the overall open area ratio φ o of the bulkheads and the distribution of the holes on the sloshing the different arrangements of the holes adopted herein could be divided into three basic layouts the layout a is presented by fig 5 and consists in a cluster of holes distributed along n rows and n columns with n 2 3 4 to obtain bulkheads with larger overall open area ratio in the layout b fig 6 additional holes were inserted amid the rows and columns of the layout a finally the layout c consist on n columns of 4 holes with n 1 2 3 fig 7 the sloshing behavior is highly related to the filling level among other aspects hence the analysis was carried out considering three different filling levels h h of 25 h l 0 167 50 h l 0 33 and 75 h l 0 50 where h is the liquid height the three filling levels will be henceforth defined as low intermediate and high filling levels respectively for some arrangements different hole sizes and hole geometries were adopted as well the complete list of the perforated bulkheads evaluated in the present work and their respective overall open area ratios φ o and submerged open area ratios φ s for the three filling levels are presented by table 1 circular holes and table 2 square shaped holes besides the concept of overall open area ratio of the bulkheads it is interesting to introduce two additional parameters open area ratio at the fluid level φ l which is the open area ratio measured locally considering an infinitesimal strip associated to the still filling level h submerged open area ratio φ s which is the ratio between the open area and the total cross section area of the submerged portion of the bulkhead between the bottom of the tank and a given filling level h the nomenclature of each layout consists in three parts separated by hyphens the first part defines the layout of the holes according to figs 5 7 the second part defines the shape of the holes c ircular or s quare and the third part defines the overall open area ratio of the perforated swash bulkhead the tank without bulkhead is called herein as model p100 or clean tank equivalent to a tank with overall open area ratio of 100 and the tank with watertight bulkhead is called model p0 or compartmented tank equivalent to a tank with overall open area ratio of 0 the fig 8 presents the locations of the pressure and wave probes in each simulation a harmonic pitch excitation was imposed to the tank whose center of rotation c is located in the geometric center of the box shaped tank except specifically stated the amplitude of the excitation is θ 0 6 o the free surface elevation was measured by two wave probes located in the longitudinal center plane of the tank y 0 3 m the h1 wave probe is placed 5 mm from the tank left wall and the h2 wave probe is located 5 mm to the left of the bulkhead the pressure was measured by the pressure probe p1 located on the tank left wall 25 mm from the bottom of the tank and 25 mm from the rear wall of the tank simulations considering frequencies ranging from 0 5 hz to 1 75 hz were performed for each filling level and tank model with an interval of 0 025 hz between successive frequencies the frequency range adopted in this analysis covers the first three lowest sloshing resonant modes which are sketched in fig 9 in the present study the first mode n 1 consists on a standing wave with wavelength l λ 1 2 and is defined as the non compartmented first antisymmetric resonant mode fig 9 a the second mode n 2 consists on a standing wave with l λ 1 and could be both the first symmetric mode for the clean tank fig 9 b and the first antisymmetric mode of the compartmented tank fig 9 c the third mode n 3 consists on the standing wave with l λ 3 2 and is the second antisymmetric mode of the clean tank fig 9 d the resonant periods and frequencies for each mode in each filling level can be estimated analytically from the wave dispersion relation of potential airy waves and the estimated values are given in table 3 initial distances between particles of l 0 10 m m was adopted in the present work in order to obtain d l 0 10 for circular holes with d 11 2 c m and l s l 0 10 for square holes with l s 10 c m for such resolution a time step of 0 5 ms and a pressure relaxation coefficient for the ppe of k 0 05 were adopted given the large number of simulations and aiming to reduce the processing time a mps based simulation system with hybrid parallelization by domain decomposition developed by fernandes et al 2015 was used in the present analysis the hybrid parallelization consists on both shared memory and distributed memory frameworks which allows the use of multiple processors per cluster node and multiple nodes of a computer cluster respectively such simulation system enables a more efficient use of the computational resources given its homogeneous load balancing and supra linear scalability fernandes et al 2015 the hardware used to perform the simulations is the computational cluster of the numerical offshore tank laboratory tpn of the university of são paulo usp the cluster has 48 nodes each one contains 20 cores of amd shanghai processors with 2 66 ghz and 128 gb of shared memory by using only one node for each simulation the processing times for a 40 s simulation range from between 4 0 h low filling level and 12 5 h high filling level 4 2 general behavior in cheng et al 2016 the investigations are limited to perforated bulkheads with the a2x2 layout fig 5 a and a range of open area ratios was verified by changing the size of the circular holes as a result insights about the phenomenon were obtained in the present study a wide variety of parameters which includes perforated bulkheads with different hole arrangements hole geometries number of holes and its size were considered to study a broader range of the flow aspects the focus of the present section is to relate the overall effects of perforated swash bulkheads geometrical parameters to the sloshing mitigation at first simulations using four tank configurations were carried out considering excitation amplitude of 6 and excitation frequencies close to the first antisymmetric resonant mode of the clean tank n 1 for three filling ratios h l 0 167 0 33 and 0 50 the tanks are model p0 compartmented tank a4x4 c p44 a3x3 c p56 and model p100 clean tank in fig 10 the graphs of the left and right columns show respectively the time series of the free surface height at the wave probes h1 close to the tank wall and h2 close to the bulkhead the three rows of fig 8 are associated to the three filling levels according to the computed results in general the largest free surface displacements were observed for the clean tank in all the three filling levels as the open area ratio of the perforated bulkhead decreases the maximum free surface height close to the left wall h1 is increasingly mitigated for all the filling levels fig 10 a c e however the computed free surface heights close to the bulkhead left side h2 show that the mitigation occurs for the low filling level fig 10 b while for the intermediate and high filling levels the effects of the open area ratio is almost negligible fig 10 d f such result regarding h2 could be explained by the sloshing behavior in low filling levels in which a travelling wave is formed in the clean tank and the wave amplitude is reduced by damping and or shift of the resonant frequency provoked by the decreasing open area ratio of the bulkhead on the other hand for the intermediate and high filling levels the sloshing consists on a standing wave and the small free surface elevation observed near the bulkhead wall are because the knot of the standing wave is located exactly in the longitudinal center of the tank the second analysis is concerned on the responses of the tanks excited in the frequencies close to the first symmetric resonant mode of the clean tank and the first antisymmetric mode of the compartmented tank n 2 for each filling level fig 11 shows the time series of the free surface height close to the tank wall h1 and bulkhead h2 for such cases for all the filling levels the largest free surface motion is observed for the tank with watertight bulkhead on the other hand under this excitation almost no difference can be observed among the free surface height at h1 and h2 of the clean tank and the tanks with perforated bulkhead moreover the perforated bulkheads provided large mitigation of the free surface heights in low and intermediate filling levels from the time series of the free surface height close to the tank left wall h1 an average double amplitude of its elevation simply denominated as free surface elevation henceforth can be obtained by subtracting the average value of the minimum free surface heights from the average value of the maximum free surface heights in every cycle except the first 10 cycles of the tank harmonic motion which were considered as transient ones and were neglected in the computation of the average values the fig 12 shows the computed free surface elevation at h1 as function of the excitation frequency considering the three filling levels for the clean tank the tank with watertight bulkhead and tanks with perforated bulkheads with open area ratios ranging from 22 to 75 the vertical axis is made dimensionless by dividing the free surface elevation by the hydrostatic variation of the free surface height due to the pitch motion of the clean tank δ h h m a x h m i n l tan θ 0 by considering a local coordinate system attached to the tank that follows its pitch motion the dynamic longitudinal force is calculated as the average value of the difference between the maximum and minimum longitudinal force at each cycle of harmonic motion fig 13 shows the dimensionless longitudinal dynamic force in the frequency domain obtained using the variation of hydrostatic force due to the maximum and minimum pitch inclinations of the clean tank δf x 2 ρ g h 0 l b s i n θ 0 the frequency domain considered in this study can be divided in two parts to simplify the discussion about the results which are illustrated by the two gray shaded areas in each graph the frequencies of the three resonant modes of the clean tank f n 1 f n 2 and f n 3 calculated analytically from the linear potential airy wave theory table 3 are presented by the vertical dashed lines the first part corresponds to the excitation frequencies between 0 5 hz and 1 0 hz and it is related to the first mode n 1 associated the three filling levels for the low frequencies the clean tank and the tanks with perforated bulkheads show essentially hydrostatic behavior and the dimensionless responses tends to one as the frequency approaches the first mode n 1 larger free surface elevations were computed as the open area ratio of the perforated bulkhead increases moreover the frequencies associated to the maximum free surface elevation increase as the open area ratio of the bulkhead increases the second part consists in the frequencies range from 1 0 hz to 1 75 hz for the three filling levels peaks were computed for the tank with watertight bulkhead close to 1 125 hz 1 25 hz and 1 3 hz for the filling ratios h l of 0 167 0 33 and 0 50 respectively and are related to the first antisymmetric mode of the compartmented tank or the second mode n 2 in addition to this in a higher frequency range but with lower magnitude peaks related to the third mode n 3 were computed for the clean tank for the tanks with perforated bulkheads one peak could be identified in the frequency range between the resonant modes n 2 and n 3 as well in such cases the general behavior of the tank with perforated bulkheads tends to resemble the behavior of the clean tank as the open area ratio of the bulkhead increases and therefore presenting lower peaks at a higher frequency in general for the tanks with perforated bulkheads the behavior of the dynamic longitudinal force shows the same tendencies of the free surface elevation for the clean tank in all the three filling levels large amplifications ranging from 3 5 to 4 times the quasi static response were obtained at the first resonant mode n 1 on the other hand for the tank with watertight bulkhead at the second mode n 2 the dynamic component of the force reduces remarkably as the filling level increases in such cases while the amplification of the dynamic force is around 3 5 times the quasi static one for the low filling level the amplification for the high filling level is about only 1 5 times the quasi static response for the high filling level between 1 0 hz and 1 75 hz fig 13 c the difference between the clean tank and the tanks with perforated bulkheads is almost negligible regarding the longitudinal dynamic force in conclusion as the open area ratio of the bulkhead decreases there is a gradual change of the sloshing behavior from that resembling the response of a clean tank to that of a tank with watertight bulkhead thus aiming to reduce the amplification of the fluid motion within the tank perforated bulkheads of low open area ratio provide better results for frequencies close to the first resonant mode n 1 while tanks with perforated bulkheads with high open area ratios provide better results for frequencies close to the second resonant mode n 2 4 3 effects of excitation amplitude in order to verify the effects of the amplitude of the harmonic pitch motion on the sloshing responses of the tanks with perforated bulkheads cases with harmonic pitch motion and a smaller amplitude of 2 were simulated for the clean tank the tank with watertight bulkhead and the tanks with perforated bulkhead with layout a the fig 14 a b c show the responses in the frequency domain of the dimensionless dynamic longitudinal force for the clean tank fig 14 d e f give the result of the tank with watertight bulkhead while figs 15 a b c provide the results of the tank with perforated bulkhead with high open area ratio of 68 and figs 15 d e f are related to the tank with perforated bulkhead with a small open area ratio of 10 in fig 14 a shows that different excitation amplitudes leads to different dimensionless responses in the two resonant modes in the first mode n 1 a strong nonlinear effect is observed the response amplification in the resonance of the case with larger motion amplitude is reduced due to the damping caused by nonlinear free surface effects such as the wave breaking of the travelling wave for the intermediate and high filling levels the effect of the excitation amplitude is relatively small showing a nearly linear response from fig 14 e f for the tank with watertight bulkhead the amplification of the dimensionless response peak due to the small amplitude excitation is larger in the second mode n 2 and occurs at a slightly higher frequency the tank with perforated bulkhead of low open area ratio of 10 fig 15 d e f has a behavior that resembles the tank with the watertight bulkhead but its resonant peaks in the second mode n 2 has significant lower magnitudes than that observed for the tank with watertight bulkhead similarly the behavior of the tank with perforated bulkhead of high open area ratio of 68 fig 15 a b c resembles that of the clean tank but it has significantly lower response amplifications at the first resonant mode n 1 for both tanks with perforated bulkheads the effects of the excitation amplitude are small for the low and the intermediate filling levels but they are almost negligible for the high filling level 4 4 effects of the geometry and the arrangement of the holes in the present section models of perforated bulkhead with similar open area ratios but different hole geometries size number and arrangements are investigated in order to address the effect of such parameters to the sloshing mitigation fig 16 a presents the local open area ratio and the submerged open area ratio as function of the filling level for two models of bulkhead with the same arrangement and overall open area ratio but different hole geometries a2x2 c p69 circular holes and a2x2 s p69 square holes on the other hand fig 16 b shows the submerged open area ratio for three models of perforated bulkheads with similar overall open area ratio but different hole arrangements thus with holes of different sizes in a different number a2x2 c p44 a3x3 c p56 and b3x3 c p50 the different profiles of the open area distribution for circular holes and for square holes are shown by the curves of the local open area ratio at the fluid level φ l in fig 16 a the local open area ratio at the fluid filling ratios of 0 167 and 0 33 are slightly higher for the model with circular holes than the one with square shaped holes nevertheless despite the small differences in the local open area ratios the submerged open area ratios are very similar between equivalent bulkheads for the three filling levels for the same cases shown in fig 16 and fig 17 provides the time series of the computed pressure at probe p1 in the first resonant mode n 1 of the sloshing the raw pressure time series obtained from the particle based simulations were filtered by a low pass filter with threshold of 20 hz in order to provide a clear view of the main harmonics without spurious numerical noise the pressure time series in fig 17 a shows two peaks at each cycle the first peak with higher magnitude is related to the impact of the travelling wave on the tank wall after the impact the fluid flows upwards along the right wall until reaching a maximum height which is followed by the collapse of the water column that generates the second peak of smaller magnitude in general the difference between the pressure time series for the bulkheads with circular and square shaped holes is almost negligible for the three equivalent models of fig 17 b the magnitudes of the pressure variation are similar the submerged open area ratio of the model a3x3 c p56 below the 0 167 filling ratio is slightly higher than those of the other two models refer to fig 16 b as a consequence it has a pressure peak slightly higher than that computed for the other equivalent bulkheads for this model a second pressure peak due the collapse of the fluid column similar to that occurred in the high overall open area ratio bulkheads of fig 17 a was also computed the graphs of the longitudinal dynamic force as function of excitation frequency for the equivalent bulkheads with different arrangements are presented by fig 18 at the three different filling levels the computed longitudinal dynamic force of the equivalent bulkheads which have almost same overall open area ratio are very similar despite the large difference in number size and arrangement of the holes the general behavior of the longitudinal dynamic force is very close between model a2x2 c p44 and b3x3 c p50 and small differences occur only in the vicinity of the resonant frequencies in the bulkhead with a larger number of holes b3x3 c p50 the fluid flows through a larger amount of edges than in the models with a smaller number of holes a2x2 c p44 and nonlinear effects such as viscous damping flow separation and vortex shedding are expected to be more significant however such tendency was not clearly identified in our results so despite the different number and size of the holes the models with slightly higher open area ratio show higher longitudinal dynamics forces at the first resonant mode on the other hand the models with slightly lower open area ratio presented higher longitudinal forces at the second resonant mode 4 5 discussion about the damping effects of the perforated bulkheads vertical baffles and bulkheads are extensively used to mitigate the sloshing they affect the flow in different ways such as by restraining the flow and intensifying viscous damping through flow separation and vortex formation while the first is related to changes in the added mass of the mechanical system the second is related to its damping thus it is interesting and useful the better understanding of the contribution of each one of these aspects regarding sloshing mitigation by perforated bulkheads in the previous section as square holes have about 12 more perimeter of sharp edges than circular holes with equivalent area it is expected higher formation of vortices in the bulkheads with square holes and as consequence a slightly more damped flow however in general the difference was negligible similar results were observed for the effect of the arrangement of the holes and its number in general regardless the number size and arrangement of the holes bulkheads with similar open area ratios presented very close results for sloshing mitigation fig 18 such results indicate that the vortex formation has a relatively smaller contribution to the damping provided by the perforated baffles if compared to the effects due to the flow restriction in the first and third sloshing resonant modes as the velocities normal to the bulkheads near the free surface are larger than near the bottom of the tank the bulkhead which provides more restriction to the flow close to the free surface is expected to be more effective for sloshing mitigation in order to verify this hypothesis bulkheads with equivalent submerged open area ratio but with nonuniform distribution of the local open area ratio along the tank depth i e with different local open area ratios near the free surface and close to the tank bottom can be considered such is the case of yu et al 2019 experiments which used slat screen bulkheads with three different open area ratios and for each one two different sizes of slots the results show that for equivalent open area ratios the cases using large slots with the slot height about a third of the depth and placed very close to the free surface the amplitudes of free surface motion is higher for the first and third modes than the cases using small slots as a result the experiments corroborated the hypothesis it is important to emphasize the particular aspects of the bulkheads evaluated in the present work first the distribution of the holes was proposed in order to be the most homogeneous and symmetrical as possible to avoid non uniform open area distribution along the depth second the largest holes are only 6 times larger than the smallest holes third even the smallest holes studied are large enough in order to avoid that very complex phenomena become predominant in the flow such as capillarity in the jet flow through the holes viscous damping and sub particle scale effects of the turbulence then for the range of open area ratios and considering the abovementioned features of the bulkheads investigated in the present study the results obtained in the previous sections and from other works in the literature strongly indicate that the most relevant geometrical parameter of the perforated bulkheads is the open area ratio and the restriction of the flow is the most fundamental contribution provided by perforated bulkheads and other vertical baffles in general to the sloshing mitigation such aspect is strongly affected by the relation between the distribution of the open area ratio in vertical direction as the flow velocity amid the tank decreases with the depth thus the focus of the following sections is the investigation of the relation between open area ratio and the tank depth in order to develop a perforated bulkhead with an optimized open area distribution for sloshing mitigation and control 4 6 optimum submerged open area ratio of swash bulkhead for sloshing mitigation according to the responses in the frequency domain of the free surface elevation fig 12 and the dynamic longitudinal force fig 13 the open area ratio of the swash perforated bulkhead affects both the magnitude of the peak resonant response and the frequency at which it occurs so based on the division of the frequency domain into two parts the first part comprising the first resonant mode n 1 from 0 5 hz to 1 0 hz and the second part containing the second resonant mode n 2 and the third resonant mode n 3 from 1 0 hz to 1 75 hz the magnitude and frequency of the peak of the curves were identified for each case and each filling level in fig 19 the resonant frequencies in the two regions of the frequency domain in relation to the perforated bulkhead submerged open area ratio are presented the general behavior is very similar for the three filling levels the resonant frequency increases monotonically as the submerged open area ratio of the bulkhead increases the increase rate is higher for low submerged open area ratios and for submerged open area ratios above 50 the frequency of the peaks tends towards an asympotote in the curve for the first mode the asymptote is the frequency of the first antisymmetric mode f n 1 of the clean tank in the curve for the second mode the resonant peak for zero open area ratio is the frequency of the second mode of the clean tank f n 2 and tends to the frequency of the third mode of the clean tank f n 3 as the open area ratio approaches to 100 the numerical data presented a good correlation with the dashed lines which are regressions curves obtained by adopting an exponential curve in the form f ф c 1 c 2 e c 3 ф where c 1 c 2 and c 3 are positive constant values considering the computed dynamic longitudinal force fig 20 provides the magnitudes of the response amplification of the first and second resonant peaks as function of the submerged open area ratio of the bulkhead besides in fig 21 the magnitude of the free surface elevation amplifications of the resonance peaks in relation to the submerged open area ratio of the bulkhead is presented in both groups of diagrams the results for the three filling levels and the two pitch excitation amplitudes are shown in both figs 20 and 21 regarding the first resonant peaks the amplification magnitude increases monotonically as the submerged open area ratio of the bulkhead increases the increase rate becomes larger as the submerged open area ratio increases concerning the second resonant peaks the opposite behavior is obtained the magnitude of the amplification is reduced monotonically as the submerged open area ratio increases and the decrease rate is larger for small submerged open area ratios similarly to the approximate formulation for the frequency of the resonant peak fig 19 the computed results of the response amplification as a function of submerged open area ratio were approximated by exponential curves which are shown in the graphs by dashed lines with correlation factor above 95 for all the cases focusing on the sloshing mitigation in the entire frequency domain the results indicate a clear tradeoff in relation of the submerged open area ratio of the perforated bulkhead while by reducing the submerged open area ratio of the perforated bulkhead the sloshing is mitigated in the first resonant mode n 1 the sloshing is increased in the second mode n 2 compartmented on the other hand by increasing the submerged open area ratio of the perforated bulkhead the sloshing is mitigated in the second resonant mode n 2 compartmented but increased in the first resonant mode n 1 notwithstanding the two exponential curves in each diagram intersects each other at an optimal point in which the overall minimum value for the amplification at the resonance for a given filling level occurs from this point the so called optimum submerged open area ratio for a given filling level can be obtained it is interesting to observe that the magnitude of the amplification at the optimum submerged open area ratio is lower than two times the quasi static free surface elevation or the hydrostatic variation of longitudinal force for all the filling levels moreover it exceeds 1 5 times only for the low filling level thus the optimum submerged open area ratio is one that results in the lowest overall peak magnitudes of longitudinal force and free surface elevations in the entire frequency range comprising the lowest three resonant modes of sloshing summarizing in the context of the present work considering the case of liquid storage and transportation systems the smaller the liquid motion is the better in the context of tlds kaneko and ishikawa 1999 tait et al 2008 a different concept of optimum open area ratio must be adopted because some level of fluid oscillation is required in order to make the tld work as a dynamic damper and transfer energy from the tank to the main structural system in such case a more complex balance between damping and inertia must be achieved whilst only the damping is the prevalent feature in the present analysis the results obtained in this analysis are consistent with firoozkoohi and faltinsen 2010 the authors studied the case of a two dimensional rectangular tank equipped with a slat screen only for the filling ratio of h l 0 4 for very small motion amplitudes an optimized solidity ratio of s n 90 was obtained which is equivalent of an open area ratio of approximately φ 10 the optimum submerged open area ratio calculated by the present study for the filling ratio of h l 0 5 for the motion amplitude of θ 2 o is around 15 the results of figs 20 and 21 indicate that the optimum submerged open area ratios decrease as the filling level increases fig 22 shows the optimum submerged open area ratio as a function of filling ratio h l the curve with solid circles is related to the free surface elevation in a large pitch motion θ 0 6 o in general the optimum submerged open area ratio is slightly lower for the motion with smaller amplitude however a particular behavior is observed for the free surface elevation at low filling levels and large motion amplitude as consequence of the highly nonlinear phenomenon of a travelling wave which is largely damped by wave breaking and runup along the tank sidewall and the bulkhead notwithstanding the curves associated to the free surface elevation under small excitation amplitude and the curves of the dynamic longitudinal forces show similar behavior and could be approximated by exponential curves as well in order to encompass the optimum submerged open area ratio obtained from the four curves a lower and an upper envelope is defined as a range of optimum submerged open area ratio as a function of the filling level and shown in fig 22 by the shaded area using the average value of the upper and the lower limits of the range of optimum submerged open area ratio the regression curve of optimum submerged open area ratio which is shown as a dashed line in fig 22 is obtained by adopting the exponential equation provided in eq 12 as a result the empirical formula for the optimum submerged open area ratio is obtained as function of the dimensionless filling ratio h l in which c 1 65 3 and c 2 2 5 12 ф o p t c 1 e c 2 h l the fitted relation of eq 12 is suitable for box shaped tanks with the filling ratios from 0 167 to 0 5 as the relation was interpolated from the results obtained in this interval notwithstanding the extrapolation for higher filling ratios h l 0 5 is deemed as suitable as well because it has a logarithmic profile that lean to a constant value as the filling ratio increases moreover despite the lower limit for the deep liquid condition is defined as h l 1 0 faltinsen and timokha 2009 for the case in which h l 0 5 the effect of the tank bottom on the flow is already small 5 swash bulkheads with optimum submerged open area ratio the previous section was focused on the investigation of the sloshing mitigation due to perforated swash bulkheads the models adopted for that purpose were based on several holes distributed in different arrangements along a bulkhead in the longitudinal center of the tank for sake of simplicity arrangements considering uniform distribution of the perforations were adopted so that the open area ratio is almost independent to the filling levels in other words the submerged open area ratio of the bulkheads is almost constant regardless of the filling height and it is also very close to the overall open area ratio nevertheless the results of section 4 6 show that an optimum submerged open area ratio could be defined as function of filling ratio h l as a further step on the investigation of the effects of the perforated bulkheads on the sloshing mitigation the focus of the present section is to apply the insights obtained by the previous results in order to propose and evaluate models of perforated bulkhead with a submerged open area ratio distribution following the optimum submerged open area ratio for all the filling levels and thus being capable of mitigate the sloshing in the entire frequency range comprising the three first resonant modes of sloshing regardless the filling condition 5 1 models the fig 23 presents three proposed layouts of swash bulkhead whose submerged open area ratio is within the range of optimum submerged open area ratio for all the filling levels the model opt a was proposed following the same concept of the previous sections with distribution of the holes in the bulkhead based on the amplitude modulation the holes are circular and the radius of the holes in the lower row are r 2 8 46 c m and the radius of the holes in the intermediate and top rows are r 1 5 24 c m with the dimension of the smaller holes limited by the convergence criteria of the numerical model of d l 0 10 despite not analyzed herein due to much higher computational cost required alternative hole distributions can also be considered using larger amounts of smaller holes based on frequency modulation the model opt b was proposed based on the idea of vertical strips with variable width in order to make the open area ratio fits within the range of optimum submerged open area ratio in the present study only two strips were used to model the bulkhead opt b due to the restriction imposed by the numerical model convergence criteria of δ l l 0 10 that must be matched in the narrowest part of the strip where δ l is the minimum linear dimension of the hole in the fig 23 b c the main dimensions are b 1 18 c m b 2 12 c m b 3 10 c m and b 4 7 5 c m both models opt a and opt b show a watertight section above h l 0 50 because the previous analysis were restricted for filling levels below that so a model opt c following the same concept of opt b was proposed to address such situation with the strip opening reaching the top of the bulkhead fig 24 a shows the local open area ratio in liquid levels for the three proposed bulkhead models fig 24 b illustrates the submerged open area ratio of the bulkheads of the three proposed models as a function of filling level just to remind the submerged open area ratio of the bulkheads consists on the ratio between the total area of the openings below the still water level and the total area of the bulkhead below such level the range of optimum submerged open area ratio is indicated by the gray region on the graphs the dark gray area is between the filling ratios from h l 0 167 to h l 0 50 evaluated previously while the light gray areas were defined by the extrapolation of the tendency for higher and lower filling levels the open area ratio of the submerged area of all the three proposed bulkhead models fits inside the range of optimum submerged open area ratio between h l 0 167 and h l 0 50 5 2 results fig 25 provides snapshots of the particle simulation in the first mode n 1 at the low filling level for the clean tank and the three tanks with optimized swash bulkhead geometries in the time frame presented by the snapshots violent impact of the travelling wave on the side walls occurs in the clean tank while relatively calm fluid motions with only very small free surface displacements were computed for the three tanks with optimized perforated bulkheads the fig 26 shows snapshots of the particle simulation for the tank with watertight bulkhead and other three tanks with optimized swash bulkhead in the second mode n 2 for the high filling level the free surface reaches the tank ceiling for the watertight bulkhead and both opt a and opt b models the impact on the ceiling is violent enough to generate splash in the tank with watertight bulkhead and the opt b swash bulkhead model fig 26 c the jet flow through the circular holes cause the highly nonlinear free surface profile observed in the second frame for the opt a model fig 26 b finally the opt c model presented the smallest free surface displacements for the high filling level at the second mode n 2 the graphs of the dimensionless free surface elevation and the dimensionless dynamic longitudinal force in the frequency domain are given by fig 27 and fig 28 respectively the results were obtained considering harmonic pitch excitation of 6 amplitude in the graphs the responses obtained by using the proposed optimized bulkheads were compared to the responses of the clean tank and the tank with watertight bulkhead the model opt c was simulated only for the high filling level because its behavior for the low and intermediate filling levels is assumed as equivalent of those by the opt b bulkhead for the low and the intermediate filling levels all the proposed models presented remarkable sloshing mitigation in the range of frequencies close to the two resonant modes n 1 and n 2 with amplifications of the free surface elevation not exceeding 1 5 times the hydrostatic free surface displacement as shown in fig 27 a and fig 27 b nevertheless for the high filling level fig 27 c all the proposed models lead to excellent sloshing mitigation in the first mode n 1 while slightly larger free surface elevation amplifications occurs in the second mode n 2 for the models opt a 2 times and opt b 2 5 times in relation to the tank with watertight bulkhead 1 8 times only the model opt c is capable of mitigating the sloshing also in the high filling condition at the second resonant mode n 2 compartmented with free surface elevation amplification less than 1 5 times the quasi hydrostatic free surface displacement in addition to these results resonant frequencies of the first resonant mode n 1 in the models with optimized swash bulkhead geometries are lower than that of the clean tank such result observed for high filling levels indicate that due to runup provoked by the perforated bulkhead besides the open area ratio distribution below the still water level the open area ratio just above this level has also an important effect on the flow and should be considered to achieve better sloshing mitigation in high filling levels since both bulkheads opt a and opt b are watertight just above the height of 75 the flow behavior resembled those of the watertight bulkhead at high filling levels with large fluid motions at the second resonant mode n 2 in conclusion an optimized model of watertight bulkhead was obtained in the model opt c which reduces the amplification of both free surface elevation and dynamic longitudinal force to less than 1 5 times for all the evaluated filling levels in the entire frequency range comprising the first three sloshing modes of a box shaped tank as predicted in section 4 6 as mentioned above other bulkhead models with different perforation geometries such as small holes distributed based on frequency modulation which follow the range of optimum submerged open area ratio can also be considered in order to achieve a similar performance on sloshing mitigation 5 3 full scale test case as recommend by the international towing tank conference 2017 the sloshing pressure obtained from reduced scale models can be scaled to full scale by adopting the froude scaling karimi et al 2014 except for some specific situations such as local impacts close to the free surface in which complex phenomena like air trapping might occur and scaling laws concerning compressibility of the liquid and the gas must also be taken into account karimi et al 2014 since the focus of the sloshing mitigation by the perforated swash bulkheads is the restriction of the global sloshing loads the contribution of the local hydrodynamic impact phenomenon might be neglected however as the perforated bulkheads introduce additional complexity to the sloshing phenomenon it is relevant to verify the validity of the froude scaling in order to extend the obtained optimized open area ratio to full scale naval and offshore structures for this purpose the dimensions of a typical suezmax tanker were considered the cargo tanks of the vessel are around 40 m width and they are divided into two compartments by a watertight bulkhead at its longitudinal center plane based on these dimensions and considering a box shaped tank the relation between the full scale model and the reduced scale model adopted in the present work is 1 45 then in order to investigate the scaling effects numerical simulations with full scale models of the tank with watertight bulkhead model p0 and the tank with optimized perforated bulkhead opt c were carried out fig 29 presents the results for the dimensionless dynamic longitudinal force of the full scale cases 1 1 and the corresponding results previously obtained using the reduced scale models 1 45 the harmonic excitation motion has amplitude of 6 and the dimensionless motion frequencies in fig 29 are defined in relation to the analytical estimation of the first non compartmented mode in fig 29 the dimensionless longitudinal dynamic force of the full scale opt c model is slightly larger than that calculated for the reduced scale model for f f 1 2 0 at the filling ratio h l 0 167 fig 29 a the opposite is observed for f f 1 1 6 at the filling ratio h l 0 5 fig 29 c nevertheless the general behavior presented good agreement between the different scales for both models and the froude scaling worked relatively well hence both the proposed optimized geometry of swash bulkhead and the relation of the optimized submerged open area ratio as function of filling ratio eq 12 could be applied to full scale conditions moreover these results provide further evidence that the nonlinear viscous damping such as skin friction and vortex generation introduce only secondary contributions to the effect of the perforated baffle otherwise larger discrepancies between the reduced scale and the full scale simulation might be expected 6 conclusions the focus of the present work is to investigate the effectiveness of perforated swash bulkheads to mitigate the sloshing for sake of simplicity the basic setup adopted herein was a reduced scale model of a clean box shaped tank and its variants equipped with perforated and watertight bulkheads as the investigation approach numerical simulations based on a fully lagrangian particle based method which is flexible and effective to model phenomena involving large free surface nonlinearities and complex geometries were carried out based on the results from a comprehensive investigation in which the effects of the open area ratio of the bulkhead the filling level of the tank and the excitation frequency were clarified an empirical relation of the optimized submerged open area ratio as function of filling ratio was proposed the optimum submerged open area ratio is defined as the ratio that minimizes the sloshing in the frequency range covering the three lowest sloshing resonant modes concerning the tradeoff between the small open area ratios which are more effective to mitigate the non compartmented resonant mode and large open area ratios which are more effective to mitigate the compartmented resonant mode the effectiveness of the proposed relation was later confirmed by numerical simulations of tank models with perforated bulkheads that follow the optimized submerged open area distributions as the behavior of the phenomenon in full scale models could be assessed by froude scaling the optimized submerged open area ratio distribution obtained using reduced scale models can also be straightforwardly applied for full scale tank designs in a wide range of practical engineering applications other useful insights about the general behavior of the phenomenon could be inferred from the parameter analysis as well first the sloshing behavior was essentially affected by the submerged open area ratio of the bulkhead almost regardless of the arrangement geometry number and size of the holes second despite the non linearity of the sloshing response the general behaviors of the sloshing response are similar for different motion amplitudes finally the shift of the natural period of the non compartmented and the compartmented resonant modes as consequence of the submerged open area ratio of the bulkhead was also addressed such shift of the natural periods provides useful information for some engineering applications such as tlds in which the natural period of the tank should match the resonant period of the building structural vibration for efficient mitigation acknowledgements the authors are grateful to the financial support provided by petrobras during the

22651,inland vessels operate in a wide range of waterway conditions and sometimes extremely shallow water where the propeller inflow becomes critical knowledge of the wake field is of utmost importance for a proper and efficient design of the propulsion system to gain a deeper understanding of the inflow conditions at different water depths four representative inland vessels with the dimensions of a large rhine vessel and different stern shapes were designed and built as scale models for the detailed determination of the complex flow phenomena at the stern a complementary approach of model tests stereo particle image velocimetry 3c piv and ranse cfd calculations was chosen while the measured resistance profiles differ negligibly between the designs there are significant differences in the power demand the integral wake fraction from the propulsion test does not adequately describe this behaviour finally experimental and numerical flow fields could be compared for a deeper insight keywords shallow water wake field scale model tests piv ranse inland ships 1 introduction on the european inland waterways with a total length of about 40 000 km nowadays operate about 19 000 vessels even though inland navigation has only a small share in the total modal split its economic interdependence is very important in certain transport chains from a german perspective this applies in particular to the supply of raw materials along the rhine longer periods with extreme high and low water levels such as in 2018 show this interdependence and sometimes lead to economic losses inland navigation is also very important from an environmental point of view with its energy efficiency and low cost per tonne kilometre and is intended to relieve road traffic depending on their size self propelled inland vessels can replace 40 to 120 trucks on the roads large pushed convoys even up to 650 the design of inland waterway vessels has always been a major challenge as these vessels have to operate safely and efficiently in a wide range of environmental conditions hekkenberg 2013 gives a good overview of the most important factors determining the economic viability of inland navigation and inland vessels to meet these requirements various designs have been developed incorporating short aft hulls highly loaded ducted propellers and devices like propeller tunnels and aprons to avoid ventilation at small draughts modern inland vessels can operate at draughts going below the propeller diameter zöllner 2000 nevertheless the hydrodynamics of these full hullforms with large block coefficients are challenging and strongly influenced by the underkeel clearance the resulting power demand limits the energy efficiency and may significantly affect the economic efficiency with increasing fuel costs due to the permanently changing sailing conditions optimization based on operational experience with existing vessels is very limited in inland navigation some vessels are studied using cfd computations and model tests which allows improving major unfavourable ship lines before the vessels are built at full scale however these investigations are limited to individual new built ships and very few sailing conditions additionally no data is available for older vessels which shall be equipped with updated propulsion systems extensive tests like piv measurements are out of scope for most new built projects to provide ship designers and propeller manufactures with generic information of these phenomena four representative inland vessels were designed and manufactured in model scale all designs have the overall dimensions of a large rhine vessel and are propelled by ducted propellers mounted on conventional shafts this family of vessels was compared extensively using computational and experimental fluid dynamics cfd and efd at three different water depths 2 hull geometries in order to cover a wide range of hull geometries of the existing fleet four ships with the dimensions l 110 m b 11 44 m and t m a x 3 2 m and differing stern shapes were designed the stern shapes resemble existing ships and all ships share the same bow shape all ships use ducted propellers in conventional shaft arrangement two designs are single screw vessels while the other two have propellers and ducts on port and starboard side the latter is usually beneficial at low draught or very shallow water and fulfils redundancy requirements for some waterways one design strategy follows tunnelled aft shapes m2051 m2053 the other flat aft shapes m2052 m2054 these four designs were built and equipped in scale 1 by 16 for model tests the rudders were omitted for cfd and efd all investigations were performed at a draught of 2 8 m the different aft shapes are shown in fig 1 the basic shape parameters of the four vessels are shown in table 1 despite the different geometries displacement and block coefficient are similar and allow extensive comparisons 3 towed model tests extensive model tests were done in dst s large shallow water basin this testing facility is 200m long 10m wide has a concrete bottom and can be operated at any water depth up to 1 20m a unique feature of this basin is the observation tunnel with 60 mm thick acrylic windows underneath the towing track the resistance and self propulsion tests were performed at three water levels corresponding to 7 5m 5 0m and 3 5m in full scale for all ship models bare hull resistance tests were carried out at all three water depths in preparation of the propulsion tests propulsor open water tests were carried out for the two propeller duct combinations used for all four ships and three water depths self propulsion tests were subsequently carried out for ship velocities analogous to the resistance tests the british method was applied with three propeller rates for each model speed during the resistance and propulsion tests video recordings were made while passing the observation tunnel the models were equipped with woollen threads at some exposed points to visualize the flow field at the stern of the ships 4 particle image velocimetry particle image velocimetry piv is a powerful non invasive laser based method for the measurement of fluid flows small particles in the water serve as tracer particles which are illuminated in a thin light sheet by a pulsed laser the reflections are captured with high speed video cameras in a stereo set up 3c piv with two images per camera taken at a defined time interval and using cross correlation the vector field in all three spatial directions can be determined thus the fluid flow in the observed area can be resolved with high precision a detailed description of this measurement technique can be found in raffel et al 2007 optical access at small underkeel clearance and typical aft body shapes is very limited and the piv system used at dst is not suitable for underwater use therefore it is installed in the observation tunnel mentioned above it consists of an innolas spitlight piv dpss frequency doubled nd yag laser with two diode pumped cavities due to the diode pumping the beam quality is almost independent of orientation and motions with a double pulse frequency of 100hz the pulse energy is about 60mj two phantom v9 1 high speed cmos cameras with 2mp resolution and 6gb internal memory each are used with 50 or 85 mm lenses mounted on scheimpflug adapters 14bit colour depth allows sufficiently high contrast even in most challenging applications polyamid particles with a diameter of 100 μ m were used as tracer acquisition and post processing were done with different subversions of the software package davis8 by lavision the basic piv setup in the view from above and from the side with first surface mirrors mounted in the basin is shown in fig 2 the recording of the nominal wake is basically easier since the cameras can look at the propeller plane from behind this path is blocked when recording the effective wake through duct and propeller in this case the ship s heading and direction of travel are reversed and the cameras look from the other side at the plane in front of the propeller especially in shallow water this is very difficult due to the shape of the ship in order to minimize reflections with high intensity on the surface of the ship model all models and appendages are coated with a fluorescent paint the wave length of the light is shifted into the orange colour spectrum and filtered out via bandpass filters on the lenses in this way disturbing reflections from the surface can be significantly reduced and particles that are close to the surface can be detected the conditions in the wake of ship hulls with flow separation are highly unsteady coherent vortices of different length scales detach from the ship s surface and travel downstream thus instantaneous vector fields from piv are not representative and do not suffice for the validation of cfd computations to reduce the uncertainty of piv data and to derive adequate results for further analysis as many vector fields as possible need to be compared filtered and averaged this is a challenging task for applications where the stationary equipment is passed by the model here at least ten test runs were performed for each condition different model and or water depth each quadruple of raw images was processed independently afterwards three consecutive vector fields for each run were averaged with the sampling rate of 100hz this equals two periods of 0 01s plus the interframe interval in time and a spatial averaging over e g 20 mm at a towing speed corresponding to 14km h at full scale the averaged data is then averaged again over all performed test runs for the same conditions due to the challenges mentioned above these measurements were only carried out with the single screw ship m2052 and the twin screw ship m2054 at all three water depths in addition depending on the water depth only one ship speed was investigated at which the sinkage and trims determined from the resistance and self propulsion tests were fixed 5 numerical computations to investigate the hydrodynamic performance and the fluid flow at the stern all four ships were compared using ranse computations for this purpose the commercial software packages ansys fluent and ansys cfx were used this software is based on the finite volume method and solves the integral equations for the conservation of mass momentum and energy in this technique the volume of interest is divided into a huge number of small elements called control volumes besides the k ω sst turbulence model from menter 1994 the k ε model was also used in addition to the calculation of pressure and velocity fields the wave elevation was calculated using the volume of fluid method the dynamic floating position i e trim and sinkage due to forward speed was also considered a detailed description of the numerical calculation methodology can be found in ferziger and perić 2002 in order to gather all gradients of the fluid and to resolve the free surface elevation a large number of elements was necessary the numbers of nodes for the computational domain varied between 4 and 6 million to reduce the number of cells hybrid grids were used the far field was discretized with a structured grid consisting of hexahedrons and the domain near the ship hull was discretized using tetrahedrons in combination with prism layers at the wall a propeller model based on the experimentally determined open water characteristics was used to represent the propeller effect all computations were carried out for the water levels 7 5m and 3 5m 6 results propellers positioned in the viscous wake operate in a complex and inhomogeneous inflow shallow water effects strongly alter this wake field with reducing underkeel clearance the flow passing between the waterway bottom and the hull is more and more blocked and the water needs to be drawn in from the sides for the analysis of the wake conditions of the ship s hull which is decisive for the inflow conditions to the propeller the consideration of the wake fraction w derived with the thrust identity approach is well established it is calculated as follows 1 w 1 v a v here v a is the axial inflow velocity and v is the inflow velocity in an undisturbed environment which usually corresponds to the ship velocity v s the following considerations of hydrodynamic flow conditions basically use this dimensionless ratio 6 1 towed model tests fig 3 initially shows the predicted ship resistance of all four ships at all three water depths the differences between the best and worst ship design are in the range of about 20 at a water depth of 3 5m however all designs are close together one of the most relevant characteristic numbers is the power demand for a given speed fig 4 shows the plots of delivered power against ship speed for all models and the three tested water depths the well known disproportionate increase of power demand with speed becomes more pronounced while the attainable ship speed is more and more reduced with decreasing water depth while the single screw design m2051 performs best in all test conditions the results for the other three designs are not straightforward they swap order with changing water depth the twin screw design m2053 is very close to the reference m2051 at high water depth but performs worst with small underkeel clearance the other twin screw design m2054 is worst with sufficient water between hull and waterway bottom but doing well in shallow water conditions looking at the magnitude of differences between the designs clearly demonstrates the need for proper hydrodynamic investigations for vessels operating in confined water at 3 5m water depth almost a factor of 2 can be found in the power demand between the best and the worst design even though the resistance curves are relatively close this effect must therefore result from the interaction behaviour of the ship s hull and propeller the thrust identity approach was used for all self propulsion tests to compare the operating conditions with the open water tests with the non dimensional thrust coefficient k t t ρ n 2 d 4 the corresponding advance coefficient j v a n d can be read from the propulsor open water characteristics using the known propeller rate n the corresponding axial inflow velocity v a is derived and the wake fraction w calculated according to eq 1 the results are plotted in fig 5 for the full scale ship speeds 12km h at 3 5m depth 14km h at 5 0m and 16km h at a water depth of 7 5m there is a clear tendency towards increasing wake fractions in low water depths however this effect is much more pronounced for the single screw vessels and especially for m2052 considering the results of the delivered power the integral wake fraction does not lead to a clear evaluation of the hull propeller interaction accordingly a high wake fraction is not automatically synonymous with an inefficient ship design as this approach does not take into account the inhomogeneous distribution in the wake field and the in plane velocity components v and w induced by the hull s wake more detailed analysis is required based on detailed flow measurements and or cfd computations snapshots of the underwater video recordings also allow only a limited qualitative evaluation fig 6 shows for the model m2053 that a tendency to flow around the tunnel edge can be observed in shallow water 6 2 detailed flow measurements and numerical computations fig 7 shows a comparison of the cfd results with the k ω sst turbulence model above and the k ε model middle with piv measurements below for m2052 with ship velocity 16km h at 7 5m water depth the non dimensional wake fraction is illustrated with colour contours while the in plane components v and w are presented as vectors in a similar graph fig 8 shows the results for m2052 with ship velocity 12km h at a water depth of 3 5m the turbulent flow in the experiment smears out the wake shadow of the stern tube clearly visible in the cfd results at the larger water depth the masking of the upper edge of the propeller tunnel can be recognized in the vector fields from piv measurements acceptable agreement can be seen for both cases the overall level of wake fractions matches well however it is noticeable that in this particular case the k ε model shows better similarities than the widely used k ω sst model the latter involves automatic switching from a k ω model in the viscous sublayer to a k ε model in the far field at this point it can only be assumed that switching based on the default settings does not work sufficiently in this particular case fig 9 shows the comparison of the experimentally determined model resistance compared to the numerical calculations for m2052 and two water depths while the deviations in deeper water are around 5 the resistance in shallow water is systematically underestimated by the calculations the k ω sst model was used in the calculations of the ship resistance comparisons with the k ε model showed even worse results for the extreme shallow water case cfd simulations based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations do not resolve the complex transient flows in the detached flow behind a ship s hull instead the turbulence effects are modelled as steady state flow the consideration of possible areas with reversed fluid flow at the stern of m2052 in fig 10 which can give a first indication of separation zones shows large differences for both turbulence models the choice of the turbulence model therefore has a major influence on the numerical solution the deviations in the wake and resistance calculations show that for this particular case the use of the standard turbulence models with the corresponding default settings does not automatically provide reliable data in addition the quality of the results is highly dependent on the right choice of local grid resolution and calculation parameters for the calculation of the nominal wake field the k ε model shows good agreement and is therefore used for further calculations figs 11 and 12 show the numerical calculation of the effective wake field using the k ε model in front of the propeller and the associated piv measurements for the model m2052 at two water depths the plane under consideration is half a propeller diameter in front of the propeller the agreement between calculation and measurement is also quite good difficulties arise due to the partial shadowing of the measuring area by the propeller shaft and the ship s hull in the case of shallow water in fig 12 an over prediction of the axial inflow through the propeller model is evident due to the masking in some piv measurements especially for the twin screw vessels the cfd results are used for further analysis figs 13 and 14 show the effective wake field of all ships in full scale for the highest and lowest considered water depth for all numerically determined vector fields it can be seen that the water depth has a significant influence on the inhomogeneity of the fluid flow at the stern the figures also show that in case of twin screw ships the influence of the viscous wake of the ship hull is concentrated on the area between the propellers the inflow to the propeller is therefore only slightly influenced for these ships contrary to the wake fraction w where only the axial component is taken into account the calculations also provide information about the velocity components in y and z direction these components have a considerable influence on the flow conditions to the propeller especially in shallow water the knowledge of these components is therefore of crucial importance for the design of a suitable propeller 7 conclusion the detailed investigations show that the stern shape has a significant influence on the power requirement of inland waterway vessels at variable water depths furthermore it should be noted that there is no consistent trend the design of an inland waterway vessel must therefore be carried out on an individual basis taking into account the boundary conditions the classic evaluation of the interaction of ship hull and propeller with towed model tests is not straight forward especially for shallow water day to day testing experience shows that for many inland ships in shallow water sometimes no advance coefficient can be identified by classic thrust or torque identity comparing with the open water characteristics behind the vessel sailing at a reasonable speed the propeller inflow is even worse than at zero speed in the open water test piv measurements can provide detailed information for this purpose but are very time consuming especially with extremely shallow water on the basis of the piv measurements carried out numerical calculations could be validated under moderate conditions related to water depth and ship speed numerical calculations under more extreme conditions very shallow water and high ship speeds are strongly dependent on the modelling of turbulence properties and should be used complementary to scale model tests in this special area considerable research is still required to enable the comprehensive use of numerical calculations acknowledgement the authors would like to

22651,inland vessels operate in a wide range of waterway conditions and sometimes extremely shallow water where the propeller inflow becomes critical knowledge of the wake field is of utmost importance for a proper and efficient design of the propulsion system to gain a deeper understanding of the inflow conditions at different water depths four representative inland vessels with the dimensions of a large rhine vessel and different stern shapes were designed and built as scale models for the detailed determination of the complex flow phenomena at the stern a complementary approach of model tests stereo particle image velocimetry 3c piv and ranse cfd calculations was chosen while the measured resistance profiles differ negligibly between the designs there are significant differences in the power demand the integral wake fraction from the propulsion test does not adequately describe this behaviour finally experimental and numerical flow fields could be compared for a deeper insight keywords shallow water wake field scale model tests piv ranse inland ships 1 introduction on the european inland waterways with a total length of about 40 000 km nowadays operate about 19 000 vessels even though inland navigation has only a small share in the total modal split its economic interdependence is very important in certain transport chains from a german perspective this applies in particular to the supply of raw materials along the rhine longer periods with extreme high and low water levels such as in 2018 show this interdependence and sometimes lead to economic losses inland navigation is also very important from an environmental point of view with its energy efficiency and low cost per tonne kilometre and is intended to relieve road traffic depending on their size self propelled inland vessels can replace 40 to 120 trucks on the roads large pushed convoys even up to 650 the design of inland waterway vessels has always been a major challenge as these vessels have to operate safely and efficiently in a wide range of environmental conditions hekkenberg 2013 gives a good overview of the most important factors determining the economic viability of inland navigation and inland vessels to meet these requirements various designs have been developed incorporating short aft hulls highly loaded ducted propellers and devices like propeller tunnels and aprons to avoid ventilation at small draughts modern inland vessels can operate at draughts going below the propeller diameter zöllner 2000 nevertheless the hydrodynamics of these full hullforms with large block coefficients are challenging and strongly influenced by the underkeel clearance the resulting power demand limits the energy efficiency and may significantly affect the economic efficiency with increasing fuel costs due to the permanently changing sailing conditions optimization based on operational experience with existing vessels is very limited in inland navigation some vessels are studied using cfd computations and model tests which allows improving major unfavourable ship lines before the vessels are built at full scale however these investigations are limited to individual new built ships and very few sailing conditions additionally no data is available for older vessels which shall be equipped with updated propulsion systems extensive tests like piv measurements are out of scope for most new built projects to provide ship designers and propeller manufactures with generic information of these phenomena four representative inland vessels were designed and manufactured in model scale all designs have the overall dimensions of a large rhine vessel and are propelled by ducted propellers mounted on conventional shafts this family of vessels was compared extensively using computational and experimental fluid dynamics cfd and efd at three different water depths 2 hull geometries in order to cover a wide range of hull geometries of the existing fleet four ships with the dimensions l 110 m b 11 44 m and t m a x 3 2 m and differing stern shapes were designed the stern shapes resemble existing ships and all ships share the same bow shape all ships use ducted propellers in conventional shaft arrangement two designs are single screw vessels while the other two have propellers and ducts on port and starboard side the latter is usually beneficial at low draught or very shallow water and fulfils redundancy requirements for some waterways one design strategy follows tunnelled aft shapes m2051 m2053 the other flat aft shapes m2052 m2054 these four designs were built and equipped in scale 1 by 16 for model tests the rudders were omitted for cfd and efd all investigations were performed at a draught of 2 8 m the different aft shapes are shown in fig 1 the basic shape parameters of the four vessels are shown in table 1 despite the different geometries displacement and block coefficient are similar and allow extensive comparisons 3 towed model tests extensive model tests were done in dst s large shallow water basin this testing facility is 200m long 10m wide has a concrete bottom and can be operated at any water depth up to 1 20m a unique feature of this basin is the observation tunnel with 60 mm thick acrylic windows underneath the towing track the resistance and self propulsion tests were performed at three water levels corresponding to 7 5m 5 0m and 3 5m in full scale for all ship models bare hull resistance tests were carried out at all three water depths in preparation of the propulsion tests propulsor open water tests were carried out for the two propeller duct combinations used for all four ships and three water depths self propulsion tests were subsequently carried out for ship velocities analogous to the resistance tests the british method was applied with three propeller rates for each model speed during the resistance and propulsion tests video recordings were made while passing the observation tunnel the models were equipped with woollen threads at some exposed points to visualize the flow field at the stern of the ships 4 particle image velocimetry particle image velocimetry piv is a powerful non invasive laser based method for the measurement of fluid flows small particles in the water serve as tracer particles which are illuminated in a thin light sheet by a pulsed laser the reflections are captured with high speed video cameras in a stereo set up 3c piv with two images per camera taken at a defined time interval and using cross correlation the vector field in all three spatial directions can be determined thus the fluid flow in the observed area can be resolved with high precision a detailed description of this measurement technique can be found in raffel et al 2007 optical access at small underkeel clearance and typical aft body shapes is very limited and the piv system used at dst is not suitable for underwater use therefore it is installed in the observation tunnel mentioned above it consists of an innolas spitlight piv dpss frequency doubled nd yag laser with two diode pumped cavities due to the diode pumping the beam quality is almost independent of orientation and motions with a double pulse frequency of 100hz the pulse energy is about 60mj two phantom v9 1 high speed cmos cameras with 2mp resolution and 6gb internal memory each are used with 50 or 85 mm lenses mounted on scheimpflug adapters 14bit colour depth allows sufficiently high contrast even in most challenging applications polyamid particles with a diameter of 100 μ m were used as tracer acquisition and post processing were done with different subversions of the software package davis8 by lavision the basic piv setup in the view from above and from the side with first surface mirrors mounted in the basin is shown in fig 2 the recording of the nominal wake is basically easier since the cameras can look at the propeller plane from behind this path is blocked when recording the effective wake through duct and propeller in this case the ship s heading and direction of travel are reversed and the cameras look from the other side at the plane in front of the propeller especially in shallow water this is very difficult due to the shape of the ship in order to minimize reflections with high intensity on the surface of the ship model all models and appendages are coated with a fluorescent paint the wave length of the light is shifted into the orange colour spectrum and filtered out via bandpass filters on the lenses in this way disturbing reflections from the surface can be significantly reduced and particles that are close to the surface can be detected the conditions in the wake of ship hulls with flow separation are highly unsteady coherent vortices of different length scales detach from the ship s surface and travel downstream thus instantaneous vector fields from piv are not representative and do not suffice for the validation of cfd computations to reduce the uncertainty of piv data and to derive adequate results for further analysis as many vector fields as possible need to be compared filtered and averaged this is a challenging task for applications where the stationary equipment is passed by the model here at least ten test runs were performed for each condition different model and or water depth each quadruple of raw images was processed independently afterwards three consecutive vector fields for each run were averaged with the sampling rate of 100hz this equals two periods of 0 01s plus the interframe interval in time and a spatial averaging over e g 20 mm at a towing speed corresponding to 14km h at full scale the averaged data is then averaged again over all performed test runs for the same conditions due to the challenges mentioned above these measurements were only carried out with the single screw ship m2052 and the twin screw ship m2054 at all three water depths in addition depending on the water depth only one ship speed was investigated at which the sinkage and trims determined from the resistance and self propulsion tests were fixed 5 numerical computations to investigate the hydrodynamic performance and the fluid flow at the stern all four ships were compared using ranse computations for this purpose the commercial software packages ansys fluent and ansys cfx were used this software is based on the finite volume method and solves the integral equations for the conservation of mass momentum and energy in this technique the volume of interest is divided into a huge number of small elements called control volumes besides the k ω sst turbulence model from menter 1994 the k ε model was also used in addition to the calculation of pressure and velocity fields the wave elevation was calculated using the volume of fluid method the dynamic floating position i e trim and sinkage due to forward speed was also considered a detailed description of the numerical calculation methodology can be found in ferziger and perić 2002 in order to gather all gradients of the fluid and to resolve the free surface elevation a large number of elements was necessary the numbers of nodes for the computational domain varied between 4 and 6 million to reduce the number of cells hybrid grids were used the far field was discretized with a structured grid consisting of hexahedrons and the domain near the ship hull was discretized using tetrahedrons in combination with prism layers at the wall a propeller model based on the experimentally determined open water characteristics was used to represent the propeller effect all computations were carried out for the water levels 7 5m and 3 5m 6 results propellers positioned in the viscous wake operate in a complex and inhomogeneous inflow shallow water effects strongly alter this wake field with reducing underkeel clearance the flow passing between the waterway bottom and the hull is more and more blocked and the water needs to be drawn in from the sides for the analysis of the wake conditions of the ship s hull which is decisive for the inflow conditions to the propeller the consideration of the wake fraction w derived with the thrust identity approach is well established it is calculated as follows 1 w 1 v a v here v a is the axial inflow velocity and v is the inflow velocity in an undisturbed environment which usually corresponds to the ship velocity v s the following considerations of hydrodynamic flow conditions basically use this dimensionless ratio 6 1 towed model tests fig 3 initially shows the predicted ship resistance of all four ships at all three water depths the differences between the best and worst ship design are in the range of about 20 at a water depth of 3 5m however all designs are close together one of the most relevant characteristic numbers is the power demand for a given speed fig 4 shows the plots of delivered power against ship speed for all models and the three tested water depths the well known disproportionate increase of power demand with speed becomes more pronounced while the attainable ship speed is more and more reduced with decreasing water depth while the single screw design m2051 performs best in all test conditions the results for the other three designs are not straightforward they swap order with changing water depth the twin screw design m2053 is very close to the reference m2051 at high water depth but performs worst with small underkeel clearance the other twin screw design m2054 is worst with sufficient water between hull and waterway bottom but doing well in shallow water conditions looking at the magnitude of differences between the designs clearly demonstrates the need for proper hydrodynamic investigations for vessels operating in confined water at 3 5m water depth almost a factor of 2 can be found in the power demand between the best and the worst design even though the resistance curves are relatively close this effect must therefore result from the interaction behaviour of the ship s hull and propeller the thrust identity approach was used for all self propulsion tests to compare the operating conditions with the open water tests with the non dimensional thrust coefficient k t t ρ n 2 d 4 the corresponding advance coefficient j v a n d can be read from the propulsor open water characteristics using the known propeller rate n the corresponding axial inflow velocity v a is derived and the wake fraction w calculated according to eq 1 the results are plotted in fig 5 for the full scale ship speeds 12km h at 3 5m depth 14km h at 5 0m and 16km h at a water depth of 7 5m there is a clear tendency towards increasing wake fractions in low water depths however this effect is much more pronounced for the single

22652,this paper deals with the problem of marine vessels trajectory tracking control in presence of environmental disturbances in order to achieve this objective a previously published methodology for controllers design was improved a new model error estimation based scheme is proposed to reduce the effect of the perturbations in the tracking error the approach is effective and low complexity thanks to uncertainty estimation based on numerical method theory this modification ensures the tracking error convergence to zero even in presence of polynomial uncertainties demonstration available different tests are presents and a performance comparison with the previous controller is shown to highlight improvements of up to 29 the control methodology is developed in discrete time however is validated by numerical simulations using a continuous time model keywords nonlinear control trajectory tracking environmental disturbance polynomial uncertainties 1 introduction autonomous vehicles have proven to be useful in a considerable variety of difficult tasks such as exploration disaster search rescue environmental monitoring and coastal patrols in these applications the trajectory tracking problem becomes relevant peng et al 2011 yang et al 2014 chen and tan 2013 yu et al 2012 yoo and park 2017 in general trajectory tracking tasks are given in two work scenarios structured or partially structured spaces in the first scenario a global planner generates the reference trajectory according to the space configuration in the second case unexpected obstacles may appear during navigation thus in order to avoid the collision algorithms used to avoid obstacles re plane the reference trajectory from the current position to the final point in both scenarios the control objective is the same find the combination of control actions to ensure that the vehicle reaches and follow a reference trajectory defined by the variables x r e f and y r e f several recent works addressed the trajectory tracking problem in marine vessels dai et al 2016 developed an adaptive neural network based controller for marine surface vessel with the introduction of an error transformation function the constrained tracking control of the original vessel is transformed into the stabilization of an unconstrained system in zheng et al 2014 the reference trajectories of a vessel were assumed to be known over a finite time horizon then a model predictive controller was developed to calculate the optimal forces and moment that vessel needs in order to track the reference trajectory a different point of view on the controller design procedure was presented in serrano et al 2014 there a linear algebra methodology was developed for trajectory tracking control in marine vessels in the above work the system was discretized and posed in matrix form then the conditions so that a system of linear equations has an exact solution was analyzed finally the control law was found solving the linear system equation the design of trajectory tracking controllers for marine vessels become a hard task in the presence of environmental disturbances underactuated ocean vehicles only control speed and heading in the horizontal plane hence convergence to a curved reference trajectory under the influence of disturbances is nontrivial such vehicles will exhibit large cross track errors during reference following and in steady state which depends on the trajectory curvature as well as on the direction and strength of the drift force fossen and lekkas 2017 a considerable number of recent papers deal with model uncertainties and disturbances in marine vessels he et al 2017 belleter and pettersen 2014 peng et al 2011 yu et al 2012 xie and ma 2015 kim et al 2017 luo et al 2016 in dai et al 2014 introduce some time varying disturbance and model uncertainties in the system and proposes an adaptive neural network output feedback controller the control method is developed exploiting the learned knowledge without readapting to the unknown ship dynamics in the closed loop process in chen et al 2013 considering environmental disturbances generated by the wave wind and ocean currents and an adaptive controller is proposed for the positioning of a marine vessel the positioning control is developed to handle the uncertainties the control algorithm is achieved using variable structure lyapunov s synthesis and neural network approximation based techniques in fossen and lekkas 2017 propose an adaptive indirect controller based on a disturbance observer designed for estimation and compensation of ocean currents the algorithm is based on look ahead based line of sight guidance principle for marine craft and an integral action is obtained by parameter adaptation a sliding mode tracking control approach was presented in yu et al 2012 the controller is developed introducing a first level sliding mode surface pair composed of two sliding mode surfaces in terms of position tracking error and velocity tracking error then a second level sliding mode surface is constructed based on the pair of first level sliding mode surfaces finally a robust controller was designed using lyapunov s direct method simulations with a circular trajectory were used to evaluate the methodology performance using backstepping and lyapunov synthesis the authors in tee and ge 2006 design a controller for marine vessels that deals with the problem of trajectory tracking in presence of disturbance and parametric uncertainties the disturbance is attributed to the exogenous effects of the environment which have finite and bound energy the bounded external disturbance is compensated by a feedforward approximators even though no information related to the disturbance is measured or used donaire et al 2017 designed a passivity based controller with integral action for fully actuated vessels that rejects disturbances when tracks the desired reference the mentioned works show acceptable performance however the implementation of those methodologies represents a challenging task due to its required a great prior control knowledge to understand the procedures used the goal of this paper is to improve the control strategy presented in serrano et al 2014 the aim of this work is to present a new alternative to design trajectory tracking controllers capable to reach and follow predefined trajectories in the presence of model uncertainties and environmental disturbances to reach this objective numerical method based estimation techniques and linear algebra theory are combined to propose a new control law the main result of this work is a control law for trajectory tracking in marine vessels that sail in the presence of modeling errors and environmental disturbances in order to deal with this issue a new term is added in the ship model representing the uncertainty here is assumed that the additive uncertainty is continuous with continuous derivatives next this term is approximated through newton s backward interpolation method thus newton s backward interpolation is used to estimate the uncertainty value at the next sample time at each period the prediction error made in the previous sample time is calculated and then using this value and the past ones it is estimated the prediction error at the current instant then the control methodology proposed in serrano et al 2014 is modified in order to include the prediction error in control actions this novel methodology allows us to reject the polynomial uncertainties and calculate the control actions without the need to implement an observer it is important to highlight that as the estimation order increase the approximation improves and the tracking error decreases in this way a positive answer to the challenging problem of tracking control in multivariable nonlinear systems under uncertainties and environmental disturbances is provided our approach is based in discrete time equations that allow the direct implementation in a programmable logic device or any device that executes sequential instructions this feature represents a great advantage over other algorithms since the implementation in a real system arises naturally another relevant contribution of this work is a method to choose the controller parameters this strategy is based on monte carlo experiment and can be used for tuning other controllers of the bibliography to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed strategy we perform several simulations considering modeling errors and environmental disturbances representing waves and wind behavior in addition the convergence to zero of the tracking errors is demonstrated the contributions with respect to our previous work are a new control scheme and a new control law which ensures the tracking of references trajectories in the presence of environmental disturbances and model uncertainties an approach to select the controller parameters based on the monte carlo randomize algorithm mcra is another important contribution of this work in control theory the additive uncertainties are used to represent mathematically modeling errors or input and output disturbances in serrano et al 2014 these additive uncertainties were omitted in the controller design procedure compared with other works of the literature our approach does not need the implementation of observers to calculate the estimated value of the uncertainty in addition the use of numerical methods to estimate the uncertainty allows the implementation in low level processors in a simple and natural way thus is possible to address a new control problem without increasing the complexity of the methodology presented in serrano et al 2014 the article is organized as follows the dynamical model of the system is shown in section 2 in section 3 the design methodology and the convergence to zero of the tracking errors are presented in section 4 a method to controller tuning is shown and two tests are implemented with the purpose of checking the effectiveness of the new control law main conclusions of the research are described in section 5 2 marine vessel model to determine the complete configuration of the marine vessel position and orientation six independent coordinates surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw are required as can be seen in fig 1 however these six degrees of freedom are commonly reduced to three this is done because the remaining degrees are open loop stable for most marine vessels consider the ship model described in serrano et al 2014

where t u and t r are the surge and yaw control respectively the mass matrix and inertia matrix are assumed to be symmetric and positively definite this is by the fact that most marine surface vessels

reference trajectories x r e f y r e f in marine vessels under environmental disturbances and model uncertainties the aim is to find the combined control actions t u and t r such that the vessel follows a reference trajectory and reject the disturbances and polynomial uncertainties thus the controller methodology presented in serrano et al 2014 is modified and a new control scheme is proposed incorporating the prediction error to reach the above objective the ship model 5 is discretized through the euler method next a term representing the additive uncertainty is incorporated into the system model then an approach based on numerical methods is proposed to estimate the unknown uncertainty using past values after that the conditions under which a linear equation system has an exact solution are found finally the control actions that must be applied in each sample time are obtained using least squares method 3 2 uncertainty estimation the discrete version of eq 5 can be obtained by using euler approximation 6 x n 1 y n 1 ψ n 1 u n 1 r n 1 x n y n ψ n u n r n t s u n cos ψ n v n sin ψ n u n sin ψ n v n cos ψ n r n f 1 n m 22 m 22 m 33 m 23 2 f 2 n t s 0 0 0 0 0 0 b 11 m 11 0 0

where g ˆ z n u n represents the discrete time nonlinear model of the system note that e n can be modeled as a bounded uncertainty if as will be assumed z and u are bounded and g is lipschitz michalska and mayne 1993 mayne et al 2000 next is incorporated in the ship model an additive uncertainty 10 z n 1 z n t s g n t s i n τ n e n where 11 e n e x n e y n e ψ n e u n e r n in 10 e n represents the additive uncertainty this term can be used to model environmental disturbances and unmodeled dynamics it is important to remark that in this paper it is assumed that each component of e n is unknown and m order polynomial remark 1 the first order difference of e n is defined as e n e n e n 1 the second order difference as 2 e n e n e n e n 1 e n 2 e n 1 e n 2 and as a rule the q th order difference is define as q e n q 1 e n remark 2 the q th difference of a q 1 order polynomial is zero the objective is to reduce the effect of uncertainty e n on tracking errors then we propose to estimate the unknown polynomial uncertainty using the past values and the theory of the numerical methods the estimated value of e n will be noted as e ˆ n and is defined in 18 it is calculated considering the newton s backward interpolation of e n hildebrand 1987 zwillinger 2002 the estimated estate vector z n is calculated by using the discrete model representation 12 z ˆ n z n 1 t s g n 1

the uncertainty at the current instant can be calculated using newton s backward interpolation 14 e n e n 1 e n 1 e n 2 e n 1 2 e n 2 e n 3 2 next the estimated value of e n is calculated as a function of the prediction error and according to the order of the uncertainty considered 3 2 1 zero order estimation consider that the additive uncertainty is constant e n 0 e n e n 1 thus the uncertainty can be calculated by making the difference between the value of the vector state at n instant and the estimated vector e n z n z ˆ n then the uncertainty is estimated with a zero order approximation 15 15 e ˆ n e ˆ x n e ˆ y n e ˆ ψ n e ˆ u n e ˆ r n e n e n 1 where e n 1 z n z ˆ n x n x ˆ n y n y ˆ n ψ n ψ ˆ n u n u ˆ n r n r ˆ n 3 2 2 first order estimation if e n is assumed as a linear function then 2 e n 0 e n 2 e n 1 e n 2 following the same above reasoning the uncertainty is estimated with a first order approximation thus e ˆ n is defined as 16 e ˆ n e n e x n 1 e x n 1 e

considered the order of the estimation increases by the same order thus if the supposed uncertainty is second order the estimated value of e n can be calculated according to 17 17 e ˆ n e n e n 1 e n 1 e n 2 e n 1 2 e n 2 e n 3 2 3 2 4 generalization m order estimation suppose that the additive uncertainty is m order then the estimated value of e n can be calculated according to 18 19 and 20 in 19

19 is obtained considering the same order of the uncertainty e n m order remark 3 if m e n c o n s t a n t and e ˆ n is calculated according to 18 and 19 e ˆ n e n 3 3 linear algebra controller next the uncertainty estimation is incorporated in the ship model and a control law that reduces the effect of uncertainty in the tracking error is obtained the goal is to find the values of the control actions t u n and t r n that should be applied in each sample time such that the marine vessel follows a pre established trajectory with minimum error first e n is replaced by its estimated value e ˆ

24 is given 24 cos ψ n sin ψ n u n δ x n e ˆ x n t s v n sin ψ n δ y n e ˆ y n t s v n cos ψ n system 24 represents the condition that must be fulfilled in order that 23 has an exact solution as can be seen in comparison with serrano et al 2014 the column space of the right hand of 24 is modified considering the additive uncertainty then the orientation of the marine vessel must comply with equation 25 such that 24 has a unique solution 25 sin ψ n cos ψ n δ y n e ˆ y n t s v n cos ψ n δ x n e ˆ x n t s v n sin ψ n the value of ψ that satisfies 25 represents the value of the ship orientation so that 24 has an exact solution it will be denominated ψ e z this orientation value makes that the ship reaches and follow the reference trajectory now according with the procedure for

the solution of system 26 represent the surge velocity and makes that the tracking errors tends to zero its solution by least squares method can be obtained by solving the normal equations strang 2011 thus the solution of 26 can be expressed as 27 u e z n δ y n e ˆ y n t s v n cos ψ n sin ψ e z n δ x n e ˆ x n t s v n sin ψ n cos ψ e z n now a second condition so that system 23 have exact solution is given from the third row of 23 and equation 26 we define 28 r e z ψ e z n 1 k ψ ψ e z n ψ n ψ n e ˆ ψ n t s then u e z and r e z are the desired value of u and r in order that the tracking errors e x and e y tends to zero see proof of theorem 1 finally by replacing equations 27 and 28 in system 23 29 is given 29 b 11 0 0 b 32 t u n t r n m 11 δ u n t s f 1 n m 22 m 33 m 23 2 m 22 δ r n t s f 2 n

2 m 22 δ r n t s f 2 n e ˆ r n t s the values of t u n and t r n represent the control actions necessary to the ship reaches and follow a pre established trajectory under the effect of additive uncertainties in the proposed methodology first an estimation of the uncertainty is added to the ship model then are identifies the reference speeds so that the error tends to zero and then control actions are calculated to keep the obtained velocity profile theorem 1 if trajectory tracking problems are considered the system behavior is ruled by 10 the additive uncertainty can be modeled with a m order polynomial and the controller is designed by 25 27 28 and 30 then e n 0 when n proof the proof starts with the analysis of variable u replacing t u n given by 30 in 10 and operating 31 is found 31 u e z n 1 u n 1 e u n 1 k u u e z n u n e u n e u n e ˆ u n then if e u n is unknown and each component is an m order polynomial the uncertainty e u n and their estimated value e ˆ u n can be eliminated from 31 see remark 3 32 e u n 1 k u e u n thence if 0 k u 1 and n with n n then e u n 0 then we find the error equations of the remaining variables ψ r x and y analyzing the variable r from 10 results 33 e r n 1 k r e r n in 33 if 0 k r 1 and n then e r n 0 next the orientation is analyzed and 34 is given 34 e ψ n 1 k ψ e ψ n t s e r n by inspection of 34 and considering 33 if 0 k r 1 and n then e r n 0 and e ψ n 0 finally we analyze the convergence to zero of the errors in x and y following the same procedure of serrano et al 2014 35 e x n 1 e y n 1 k x 0 0 k y e x n e y n l i n e

tends to zero because e ψ n 0 and e u n 0 when n 0 thus is demonstrated that e x n 0 and e y n 0 when n 0 and the tracking error tends to 0 3 4 methodology summary before applying the methodology it is necessary to represent the mathematical model of the system in state form as a set of linear first order differential equations the design methodology can be summarized in five steps first the system of linear first order differential equations represented in state form is discretized using a numerical method next is incorporated into the system model an additive uncertainty and then it is estimated according to 19 20 and 12 the estimation order is chosen according to the supposed uncertainty order third the control problem is formulated as solving a system of linear equations iu b where i is input matrix u is vector composed by the control action and b is vector function of the state variables and the system parameters then the state variables chosen as desired values must be replaced by the reference variables assuming a smooth approaching for instance proportional to the error λ n 1 λ r e f n 1 k λ λ r e f n λ n where λ n is a state variable at instant n k λ is a controller parameter associated to the variable λ and λ r e f n is the value of the reference variable at instant n next the desired trajectory of the remaining state variables should be determined these variables are defined with the subscript e z assuming also an approaching proportional to the error the aim is to find the value of the control actions at instant n such that the trajectory tracking error tends to zero to accomplish this the system iu b must have an exact solution then the vector b must be contained in the space formed by the columns of i i e the vector b must be a linear combination of the column vectors of matrix i strang 2011 thus the conditions such that the system iu b has an exact solution and the errors tend to zero are defined in this step finally the control actions are obtained by solving system iu b by mean of least squares method i t iu i t b 4 simulations results in this section is presented a controller tuning based on a numeric method then the controller performance is tested under the effect of environmental disturbances and model errors in order to analyze the improvements made to the original control scheme the proposed controller is compared with the proposed in serrano et al 2014 the simulations are achieved using the programming environment simulink of matlab platform the control methodology is applied to the original time continuous system as shown in fig 2 the ship model parameters m d b are obtained from serrano et al 2014 børhaug et al 2011 and the sample time used was t s 0 1 s 36 m 25 8 0 0 0 33 8 11 748 0 11 748

controller tuning theorem 1 gives the limits between which the controller parameters can be chosen if these parameters are chosen properly the vessel reaches and follow a predetermined path smoothly without undesired oscillations in this work it is used eq 8 of tempo and ishii 2007 with an accuracy of 0 007 ε and a confidence value δ of 0 01 thus it is necessary to make 1000 simulations the whole explanation of this method is explained in tempo and ishii 2007 this method is applied as follows the simulations are implemented using simulink of matlab software the experiment is carried out considering m 0 1 2 in 19 these will be called c0 c1 and c2 respectively for each controller c0 c1 and c2 1000 simulations are executed the controller parameters are fixed in each trial and are chosen in a random way before of each simulation such that 0 k λ 1 the lower and upper bound are chosen such according to proof of theorem 1 of this work a sinusoidal trajectory is considered for the implementation of the monte carlo experiment this reference trajectory remains fixed for each simulation a cost function that evaluates the controller performance is defined the controller set of parameters that minimizes the predefined cost function is selected as optimal the cost function defined for choose the optimal controller parameters set is show in 37 it considers the cost incurred by the tracking error where φ represents the desired trajectory φ the number of points of such trajectory i 0 φ 1 2 x r e f i x i 2 the quadratic error in the x coordinate and i 0 φ 1 2 y r e f i y i 2 the quadratic error in the y coordinate 37 c φ i 0 φ 1 2 x r e f n x n 2 y r e f n y n 2 although this procedure does not guarantee an optimum solution the monte carlo experiment offers an estimated result based on a large number of trials hence 1000 values of each parameter for each controller c0 c1 and c2 ranging from 0 to 1 were simulated the results of the mc experiment are shown in fig 3 the tracking cost of the 1000 simulations for controller c0 m 0 are presented in fig 3 a the minimum cost obtained with controller c0 corresponds to 17 05 and is shown in 3 a fig 3 b presents the results for 1000 trials using the controller c1 proposed in this work m 1 as can be seen the minimum cost obtained is 15 99 finally the minimum cost obtained by c2 is shown in fig 3 c the minimum cost obtained is 14 87 fig 3 d summarize the minimum cost obtained for each controller by analyzing the results obtained in 3 can be concluded that if m increases the performance of the controller improves it verifies the theoretical results obtained in the previous section in table 1 are summarized the results obtained in mc simulations fig 4 show the best performance reached for each controller table 1 the position of the ship and the reference trajectory is shown in fig 4 a the ship orientation and the control actions applied in each sample time can be seen in fig 4 b fig c and fig d respectively 4 2 simulation under uncertainty now the performance of the controller is evaluated under the presence of additive uncertainties in two typical trajectories of the literature the controller parameters used in c0 c1 and c2 are obtained from the monte carlo experiment of the previous section table 1 with the aim of analyzing the improvement introduced in the control technique based on linear algebra the performance of our approach will be contrasted with the original method presented in serrano et al 2014 this controller will be called c3 hereinafter in order to quantify the performance of each controller the mean and error variance will be calculated according to 38 and 39 respectively jazwinski 2007 38 x n 1 n e n n 39 σ 2 n 1 n e n x 2 n where n is the number of sampling periods performed during the experience and e n represents the tracking error at the n instant see remark 4 4 2 1 simulation with environmental disturbances in order to analyze the controllers performance polynomial disturbances in x and y variables are introduced in the continuous ship model according to 40 the time variation of d x and d y is given by fig 5 as can be seen first a constant disturbance is introduced in both variables at time t 40 s then a linear function is added to the disturbance function at time t 85 s and finally a quadratic signal is introduced in t 170 s 40 x u cos ψ vsin ψ d x y u sin ψ vcos ψ d y ψ r u f 1 n b 11 m 11 t u r m 22 m 22 m 33 m 23 2 f 2 n b 32 t r in applications as obstacle avoidance the reference trajectory must be re planned when unexpected objects appear in some cases abrupt changes are generated in this reference trajectory due to the large danger of collision in order to evaluate the performance of the marine vessel in a situation such as that previously mentioned a square reference trajectory was chosen in this subsection the trajectory to be followed by the ship is generated with a constant linear velocity of v 0 25 m s the trajectory begins in the position x r e f 0 y r e f 0 1 m 1 m and the initial position of the marine vessel is at the system origin fig 6 a shows the trajectory followed by the ship on the plane x y for each controller as can be seen when no disturbances appear the performance obtained with all controllers is similar if a constant disturbance is introduced the tracking error do not increase significantly due the integrative behavior of the ship model however if a linear disturbance is introduced a constant error appears in the tracking obtained by c3 as it is shown in fig 6 c and d when quadratic disturbances appear the tracking error of c3 increases linearly fig 6 b show the trajectory cost of all implemented controllers by inspection of this figure c2 presents the best performance when polynomial disturbances are introduced during the ship navigation note how the performance error can be reduced by 31 just adding a zero order estimator by 36 with a first order one and by 47 with a second order estimator 4 2 2 simulation considering modeling errors and enviromental disturbances in real applications mathematical models cannot faithfully represent marine vessels in addition during the navigation the ship s load varies and waves and wind causes poor performance of the control system now the goal is to analyze the combined effects of modeling errors and weather conditions in the control system performance kim et al 2017 luo et al 2016 ghommam et al 2010 pierson et al 1980 thus a variation is introduced in the nominal model parameters and to represent wave and wind behavior disturbances are introduced in the ship modeling errors were introduced by changing 10 the values of m and d matrices 41 m 28 4 0 0 0 30 42 12 91 0 12 91 6 067 d 1 8 0 0 0 6 3 7 7967 0 7 7967 1 562 furthermore new disturbances were introduced in x and y variables representing wave behavior as show fig 7 ghommam et al 2010 this disturbance function is obtained adding a sinusoidal function to the polynomial disturbance of fig 5 wind effect can be represented by introducing a disturbance in linear and transverse velocities pierson et al 1980 thus the disturbance w shown in fig 8 is added to u and v variables see equation 2 the simulation is performed using an eight shaped trajectory the system origin is the initial position of the ship and the reference trajectory begins in x r e f y r e f 1 m 2 m the simulations results are shown in fig 9 by inspection of fig 9 a all controllers reach and follow the reference trajectory nevertheless the controllers c0 c1 and c2 proposed in this paper have better results this can be better appreciate in fig 9 c and d where the tracking errors in x coordinate and y coordinate are shown the effect of the modeling errors in the tracking errors is reduced by the estimation based controllers this can be better be appreciated in the first 40s of fig 9 c and d note that although the disturbance increases significantly tracking errors remain below 0 2 m this test demonstrates another advantage of the proposed estimation technique fig 9 b show the comparison of tracking performance between the four different controllers under modeling errors and waves disturbances table 2 summarizes the results obtained by each controller in the simulations as can be seen estimation based controllers c0 c1 and c2 have a better performance than c3 moreover it is observed that the variance values obtained are small and the mean of the errors obtained for the controllers presented in this paper improves up to 29 the performance of the original controller proposed in serrano et al 2014 5 conclusion a novel methodology for trajectory tracking in marine vessels under uncertainty was presented the methodology allows controlling of a nonlinear system in the presence of environmental disturbances and additive uncertainties in order to deal with this issue a new control scheme was proposed and a new term has been added to the ship model representing the uncertainty then this unknown uncertainty is approximated by numerical methods using the past values the estimation order is chosen considering the variation hypothesis of e n if each component of e n is an m order polynomial then the uncertainty e n and its estimated value e ˆ n are m order so as to avoid its influence on the tracking error e n compared to the technique based on linear algebra presented in serrano et al 2014 the problem is now addressed in a more realistic way considering the uncertainty of the system in the problem formulation this new approach improves tracking errors without increasing the complexity of the control algorithm in addition a controller tuning approach through monte carlo experiment is proposed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology were conducted some tests by adding different types of uncertainty it was clearly shown that the proposed controller performance is remarkably better while the complexity of the algorithm is not excessive finally has been demonstrated the convergence to zero of the tracking errors besides this control approach can be applied to many nonlinear systems making it a promising technique for its application to several robotic systems furthermore the present methodology has the advantage of using discrete equations and therefore a direct implementation in most computer driven systems is feasible

22652,this paper deals with the problem of marine vessels trajectory tracking control in presence of environmental disturbances in order to achieve this objective a previously published methodology for controllers design was improved a new model error estimation based scheme is proposed to reduce the effect of the perturbations in the tracking error the approach is effective and low complexity thanks to uncertainty estimation based on numerical method theory this modification ensures the tracking error convergence to zero even in presence of polynomial uncertainties demonstration available different tests are presents and a performance comparison with the previous controller is shown to highlight improvements of up to 29 the control methodology is developed in discrete time however is validated by numerical simulations using a continuous time model keywords nonlinear control trajectory tracking environmental disturbance polynomial uncertainties 1 introduction autonomous vehicles have proven to be useful in a considerable variety of difficult tasks such as exploration disaster search rescue environmental monitoring and coastal patrols in these applications the trajectory tracking problem becomes relevant peng et al 2011 yang et al 2014 chen and tan 2013 yu et al 2012 yoo and park 2017 in general trajectory tracking tasks are given in two work scenarios structured or partially structured spaces in the first scenario a global planner generates the reference trajectory according to the space configuration in the second case unexpected obstacles may appear during navigation thus in order to avoid the collision algorithms used to avoid obstacles re plane the reference trajectory from the current position to the final point in both scenarios the control objective is the same find the combination of control actions to ensure that the vehicle reaches and follow a reference trajectory defined by the variables x r e f and y r e f several recent works addressed the trajectory tracking problem in marine vessels dai et al 2016 developed an adaptive neural network based controller for marine surface vessel with the introduction of an error transformation function the constrained tracking control of the original vessel is transformed into the stabilization of an unconstrained system in zheng et al 2014 the reference trajectories of a vessel were assumed to be known over a finite time horizon then a model predictive controller was developed to calculate the optimal forces and moment that vessel needs in order to track the reference trajectory a different point of view on the controller design procedure was presented in serrano et al 2014 there a linear algebra methodology was developed for trajectory tracking control in marine vessels in the above work the system was discretized and posed in matrix form then the conditions so that a system of linear equations has an exact solution was analyzed finally the control law was found solving the linear system equation the design of trajectory tracking controllers for marine vessels become a hard task in the presence of environmental disturbances underactuated ocean vehicles only control speed and heading in the horizontal plane hence convergence to a curved reference trajectory under the influence of disturbances is nontrivial such vehicles will exhibit large cross track errors during reference following and in steady state which depends on the trajectory curvature as well as on the direction and strength of the drift force fossen and lekkas 2017 a considerable number of recent papers deal with model uncertainties and disturbances in marine vessels he et al 2017 belleter and pettersen 2014 peng et al 2011 yu et al 2012 xie and ma 2015 kim et al 2017 luo et al 2016 in dai et al 2014 introduce some time varying disturbance and model uncertainties in the system and proposes an adaptive neural network output feedback controller the control method is developed exploiting the learned knowledge without readapting to the unknown ship dynamics in the closed loop process in chen et al 2013 considering environmental disturbances generated by the wave wind and ocean currents and an adaptive controller is proposed for the positioning of a marine vessel the positioning control is developed to handle the uncertainties the control algorithm is achieved using variable structure lyapunov s synthesis and neural network approximation based techniques in fossen and lekkas 2017 propose an adaptive indirect controller based on a disturbance observer designed for estimation and compensation of ocean currents the algorithm is based on look ahead based line of sight guidance principle for marine craft and an integral action is obtained by parameter adaptation a sliding mode tracking control approach was presented in yu et al 2012 the controller is developed introducing a first level sliding mode surface pair composed of two sliding mode surfaces in terms of position tracking error and velocity tracking error then a second level sliding mode surface is constructed based on the pair of first level sliding mode surfaces finally a robust controller was designed using lyapunov s direct method simulations with a circular trajectory were used to evaluate the methodology performance using backstepping and lyapunov synthesis the authors in tee and ge 2006 design a controller for marine vessels that deals with the problem of trajectory tracking in presence of disturbance and parametric uncertainties the disturbance is attributed to the exogenous effects of the environment which have finite and bound energy the bounded external disturbance is compensated by a feedforward approximators even though no information related to the disturbance is measured or used donaire et al 2017 designed a passivity based controller with integral action for fully actuated vessels that rejects disturbances when tracks the desired reference the mentioned works show acceptable performance however the implementation of those methodologies represents a challenging task due to its required a great prior control knowledge to understand the procedures used the goal of this paper is to improve the control strategy presented in serrano et al 2014 the aim of this work is to present a new alternative to design trajectory tracking controllers capable to reach and follow predefined trajectories in the presence of model uncertainties and environmental disturbances to reach this objective numerical method based estimation techniques and linear algebra theory are combined to propose a new control law the main result of this work is a control law for trajectory tracking in marine vessels that sail in the presence of modeling errors and environmental disturbances in order to deal with this issue a new term is added in the ship model representing the uncertainty here is assumed that the additive uncertainty is continuous with continuous derivatives next this term is approximated through newton s backward interpolation method thus newton s backward interpolation is used to estimate the uncertainty value at the next sample time at each period the prediction error made in the previous sample time is calculated and then using this value and the past ones it is estimated the prediction error at the current instant then the control methodology proposed in serrano et al 2014 is modified in order to include the prediction error in control actions this novel methodology allows us to reject the polynomial uncertainties and calculate the control actions without the need to implement an observer it is important to highlight that as the estimation order increase the approximation improves and the tracking error decreases in this way a positive answer to the challenging problem of tracking control in multivariable nonlinear systems under uncertainties and environmental disturbances is provided our approach is based in discrete time equations that allow the direct implementation in a programmable logic device or any device that executes sequential instructions this feature represents a great advantage over other algorithms since the implementation in a real system arises naturally another relevant contribution of this work is a method to choose the controller parameters this strategy is based on monte carlo experiment and can be used for tuning other controllers of the bibliography to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed strategy we perform several simulations considering modeling errors and environmental disturbances representing waves and wind behavior in addition the convergence to zero of the tracking errors is demonstrated the contributions with respect to our previous work are a new control scheme and a new control law which ensures the tracking of references trajectories in the presence of environmental disturbances and model uncertainties an approach to select the controller parameters based on the monte carlo randomize algorithm mcra is another important contribution of this work in control theory the additive uncertainties are used to represent mathematically modeling errors or input and output disturbances in serrano et al 2014 these additive uncertainties were omitted in the controller design procedure compared with other works of the literature our approach does not need the implementation of observers to calculate the estimated value of the uncertainty in addition the use of numerical methods to estimate the uncertainty allows the implementation in low level processors in a simple and natural way thus is possible to address a new control problem without increasing the complexity of the methodology presented in serrano et al 2014 the article is organized as follows the dynamical model of the system is shown in section 2 in section 3 the design methodology and the convergence to zero of the tracking errors are presented in section 4 a method to controller tuning is shown and two tests are implemented with the purpose of checking the effectiveness of the new control law main conclusions of the research are described in section 5 2 marine vessel model to determine the complete configuration of the marine vessel position and orientation six independent coordinates surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw are required as can be seen in fig 1 however these six degrees of freedom are commonly reduced to three this is done because the remaining degrees are open loop stable for most marine vessels consider the ship model described in serrano et al 2014

where t u and t r are the surge and yaw control respectively the mass matrix and inertia matrix are assumed to be symmetric and positively definite this is by the fact that most marine surface vessels

reference trajectories x r e f y r e f in marine vessels under environmental disturbances and model uncertainties the aim is to find the combined control actions t u and t r such that the vessel follows a reference trajectory and reject the disturbances and polynomial uncertainties thus the controller methodology presented in serrano et al 2014 is modified and a new control scheme is proposed incorporating the prediction error to reach the above objective the ship model 5 is discretized through the euler method next a term representing the additive uncertainty is incorporated into the system model then an approach based on numerical methods is proposed to estimate the unknown uncertainty using past values after that the conditions under which a linear equation system has an exact solution are found finally the control actions that must be applied in each sample time are obtained using least squares method 3 2 uncertainty estimation the discrete version of eq 5 can be obtained by using euler approximation 6 x n 1 y n 1 ψ n 1 u n 1 r n 1 x n y n ψ n u n r n t s u n cos ψ n v n sin ψ n u n sin ψ n v n cos ψ n r n f 1 n m 22 m 22 m 33 m 23 2 f 2 n t s 0 0 0 0 0 0 b 11 m 11 0 0

where g ˆ z n u n represents the discrete time nonlinear model of the system note that e n can be modeled as a bounded uncertainty if as will be assumed z and u are bounded and g is lipschitz michalska and mayne 1993 mayne et al 2000 next is incorporated in the ship model an additive uncertainty 10 z n 1 z n t s g n t s i n τ n e n where 11 e n e x n e y n e ψ n e u n e r n in 10 e n represents the additive uncertainty this term can be used to model environmental disturbances and unmodeled dynamics it is important to remark that in this paper it is assumed that each component of e n is unknown and m order polynomial remark 1 the first order difference of e n is defined as e n e n e n 1 the second order difference as 2 e n e n e n e n 1 e n 2 e n 1 e n 2 and as a rule the q th order difference is define as q e n q 1 e n remark 2 the q th difference of a q 1 order polynomial is zero the objective is to reduce the effect of uncertainty e n on tracking errors then we propose to estimate the unknown polynomial uncertainty using the past values and the theory of the numerical methods the estimated value of e n will be noted as e ˆ n and is defined in 18 it is calculated considering the newton s backward interpolation of e n hildebrand 1987 zwillinger 2002 the estimated estate vector z n is calculated by using the discrete model representation 12 z ˆ n z n 1 t s g n 1

the uncertainty at the current instant can be calculated using newton s backward interpolation 14 e n e n 1 e n 1 e n 2 e n 1 2 e n 2 e n 3 2 next the estimated value of e n is calculated as a function of the prediction error and according to the order of the uncertainty considered 3 2 1 zero order estimation consider that the additive uncertainty is constant e n 0 e n e n 1 thus the uncertainty can be calculated by making the difference between the value of the vector state at n instant and the estimated vector e n z n z ˆ n then the uncertainty is estimated with a zero order approximation 15 15 e ˆ n e ˆ x n e ˆ y n e ˆ ψ n e ˆ u n e ˆ r n e n e n 1 where e n 1 z n z ˆ n x n x ˆ n y n y ˆ n ψ n ψ ˆ n u n u ˆ n r n r ˆ n 3 2 2 first order estimation if e n is assumed as a linear function then 2 e n 0 e n 2 e n 1 e n 2 following the same above reasoning the uncertainty is estimated with a first order approximation thus e ˆ n is defined as 16 e ˆ n e n e x n 1 e x n 1 e

considered the order of the estimation increases by the same order thus if the supposed uncertainty is second order the estimated value of e n can be calculated according to 17 17 e ˆ n e n e n 1 e n 1 e n 2 e n 1 2 e n 2 e n 3 2 3 2 4 generalization m order estimation suppose that the additive uncertainty is m order then the estimated value of e n can be calculated according to 18 19 and 20 in 19

19 is obtained considering the same order of the uncertainty e n m order remark 3 if m e n c o n s t a n t and e ˆ n is calculated according to 18 and 19 e ˆ n e n 3 3 linear algebra controller next the uncertainty estimation is incorporated in the ship model and a control law that reduces the effect of uncertainty in the tracking error is obtained the goal is to find the values of the control actions t u n and t r n that should be applied in each sample time such that the marine vessel follows a pre established trajectory with minimum error first e n is replaced by its estimated value e ˆ

24 is given 24 cos ψ n sin ψ n u n δ x n e ˆ x n t s v n sin ψ n δ y n e ˆ y n t s v n cos ψ n system 24 represents the condition that must be fulfilled in order that 23 has an exact solution as can be seen in comparison with serrano et al 2014 the column space of the right hand of 24 is modified considering the additive uncertainty then the orientation of the marine vessel must comply with equation 25 such that 24 has a unique solution 25 sin ψ n cos ψ n δ y n e ˆ y n t s v n cos ψ n δ x n e ˆ x n t s v n sin ψ n the value of ψ that satisfies 25 represents the value of the ship orientation so that 24 has an exact solution it will be denominated ψ e z this orientation value makes that the ship reaches and follow the reference trajectory now according with the procedure for

the solution of system 26 represent the surge velocity and makes that the tracking errors tends to zero its solution by least squares method can be obtained by solving the normal equations strang 2011 thus the solution of 26 can be expressed as 27 u e z n δ y n e ˆ y n t s v n cos ψ n sin ψ e z n δ x n e ˆ x n t s v n sin ψ n cos ψ e z n now a second condition so that system 23 have exact solution is given from the third row of 23 and equation 26 we define 28 r e z ψ e z n 1 k ψ ψ e z n ψ n ψ n e ˆ ψ n t s then u e z and r e z are the desired value of u and r in order that the tracking errors e

2 m 22 δ r n t s f 2 n e ˆ r n t s the values of t u n and t r n represent the control actions necessary to the ship reaches and follow a pre established trajectory under the effect of additive uncertainties in the proposed methodology first an estimation of the uncertainty is added to the ship model then are identifies the reference speeds so that the error tends to zero and then control actions are calculated to keep the obtained velocity profile theorem 1 if trajectory tracking problems are considered the system behavior is ruled by 10 the additive uncertainty can be modeled with a m order polynomial and the controller is designed by 25 27 28 and 30 then e n 0 when n proof the proof starts with the analysis of variable u replacing t u n given by 30 in 10 and operating 31 is found 31 u e z n 1 u n 1 e u n 1 k u u e z n u n e u n e u n e ˆ u n then if e u n is unknown and each component is an m order polynomial the uncertainty e u n and their estimated value e ˆ u n can be eliminated from 31 see remark 3 32 e u n 1 k u e u n thence if 0 k u 1 and n with n n then e u n 0 then we find the error equations of the remaining variables ψ r x and y analyzing the variable r from

tends to zero because e ψ n 0 and e u n 0 when n 0 thus is demonstrated that e x n 0 and e y n 0 when n 0 and the tracking error tends to 0 3 4 methodology summary before applying the methodology it is necessary to represent the mathematical model of the system in state form as a set of linear first order differential equations the design methodology can be summarized in five steps first the system of linear first order differential equations represented in state form is discretized using a numerical method next is incorporated into the system model an additive uncertainty and then it is estimated according to 19 20 and 12 the estimation order is chosen according to the supposed uncertainty order third the control problem is formulated as solving a system of linear equations iu b where i is input matrix u is vector composed by the control action and b is vector function of the state variables and the system parameters then the state variables chosen as desired values must be replaced by the reference variables assuming a smooth approaching for instance proportional to the error λ n 1 λ r e f n 1 k λ λ r e f n λ n where λ n is a state variable at instant n k λ is a controller parameter associated to the variable λ and λ r e f n is the value of the reference variable at instant n next the desired trajectory of the remaining state variables should be determined these variables are defined with the subscript e z assuming also an approaching proportional to the error the aim is to find the value of the control actions at instant n such that the trajectory tracking error tends to zero to accomplish this the system iu b must have an exact solution then the vector b must be contained in the space formed by the columns of i i e the vector b must be a linear combination of the column vectors of matrix i strang 2011 thus the conditions such that the system iu b has an exact solution and the errors tend to zero are defined in this step finally the control actions are obtained by solving system iu b by mean of least squares method i t iu i t b 4 simulations results in this section is presented a controller tuning based on a numeric method then the controller performance is tested under the effect of environmental disturbances and model errors in order to analyze the improvements made to the original control scheme the proposed controller is compared with the proposed in serrano et al 2014 the simulations are achieved using the programming environment simulink of matlab platform the control methodology is applied to the original time continuous system as shown in fig 2 the ship model parameters m d b are obtained from serrano et al 2014 børhaug et al 2011 and the sample time used was t s 0 1 s 36 m 25 8 0 0 0 33 8 11 748 0 11 748

controller tuning theorem 1 gives the limits between which the controller parameters can be chosen if these parameters are chosen properly the vessel reaches and follow a predetermined path smoothly without undesired oscillations in this work it is used eq 8 of tempo and ishii 2007 with an accuracy of 0 007 ε and a confidence value δ of 0 01 thus it is necessary to make 1000 simulations the whole explanation of this method is explained in tempo and ishii 2007 this method is applied as follows the simulations are implemented using simulink of matlab software the experiment is carried out considering m 0 1 2 in 19 these will be called c0 c1 and c2 respectively for each controller c0 c1 and c2 1000 simulations are executed the controller parameters are fixed in each trial and are chosen in a random way before of each simulation such that 0 k λ 1 the lower and upper bound are chosen such according to proof of theorem 1 of this work a sinusoidal trajectory is considered for the implementation of the monte carlo experiment this reference trajectory remains fixed for each simulation a cost function that evaluates the controller performance is defined the controller set of parameters that minimizes the predefined cost function is selected as optimal the cost function defined for choose the optimal controller parameters set is show in 37 it considers the cost incurred by the tracking error where φ represents the desired trajectory φ the number of points of such trajectory i 0 φ 1 2 x r e f i x i 2 the quadratic error in the x coordinate and i 0 φ 1 2 y r e f i y i 2 the quadratic error in the y coordinate 37 c φ i 0 φ 1 2 x r e f n x n 2 y r e f n y n 2 although this procedure does not guarantee an optimum solution the monte carlo experiment offers an estimated result based on a large number of trials hence 1000 values of each parameter for each controller c0 c1 and c2 ranging from 0 to 1 were simulated the results of the mc experiment are shown in fig 3 the tracking cost of the 1000 simulations for controller c0 m 0 are presented in fig 3 a the minimum cost obtained with controller c0 corresponds to 17 05 and is shown in 3 a fig 3 b presents the results for 1000 trials using the controller c1 proposed in this work m 1 as can be seen the minimum cost obtained is 15 99 finally the minimum cost obtained by c2 is shown in fig 3 c the minimum cost obtained is 14 87 fig 3 d summarize the minimum cost obtained for each controller by analyzing the results obtained in 3 can be concluded that if m increases the performance of the controller improves it verifies the theoretical results obtained in the previous section in table 1 are summarized the results obtained in mc simulations fig 4 show the best performance reached for each controller table 1 the position of the ship and the reference trajectory is shown in fig 4 a the ship orientation and the control actions applied in each sample time can be seen in fig 4 b fig c and fig d respectively 4 2 simulation under uncertainty now the performance of the controller is evaluated under the presence of additive uncertainties in two typical trajectories of the literature the controller parameters used in c0 c1 and c2 are obtained from the monte carlo experiment of the previous section table 1 with the aim of analyzing the improvement introduced in the control technique based on linear algebra the performance of our approach will be contrasted with the original method presented in serrano et al 2014 this controller will be called c3 hereinafter in order to quantify the performance of each controller the mean and error variance will be calculated according to 38 and 39 respectively jazwinski 2007 38 x n 1 n e n n 39 σ 2 n 1 n e n x 2 n where n is the number of sampling periods performed during the experience and e n represents the tracking error at the n instant see remark 4 4 2 1 simulation with environmental disturbances in order to analyze the controllers performance polynomial disturbances in x and y variables are introduced in the continuous ship model according to 40 the time variation of d x and d y is given by fig 5 as can be seen first a constant disturbance is introduced in both variables at time t 40 s then a linear function is added to the disturbance function at time t 85 s and finally a quadratic signal is introduced in t 170 s 40 x u cos ψ vsin ψ d x y u sin ψ vcos ψ d y ψ r u f 1 n b 11 m 11 t u r m 22 m 22 m 33 m 23 2 f 2 n b 32 t r in applications as obstacle avoidance the reference trajectory must be re planned when unexpected objects appear in some cases abrupt changes are generated in this reference trajectory due to the large danger of collision in order to evaluate the performance of the marine vessel in a situation such as that previously mentioned a square reference trajectory was chosen in this subsection the trajectory to be followed by the ship is generated with a constant linear velocity of v 0 25 m s the trajectory begins in the position x r e f 0 y r e f 0 1 m 1 m and the initial position of the marine vessel is at the system origin fig 6 a shows the trajectory followed by the ship on the plane x y for each controller as can be seen when no disturbances appear the performance obtained with all controllers is similar if a constant disturbance is introduced the tracking error do not increase significantly due the integrative behavior of the ship model however if a linear disturbance is introduced a constant error appears in the tracking obtained by c3 as it is shown in fig 6 c and d when quadratic disturbances appear the tracking error of c3 increases linearly fig 6 b show the trajectory cost of all implemented controllers by inspection of this figure c2 presents the best performance when polynomial disturbances are introduced during the ship navigation note how the performance error can be reduced by 31 just adding a zero order estimator by 36 with a first order one and by 47 with a second order estimator 4 2 2 simulation considering modeling errors and enviromental disturbances in real applications mathematical models cannot faithfully represent marine vessels in addition during the navigation the ship s load varies and waves and wind causes poor performance of the control system now the goal is to analyze the combined effects of modeling errors and weather conditions in the control system performance kim et al 2017 luo et al 2016 ghommam et al 2010 pierson et al 1980 thus a variation is introduced in the nominal model parameters and to represent wave and wind behavior disturbances are introduced in the ship modeling errors were introduced by changing 10 the values of m and d matrices 41 m 28 4 0 0 0 30 42 12 91 0 12 91 6 067 d 1 8 0 0 0 6 3 7 7967 0 7 7967 1 562 furthermore new disturbances were introduced in x and y variables representing wave behavior as show fig 7 ghommam et al 2010 this disturbance function is obtained adding a sinusoidal function to the polynomial disturbance of fig 5 wind effect can be represented by introducing a disturbance in linear and transverse velocities pierson et al 1980 thus the disturbance w shown in fig 8 is added to u and v variables see equation 2 the simulation is performed using an eight shaped trajectory the system origin is the initial position of the ship and the reference trajectory begins in x r e f y r e f 1 m 2 m the simulations results are shown in fig 9 by inspection of fig 9 a all controllers reach and follow the reference trajectory nevertheless the controllers c0 c1 and c2 proposed in this paper have better results this can be better appreciate in fig 9 c and d where the tracking errors in x coordinate and y coordinate are shown the effect of the modeling errors in the tracking errors is reduced by the estimation based controllers this can be better be appreciated in the first 40s of fig 9 c and d note that although the disturbance increases significantly tracking errors remain below 0 2 m this test demonstrates another advantage of the proposed estimation technique fig 9 b show the comparison of tracking performance between the four different controllers under modeling errors and waves disturbances table 2 summarizes the results obtained by each controller in the simulations as can be seen estimation based controllers c0 c1 and c2 have a better performance than c3 moreover it is observed that the variance values obtained are small and the mean of the errors obtained for the controllers presented in this paper improves up to 29 the performance of the original controller proposed in serrano et al 2014 5 conclusion a novel methodology for trajectory tracking in marine vessels under uncertainty was presented the methodology allows controlling of a nonlinear system in the presence of environmental disturbances and additive uncertainties in order to deal with this issue a new control scheme was proposed and a new term has been added to the ship model representing the uncertainty then this unknown uncertainty is approximated by numerical methods using the past values the estimation order is chosen considering the variation hypothesis of e n if each component of e n is an m order polynomial then the uncertainty e n and its estimated value e ˆ n are m order so as to avoid its influence on the tracking error e n compared to the technique based on linear algebra presented in serrano et al 2014 the problem is now addressed in a more realistic way considering the uncertainty of the system in the problem formulation this new approach improves tracking errors without increasing the complexity of the control algorithm in addition a controller tuning approach through monte carlo experiment is proposed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology were conducted some tests by adding different types of uncertainty it was clearly shown that the proposed controller performance is remarkably better while the complexity of the algorithm is not excessive finally has been demonstrated the convergence to zero of the tracking errors besides this control approach can be applied to many nonlinear systems making it a promising technique for its application to several robotic systems furthermore the present methodology has the advantage of using discrete equations and therefore a direct implementation in most computer driven systems is feasible

22653,reinforced thermoplastic pipes rtps can experience collapse under external pressure the maximum external pressure that rtps can resist before buckling collapse must be considered in engineering practice to predict the critical pressure of rtps a new analytical model is proposed by analyzing the hoop stress distributions of crushed rings the model is made under the assumption that the maximum hoop stress equals the critical stress when pipes collapse different from the previously reported studies focusing on axial compression the critical stress of cylinders buckling under crushing loads is formulated with regard to the material anisotropy of rtps the equivalent stiffness method is applied to obtain the homogenized hoop elastic modulus in the proposed model the effectiveness of the proposed model is verified by eigenvalue analyses on solid models and continuum shell models compared with numerical methods and timoshenko and gere 1961 the proposed model was found to give accurate critical pressures and hoop stress distributions furthermore the optimal range for fiber s winding angle is obtained and the effect of thickness radius ratios on critical pressure and the

consists of liner coating and laminates in the middle bai et al 2015 the liner and coating are made of hdpe to protect the reinforcing layers from corroding due to the transported product and the environment yu et al 2015 as the principle load bearing layers laminates are composed of hdpe and carbon fibers or glass fibers wound at different angles yu et al 2015 while the exploration of oil and gas are increasing in deep water rtps may collapse during the installation process therefore predicting the critical pressure of rtps is a crucial step to address the collapse problem timoshenko and gere 1961 obtained the critical pressure of cylinders based on small deflection assumption and thin wall ring assumption there are numerous papers on the collapse of flexible pipes which can be used for reference neto and martins 2009 2012 2014 compared 3d finite element models with analytical models to predict the wet collapse pressure of carcass layer and pressure armor layer based on timoshenko and gere s work tang et al 2016 proposed a strain energy equivalence method to investigate the collapse of carcass layer and got conservative results cuamatzi melendez et al 2017 used the arc length method to study the effect of ovality on the collapse of carcass layer and showed the necessity to develop proper 3d finite element models for collapse evaluation castello et al 2007 analyzed the ultimate strength of sandwich pipes under external pressure by numerical analysis and experimental studies for rtps material properties vary from layer to layer the collapse prediction is still challenging dalmolen et al 2009 because of the material anisotropy bai et al 2016 developed a 3d finite element model to investigate the collapse of rtps and proved the reliability of numerical results by comparison with hydrostatic buckling experiments sun et al 2014a 2014b proposed a stress homogenization method to study composite cylindrical structures subjected to pressure axial forces bending etc the research of sun et al 2014a 2014b showed that the material anisotropy might have significant effects on the effective axial torsional and coupling stiffness coefficients of composite cylinders based on the composite pipe stress homogenization theory toh et al 2018 obtained the corresponding ply properties in filament wound pipes by the comparison between experiments and analytical models cho et al 2019 proposed an empirical formula to predict the collapse strength of composite cylindrical shells considering geometric and material nonlinearities compared to hydrostatic buckling experiments the reliability of the empirical formula was proved but the applicability of the formula was only studied for winding angles in the range 5 70 hur et al 2008 investigated the post buckling behavior and failure of composite cylinders subjected to external hydrostatic pressure by comparing numerical results with hydrostatic buckling experiments compared to experimental results the best numerical results had an error margin within 15 5 and the buckling modes of different methods presented a remarkable variation however those hydrostatic buckling experiments require expensive and large devices and the homogenization model sun et al 2014a 2014b needs large matrix calculations and successive iterations to investigate the elastic buckling collapse of rtps under external pressures a new analytical model is proposed to predict the critical pressure assuming that the maximum hoop stress equals the critical stress when pipes collapse the maximum hoop stress is determined by analyzing the hoop stress distributions of crushed rings the critical stress of cylinders buckling under crushing loads is computed based on donnell equation with regard to the material anisotropy of rtps the equivalent stiffness method is applied to obtain the homogenized hoop elastic modulus eigenvalue analyses on solid models and continuum shell models are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model compared with numerical methods and timoshenko and gere 1961 the proposed model was found to give accurate critical pressures and hoop stress distributions furthermore the effects of the fibers winding angle and thickness radius ratios on the critical pressure are discussed 2 new analytical model based on the hoop stress analysis of crushed rings 2 1 hoop stress distribution of crushed rings as shown in fig 2 the cross sections of rtps were crushed into oval shaped rings under crushing loads on the oval shaped ring there are eight points whose von mises stresses equal 0 distributing symmetrically on the internal and external surfaces and these points are named singularity points the angle between the singularity points and the crushing load is 39 6 which has been verified by photoelastic tests and theoretical derivation sun et al 2014c a half ring was employed in the following theoretical derivation because of the geometric symmetry as shown in fig 3 as shown in fig 4 the oval shaped ring can be divided into two compression zones and two expansion zones by singularity points sun et al 2014c frocht 1946 in the open literature sarvestani and hojjati 2017 hoop stresses affect the buckling behavior of cylinders therefore hoop stress distributions are mainly discussed in the following hoop stresses in compression zones are negative at the external surface and positive at the internal surface while hoop stresses in expansion zones are positive at the external surface and negative at the internal surface ren et al 2019 meanwhile as expressed in fig 4 the maximum hoop stresses appear on the internal and external surfaces of the oval shaped ring bai and bai 2016 eq 1 gives the analytical solution of the hoop stresses on the internal and external surfaces of the oval shaped ring as follows timoshenko 1922 1 σ θ θ r i 3 2 m θ w δ 2 σ θ θ r o 3 2 m θ w δ 2 where σ θθ denotes hoop stress m θ is the bending moment on each cross section shown in fig 3 δ denotes half of the thickness r o denotes the external radius and r i denotes the internal radius of the ring w is the axial length of the ring in the present 2d model the axial length w is taken as 1 m the unit length from eq 1 singularity points are located on the cross sections where the bending moment is equal to 0 the bending moment m θ in eq 1 was given as follows timoshenko and gere 1961 2 m θ m 0 p r 2 1 cos θ where p denotes the crushing load r is the mean radius of the ring m 0 was derived by castigliano s theorem timoshenko and gere 1961 3 m 0 p r 2 2 π 1 by defining t 2δ and φ π 2 θ and substituting eq 2 and eq 3 into eq 1 hoop stresses on the internal and external surfaces of the oval shaped ring can be expressed as 4 σ θ θ r i 3 w t 2 p r sin φ 2 π σ θ θ r o 3 w t 2 p r sin φ 2 π as expressed in eq 4 the hoop stress σ θθ is related to the crushing load p the mean radius and the thickness it is applicable to homogenous pipes and rtps because the hoop stress doesn t depend on material constants eq 4 also gives the locations of singularity points where φ equals sin 1 2 π which is close to 39 6 singularity points move disproportionately within a small area as the thickness radius ratio changes discussed in section 4 4 details about the disproportionate motions of singularity points can be found in sun et al 2014c which is neglected in the following theoretical derivation on the internal and external surfaces of the crushed ring hoop stresses of the points on minor axis reach the maximum 5 σ max σ θ θ φ 0 6 π p r w t 2 for an oval shaped ring the location with the minimum curvature collapses firstly timoshenko and gere 1961 the physical interpretation is that stresses of the points on minor axis reach the critical stress σcr discussed in section 2 2 at first by assuming σ max equals σcr according to eq 5 the critical crushing load p cr can be expressed as follows 6 p c r π t 2 w σ cr 6 r 2 2 critical stress of cylinders buckling under crushing loads as discussed in section 2 1 when the stresses of the points on the minor axis reach the critical stress σcr the ring collapses therefore it is a significant step to obtain the critical stress of cylinders buckling under crushing loads in the new analytical model in the present paper following the same derivation process of obtaining the critical stress of cylinders buckling under axial compression tang et al 1989 the critical stress of cylinders buckling under crushing loads is solved based on donnell s work 1933 in the derivation processes of obtaining critical pressure of cylinders buckling under axial compression tang et al 1989 and under crushing loads the difference is stress analysis and details are as follows considering the equilibrium of a small element on minor axis shown in fig 5 p z p θ p zθ and p θz are first mid plane forces first mid plane forces are induced by loads before buckling occurs and donnell equation based on the thin shell theory takes the following form tang et al 1989 7 d 8 w 4 p z 2 w z 2 p θ 2 w θ 2 2 p z θ 2 w z θ e t r 2 4 w z 4 0 where w denotes the radial displacement e is young s modulus v is the poisson s ratio z and θ correspond to the axial and hoop directions respectively d and 4 were given by 8 d e t 3 12 1 v 2 4 2 z 2 2 θ 2 2 z 2 2 θ 2 as expressed in eq 7 it is easy to obtain the critical loads of cylinders by donnell equation because there is only one displacement variable w in the eighth order differential equation tang et al 1989 the mid plane force p z p zθ and p θz are ignored in the following theoretical derivation because of the infinite boundary conditions on the cross sections of cylinders p θ takes the following form 9 p θ σ θ θ t substituting eq 9 into eq 7 gives the following expression 10 d 8 w σ θ θ t 4 2 w θ 2 e t r 2 4 w z 4 0 where w takes the following form timoshenko and gere 1961 11 w w 0 sin m π z l sin n θ r in eq 11 w 0 is the maximum radial displacement as shown in fig 6 m denotes half wave numbers of cylinders along the axial direction n denotes half wave numbers of cylinders along the hoop direction the cylinder translates rigidly in r θ plane when n equals 1 and 2 is the minimum root of buckling modes for a 2 dimensional ring and high order buckling modes occur with additional constraints timoshenko and gere 1961 defining β nl πr substituting eq 11 into eq 10 gives the following equation 12 d π l 8 m 2 β 2 4 σ θ θ t π l 6 β 2 m 2 β 2 2 e t r 2 m 4 π l 4 0 introduce the following variables into eq 12 tang et al 1989 13 α l 2 r t 1 v 2 1 2 k θ σ θ θ t l 2 d π 2 where α is a dimensionless parameter which describes shape features of rings including radius and length the buckling coefficient k θ is similar to the buckling coefficient of the thin plate tang et al 1989 substituting eq 13 into eq 12 gives the following equation 14 m 2 β 2 4 k θ β 2 m 2 β 2 2 12 m 4 α 2 π 4 0 in order to calculate the critical stress the minimum root of k θ should be calculated firstly tang et al 1989 and it takes the following form 15 k θ min 4 3 π 2 α based on the above derivation the critical stress can be given as follows 16 σ c r e t 3 1 v 2 r eq 16 gives a similar but not identical value with the critical stress of cylinders buckling under axial compressions calculated by timoshenko and gere 1961 for rtps e denotes the homogenized hoop elastic modulus in eq 16 the physical interpretation of the similarity is that the buckling modes of cylinders under axial compressions and under crushing loads along hoop direction are similar eq 16 also shows that critical stress increases linearly with increasing thickness radius ratios therefore critical stress is related to geometric parameters besides material parameters 2 3 critical pressure calculated by static equivalence method in the deepwater environment rtps may collapse under the uniform hydrostatic pressure in order to calculate the critical pressure via critical crushing loads static equivalence method li and zhang 2010 was employed according to the symmetry of the ring shown in fig 7 the expression between the crushing load p and equivalent uniform pressure p can be described as 17 p 0 w 0 π p sin θ r o d θ d l 2 w r o p by substituting eq 17 and eq 16 into eq 6 the critical pressure can be expressed as follows 18 p c r π e 12 3 1 v 2 t 3 r o r 2 2 4 existing critical pressure formula timoshenko and gere 1961 obtained the critical pressure of cylinders based on the small deflection assumption the existing critical pressure expression takes the following form 19 p c r e 4 t r 3 the above formula was widely used to solve elastic buckling problems of carcass layer and pressure armor layer in unbonded flexible risers and steel pipes neto and martins 2014 tang et al 2016 cuamatzi melendez et al 2017 sævik and ye 2016 he et al 2014 2015 compared with eq 19 the geometric parameters and material parameters in eq 18 are the same including the cube of thickness the cube of radius and homogenized hoop elastic modulus discussed in section 2 5 therefore the proposed equation eq 18 is reasonable 2 5 homogenized hoop elastic moduli of rtps as shown in eq 18 and eq 19 the determination of homogenized hoop elastic modulus is dispensable in investigating elastic buckling problems as shown in fig 1 rtps consists of liner coating and laminates the liner and the coating are made of neat thermoplastic yu et al 2015 and the middle laminates consist of a lot of repeating sublaminate with winding angles ranging from 0 to 90 shown in fig 8 due to the complexity of materials the homogenized hoop elastic moduli of rtps sun et al 2014b are difficult to be calculated the equivalent stiffness method toh et al 2018 tang et al 2016 is applied to obtain the homogenized hoop elastic modulus in the present paper 20 k p w where k is the hoop stiffness of the pipe per unit length p is the crushing load w is the radial displacement of the point on minor axis shown in fig 2 in addition neglecting plane strain condition the hoop stiffness can be expressed as tang et al 2016 21 k 2 π e 3 π 2 8 t r 3 comparing the relations shown in eq 20 and eq 21 the homogenized hoop elastic modulus takes the following form 22 e 3 π 2 8 p 2 π w r t 3 the solution of the homogenized hoop elastic modulus was validated by crushing experiments numerical simulation and theoretical derivation toh et al 2018 as a macroscopic parameter the homogenized hoop elastic modulus describes the circumferential stiffness characteristics of rtps in eq 22 the unknowns including the crushing load p and the radial displacement w can be obtained by radial compression tests or numerical calculations in the present paper they were obtained from the numerical model shown in section 3 4 the winding angles of fibers have a great effect on the hoop stiffness of rtps and the output of the radial displacement w based on the above stress analysis and the solution of the homogenized hoop elastic modulus the critical pressure of cylinders buckling under external pressure is predicted easily neglecting plane strain condition and substituting the homogenized hoop elastic modulus into eq 18 and eq 19 the critical pressure is obtained 3 numerical simulation 3 1 finite element model in order to estimate the critical pressure of rtps numerically three finite element models were created using commercial software abaqus dassault systèmes 2010 the lengths of finite element models were 150 mm and the finite element model shown in fig 9 consists of liner laminates and coating geometric parameters and material parameters xia et al 2002 sun et al 2014b of liner laminates and coating are shown in table 1 and table 2 respectively and the winding angles of fibers were 55 55 for all models 3 2 meshes and element types in numerical models c3d8r 8 node linear brick elements with reduced integration was used for the elements of liner and coating dassault systèmes 2010 this element type is good at linear and nonlinear analysis involving contact plasticity and large deformation bai et al 2016 the elements of laminates were sweep elements with radial stack direction to obtain more accurate numerical results and compare different laminates simulation methods c3d8r and sc8r 8 node continuum shell elements with reduced integration were used to simulate laminates respectively continuum shell elements sc8r and solid elements c3d8r provide a more realistic modeling of the laminate structure as compared to shell elements s4r solid model the element type of laminates is c3d8r continuum shell model the element type of laminates is sc8r 3 3 boundary conditions and loads in order to avoid the boundary effects as shown in fig 9a the coupling of dof on the sectional nodes was set to consider the kinematics of infinite bai et al 2016 neto and martins 2012 ren et al 2019 dassault systèmes 2010 besides symmetric boundary conditions about x z plane and y z plane were applied to produce ovalization deformation ren et al 2019 all nodes at x 0 mm can only move up and down meanwhile all nodes at y 0 mm can only move right and left a node at y 0 mm was fixed along the axial direction to avoid rigid motion bai et al 2016 ren et al 2019 uniform pressure was applied on the external surface of the pipe eigenvalue analysis was used to simulate the elastic buckling of rtps 3 4 solution of homogenized hoop elastic modulus in section 2 5 the hoop stiffness used to calculate the homogenized hoop elastic modulus in eq 21 was obtained numerically in the present paper to be consistent with analytical models shown in fig 2 two rigid plates were set to apply crushing loads as shown in fig 10 the rigid plate on the top could only translate along y direction and the rigid plate under the pipe was fixed uniform pressure was applied on the upper surface of the top plate to simulate the crushing load p the friction coefficient between plates and pipe was 0 1 general static analysis was used in the simulations 4 results and discussion 4 1 comparison of critical pressures predicted by analytical and numerical methods critical pressures calculated by different methods are listed in table 3 the results calculated by continuum shell models were higher than the results calculated by solid models with a difference of 10 compared to numerical results analytical results were more conservative the results calculated by timoshenko and gere 1961 were close to numerical results with a mean difference of 7 from table 3 critical pressures calculated by the proposed model were a factor of 0 5 lower than the values predicted by other methods there were mainly two reasons which caused the proposed model to predict lower critical pressure on the one hand the constant term π 12 3 0 15 in eq 18 is close to half of the constant term 1 4 0 25 in eq 19 the difference between the constant terms in eq 18 and eq 19 attributes to the analytical solution of hoop stress discussed in section 4 2 on the other hand eq 18 includes mean radius and external radius and the radius in eq 19 denotes mean radius the above differences explain why the critical pressure calculated by the proposed model was a factor of 0 5 lower than other methods therefore it is recommended that the results of the proposed model be divided by a factor of 0 5 after considering this modification factor the proposed model was modified and gave the critical pressure as 23 p c r π e 6 3 1 v 2 t 3 r o r 2 as shown in fig 11 compared to timoshenko and gere 1961 after modified the results of the proposed model were more close to numerical results for pipes with different geometric parameters the comparison showed that the proposed model could predict stable and reliable critical pressure 4 2 hoop stress analysis under the crushing loads shown in fig 10 the cross section of 8 inch pipe was crushed to an oval shape as shown in fig 12 a quarter of the liner and the coating the compression and expansion zones were in extremely good agreement with the analysis for homogenous pipes in the open literature sun et al 2014c ren et al 2019 for the coating the region located on the minor axis was compressed and the region located on the major axis was stretched on the contrary for the liner the region located on the major axis was compressed and the region located on the minor axis was stretched for laminates the hoop stress distributions were affected by the material anisotropy and fiber s orientations the stress continuity conditions should be satisfied at the layer interfaces menshykova and guz 2014 as shown in fig 13 the numerical models in this research couldn t give realistic hoop stress distributions of laminates precise stress distributions of laminates are still in need of further study for all pipes the buckling collapse was a macro mechanical behavior therefore in the present paper it focuses more on the hoop stress distribution on boundaries the internal and external surfaces in this way the effect of the material anisotropy on the hoop stress distributions of laminates is aside from the major issues and not mainly discussed as expressed in eq 4 hoop stresses are linear with the crushing load p to compare hoop stresses predicted by different methods the ratios between hoop stresses and the crushing load were calculated this ratio is only determined by the mean radius and thickness the above ratios along the internal and external circumference of the 8 inch pipe a quarter of a circle predicted by different methods are shown in fig 14 and fig 15 respectively in fig 15 when φ ranging from 0 to 10 the numerical results were not accurate because the contact between rtps and rigid plate caused stress concentration as shown in figs 14 and 15 the results of solid models and continuum shell models were consistent and the results calculated by timoshenko 1922 were much higher the comparison of hoop stress distributions between numerical models and timoshenko 1922 demonstrated the 0 5 lower load factor discussed in section 4 1 was from the hoop stress formulae timoshenko 1922 therefore the formulae of hoop stresses along the hoop direction eq 4 in the new analytical model was modified by the factor of 0 5 and given as 24 σ θ θ r i 3 2 w t 2 p r sin φ 2 π σ θ θ r o 3 2 w t 2 p r sin φ 2 π as shown in figs 14 and 15 when the modified hoop stress formulae were used the hoop stresses were in good agreement with the numerical results it demonstrated the modified hoop stress formulae were more accurate than timoshenko 1922 meanwhile all models can predict the locations of singularity points correctly according to the analysis of section 2 1 the hoop stress formulae play an important role in predicting the buckling loads the error of the initial hoop stress formulae timoshenko 1922 directly lead to the error of critical pressures predicted by the proposed model the hoop stress comparison showed that the modification factor of the proposed model mainly attributes to the difference of hoop stress prediction in timoshenko 1922 4 3 effect of winding angles the winding angles of fibers have a great effect on the critical pressure to investigate the effect of the winding angle on hoop carrying capacity the 8 inch pipes with different winding angles were modeled critical pressures of different models are listed in table 4 the results estimated by solid models and continuum shell models were higher than the analytical results as the winding angle increases the differences between solid models and timoshenko and gere 1961 increase and the error margin reach 15 6 when the winding angle close to 90 from fig 16 the results of the proposed model were more close to the results of solid models with an error margin less than 10 for arbitrary angles it demonstrated the critical pressure predicted by the proposed model was more accurate especially for rtps with relatively large winding angles as a whole in fig 16 the critical pressures increase with the increasing winding angles when the winding angles range from 0 to 30 critical pressures estimated by all methods increase slowly it demonstrates that fibers couldn t enhance the hoop carrying capacity of pipes when winding angles are less than 30 critical pressures rise rapidly as the winding angle increases from 30 to 80 in this range the winding angles have a great effect on the hoop carrying capacity engineers could pick appropriate winding angles in this range to design rtps the critical pressure has minor increment when the winding angles increase from 80 to 90 the change of winding angles in this range has little effect on the hoop carrying capacity meanwhile fibers couldn t enhance the axial carrying capacity when the winding angles are close to 90 therefore it is recommended that the winding angles take a value from 30 to 80 4 4 effect of thickness radius ratios the existing critical pressure formula proposed by timoshenko and gere 1961 was derived by the differential equation for the curved beam under uniform pressures it was assumed that the pipe is thin wall in the derivation therefore the effect of thickness radius ratios was ignored in the analytical model proposed by timoshenko and gere 1961 however the thickness radius ratio has great effects on the critical pressure especially for thick wall pipes to investigate the effect of the thickness radius ratio on the critical pressure numerical and analytical models were developed whose geometric parameters were consistent with the 8 inch pipe except for the internal radius the comparison is shown in table 5 and fig 17 as a whole the critical pressure increases with the increasing thickness radius ratio the reason is that the critical pressure is proportionate to the cube of the thickness radius ratios as shown in eq 18 and eq 19 for the pipes whose thickness radius ratios vary from 0 15 to 0 30 as shown in fig 17 the proposed model and timoshenko and gere 1961 can both predict accurate critical pressures with an error margin less than 10 however for the pipes whose thickness radius ratios are greater than 0 3 the differences between numerical and analytical models increase with the increasing thickness radius ratio on the one hand the effect of thickness radius ratios on the critical pressures was ignored in timoshenko and gere 1961 on the other hand the proposed model was based on the assumption that the singularity points are fixed singularity points move along the circumference within a small area as the thickness radius ratio changes according to the open literature sun et al 2014c singularity points on the internal surface move towards to the point of crushing load along the circumference as shown in fig 18 and fig 19 meanwhile the singularity points on the external surface move in the opposite direction along the circumference as shown in fig 20 and fig 21 it demonstrates additional compressions exist in the deformed rings sun et al 2014c the additional compressions counteract partial positive stresses the higher the thickness radius ratios the stronger the interactions between additional compressions and positive stresses for pipes with high thickness radius ratios the strong interactions make the stresses of points on the minor axis reach critical stress more difficult therefore the interactions between additional compressions and positive stresses play a role in enhancing the hoop carrying capacity this is also the reason that the differences between numerical models and analytical models were large for pipes with high thickness radius ratios in short both analytical models were more applicable to the predictions of critical pressures for pipes with low thickness radius ratios for pipes with high thickness radius ratios both analytical models were too conservative and should consider the effect of thickness radius ratios 5 conclusions this work focuses on the buckling collapse of rtps under external uniform pressure a new analytical model to estimate the critical pressure of rtps by the hoop stress distribution of crushed rings is proposed which assumes that the maximum hoop stress equals the critical stress when pipes collapse the critical stress of cylinders buckling under crushing loads is obtained based on donnell equation the homogenized hoop elastic moduli of rtps is derived based on the equivalent stiffness method eigenvalue analyses on solid models and continuum shell models are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model compared with numerical methods and timoshenko and gere 1961 the proposed model was found to give accurate critical pressures and hoop stress distributions the critical pressure predicted by the proposed model was reliable for rtps with different winding angles and the optimal range for fiber s winding angle was obtained in the present paper according to the present study the winding angle taking a value from 30 to 80 is recommended in pipe design in this range fibers play an important part in enhancing the hoop carrying capacity of rtps the comparison between numerical and analytical models showed that analytical models were more applicable to pipes with low thickness radius ratios for pipes with high thickness radius ratios the results of analytical models were too conservative disproportionate motions of singularity points demonstrated higher additional compressions exist in thicker rings which leads to the error of analytical models for pipes with high thickness radius ratios the interactions between additional compressions and positive stresses enhance the hoop carrying capacity of rtps

composite pipes are widely used in offshore engineering due to its outstanding advantages of corrosion resistance high pressure resistance good thermal insulation light weight and easy to install bai et al 2014 2016 xia et al 2002 toh et al 2018 rtps are typical composite pipes extensively used in oil and gas industry toh et al 2018 as shown in fig 1 reinforced thermoplastic pipe generally consists of liner coating and laminates in the middle bai et al 2015 the liner and coating are made of hdpe to protect the reinforcing layers from corroding due to the transported product and the environment yu et al 2015 as the principle load bearing layers laminates are composed of hdpe and carbon fibers or glass fibers wound at different angles yu et al 2015 while the exploration of oil and gas are increasing in deep water rtps may collapse during the installation process therefore predicting the critical pressure of rtps is a crucial step to address the collapse problem timoshenko and gere 1961 obtained the critical pressure of cylinders based on small deflection assumption and thin wall ring assumption there are numerous papers on the collapse of flexible pipes which can be used for reference neto and martins 2009 2012 2014 compared 3d finite element models with analytical models to predict the wet collapse pressure of carcass layer and pressure armor layer based on

models cho et al 2019 proposed an empirical formula to predict the collapse strength of composite cylindrical shells considering geometric and material nonlinearities compared to hydrostatic buckling experiments the reliability of the empirical formula was proved but the applicability of the formula was only studied for winding angles in the range 5 70 hur et al 2008 investigated the post buckling behavior and failure of composite cylinders subjected to external hydrostatic pressure by comparing numerical results with hydrostatic buckling experiments compared to experimental results the best numerical results had an error margin within 15 5 and the buckling modes of different methods presented a remarkable variation however those hydrostatic buckling experiments require expensive and large devices and the homogenization model sun et al 2014a 2014b needs large matrix calculations and successive iterations to investigate the elastic buckling collapse of rtps under external pressures a new analytical model is proposed to predict the critical pressure assuming that the maximum hoop stress equals the critical stress when pipes collapse the maximum hoop stress is determined by analyzing the hoop stress distributions of crushed rings the critical stress of cylinders buckling under crushing loads is computed based on donnell equation with regard to the material anisotropy of

distribution of crushed rings as shown in fig 2 the cross sections of rtps were crushed into oval shaped rings under crushing loads on the oval shaped ring there are eight points whose von mises stresses equal 0 distributing symmetrically on the internal and external surfaces and these points are named singularity points the angle between the singularity points and the crushing load is 39 6 which has been verified by photoelastic tests and theoretical derivation sun et al 2014c a half ring was employed in the following theoretical derivation because of the geometric symmetry as shown in fig 3 as shown in fig 4 the oval shaped ring can be divided into two compression zones and two expansion zones by singularity points sun et al 2014c frocht 1946 in the open literature sarvestani and hojjati 2017 hoop stresses affect the buckling behavior of cylinders therefore hoop stress distributions are mainly discussed in the following hoop stresses in compression zones are negative at the external surface and positive at the internal surface while hoop stresses in expansion zones are positive at the external surface and negative at the internal surface ren et al 2019 meanwhile as expressed in fig 4 the maximum hoop stresses appear on the internal and external surfaces of the oval shaped ring bai and bai 2016 eq 1 gives the analytical solution of the hoop stresses on the internal and external surfaces of the oval shaped ring as follows timoshenko 1922 1 σ θ θ r i 3 2 m θ w δ 2 σ θ θ r o 3 2 m θ w δ 2 where σ θθ denotes hoop stress m θ is the bending moment on each cross section shown in fig 3 δ denotes half of the thickness r o denotes the external radius and r i denotes the internal radius of the ring w is the axial length of the ring in the present 2d model the axial length w is taken as 1 m the unit length from eq 1 singularity points are located on the cross sections where the bending moment is equal to 0 the bending moment m θ in eq 1 was given as follows timoshenko and gere 1961 2 m θ m 0 p r 2 1 cos θ where p denotes the crushing load r is the mean radius of the ring m 0 was derived by castigliano s theorem timoshenko and gere 1961 3 m 0 p r 2 2 π 1 by defining t 2δ and φ π 2 θ and substituting eq 2 and eq 3 into eq 1 hoop stresses on the internal and external surfaces of the oval shaped ring can be expressed as 4 σ θ θ r i 3 w t 2 p r sin φ 2 π σ θ θ r o 3 w t 2 p r sin φ 2 π as expressed in eq 4 the hoop stress σ θθ is related to the crushing load p the mean radius and the thickness it is applicable to homogenous pipes and rtps because the hoop stress doesn t depend on material constants eq 4 also gives the locations of singularity points where φ equals sin 1 2 π which is close to 39 6 singularity points move disproportionately within a small area as the thickness radius ratio changes discussed in section 4 4 details about the disproportionate motions of singularity points can be found in sun et al 2014c which is neglected in the following theoretical derivation on the internal and external surfaces of the crushed ring hoop stresses of the points on minor axis reach the maximum 5 σ max σ θ θ φ 0 6 π p r w t 2 for an oval shaped ring the location with the minimum curvature collapses firstly timoshenko and gere 1961 the physical interpretation is that stresses of the points on minor axis reach the critical stress σcr discussed in section 2 2 at first by assuming σ max equals σcr according to eq 5 the critical crushing load p cr can be expressed as follows 6 p c r π t 2 w σ cr 6 r 2 2 critical stress of cylinders buckling under crushing loads as discussed in section 2 1 when the stresses of the points on the minor axis reach the critical stress σcr the ring collapses therefore it is a significant step to obtain the critical stress of cylinders buckling under crushing loads in the new analytical model in the present paper following the same derivation process of obtaining the critical stress of cylinders buckling under axial compression tang et al 1989 the critical stress of cylinders buckling under crushing loads is solved based on donnell s work 1933 in the derivation processes of obtaining critical pressure of cylinders buckling under axial compression tang et al 1989 and under crushing loads the difference is stress analysis and details are as follows considering the equilibrium of a small element on minor axis shown in fig 5 p z p θ p zθ and p θz are first mid plane forces first mid plane forces are induced by loads before buckling occurs and donnell equation based on the thin shell theory takes the following form tang et al 1989 7 d 8 w 4 p z 2 w z 2 p θ 2 w θ 2 2 p z θ 2 w z θ e t r 2 4 w z 4 0 where w denotes the radial displacement e is young s modulus v is the poisson s ratio z and θ correspond to the axial and hoop directions respectively d and 4 were given by 8 d e t 3 12 1 v 2 4 2 z 2 2 θ 2 2 z 2 2 θ 2 as expressed in eq 7 it is easy to obtain the critical loads of cylinders by donnell equation because there is only one displacement variable w in the eighth order differential equation tang et al 1989 the mid plane force p z p zθ and p θz are ignored in the following theoretical derivation because of the infinite boundary conditions on the cross sections of cylinders p θ takes the following form 9 p θ σ θ θ t substituting eq 9 into eq 7 gives the following expression 10 d 8 w σ θ θ t 4 2 w θ 2 e t r 2 4 w z 4 0 where w takes the following form timoshenko and gere 1961 11 w w 0 sin m π z l sin n θ r in eq 11 w 0 is the maximum radial displacement as shown in fig 6 m denotes half wave numbers of cylinders along the axial direction n denotes half wave numbers of cylinders along the hoop direction the cylinder translates rigidly in r θ plane when n equals 1 and 2 is the minimum root of buckling modes for a 2 dimensional ring and high order buckling modes occur with additional constraints timoshenko and gere 1961 defining β nl πr substituting eq 11 into eq 10 gives the following equation 12 d π l 8 m 2 β 2 4 σ θ θ t π l 6 β 2 m 2 β 2 2 e t r 2 m 4 π l 4 0 introduce the following variables into eq 12 tang et al 1989 13 α l 2 r t 1 v 2 1 2 k θ σ θ θ t l 2 d π 2 where α is a dimensionless parameter which describes shape features of rings including radius and length the buckling coefficient k θ is similar to the buckling coefficient of the thin plate tang et al 1989 substituting eq 13 into eq 12 gives the following equation 14 m 2 β 2 4 k θ β 2 m 2 β 2 2 12 m 4 α 2 π 4 0 in order to calculate the critical stress the minimum root of k θ should be calculated firstly tang et al 1989 and it takes the following form 15 k θ min 4 3 π 2 α based on the above derivation the critical stress can be given as follows 16 σ c r e t 3 1 v 2 r eq 16 gives a similar but not identical value with the critical stress of cylinders buckling under axial compressions calculated by timoshenko and gere 1961 for rtps e denotes the homogenized hoop elastic modulus in eq 16 the physical interpretation of the similarity is that the buckling modes of cylinders under axial compressions and under crushing loads along hoop direction are similar eq 16 also shows that critical stress increases linearly with increasing thickness radius ratios therefore critical stress is related to geometric parameters besides material parameters 2 3 critical pressure calculated by static equivalence method in the deepwater environment rtps may collapse under the uniform hydrostatic pressure in order to calculate the critical pressure via critical crushing loads static equivalence method li and zhang 2010 was employed according to the symmetry of the ring shown in fig 7 the expression between the crushing load p and equivalent uniform pressure p can be described as 17 p 0 w 0 π p sin θ r o d θ d l 2 w r o p by substituting eq 17 and eq 16 into eq 6 the critical pressure can be expressed as follows 18 p c r π e 12 3 1 v 2 t 3 r o r 2 2 4 existing critical pressure formula timoshenko and gere 1961 obtained the critical pressure of cylinders based on the small deflection assumption the existing critical pressure expression takes the following form 19 p c r e 4 t r 3 the above formula was widely used to solve elastic buckling problems of carcass layer and pressure armor layer in unbonded flexible risers and steel pipes neto and martins 2014 tang et al 2016 cuamatzi melendez et al 2017 sævik and ye 2016 he et al 2014 2015 compared with eq 19 the geometric parameters and material parameters in eq 18 are the same including the cube of thickness the cube of radius and homogenized hoop elastic modulus discussed in section 2 5 therefore the proposed equation eq 18 is reasonable 2 5 homogenized hoop elastic moduli of rtps as shown in eq 18 and eq 19 the determination of homogenized hoop elastic modulus is dispensable in investigating elastic buckling problems as shown in fig 1 rtps consists of liner coating and laminates the liner and the coating are made of neat thermoplastic yu et al 2015 and the middle laminates consist of a lot of repeating sublaminate with winding angles ranging from 0 to 90 shown in fig 8 due to the complexity of materials the homogenized hoop elastic moduli of rtps sun et al 2014b are difficult to be calculated the equivalent stiffness method toh et al 2018 tang et al 2016 is applied to obtain the homogenized hoop elastic modulus in the present paper 20 k p w where k is the hoop stiffness of the pipe per unit length p is the crushing load w is the radial displacement of the point on minor axis shown in fig 2 in addition neglecting plane strain condition the hoop stiffness can be expressed as tang et al 2016 21 k 2 π e 3 π 2 8 t r 3 comparing the relations shown in eq 20 and eq 21 the homogenized hoop elastic modulus takes the following form 22 e 3 π 2 8 p 2 π w r t 3 the solution of the homogenized hoop elastic modulus was validated by crushing experiments numerical simulation and theoretical derivation toh et al 2018 as a macroscopic parameter the homogenized hoop elastic modulus describes the circumferential stiffness characteristics of rtps in eq 22 the unknowns including the crushing load p and the radial displacement w can be obtained by radial compression tests or numerical calculations in the present paper they were obtained from the numerical model shown in section 3 4 the winding angles of fibers have a great effect on the hoop stiffness of rtps and the output of the radial displacement w based on the above stress analysis and the solution of the homogenized hoop elastic modulus the critical pressure of cylinders buckling under external pressure is predicted easily neglecting plane strain condition and substituting the homogenized hoop elastic modulus into eq 18 and eq 19 the critical pressure is obtained 3 numerical simulation 3 1 finite element model in order to estimate the critical pressure of rtps numerically three finite element models were created using commercial software abaqus dassault systèmes 2010 the lengths of finite element models were 150 mm and the finite element model shown in fig 9 consists of liner laminates and coating geometric parameters and material parameters xia et al 2002 sun et al 2014b of liner laminates and coating are shown in table 1 and table 2 respectively and the winding angles of fibers were 55 55 for all models 3 2 meshes and element types in numerical models c3d8r 8 node linear brick elements with reduced integration was used for the elements of liner and coating dassault systèmes 2010 this element type is good at linear and nonlinear analysis involving contact plasticity and large deformation bai et al 2016 the elements of laminates were sweep elements with radial stack direction to obtain more accurate numerical results and compare different laminates simulation methods c3d8r and sc8r 8 node continuum shell elements with reduced integration were used to simulate laminates respectively continuum shell elements sc8r and solid elements c3d8r provide a more realistic modeling of the laminate structure as compared to shell elements s4r solid model the element type of laminates is c3d8r continuum shell model the element type of laminates is sc8r 3 3 boundary conditions and loads in order to avoid the boundary effects as shown in fig 9a the coupling of dof on the sectional nodes was set to consider the kinematics of infinite bai et al 2016 neto and martins 2012 ren et al 2019 dassault systèmes 2010 besides symmetric boundary conditions about x z plane and y z plane were applied to produce ovalization deformation ren et al 2019 all nodes at x 0 mm can only move up and down meanwhile all nodes at y 0 mm can only move right and left a node at y 0 mm was fixed along the axial direction to avoid rigid motion bai et al 2016 ren et al 2019 uniform pressure was applied on the external surface of the pipe eigenvalue analysis was used to simulate the elastic buckling of rtps 3 4 solution of homogenized hoop elastic modulus in section 2 5 the hoop stiffness used to calculate the homogenized hoop elastic modulus in eq 21 was obtained numerically in the present paper to be consistent with analytical models shown in fig 2 two rigid plates were set to apply crushing loads as shown in fig 10 the rigid plate on the top could only translate along y direction and the rigid plate under the pipe was fixed uniform pressure was applied on the upper surface of the top plate to simulate the crushing load p the friction coefficient between plates and pipe was 0 1 general static analysis was used in the simulations 4 results and discussion 4 1 comparison of critical pressures predicted by analytical and numerical methods critical pressures calculated by different methods are listed in table 3 the results calculated by continuum shell models were higher than the results calculated by solid models with a difference of 10 compared to numerical results analytical results were more conservative the results calculated by timoshenko and gere 1961 were close to numerical results with a mean difference of 7 from table 3 critical pressures calculated by the proposed model were a factor of 0 5 lower than the values predicted by other methods there were mainly two reasons which caused the proposed model to predict lower critical pressure on the one hand the constant term π 12 3 0 15 in eq 18 is close to half of the constant term 1 4 0 25 in eq 19 the difference between the constant terms in eq 18 and eq 19 attributes to the analytical solution of hoop stress discussed in section 4 2 on the other hand eq 18 includes mean radius and external radius and the radius in eq 19 denotes mean radius the above differences explain why the critical pressure calculated by the proposed model was a factor of 0 5 lower than other methods therefore it is recommended that the results of the proposed model be divided by a factor of 0 5 after considering this modification factor the proposed model was modified and gave the critical pressure as 23 p c r π e 6 3 1 v 2 t 3 r o r 2 as shown in fig 11 compared to timoshenko and gere 1961 after modified the results of the proposed model were more close to numerical results for pipes with different geometric parameters the comparison showed that the proposed model could predict stable and reliable critical pressure 4 2 hoop stress analysis under the crushing loads shown in fig 10 the cross section of 8 inch pipe was crushed to an oval shape as shown in fig 12 a quarter of the liner and the coating the compression and expansion zones were in extremely good agreement with the analysis for homogenous pipes in the open literature sun et al 2014c ren et al 2019 for the coating the region located on the minor axis was compressed and the region located on the major axis was stretched on the contrary for the liner the region located on the major axis was compressed and the region located on the minor axis was stretched for laminates the hoop stress distributions were affected by the material anisotropy and fiber s orientations the stress continuity conditions should be satisfied at the layer interfaces menshykova and guz 2014 as shown in fig 13 the numerical models in this research couldn t give realistic hoop stress distributions of laminates precise stress distributions of laminates are still in need of further study for all pipes the buckling collapse was a macro mechanical behavior therefore in the present paper it focuses more on the hoop stress distribution on boundaries the internal and external surfaces in this way the effect of the material anisotropy on the hoop stress distributions of laminates is aside from the major issues and not mainly discussed as expressed in eq 4 hoop stresses are linear with the crushing load p to compare hoop stresses predicted by different methods the ratios between hoop stresses and the crushing load were calculated this ratio is only determined by the mean radius and thickness the above ratios along the internal and external circumference of the 8 inch pipe a quarter of a circle predicted by different methods are shown in fig 14 and fig 15 respectively in fig 15 when φ ranging from 0 to 10 the numerical results were not accurate because the contact between rtps and rigid plate caused stress concentration as shown in figs 14 and 15 the results of solid models and continuum shell models were consistent and the results calculated by timoshenko 1922 were much higher the comparison of hoop stress distributions between numerical models and timoshenko 1922 demonstrated the 0 5 lower load factor discussed in section 4 1 was from the hoop stress formulae timoshenko 1922 therefore the formulae of hoop stresses along the hoop direction eq 4 in the new analytical model was modified by the factor of 0 5 and given as 24 σ θ θ r i 3 2 w t 2 p r sin φ 2 π σ θ θ r o 3 2 w t 2 p r sin φ 2 π as shown in figs 14 and 15 when the modified hoop stress formulae were used the hoop stresses were in good agreement with the numerical results it demonstrated the modified hoop stress formulae were more accurate than timoshenko 1922 meanwhile all models can predict the locations of singularity points correctly according to the analysis of section 2 1 the hoop stress formulae play an important role in predicting the buckling loads the error of the initial hoop stress formulae timoshenko 1922 directly lead to the error of critical pressures predicted by the proposed model the hoop stress comparison showed that the modification factor of the proposed model mainly attributes to the difference of hoop stress prediction in timoshenko 1922 4 3 effect of winding angles the winding angles of fibers have a great effect on the critical pressure to investigate the effect of the winding angle on hoop carrying capacity the 8 inch pipes with different winding angles were modeled critical pressures of different models are listed in table 4 the results estimated by solid models and continuum shell models were higher than the analytical results as the winding angle increases the differences between solid models and timoshenko and gere 1961 increase and the error margin reach 15 6 when the winding angle close to 90 from fig 16 the results of the proposed model were more close to the results of solid models with an error margin less than 10 for arbitrary angles it demonstrated the critical pressure predicted by the proposed model was more accurate especially for rtps with relatively large winding angles as a whole in fig 16 the critical pressures increase with the increasing winding angles when the winding angles range from 0 to 30 critical pressures estimated by all methods increase slowly it demonstrates that fibers couldn t enhance the hoop carrying capacity of pipes when winding angles are less than 30 critical pressures rise rapidly as the winding angle increases from 30 to 80 in this range the winding angles have a great effect on the hoop carrying capacity engineers could pick appropriate winding angles in this range to design rtps the critical pressure has minor increment when the winding angles increase from 80 to 90 the change of winding angles in this range has little effect on the hoop carrying capacity meanwhile fibers couldn t enhance the axial carrying capacity when the winding angles are close to 90 therefore it is recommended that the winding angles take a value from 30 to 80 4 4 effect of thickness radius ratios the existing critical pressure formula proposed by timoshenko and gere 1961 was derived by the differential equation for the curved beam under uniform pressures it was assumed that the pipe is thin wall in the derivation therefore the effect of thickness radius ratios was ignored in the analytical model proposed by timoshenko and gere 1961 however the thickness radius ratio has great effects on the critical pressure especially for thick wall pipes to investigate the effect of the thickness radius ratio on the critical pressure numerical and analytical models were developed whose geometric parameters were consistent with the 8 inch pipe except for the internal radius the comparison is shown in table 5 and fig 17 as a whole the critical pressure increases with the increasing thickness radius ratio the reason is that the critical pressure is proportionate to the cube of the thickness radius ratios as shown in eq 18 and eq 19 for the pipes whose thickness radius ratios vary from 0 15 to 0 30 as shown in fig 17 the proposed model and timoshenko and gere 1961 can both predict accurate critical pressures with an error margin less than 10 however for the pipes whose thickness radius ratios are greater than 0 3 the differences between numerical and analytical models increase with the increasing thickness radius ratio on the one hand the effect of thickness radius ratios on the critical pressures was ignored in timoshenko and gere 1961 on the other hand the proposed model was based on the assumption that the singularity points are fixed singularity points move along the circumference within a small area as the thickness radius ratio changes according to the open literature sun et al 2014c singularity points on the internal surface move towards to the point of crushing load along the circumference as shown in fig 18 and fig 19 meanwhile the singularity points on the external surface move in the opposite direction along the circumference as shown in fig 20 and fig 21 it demonstrates additional compressions exist in the deformed rings sun et al 2014c the additional compressions counteract partial positive stresses the higher the thickness radius ratios the stronger the interactions between additional compressions and positive stresses for pipes with high thickness radius ratios the strong interactions make the stresses of points on the minor axis reach critical stress more difficult therefore the interactions between additional compressions and positive stresses play a role in enhancing the hoop carrying capacity this is also the reason that the differences between numerical models and analytical models were large for pipes with high thickness radius ratios in short both analytical models were more applicable to the predictions of critical pressures for pipes with low thickness radius ratios for pipes with high thickness radius ratios both analytical models were too conservative and should consider the effect of thickness radius ratios 5 conclusions this work focuses on the buckling collapse of rtps under external uniform pressure a new analytical model to estimate the critical pressure of rtps by the hoop stress distribution of crushed rings is proposed which assumes that the maximum hoop stress equals the critical stress when pipes collapse the critical stress of cylinders buckling under crushing loads is obtained based on donnell equation the homogenized hoop elastic moduli of rtps is derived based on the equivalent stiffness method eigenvalue analyses on solid models and continuum shell models are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model compared with numerical methods and timoshenko and gere 1961 the proposed model was found to give accurate critical pressures and hoop stress distributions the critical pressure predicted by the proposed model was reliable for rtps with different winding angles and the optimal range for fiber s winding angle was obtained in the present paper according to the present study the winding angle taking a value from 30 to 80 is recommended in pipe design in this range fibers play an important part in enhancing the hoop carrying capacity of rtps the comparison between numerical and analytical models showed that analytical models were more applicable to pipes with low thickness radius ratios for pipes with high thickness radius ratios the results of analytical models were too conservative disproportionate motions of singularity points demonstrated higher additional compressions exist in thicker rings which leads to the error of analytical models for pipes with high thickness radius ratios the interactions between additional compressions and positive stresses enhance the hoop carrying capacity of rtps

22654,the creation of a database of hydrodynamic loads for a generic submarine hull with a casing is proposed due to a lack of data in the open literature on the loading effects of submarine casings this work presents a numerical methodology for the eventual creation of such a database steady state reynolds averaged navier stokes simulations were conducted for the joubert bb2 generic submarine hull in translation with and without a deck casing while deeply submerged and with and without a casing in a wind tunnel simulation results at a reynolds number of re 5 24 106 provide hydrodynamic load increments due to the submarine deck casing and are validated against unique experimental data for a range of angles of attack 15 α 15 and angles of drift 30 β 30 the estimated numerical error of the in plane force and moment were 8 1 and 6 8 respectively and 2 2 and 3 7 for the out of plane force and moment respectively the simulation results were useful in evaluating the interference of the experimental support system and investigating the hydrodynamic loading effects of the casing it was found that the addition of a casing can alter the in plane hydrodynamic loads by at least 30 and can also introduce out of plane loads of comparable magnitude keywords computational fluid dynamics rans hydrodynamics submarine casing hydrodynamic loads wind tunnel 1 introduction the total forces on a fully appended submarine are commonly estimated in manoeuvring simulations by adding the forces due to appendages to the hull force and accounting for the interference effects between them jeans et al 2010 however crossflow separation due to adverse pressure gradients caused by the contour of the submarine hull makes overall force and moment predictions very difficult jeans et al 2005 additional variations in the shape of the hull such as from a casing further complicates load prediction current methods used to estimate hydrodynamic loads on a submarine with hull casing lack accuracy and would benefit from an improved model for such casing effects mackay 2009 many experiments and numerical studies have been performed to determine the forces and moments on various hull shapes appended and not appended jeans et al 2010 2005 mackay 2009 freeman 1932 allen 1950 lawrence 1954 whicker and fehlner 1958 aucher 1981 mackay 1988 roddy 1990 watt et al 1991 ahn 1992 mackay 1993 1995 liu and

al 2013 quick and woodyatt 2014 fureby et al 2016 but the results of interest are for hulls with large asymmetric features which includes axisymmetric hulls with sails and axisymmetric hulls with casings hulls with sails have been studied in detail lawrence 1954 whicker and fehlner 1958 aucher 1981 mackay 1988 1995 but axisymmetric hulls with only a casing have not been extensively studied a force and moment database for axisymmetric hulls with casings is essential for model development but is not available this work presents the verification and validation of a numerical methodology for analysing the hydrodynamic loading effects of a submarine casing future work will utilize the methodology to develop a database of hydrodynamic force and moment data for a generic submarine geometry in steady translation using a commercial computational fluid dynamics cfd solver this database of high fidelity numerical data would then suitable for formulating new semi empirical models or extending existing models for making faster than real time manoeuvring predictions the numerical error of the computational results is estimated with a grid refinement study and the cfd predictions of casing incremental loads are validated by comparison to unique experimental data available gathered by others some results of the flow field effects due to a casing are also presented 1 1 generic submarine geometry and orientation nomenclature the defence science and technology group dstg an agency of the australian department of defence has developed a generic submarine geometry named the joubert 2004 2006 the bb2 variant fig 1 has a length to diameter ratio of 7 30 and consists of an elliptical nose a constant diameter midsection and a tapered tail kumar et al 2012 it can be configured with or without a casing as shown in figs 1a and 1b the orientation of a submarine hull to the oncoming flow can be defined by two parameters using a standard submarine body fixed

the forces along each principal axis are represented by x y and z and the moments about the body fixed axes are represented by k m and n 1 2 experimental studies since the inception of the joubert submarine geometry many experimental and computational studies of the submarine in various configurations have been performed quick et al 2012 anderson et al 2012 kumar et al 2012 jones et al 2013 quick and woodyatt 2014 manovski et al 2014 the studies focused on obtaining force and moment data in sweeps of the angle of attack α and angle of drift β tests were performed with the bb2 variant of the joubert axisymmetric hull axisymmetric hull with casing and sail and fully appended configurations at reynolds numbers of re 2 7 106 and re 5 24 106 of all the open literature experimental studies only the results of quick and woodyatt 2014 present clear force and moment data for both an axisymmetric hull and hull with casing this data acts as a primary validation source for the computational methodology outlined later in this document what follows is an overview of their experimental procedure the testing facility used for the experimental trials was the closed loop low speed wind tunnel lswt of dstg s platform sciences laboratory the test section has a octagonal cross section fig 2 with a length of 6 56m all internal angles are 135 the dimensions of the lswt are also outlined by matheson 1983 and erm 2003 a free stream flow velocity of up to 100m s could be obtained with the u component turbulence intensity being less than 0 4 and less than 0 7 for the v and w component turbulence intensities the total turbulence intensity was therefore 0 4 2 0 7 2 0 7 2 1 1 the wind tunnel features a test section that allows for models to be attached to a turntable at the top or bottom of the tunnel erm 2003 as outlined by quick and woodyatt 2014 the experiments were performed on a 1 35m long joubert submarine hull 1 52 scale mounted to the floor turntable on a support pylon covered by a fairing fig 2 the support pylon attached to the interior of the hull through a cavity on the underside of the hull the tunnel blockage due to the submarine and support geometry was estimated to be 2 1 at zero incidence α 0 β 0 the angle of attack could be varied with a pitch arm to the rear of the support pylon and the angle of drift could be controlled by rotating the turntable the pitch arm moved along with the hull as its pitch and drift angles were changed and the fairing would stay oriented with the oncoming flow as the hull s drift angle was changed surface pressure and skin friction data were recorded for the axisymmetric hull while force and moment data were recorded for both the axisymmetric hull and hull with casing tests were performed at 30m s 40m s and 60m s the results of the 60m s tests are presented herein which corresponds to a reynolds number of re 5 24 106 three different boundary layer transition strips were employed in these experiments a 0 2mm wire a 0 5mm wire and an 80 grit silicon carbide strip with a width of 3mm more details of the tripping devices are described in jones et al 2013 the sizes of the trips were selected based on the empirical method of braslow and knox 1958 the transition strips were placed at 5 of the hull length aft of the nose λ λ l 0 05 where λ is the distance from the nose so that the flow along the rest of the smooth model surface was fully turbulent the turbulence model selected for the numerical simulations in this work approximate this condition by assuming that the flow over the entire hull is fully turbulent the wind tunnel support strut interfered with the flow around the model in this experiment this affected the force and moment measurements a strain gauge balance was mounted internal to the model with its ground side attached to the top of the pylon support and its metric side to the interior of the model therefore the aerodynamic forces acting on the pylon support and pitch arm were not registered by the internal balance however the support structure did modify the flow around the model thereby modifying the forces the balance measures this is support interference support interference can be measured by testing on different minimally interfering support systems such as the procedure used by watt et al 1993 but this requires three times more testing although the experimental data of quick and woodyatt 2014 were not corrected for support interference modern computational capabilities allow this to be done using cfd the experiment was also affected by support tare from the cavity that was cut in the underside of the hull for the insertion of the pylon support this cavity was large enough to accommodate the hull s pitch angle range of α 15 relative to the stationary support pylon table 1 shows the reported error in the measured non dimensional loads as determined using known errors of the measuring equipment used and the standard deviation of 50 data

low and moderate angles of drift the study was validated against experimental data for axisymmetric hulls at moderate angles of drift β 25 but agreement could not be maintained within experimental uncertainty at higher angles of drift zhang 2010 later expanded upon the meshing strategy of baker 2006 and watt et al 2006b for the generation of meshes of hulls in steady turns the mesh topology developed by baker 2006 watt et al 2006b and zhang 2010 has been utilized in this research and is described in a later section watt et al 2006a found that much of the disagreement between rans load predictions and experiments were due to the turbulence model their predictions disagreed with experiment by about 20 using an isotropic two equation turbulence model the shear stress transport model sst menter 1994 but the disagreement was reduced by about half by using an anisotropic turbulence model the baseline reynolds stress model bsl rsm launder et al 1975 rodi 1984 this was attributed to the ability of bsl rsm to predict anisotropy due the fact that it solves seven transport equations compared to other rans turbulence models which solve two transport equations k ε launder and spalding 1974 k ω wilcox 2008 sst toxopeus et al 2012 also found that cfd results obtained using bsl rsm offered better agreement with experimental data than those obtained with sst this is particularly important for the case of a submarine hull in drift which features large regions of separated anisotropic turbulent flow however the added complexity of bsl rsm increases the computational requirements and discretization error of the simulations compared to simpler models the joubert bb2 hull has been simulated in steady and unsteady modelling environments results of experiments and simulations for the axisymmetric hull and fully appended hull at zero incidence were first reported by anderson et al 2012 their cfd simulations were divided into steady state rans simulations using the k ε and sst turbulence models and unsteady les at reynolds numbers of re 5 24 106 the axisymmetric hull simulations used quarter symmetry an assumption that ignored the pylon support used in the wind tunnel nonetheless both the rans and les models were found to offer good predictions of the average wake velocity deficit however the k ε turbulence model did not provide accurate predictions of the turbulent features in a fully appended model configuration simulations using sst provided results that more closely matched the experiments jones et al 2013 also performed cfd simulations of the joubert axisymmetric hull at re 5 24 106 although they did not report whether the simulations were modelled using steady or unsteady flow or the choice of turbulence model they found good agreement with experimental data for the surface pressure on the hull and found that cfd under predicted the skin friction on the hull leong et al 2016 performed steady cfd simulations of the joubert bb2 axisymmetric hull hull with casing and hull with casing and sail in a steady turn at an angle of drift of β 18 using the bsl rsm turbulence model while the study did not consider steady translation the authors found that the casing introduced non zero out of plane forces that is a non zero normal force z and pitching moment m and generated an asymmetric vortical wake these limited data reflect the only results other than that of quick and woodyatt 2014 of the casing effect of a generic submarine hull that are available in the open literature this work attempts to address this knowledge gap with the development of a numerical methodology for the creation of a database of hydrodynamic loading casing effects 2 computational methodology four sets of simulations were performed with the joubert bb2 axisymmetric hull and hull with casing two sets in deep water simulations in unbounded water without a free surface one set each with and without a casing and two sets in a numerical re creation of the wind tunnel experiments outlined by quick and woodyatt 2014 one set each with and without a casing the computational setup and mesh topology were kept as similar as possible in the two sets of simulations the deep water simulation numerical error was estimated using a grid refinement study and provided confidence that the methodology could predict the effects of a casing on an axisymmetric hull the lswt results validated the numerical methodology and comparing with the deep water results show the support interference in the lswt results 2 1 governing equations the steady state physics of an incompressible submarine hydrodynamics fluid flow problem can be described by an equation for the conservation of mass 2 u i x i 0 and an equation describing the conservation of momentum 3 ρ u i u j x j p x i x j μ u i x j ρ u i u j x j where ρ u i u j is the reynolds stress r i j this tensor can be modelled with turbulence models to provide closure to eqs 2 and 3 which are called the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations versteeg and malalasekera 2007 the baseline reynolds stress model bsl rsm launder et al 1975 rodi 1984 describes the conservation of the reynolds stresses r i j as follows versteeg and malalasekera 2007 4 d r i j d t p i j d i j ε i j π i j where p i j is the rate of production of r i j d i j is the transport of r i j by diffusion ε i j is the rate of dissipation of r i j and π i j is the transport of r i j due to turbulent pressure strain interactions this model is based on the ω equation of wilcox 2008 and automatically adjusts between near wall and wall function formulations and features a blend from a k ω formulation near surfaces to a k ε formulation in the free stream ansys inc 2011a menter 1994 bsl rsm was the primary turbulence model used in this study due to its ability to more accurately predict anisotropic reynolds stresses in complex flows and can therefore offer a more accurate prediction of the hydrodynamic loads watt et al 2006a the commercial code that was used to solve the discretized fluid flow equations ansys cfx 14 0 employs an element based finite volume method discretization of the above flow equations with co located pressure velocity coupling and an implicit coupled multigrid solver ansys inc 2011a details of the numerical schemes used are outlined in section 2 3 2 2 mesh generation deep water the meshes for the cfd simulations of the joubert bb2 hull were generated with pointwise using a script based upon the topology design of baker 2006 zhang 2010 watt et al 2006a and maxwell 2010 the script generated structured meshes around the submarine geometry and the wake region which was joined to an outer structured mesh with an unstructured tetrahedron mesh the structured region surrounding the hull allowed for an improved estimation of the locations of crossflow separation and an improved discretization of the wake s flow features watt et al 2006b the structured far field allowed for a reduced cell count in that region using an unstructured transition region prevented the unnecessary propagation of fine inner grid features to the far field the outer bounding box of the mesh had dimensions of δ x δ y δ z 5 2 l 4 4 l 4 2 l and the centre of buoyancy of the submarine geometry s axisymmetric hull was located near the centre of the box many properties of the final mesh could be adjusted using general script parameters in particular the script was designed to generate meshes for various hull and casing geometries at varying angles of attack α and angles of drift β adjustment of the grid density was also a simple task fig 3 shows the hybrid mesh topology for the orientation of α 0 and β 20 the meshes generated for the axisymmetric hull geometry employed a symmetry plane normal to the z axis while the meshes generated for the axisymmetric hull with casing had no symmetry plane for an axisymmetric hull the circumferential node count on one side of the hull was 101 nodes and was therefore the same on the other side by symmetry if a casing was present the node count on the top side was increased to 201 which allowed for greater circumferential resolution at the deck corners the longitudinal node spacing was approximately 0 0037 l the length of the joubert bb2 hull was based on a model length of 1 35m a butterfly topology was used at the nose to reduce cell skewness the geometric growth rate for the node spacing normal to the geometry surface was set to 7 the target y was set to 0 5 to ensure high near wall resolution and accurate boundary layer prediction along the length of the hull the first node height δ y was determined using a flat plate assumption outlined by ansys inc 2011b as follows 5 δ y 74 l y re 13 14 which was formulated with the assumption that the wall shear stress coefficient is as follows white 1991 6 c f τ w q 0 027 re x 1 7 where x is the distance from the leading edge of a flat plate the meshing script generated meshes for angles of attack ranging from 15 α 15 and angles of drift ranging from 0 β 30 at a reynolds number of re 5 24 106 these meshes had cell counts on the order of 14 106 cells 2 3 computational setup deep water the fluid used in the deep water simulations of the joubert bb2 hull was sea water with ρ 1030 kg m3 and μ 1 06 10 3 kg m s the inlet boundary condition was set to have a uniform speed with 1 turbulence intensity the same as in the lswt experiments a reynolds number of 5 24 106 resulted in an inlet flow velocity of u 3 99 m s for a model hull length of 1 35m the outlet boundary condition was set to have an average static pressure of 0pa and was allowed to vary locally by up to 5 the four sided outer boundary was an opening boundary condition with entrainment meaning flow was allowed to exit and enter the domain with a relative pressure of 0pa for entering flow the hull was defined as a smooth no slip wall second order central differencing is not an available advection scheme for rans simulations in cfx v14 0 however second order spatial discretization of the governing discretized equations was used by specifying a blend factor of 1 0 which applies a correction to an upwinding scheme to make it formally second order in space ansys inc 2011a the baseline reynolds stress model bsl rsm was selected as the turbulence model second order discretization of the advection terms for rans turbulence models is not available in cfx 14 0 instead high resolution upwinding was chosen as the advection discretization scheme which adjusts an anti diffusive correction at each node to be applied to an upwinding advection scheme in order to keep the discretization as close as possible to second order without introducing instability ansys inc 2011b the non dimensional time step was set to δ t δ t u l 0 01 which is only useful as a relaxation parameter to aid convergence due to the implicit nature of the cfx solver the simulations were run until the maximum residuals of the momentum and continuity equations were less than 1 10 4 simulations were performed in deep water with and without a casing for angles of attack ranging from 15 α 15 and angles of drift ranging from 0 β 30 four additional simulations were performed for the hull with a casing at an orientation of α 0 β 20 with varying mesh densities for estimating the numerical error one additional simulation was performed for the axisymmetric hull at an orientation of α 0 β 0 with the sst turbulence model to compare the pressure and skin friction distributions with the bsl rsm predictions a total of 60 simulations were performed in deep water the hydrodynamic loads were calculated by integrating the fluid pressure and wall shear stress over the hull surface and then normalized by the upstream dynamic fluid pressure q 1 2 ρ u 2 and hull length l as follows 7 forces x x q l 2 moments k k q l 3 2 4 computational setup lswt as previously mentioned in section 1 3 cfd simulations of the joubert bb2 hull were performed by jones et al 2013 anderson et al 2012 and leong et al 2016 however they did not model the support geometry in their simulations the simulations for this validation study were performed with the complete model support geometry the meshes that were generated for the wind tunnel simulations were modified versions of the deep water meshes the structured region containing the hull and wake in the deep water meshes was placed at the proper position in a recreation of the lswt a portion of the structured mesh region surrounding the underside of the hull was removed to accommodate the presence of the support geometry as shown in fig 4 it was important to mesh the volume region between the hull cavity and support geometry for the simulations preliminary results without the cavity did not agree well with the experiments the overall mesh topology maintained a meshing methodology consistent with the deep water simulations and ensured that the results had a consistent numerical basis using an unstructured mesh around the support structure allowed for easier mesh generation as compared to a structured mesh because the complicated shape and position of the support structure relative to the hull would have made structured meshing a laborious task pointwise s t rex algorithm allowed for high quality unstructured meshes to be created with anisotropic prismatic or hexahedral inflation layers depending on the wall domain topologies and provided careful control of mesh quality the first node height of the pylon support adjustment arm and sting was set to be the same as on the hull which had a specified y of 0 5 to reduce mesh skewness at corners the target y of the tunnel walls was set to 30 therefore wall functions were used the boundary layer generation algorithm was set to stop after 60 layers were generated with a growth rate of 8 fig 4a shows the inflation layers on the tunnel walls and fig 4b shows the hull mesh at the location of the support the automatically generated inflation layer on the support and underside of the hull is much thinner than that of the tunnel walls however it was still thick enough to properly capture the boundary layers it is the dark region of dense mesh elements encasing the support and underside of the hull in fig 4b simulations were performed for a 1 35m joubert bb2 hull in the lswt complete with the model support geometry with and without a casing for angles of attack ranging from 15 α 15 and angles of drift ranging from 0 β 30 a simulation methodology similar to the deep water simulations was used with differences in the computational setup detailed below a total of 27 simulations were performed for the joubert bb2 hull with and without a casing in the lswt the cfd simulations were performed at conditions that closely matched the experimental conditions air at 25 c with a reference pressure of 1atm ρ 1 185 kg m3 μ 1 831 10 5 kg m s the inlet boundary condition was set to have a normal speed with a turbulence intensity matching that of the wind tunnel 0 4 2 0 7 2 0 7 2 1 1 erm 2003 and a velocity magnitude of 60 0m s which corresponded to the desired reynolds number of re 5 24 106 the outlet boundary condition was set to have an average relative static pressure of 0pa and was allowed to vary locally by up to 5 the wind tunnel walls hull and support geometry were defined as a smooth no slip walls the cavity walls were included with the hull surface when calculating the hydrodynamic loads by integrating the fluid pressure and wall shear stresses on these surfaces the forces on the support pylon were not considered the cfd simulations were performed using ansys cfx v14 0 on the hydra high performance multi processor computer at drdc atlantic 3 estimation of discretization error the procedures of eça and hoekstra 2009 2014 were employed to estimate the numerical error of the computational methodology the numerical error u n is defined by eça and hoekstra 2014 as being the arithmetical sum of the round off error u r the iterative error u i and the discretization error u d u n u r u i u d and indicates the interval that contains the exact solution with 95 coverage the round off error is easily estimated based on the precision of the solver in this case for double precision u r ϵ 2 1 11 10 16 higham 2002 the iterative error estimation procedure as outlined by eça and hoekstra 2009 tracks the relative change of a quantity ϕ between successive solver iterations n 1 to n the estimation of the discretization error as outlined by eça and hoekstra 2014 requires that solutions be calculated on at least four grids n g 4 that are systematically refined these meshes were easily created with the mesh generation script the normalized hydrodynamic forces and moments were the flow quantities used to estimate the numerical error ϕ x y z k m n five systematically refined grids were generated for the case of the joubert bb2 hull with casing at zero angle of attack and an angle of drift of β 20 as will be shown later such an orientation produced a complex wake field that resulted in non zero values for the out of plane loads the properties of the grids used for estimating the numerical error are listed in table 2 fig 5 shows a plot of a the maximum residual history and b the relative change of the hydrodynamic loads at the nominal grid density during the course of the solver run at the termination of the solver when the maximum normalized residuals of the momentum and continuity equations were less than 1 10 4 the relative change of the hydrodynamic loads were less than 1 10 9 table 3 shows the calculated estimates of the iterative error using the procedure of eça and hoekstra 2009 for the five grids considered in the total numerical error estimation all the iterative error estimates of the loads for the nominal grid density are less than 1 fig 6 shows the grid density convergence of the hydrodynamic loads as well as their discretization uncertainty bounds as calculated with the procedure of eça and hoekstra 2014 also shown are the least squares fits ϕ f which indicate the approximate convergence order of the hydrodynamic loads all the loads except the longitudinal force x are described by second order fits the convergence order for x was calculated to be 1 20 the coefficients of determination r 2 are acceptable for all the loads except m this is likely due to the least squares fit for m being nearly the same as the mean of all the grid predictions ϕ f m 1 5 table 4 shows the calculated estimates of the discretization error using the procedure of eça and hoekstra 2014 for the five grids considered as well as the percent differences between the load predictions of the nominal density grid ϕ 3 and the extrapolated infinite grid density predictions of the least squares fits ϕ f h 0 all the nominal grid density loads predictions are within 3 of their predicted extrapolated values except k which is nearly 7 greater m is only 0 22 greater than its predicted extrapolated value the total estimated numerical error of the hydrodynamic loads for the nominal grid density are given in table 5 the longitudinal force x and the rolling moment k have the largest estimated discretization errors each being greater than 20 the in plane loads y and n have the second largest estimated discretization errors at 8 1 and 6 8 respectively and the out of plane loads z and m have the smallest estimated discretization errors at 2 2 and 3 7 respectively the large numerical error estimates of x and k demonstrate that much finer grids are required to estimate these quantities with confidence the estimated error of the in plane loads y and n mirrors the findings of watt et al 2006a and reflects the efforts in designing the mesh topology which was specifically created to predict in plane loads on slender axisymmetric bodies in translation the low error estimates of the out of plane loads z and m are encouraging results considering this study is the first use of the previously discussed mesh topology as a tool for predicting the out of plane forces and moments 4 results 4 1 lswt the following sections detail the results that were gathered from the cfd simulations and compares them to the experimental results of jones et al 2013 for the pressure and skin friction results on the axisymmetric hull and quick and woodyatt 2014 for the forces and moments with and without a casing all the data presented was taken at a reynolds number of re 5 24 106 fig 7 shows the pressure coefficient c p p p q along the joubert bb2 hull without a casing at zero incidence α 0 β 0 in the experiments the pressure was measured on the top of the hull not the underside using taps along the hull centre line the pressure coefficient as calculated in the cfd simulations is shown on the top of the hull for the deep water simulations and the top and underside of the hull for the lswt simulations the experimental results for several boundary layer trips are displayed alongside cfd results of the joubert axisymmetric hull in deep water and in the lswt the experimental pressure distributions are shown to be insensitive to the different boundary layer trips that were used the cfd deep water dw results are in better agreement with the experimental data than the cfd lswt top side results along the nose of the hull all the cfd results are slightly different from the experimental data along the midbody and tail the differences in c p between the deep water and lswt top side simulations could be due to flow acceleration reducing the pressure coefficient from increased wind tunnel blockage by the tunnel s boundary layers and the presence of the support fairing additional simulations of the hull in the lswt without the support geometry would be required to resolve this discrepancy the lswt underside results are the same as the top side results for λ 0 03 and λ 0 92 but agree better with the deep water results for 0 03 λ 0 3 this could be due to the fluid moving slower around the underside of the hull up to the support geometry causing its pressure to rise slightly in the range 0 3 λ 0 9 the support geometry clearly has a dominant effect on the fluid pressure on the underside of the hull a separate deep water simulation using the sst turbulence model was also performed to observe the difference with bsl rsm which is observed to be negligible fig 8 shows the skin friction magnitude coefficient c f τ w q on the top of the joubert axisymmetric hull at zero incidence the skin friction was only measured on the top of the hull not the underside the effect of the tripping device on the experimental data is evident in fig 8 especially for the untripped case where the transition from laminar to turbulent flow is visible near λ 0 25 the lswt results over predict the skin friction distribution on the top of the hull surface a result that was also found by jones et al 2013 the sensitivity of the skin friction coefficient to the tripping device was noted by jones et al 2013 and they remarked that the over prediction of the cfd results could be due to the numerical solution accounting for turbulent effects starting from the nose λ 0 instead of at the location of the trip in the experiments λ 0 05 however it is unlikely that an overprediction of c f over the nose would propagate along the entire length of the hull a separate deep water simulation using the sst turbulence model was also performed to observe the difference with bsl rsm sst offers a slightly lower prediction of c f than bsl rsm but it is still greater than the experimental predictions the total hydrodynamic forces and moments on the joubert bb2 in the lswt both with and without a casing are presented next the moment reference point is located at λ 0 5 l 0 635 m from the nose along the axisymmetric hull s centre line the experimental results are from the tests detailed by quick and woodyatt 2014 which had the same experimental setup as the tests performed by jones et al 2013 fig 9 shows the cfd predictions of the hydrodynamic loads on the joubert bb2 hull without a casing in the lswt compared to the experimental results two plots are shown for each load one for an angle of attack α sweep 15 α 15 and one for an angle of drift β sweep 30 β 30 the β sweep cfd results are symmetric about β 0 due to geometric symmetry the experimental results of quick and woodyatt 2014 were not symmetric about β 0 although they should have been because of the symmetry of the experimental setup so the error bounds were widened to encompass the asymmetric data good agreement is observed for α 15 and β 25 except for the pitching moment m which is slightly under predicted at all angles of drift except near β 20 there was difficulty in maintaining agreement with the experimental data at β 30 which is similar to the findings of baker 2006 and watt et al 2006b fig 10 shows the cfd predictions of the hydrodynamic loads on the joubert bb2 hull with a casing compared to the experimental results good agreement is also observed for α 15 and β 25 except again for the slight under prediction of the pitching moment m at most angles of drift β the procedure outlined in the asme v v 20 2009 standard asme 2009 was used to assess the results validation it compares the comparison error e which is the difference between the simulated and measured values to the validation uncertainty u val 8 u val u exp 2 u n 2 u in 2 where u exp is the experimental error u n is the numerical error and u in is the input error in this case the input error was assumed to be negligible in all of the data presented in figs 9 and 10 the comparison error was found to be less than the validation uncertainty meaning the modelling error is within the noise level imposed by the numerical input and experimental uncertainties asme 2009 4 2 deep water figs 11 and 12 show the cfd predictions of the hydrodynamic loads on the joubert bb2 hull with and without a casing in deep water no wind tunnel walls or support geometry fig 11 shows the results for an angle of attack sweep 30 α 30 and fig 12 shows the results for an angle of drift sweep 30 β 30 a larger range of angles of attack was permitted in deep water because there was no support geometry the effect of the casing at positive and negative angles of attack on the hydrodynamic loads is modest it causes a negative bias in the longitudinal force x across all angles of attack more so at positive angles of attack and small reductions of the normal force z and pitching moment m at positive angles of attack the percent change of these loads with the introduction of the casing are given in table 6 anomalous results are observed in fig 11 for y k and n these data are not concerning when it is realized that the magnitudes of these loads are very small when compared to x z and m at the same angles of attack the effect of the casing is more obvious when considering its loading effects at non zero angles of drift the casing introduces a rolling moment k normal force z and pitching moment m which are zero for a hull without a casing in drift due to the hull s symmetry the magnitude of z introduced in drift is nearly half of the magnitude of z at the same angle of attack and the magnitude of m introduced in drift is only a few percent of the magnitude of m at the same angle of attack the casing increases the magnitudes of the side force y and yawing moment n at non zero angles of drift the percent changes of these loads are given in table 6 4 3 casing load increment figs 13 and 14 compare the cfd prediction of the lswt and deep water casing increments to the experimental results these results are calculated by subtracting the axisymmetric hull results from the results of the hull with casing by investigating the casing increment the interference and tare effects of the support geometry are minimal since both the axisymmetric hull and hull with casing results contain roughly the same bias however interference effects will not be completely eliminated since the wake shed from the support fairing interacts with the hull geometry in slightly different ways depending on whether or not a casing is present the results are in excellent agreement up to α 15 and β 20 experimental data is not available for α 15 because the wind tunnel model could not be set to those angles of attack the pitching and yawing moment increments m c and n c are slightly outside the experimental limits for β 25 these results indicate that the numerical methodology can accurately simulate the hydrodynamic loading effects of a casing on a submarine geometry up to angles of attack of α 15 and angles of drift of β 20 the casing effects for the deep water and lswt cfd results track closely with the experimental data which supports the hypothesis that the casing increment data contains little support interference bias 5 discussion 5 1 interference in the lswt to help understand the flow around the submarine model occurring in the lswt figs 15 and 16 illustrate the effect the support fairing has on the wake of the joubert bb2 hull at positive and negative angles of attack and at a positive angle of drift the hull is coloured with the pressure coefficient c p and the magnitude of non dimensional fluid vorticity ω ω i ω i l u as defined using einstein summation notation einstein 1916 is shown in several cross sectional planes from the nose to the tail of the hull the hull wake is affected by the presence of the support geometry with the vortex core region nearest the support geometry being distorted this alteration of the vorticity field changes the circulation around the hull thereby changing the forces it experiences the pressure on the underside of the hull is also reduced near the support geometry it was observed in fig 7 that the presence of the lswt support fairing had an effect on the pressure coefficient on the surface of the axisymmetric joubert hull experimental data was not recorded on the underside of the hull but the cfd results provide an interesting description of the effect of a support fairing in this region the cfd predicted pressure coefficient on the underside of the joubert axisymmetric hull in both deep water and the lswt is shown in fig 17 in order to highlight the local effects of the support structure outlined in black the effects of the support geometry on the fluid pressure on the hull are clearly visible a high pressure region on the hull due to fluid stagnation is shown forward of the support geometry and low pressure regions due to flow acceleration are shown on either side of the pylon and at the rear of the hull cavity 5 2 casing hydrodynamic effects deep water flow field results are presented in this section to provide additional insight on the incremental loading effects of a casing surface streamline and wake topology changes will be discussed fig 18 shows the surface streamlines on the joubert bb2 hull with and without a casing along with the pressure coefficient on the hull the pressure on the hull surface is a maximum at the forward stagnation point and a minimum where fluid is accelerated around the nose a small amount of pressure recovery is visible at the tail local pressure minima extend along the sides of the hull as viewed in the upper views of fig 18 and are bordered by clustered curves of streamlines it has been shown that these curves indicate boundary layer separation allen and perkins 1951 jeans and holloway 2010 and are the primary flow separation lines the flow is attached to the hull over the windward side while primary and secondary separation and reattachment lines are visible on the leeward side the region enclosed by the primary separation lines grows as the flow approaches the tail as will be shown later this is due to the growth of the vortical wake without a casing the surface pressure coefficient and surface streamlines are symmetric fig 18a but the addition of a casing figs 18b 18d alters the surface pressure and streamlines and can produce asymmetric flow around the hull the region of separated flow is not significantly affected by a casing when the angle of attack is negative fig 18b and remains symmetric the normal force increment due to the casing z c at α 15 β 0 was also shown to be minimal asymmetry is observed if the hull is in drift fig 18c lower pressures are observed at the corners of the casing which precedes an adverse pressure gradient thereby promoting flow separation the surface streamlines also show how a primary separation line is tied to the leeward corner of the casing the adverse pressure gradient at the casing corners is stronger than on the curved hull so primary flow separation is observed to originate at that location the flow on the side of the hull opposite the casing remains visually similar to the flow around a hull without a casing the asymmetric flow around the hull causes the normal force z and pitching moment m to both be non zero with the hull at a positive angle of attack fig 18d the casing is observed to delay flow separation the flow remains attached to the hull as it passes over the sides of the casing when compared to the no casing results fig 18a the primary separation lines are shifted leeward to the corners of the casing the wake region is therefore narrower at this orientation this correlates with a decrease in the magnitude of the normal force z at this orientation at the termination of the casing the separation lines return to a position similar to when there is no casing consider further the deep water images of fig 16 which are repeated below in fig 19 the no casing results figs 19a 19c and 19e show a wake composed of two symmetrical vortices that continually grow in size and strength along the hull the vortices have a circular shape in the mid body and start elongating near the same aft position that the hull begins narrowing at a negative angle of attack fig 19b the with casing wake pattern is similar to the no casing results the casing does not seem to affect the wake in this orientation the casing also does not greatly affect the loads in this orientation see fig 11 at a positive angle of attack fig 19d the wake topology is similar but the strengths of the vortices are weaker due to the afterbody effect of the casing this is also reflected in the reduced magnitudes of the longitudinal force x normal force z and pitching moment m the wake pattern is more complex in drift fig 19f particularly along the tail and downstream up to the end of the deck the wake consists of two vortices but unlike the previous two cases they are not symmetric at the end of the deck one of these vortices is shed and a third small vortex is seen growing along the tail the result is a wake pattern consisting of three primary vortices along the tail flow separation is also observed at the leeward corners of the casing the complicated asymmetric wake in drift caused by the presence of the casing also induces a non zero normal force z and pitching moment m 6 conclusions the unique experimental data of quick and woodyatt 2014 for the joubert bb2 generic submarine hull with a casing has been used to validate cfd predictions of the incremental loads due to the casing the lswt support was found to have considerable effects on the hull wake and surface pressure vortices formed by crossflow separation on the underside of the hull interacted with the wake of the support thereby altering the hydrodynamic loading experienced by the hull the support created intense regions of low pressure on the underside of the hull whose effect could be observed on the topside of the hull the skin friction coefficient along the topside of the hull from the nose to the tail was relatively unaffected by the presence of the support good agreement was observed between the cfd predictions and experimental measurements of the hydrodynamic loads experienced by the joubert bb2 in the lswt up to α and β 25 except the out of plane moment which was generally under predicted for β 25 the load interference effects of the lswt support were minimal when the casing load increment was isolated regardless of whether the geometry was in a wind tunnel environment the predictions of the casing load increment also agreed well with experiment the numerical method is adaptable to various hull and casing shapes which permits many simulations of various geometries of interest for developing a comprehensive hydrodynamic load database the estimated numerical error of the in plane loads were 8 1 and 6 8 for the force and moment respectively the estimated numerical error of the out of plane loads were 2 2 and 3 7 for the force and moment respectively the numerical methodology does not offer a precise estimate of the longitudinal force x or the rolling moment k whose numerical errors were estimated to be 24 0 and 21 8 respectively finer grids are required to make confident predictions of these quantities the addition of a casing to the joubert axisymmetric hull was found to have a significant effect on the hydrodynamic loads positive angles of attack showed more casing influence than negative angles of attack in general the casing added a negative bias to the longitudinal force x across all angles of attack at α 10 z was reduced by 8 89 and m was reduced by 3 84 at α 25 z was reduced by 11 8 and m was reduced by 10 6 the casing introduced a rolling moment k normal force z and pitching moment m at non zero angles of drift the magnitudes of the side force y and yawing moment n were also increased at β 10 y was increased by 30 6 and n was increased by 14 5 at β 25 y was increased by 31 4 and n was increased by 11 5 in comparing the viscous flow results of the joubert axisymmetric hull with a casing to the results without a casing it was found that lower surface pressures are present at the corners of the casing which precedes an adverse pressure gradient when a casing corner was located on the leeward side of the hull it tended to promote flow separation and the adverse pressure gradient following the casing corners was stronger than the gradient observed on the curve axisymmetric hull flow separation was delayed by a casing corner if the corner was located on the leeward side altering the flow separation points on the hull caused the vortical wake to form differently than for an axisymmetric hull in a drifting orientation the wake pattern was very complex with multiple vortices present in the asymmetric wake this was consistent with significant out of plane loading on the hull at a positive angle of attack the casing created an after body effect in the wake and reduced the magnitude of the normal force further work detailing the hydrodynamic effects of a submarine casing in other flow orientations will be a useful addition to a results database and future development of load estimation models acknowledgements the authors would like to thank dr dev ranmuthugala

22654,the creation of a database of hydrodynamic loads for a generic submarine hull with a casing is proposed due to a lack of data in the open literature on the loading effects of submarine casings this work presents a numerical methodology for the eventual creation of such a database steady state reynolds averaged navier stokes simulations were conducted for the joubert bb2 generic submarine hull in translation with and without a deck casing while deeply submerged and with and without a casing in a wind tunnel simulation results at a reynolds number of re 5 24 106 provide hydrodynamic load increments due to the submarine deck casing and are validated against unique experimental data for a range of angles of attack 15 α 15 and angles of drift 30 β 30 the estimated numerical error of the in plane force and moment were 8 1 and 6 8 respectively and 2 2 and 3 7 for the out of plane force and moment respectively the simulation results were useful in evaluating the interference of the experimental support system and investigating the hydrodynamic loading effects of the casing it was found that the addition of a casing can alter the in plane hydrodynamic loads by at least 30 and can also introduce out of plane loads of comparable magnitude keywords computational fluid dynamics rans hydrodynamics submarine casing hydrodynamic loads wind tunnel 1 introduction the total forces on a fully appended submarine are commonly estimated in manoeuvring simulations by adding the forces due to appendages to the hull force and accounting for the interference effects between them jeans et al 2010 however crossflow separation due to adverse pressure gradients caused by the contour of the submarine hull makes overall force and moment predictions very difficult jeans et al 2005 additional variations in the shape of the hull such as from a casing further complicates load prediction current methods used to estimate hydrodynamic loads on a submarine with hull casing lack accuracy and would benefit from an improved model for such casing effects mackay 2009 many experiments and numerical studies have been performed to determine the forces and moments on various hull shapes appended and not appended jeans et al 2010 2005 mackay 2009 freeman 1932 allen 1950 lawrence 1954 whicker and fehlner 1958 aucher 1981 mackay 1988 roddy 1990 watt et al 1991 ahn 1992 mackay 1993 1995 liu and huang 1998 mackay 2003 baker et al 2005 mackay 2006 2008 fureby 2008 toxopeus 2008 jeans et al 2009 alin et al 2010 toxopeus et al 2012 quick et al 2012 anderson et al 2012 kumar et al 2012 jones et al 2013 quick and woodyatt 2014 fureby et al 2016 but the results of interest are for hulls with large asymmetric features which includes axisymmetric hulls with sails and axisymmetric hulls with casings hulls with sails have been studied in detail lawrence 1954 whicker and fehlner 1958 aucher 1981 mackay 1988 1995 but axisymmetric hulls with only a casing have not been extensively studied a force and moment database for axisymmetric hulls with casings is essential for model development but is not available this work presents the verification and validation of a numerical methodology for analysing the hydrodynamic loading effects of a submarine casing future work will utilize the methodology to develop a database of hydrodynamic force and moment data for a generic submarine geometry in steady translation using a commercial computational fluid dynamics cfd solver this database of high fidelity numerical data would then suitable for formulating new semi empirical models or extending existing models for making faster than real time manoeuvring predictions the numerical error of the computational results is estimated with a grid refinement study and the cfd predictions of casing incremental loads are validated by comparison to unique experimental data available gathered by others some results of the flow field effects due to a casing are also presented 1 1 generic submarine geometry and orientation nomenclature the defence science and technology group dstg an agency of the australian department of defence has developed a generic submarine geometry named the joubert 2004 2006 the bb2 variant fig 1 has a length to diameter ratio of 7 30 and consists of an elliptical nose a constant diameter midsection and a tapered tail kumar et al 2012 it can be configured with or without a casing as shown in figs 1a and 1b the orientation of a submarine hull to the oncoming flow can be defined by two parameters using a standard submarine body fixed coordinate frame the angle of attack α and angle of drift β 1 α arctan w u β arctan v u while the hydrodynamic forces and moments are described along the body fixed axes of the coordinate frame fig 1c the forces along each principal axis are represented by x y and z and the moments about the body fixed axes are represented by k m and n 1 2 experimental studies since the inception of the joubert submarine geometry many experimental and computational studies of the submarine in various configurations have been performed quick et al 2012 anderson et al 2012 kumar et al 2012 jones et al 2013 quick and woodyatt 2014 manovski et al 2014 the studies focused on obtaining force and moment data in sweeps of the angle of attack α and angle of drift β tests were performed with the bb2 variant of the joubert axisymmetric hull axisymmetric hull with casing and sail and fully appended configurations at reynolds numbers of re 2 7 106 and re 5 24 106 of all the open literature experimental studies only the results of quick and woodyatt 2014 present clear force and moment data for both an axisymmetric hull and hull with casing this data acts as a primary validation source for the computational methodology outlined later in this document what follows is an overview of their experimental procedure the testing facility used for the experimental trials was the closed loop low speed wind tunnel lswt of dstg s platform sciences laboratory the test section has a octagonal cross section fig 2 with a length of 6 56m all internal angles are 135 the dimensions of the lswt are also outlined by matheson 1983 and erm 2003 a free stream flow velocity of up to 100m s could be obtained with the u component turbulence intensity being less than 0 4 and less than 0 7 for the v and w component turbulence intensities the total turbulence intensity was therefore 0 4 2 0 7 2 0 7 2 1 1 the wind tunnel features a test section that allows for models to be attached to a turntable at the top or bottom of the tunnel erm 2003 as outlined by quick and woodyatt 2014 the experiments were performed on a 1 35m long joubert submarine hull 1 52 scale mounted to the floor turntable on a support pylon covered by a fairing fig 2 the support pylon attached to the interior of the hull through a cavity on the underside of the hull the tunnel blockage due to the submarine and support geometry was estimated to be 2 1 at zero incidence α 0 β 0 the angle of attack could be varied with a pitch arm to the rear of the support pylon and the angle of drift could be controlled by rotating the turntable the pitch arm moved along with the hull as its pitch and drift angles were changed and the fairing would stay oriented with the oncoming flow as the hull s drift angle was changed surface pressure and skin friction data were recorded for the axisymmetric hull while force and moment data were recorded for both the axisymmetric hull and hull with casing tests were performed at 30m s 40m s and 60m s the results of the 60m s tests are presented herein which corresponds to a reynolds number of re 5 24 106 three different boundary layer transition strips were employed in these experiments a 0 2mm wire a 0 5mm wire and an 80 grit silicon carbide strip with a width of 3mm more details of the tripping devices are described in jones et al 2013 the sizes of the trips were selected based on the empirical method of braslow and knox 1958 the transition strips were placed at 5 of the hull length aft of the nose λ λ l 0 05 where λ is the distance from the nose so that the flow along the rest of the smooth model surface was fully turbulent the turbulence model selected for the numerical simulations in this work approximate this condition by assuming that the flow over the entire hull is fully turbulent the wind tunnel support strut interfered with the flow around the model in this experiment this affected the force and moment measurements a strain gauge balance was mounted internal to the model with its ground side attached to the top of the pylon support and its metric side to the interior of the model therefore the aerodynamic forces acting on the pylon support and pitch arm were not registered by the internal balance however the support structure did modify the flow around the model thereby modifying the forces the balance measures this is support interference support interference can be measured by testing on different minimally interfering support systems such as the procedure used by watt et al 1993 but this requires three times more testing although the experimental data of quick and woodyatt 2014 were not corrected for support interference modern computational capabilities allow this to be done using cfd the experiment was also affected by support tare from the cavity that was cut in the underside of the hull for the insertion of the pylon support this cavity was large enough to accommodate the hull s pitch angle range of α 15 relative to the stationary support pylon table 1 shows the reported error in the measured non dimensional loads as determined using known errors of the measuring equipment used and the standard deviation of 50 data samples of each load measurement 1 3 computational studies previous cfd studies of submarine hull shapes have modelled the flow with the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations large eddy simulations les smagorinsky 1963 deardorff 1970 and detached eddy simulations des menter and kuntz 2004 spalart 2009 rans models steady state effects while unsteady rans urans les and des model unsteady effects urans les and des are more computationally intensive than rans simulations since transient flow is resolved in the cases of les and des a higher mesh node count is required than u rans since isotropic grids are preferred in general it has been found that rans offers adequate prediction of average and integral quantities in simulations of axisymmetric hulls in translation jeans et al 2009 toxopeus 2008 fureby 2008 alin et al 2010 toxopeus et al 2012 nevertheless fureby et al 2016 found that les and des are more appropriate modelling approaches for estimating flow noise flows around fully appended hulls and cases of high incidence angles high being between 18 vaz et al 2010 and 25 watt et al 2006b cfd simulations performed by baker et al 2005 baker 2006 and watt et al 2006b focused on developing a cfd meshing strategy for improving the predictions of the in plane force and wake vorticity for axisymmetric hulls in translation and decreasing discretization error at low and moderate angles of drift the study was validated against experimental data for axisymmetric hulls at moderate angles of drift β 25 but agreement could not be maintained within experimental uncertainty at higher angles of drift zhang 2010 later expanded upon the meshing strategy of baker 2006 and watt et al 2006b for the generation of meshes of hulls in steady turns the mesh topology developed by baker 2006 watt et al 2006b and zhang 2010 has been utilized in this research and is described in a later section watt et al 2006a found that much of the disagreement between rans load predictions and experiments were due to the turbulence model their predictions disagreed with experiment by about 20 using an isotropic two equation turbulence model the shear stress transport model sst menter 1994 but the disagreement was reduced by about half by using an anisotropic turbulence model the baseline reynolds stress model bsl rsm launder et al 1975 rodi 1984 this was attributed to the ability of bsl rsm to predict anisotropy due the fact that it solves seven transport equations compared to other rans turbulence models which solve two transport equations k ε launder and spalding 1974 k ω wilcox 2008 sst toxopeus et al 2012 also found that cfd results obtained using bsl rsm offered better agreement with experimental data than those obtained with sst this is particularly important for the case of a submarine hull in drift which features large regions of separated anisotropic turbulent flow however the added complexity of bsl rsm increases the computational requirements and discretization error of the simulations compared to simpler models the joubert bb2 hull has been simulated in steady and unsteady modelling environments results of experiments and simulations for the axisymmetric hull and fully appended hull at zero incidence were first reported by anderson et al 2012 their cfd simulations were divided into steady state rans simulations using the k ε and sst turbulence models and unsteady les at reynolds numbers of re 5 24 106 the axisymmetric hull simulations used quarter symmetry an assumption that ignored the pylon support used in the wind tunnel nonetheless both the rans and les models were found to offer good predictions of the average wake velocity deficit however the k ε turbulence model did not provide accurate predictions of the turbulent features in a fully appended model configuration simulations using sst provided results that more closely matched the experiments jones et al 2013 also performed cfd simulations of the joubert axisymmetric hull at re 5 24 106 although they did not report whether the simulations were modelled using steady or unsteady flow or the choice of turbulence model they found good agreement with experimental data for the surface pressure on the hull and found that cfd under predicted the skin friction on the hull leong et al 2016 performed steady cfd simulations of the joubert bb2 axisymmetric hull hull with casing and hull with casing and sail in a steady turn at an angle of drift of β 18 using the bsl rsm turbulence model while the study did not consider steady translation the authors found that the casing introduced non zero out of plane forces that is a non zero normal force z and pitching moment m and generated an asymmetric vortical wake these limited data reflect the only results other than that of quick and woodyatt 2014 of the casing effect of a generic submarine hull that are available in the open literature this work attempts to address this knowledge gap with the development of a numerical methodology for the creation of a database of hydrodynamic loading casing effects 2 computational methodology four sets of simulations were performed with the joubert bb2 axisymmetric hull and hull with casing two sets in deep water simulations in unbounded water without a free surface one set each with and without a casing and two sets in a numerical re creation of the wind tunnel experiments outlined by quick and woodyatt 2014 one set each with and without a casing the computational setup and mesh topology were kept as similar as possible in the two sets of simulations the deep water simulation numerical error was estimated using a grid refinement study and provided confidence that the methodology could predict the effects of a casing on an axisymmetric hull the lswt results validated the numerical methodology and comparing with the deep water results show the support interference in the lswt results 2 1 governing equations the steady state physics of an incompressible submarine hydrodynamics fluid flow problem can be described by an equation for the conservation of mass 2 u i x i 0 and an equation describing the conservation of momentum 3 ρ u i u j x j p x i x j μ u i x j ρ u i u j x j where ρ u i u j is the reynolds stress r i j this tensor can be modelled with turbulence models to provide closure to eqs 2 and 3 which are called the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations versteeg and malalasekera 2007 the baseline reynolds stress model bsl rsm launder et al 1975 rodi 1984 describes the conservation of the reynolds stresses r i j as follows versteeg and malalasekera 2007 4 d r i j d t p i j d i j ε i j π i j where p i j is the rate of production of r i j d i j is the transport of r i j by diffusion ε i j is the rate of dissipation of r i j and π i j is the transport of r i j due to turbulent pressure strain interactions this model is based on the ω equation of wilcox 2008 and automatically adjusts between near wall and wall function formulations and features a blend from a k ω formulation near surfaces to a k ε formulation in the free stream ansys inc 2011a menter 1994 bsl rsm was the primary turbulence model used in this study due to its ability to more accurately predict anisotropic reynolds stresses in complex flows and can therefore offer a more accurate prediction of the hydrodynamic loads watt et al 2006a the commercial code that was used to solve the discretized fluid flow equations ansys cfx 14 0 employs an element based finite volume method discretization of the above flow equations with co located pressure velocity coupling and an implicit coupled multigrid solver ansys inc 2011a details of the numerical schemes used are outlined in section 2 3 2 2 mesh generation deep water the meshes for the cfd simulations of the joubert bb2 hull were generated with pointwise using a script based upon the topology design of baker 2006 zhang 2010 watt et al 2006a and maxwell 2010 the script generated structured meshes around the submarine geometry and the wake region which was joined to an outer structured mesh with an unstructured tetrahedron mesh the structured region surrounding the hull allowed for an improved estimation of the locations of crossflow separation and an improved discretization of the wake s flow features watt et al 2006b the structured far field allowed for a reduced cell count in that region using an unstructured transition region prevented the unnecessary propagation of fine inner grid features to the far field the outer bounding box of the mesh had dimensions of δ x δ y δ z 5 2 l 4 4 l 4 2 l and the centre of buoyancy of the submarine geometry s axisymmetric hull was located near the centre of the box many properties of the final mesh could be adjusted using general script parameters in particular the script was designed to generate meshes for various hull and casing geometries at varying angles of attack α and angles of drift β adjustment of the grid density was also a simple task fig 3 shows the hybrid mesh topology for the orientation of α 0 and β 20 the meshes generated for the axisymmetric hull geometry employed a symmetry plane normal to the z axis while the meshes generated for the axisymmetric hull with casing had no symmetry plane for an axisymmetric hull the circumferential node count on one side of the hull was 101 nodes and was therefore the same on the other side by symmetry if a casing was present the node count on the top side was increased to 201 which allowed for greater circumferential resolution at the deck corners the longitudinal node spacing was approximately 0 0037 l the length of the joubert bb2 hull was based on a model length of 1 35m a butterfly topology was used at the nose to reduce cell skewness the geometric growth rate for the node spacing normal to the geometry surface was set to 7 the target y was set to 0 5 to ensure high near wall resolution and accurate boundary layer prediction along the length of the hull the first node height δ y was determined using a flat plate assumption outlined by ansys inc 2011b as follows 5 δ y 74 l y re 13 14 which was formulated with the assumption that the wall shear stress coefficient is as follows white 1991 6 c f τ w q 0 027 re x 1 7 where x is the distance from the leading edge of a flat plate the meshing script generated meshes for angles of attack ranging from 15 α 15 and angles of drift ranging from 0 β 30 at a reynolds number of re 5 24 106 these meshes had cell counts on the order of 14 106 cells 2 3 computational setup deep water the fluid used in the deep water simulations of the joubert bb2 hull was sea water with ρ 1030 kg m3 and μ 1 06 10 3 kg m s the inlet boundary condition was set to have a uniform speed with 1 turbulence intensity the same as in the lswt experiments a reynolds number of 5 24 106 resulted in an inlet flow velocity of u 3 99 m s for a model hull length of 1 35m the outlet boundary condition was set to have an average static pressure of 0pa and was allowed to vary locally by up to 5 the four sided outer boundary was an opening boundary condition with entrainment meaning flow was allowed to exit and enter the domain with a relative pressure of 0pa for entering flow the hull was defined as a smooth no slip wall second order central differencing is not an available advection scheme for rans simulations in cfx v14 0 however second order spatial discretization of the governing discretized equations was used by specifying a blend factor of 1 0 which applies a correction to an upwinding scheme to make it formally second order in space ansys inc 2011a the baseline reynolds stress model bsl rsm was selected as the turbulence model second order discretization of the advection terms for rans turbulence models is not available in cfx 14 0 instead high resolution upwinding was chosen as the advection discretization scheme which adjusts an anti diffusive correction at each node to be applied to an upwinding advection scheme in order to keep the discretization as close as possible to second order without introducing instability ansys inc 2011b the non dimensional time step was set to δ t δ t u l 0 01 which is only useful as a relaxation parameter to aid convergence due to the implicit nature of the cfx solver the simulations were run until the maximum residuals of the momentum and continuity equations were less than 1 10 4 simulations were performed in deep water with and without a casing for angles of attack ranging from 15 α 15 and angles of drift ranging from 0 β 30 four additional simulations were performed for the hull with a casing at an orientation of α 0 β 20 with varying mesh densities for estimating the numerical error one additional simulation was performed for the axisymmetric hull at an orientation of α 0 β 0 with the sst turbulence model to compare the pressure and skin friction distributions with the bsl rsm predictions a total of 60 simulations were performed in deep water the hydrodynamic loads were calculated by integrating the fluid pressure and wall shear stress over the hull surface and then normalized by the upstream dynamic fluid pressure q 1 2 ρ u 2 and hull length l as follows 7 forces x x q l 2 moments k k q l 3 2 4 computational setup lswt as previously mentioned in section 1 3 cfd simulations of the joubert bb2 hull were performed by jones et al 2013 anderson et al 2012 and leong et al 2016 however they did not model the support geometry in their simulations the simulations for this validation study were performed with the complete model support geometry the meshes that were generated for the wind tunnel simulations were modified versions of the deep water meshes the structured region containing the hull and wake in the deep water meshes was placed at the proper position in a recreation of the lswt a portion of the structured mesh region surrounding the underside of the hull was removed to accommodate the presence of the support geometry as shown in fig 4 it was important to mesh the volume region between the hull cavity and support geometry for the simulations preliminary results without the cavity did not agree well with the experiments the overall mesh topology maintained a meshing methodology consistent with the deep water simulations and ensured that the results had a consistent numerical basis using an unstructured mesh around the support structure allowed for easier mesh generation as compared to a structured mesh because the complicated shape and position of the support structure relative to the hull would have made structured meshing a laborious task pointwise s t rex algorithm allowed for high quality unstructured meshes to be created with anisotropic prismatic or hexahedral inflation layers depending on the wall domain topologies and provided careful control of mesh quality the first node height of the pylon support adjustment arm and sting was set to be the same as on the hull which had a specified y of 0 5 to reduce mesh skewness at corners the target y of the tunnel walls was set to 30 therefore wall functions were used the boundary layer generation algorithm was set to stop after 60 layers were generated with a growth rate of 8 fig 4a shows the inflation layers on the tunnel walls and fig 4b shows the hull mesh at the location of the support the automatically generated inflation layer on the support and underside of the hull is much thinner than that of the tunnel walls however it was still thick enough to properly capture the boundary layers it is the dark region of dense mesh elements encasing the support and underside of the hull in fig 4b simulations were performed for a 1 35m joubert bb2 hull in the lswt complete with the model support geometry with and without a casing for angles of attack ranging from 15 α 15 and angles of drift ranging from 0 β 30 a simulation methodology similar to the deep water simulations was used with differences in the computational setup detailed below a total of 27 simulations were performed for the joubert bb2 hull with and without a casing in the lswt the cfd simulations were performed at conditions that closely matched the experimental conditions air at 25 c with a reference pressure of 1atm ρ 1 185 kg m3 μ 1 831 10 5 kg m s the inlet boundary condition was set to have a normal speed with a turbulence intensity matching that of the wind tunnel 0 4 2 0 7 2 0 7 2 1 1 erm 2003 and a velocity magnitude of 60 0m s which corresponded to the desired reynolds number of re 5 24 106 the outlet boundary condition was set to have an average relative static pressure of 0pa and was allowed to vary locally by up to 5 the wind tunnel walls hull and support geometry were defined as a smooth no slip walls the cavity walls were included with the hull surface when calculating the hydrodynamic loads by integrating the fluid pressure and wall shear stresses on these surfaces the forces on the support pylon were not considered the cfd simulations were performed using ansys cfx v14 0 on the hydra high performance multi processor computer at drdc atlantic 3 estimation of discretization error the procedures of eça and hoekstra 2009 2014 were employed to estimate the numerical error of the computational methodology the numerical error u n is defined by eça and hoekstra 2014 as being the arithmetical sum of the round off error u r the iterative error u i and the discretization error u d u n u r u i u d and indicates the interval that contains the exact solution with 95 coverage the round off error is easily estimated based on the precision of the solver in this case for double precision u r ϵ 2 1 11 10 16 higham 2002 the iterative error estimation procedure as outlined by eça and hoekstra 2009 tracks the relative change of a quantity ϕ between successive solver iterations n 1 to n the estimation of the discretization error as outlined by eça and hoekstra 2014 requires that solutions be calculated on at least four grids n g 4 that are systematically refined these meshes were easily created with the mesh generation script the normalized hydrodynamic forces and moments were the flow quantities used to estimate the numerical error ϕ x y z k m n five systematically refined grids were generated for the case of the joubert bb2 hull with casing at zero angle of attack and an angle of drift of β 20 as will be shown later such an orientation produced a complex wake field that resulted in non zero values for the out of plane loads the properties of the grids used for estimating the numerical error are listed in table 2 fig 5 shows a plot of a the maximum residual history and b the relative change of the hydrodynamic loads at the nominal grid density during the course of the solver run at the termination of the solver when the maximum normalized residuals of the momentum and continuity equations were less than 1 10 4 the relative change of the hydrodynamic loads were less than 1 10 9 table 3 shows the calculated estimates of the iterative error using the procedure of eça and hoekstra 2009 for the five grids considered in the total numerical error estimation all the iterative error estimates of the loads for the nominal grid density are less than 1 fig 6 shows the grid density convergence of the hydrodynamic loads as well as their discretization uncertainty bounds as calculated with the procedure of eça and hoekstra 2014 also shown are the least squares fits ϕ f which indicate the approximate convergence order of the hydrodynamic loads all the loads except the longitudinal force x are described by second order fits the convergence order for x was calculated to be 1 20 the coefficients of determination r 2 are acceptable for all the loads except m this is likely due to the least squares fit for m being nearly the same as the mean of all the grid predictions ϕ f m 1 5 table 4 shows the calculated estimates of the discretization error using the procedure of eça and hoekstra 2014 for the five grids considered as well as the percent differences between the load predictions of the nominal density grid ϕ 3 and the extrapolated infinite grid density predictions of the least squares fits ϕ f h 0 all the nominal grid density loads predictions are within 3 of their predicted extrapolated values except k which is nearly 7 greater m is only 0 22 greater than its predicted extrapolated value the total estimated numerical error of the hydrodynamic loads for the nominal grid density are given in table 5 the longitudinal force x and the rolling moment k have the largest estimated discretization errors each being greater than 20 the in plane loads y and n have the second largest estimated discretization errors at 8 1 and 6 8 respectively and the out of plane loads z and m have the smallest estimated discretization errors at 2 2 and 3 7 respectively the large numerical error estimates of x and k demonstrate that much finer grids are required to estimate these quantities with confidence the estimated error of the in plane loads y and n mirrors the findings of watt et al 2006a and reflects the efforts in designing the mesh topology which was specifically created to predict in plane loads on slender axisymmetric bodies in translation the low error estimates of the out of plane loads z and m are encouraging results considering this study is the first use of the previously discussed mesh topology as a tool for predicting the out of plane forces and moments 4 results 4 1 lswt the following sections detail the results that were gathered from the cfd simulations and compares them to the experimental results of jones et al 2013 for the pressure and skin friction results on the axisymmetric hull and quick and woodyatt 2014 for the forces and moments with and without a casing all the data presented was taken at a reynolds number of re 5 24 106 fig 7 shows the pressure coefficient c p p p q along the joubert bb2 hull without a casing at zero incidence α 0 β 0 in the experiments the pressure was measured on the top of the hull not the underside using taps along the hull centre line the pressure coefficient as calculated in the cfd simulations is shown on the top of the hull for the deep water simulations and the top and underside of the hull for the lswt simulations the experimental results for several boundary layer trips are displayed alongside cfd results of the joubert axisymmetric hull in deep water and in the lswt the experimental pressure distributions are shown to be insensitive to the different boundary layer trips that were used the cfd deep water dw results are in better agreement with the experimental data than the cfd lswt top side results along the nose of the hull all the cfd results are slightly different from the experimental data along the midbody and tail the differences in c p between the deep water and lswt top side simulations could be due to flow acceleration reducing the pressure coefficient from increased wind tunnel blockage by the tunnel s boundary layers and the presence of the support fairing additional simulations of the hull in the lswt without the support geometry would be required to resolve this discrepancy the lswt underside results are the same as the top side results for λ 0 03 and λ 0 92 but agree better with the deep water results for 0 03 λ 0 3 this could be due to the fluid moving slower around the underside of the hull up to the support geometry causing its pressure to rise slightly in the range 0 3 λ 0 9 the support geometry clearly has a dominant effect on the fluid pressure on the underside of the hull a separate deep water simulation using the sst turbulence model was also performed to observe the difference with bsl rsm which is observed to be negligible fig 8 shows the skin friction magnitude coefficient c f τ w q on the top of the joubert axisymmetric hull at zero incidence the skin friction was only measured on the top of the hull not the underside the effect of the tripping device on the experimental data is evident in fig 8 especially for the untripped case where the transition from laminar to turbulent flow is visible near λ 0 25 the lswt results over predict the skin friction distribution on the top of the hull surface a result that was also found by jones et al 2013 the sensitivity of the skin friction coefficient to the tripping device was noted by jones et al 2013 and they remarked that the over prediction of the cfd results could be due to the numerical solution accounting for turbulent effects starting from the nose λ 0 instead of at the location of the trip in the experiments λ 0 05 however it is unlikely that an overprediction of c f over the nose would propagate along the entire length of the hull a separate deep water simulation using the sst turbulence model was also performed to observe the difference with bsl rsm sst offers a slightly lower prediction of c f than bsl rsm but it is still greater than the experimental predictions the total hydrodynamic forces and moments on the joubert bb2 in the lswt both with and without a casing are presented next the moment reference point is located at λ 0 5 l 0 635 m from the nose along the axisymmetric hull s centre line the experimental results are from the tests detailed by quick and woodyatt 2014 which had the same experimental setup as the tests performed by jones et al 2013 fig 9 shows the cfd predictions of the hydrodynamic loads on the joubert bb2 hull without a casing in the lswt compared to the experimental results two plots are shown for each load one for an angle of attack α sweep 15 α 15 and one for an angle of drift β sweep 30 β 30 the β sweep cfd results are symmetric about β 0 due to geometric symmetry the experimental results of quick and woodyatt 2014 were not symmetric about β 0 although they should have been because of the symmetry of the experimental setup so the error bounds were widened to encompass the asymmetric data good agreement is observed for α 15 and β 25 except for the pitching moment m which is slightly under predicted at all angles of drift except near β 20 there was difficulty in maintaining agreement with the experimental data at β 30 which is similar to the findings of baker 2006 and watt et al 2006b fig 10 shows the cfd predictions of the hydrodynamic loads on the joubert bb2 hull with a casing compared to the experimental results good agreement is also observed for α 15 and β 25 except again for the slight under prediction of the pitching moment m at most angles of drift β the procedure outlined in the asme v v 20 2009 standard asme 2009 was used to assess the results validation it compares the comparison error e which is the difference between the simulated and measured values to the validation uncertainty u val 8 u val u exp 2 u n 2 u in 2 where u exp is the experimental error u n is the numerical error and u in is the input error in this case the input error was assumed to be negligible in all of the data presented in figs 9 and 10 the comparison error was found to be less than the validation uncertainty meaning the modelling error is within the noise level imposed by the numerical input and experimental uncertainties asme 2009 4 2 deep water figs 11 and 12 show the cfd predictions of the hydrodynamic loads on the joubert bb2 hull with and without a casing in deep water no wind tunnel walls or support geometry fig 11 shows the results for an angle of attack sweep 30 α 30 and fig 12 shows the results for an angle of drift sweep 30 β 30 a larger range of angles of attack was permitted in deep water because there was no support geometry the effect of the casing at positive and negative angles of attack on the hydrodynamic loads is modest it causes a negative bias in the longitudinal force x across all angles of attack more so at positive angles of attack and small reductions of the normal force z and pitching moment m at positive angles of attack the percent change of these loads with the introduction of the casing are given in table 6 anomalous results are observed in fig 11 for y k and n these data are not concerning when it is realized that the magnitudes of these loads are very small when compared to x z and m at the same angles of attack the effect of the casing is more obvious when considering its loading effects at non zero angles of drift the casing introduces a rolling moment k normal force z and pitching moment m which are zero for a hull without a casing in drift due to the hull s symmetry the magnitude of z introduced in drift is nearly half of the magnitude of z at the same angle of attack and the magnitude of m introduced in drift is only a few percent of the magnitude of m at the same angle of attack the casing increases the magnitudes of the side force y and yawing moment n at non zero angles of drift the percent changes of these loads are given in table 6 4 3 casing load increment figs 13 and 14 compare the cfd prediction of the lswt and deep water casing increments to the experimental results these results are calculated by subtracting the axisymmetric hull results from the results of the hull with casing by investigating the casing increment the interference and tare effects of the support geometry are minimal since both the axisymmetric hull and hull with casing results contain roughly the same bias however interference effects will not be completely eliminated since the wake shed from the support fairing interacts with the hull geometry in slightly different ways depending on whether or not a casing is present the results are in excellent agreement up to α 15 and β 20 experimental data is not available for α 15 because the wind tunnel model could not be set to those angles of attack the pitching and yawing moment increments m c and n c are slightly outside the experimental limits for β 25 these results indicate that the numerical methodology can accurately simulate the hydrodynamic loading effects of a casing on a submarine geometry up to angles of attack of α 15 and angles of drift of β 20 the casing effects for the deep water and lswt cfd results track closely with the experimental data which supports the hypothesis that the casing increment data contains little support interference bias 5 discussion 5 1 interference in the lswt to help understand the flow around the submarine model occurring in the lswt figs 15 and 16 illustrate the effect the support fairing has on the wake of the joubert bb2 hull at positive and negative angles of attack and at a positive angle of drift the hull is coloured with the pressure coefficient c p and the magnitude of non dimensional fluid vorticity ω ω i ω i l u as defined using einstein summation notation einstein 1916 is shown in several cross sectional planes from the nose to the tail of the hull the hull wake is affected by the presence of the support geometry with the vortex core region nearest the support geometry being distorted this alteration of the vorticity field changes the circulation around the hull thereby changing the forces it experiences the pressure on the underside of the hull is also reduced near the support geometry it was observed in fig 7 that the presence of the lswt support fairing had an effect on the pressure coefficient on the surface of the axisymmetric joubert hull experimental data was not recorded on the underside of the hull but the cfd results provide an interesting description of the effect of a support fairing in this region the cfd predicted pressure coefficient on the underside of the joubert axisymmetric hull in both deep water and the lswt is shown in fig 17 in order to highlight the local effects of the support structure outlined in black the effects of the support geometry on the fluid pressure on the hull are clearly visible a high pressure region on the hull due to fluid stagnation is shown forward of the support geometry and low pressure regions due to flow acceleration are shown on either side of the pylon and at the rear of the hull cavity 5 2 casing hydrodynamic effects deep water flow field results are presented in this section to provide additional insight on the incremental loading effects of a casing surface streamline and wake topology changes will be discussed fig 18 shows the surface streamlines on the joubert bb2 hull with and without a casing along with the pressure coefficient on the hull the pressure on the hull surface is a maximum at the forward stagnation point and a minimum where fluid is accelerated around the nose a small amount of pressure recovery is visible at the tail local pressure minima extend along the sides of the hull as viewed in the upper views of fig 18 and are bordered by clustered curves of streamlines it has been shown that these curves indicate boundary layer separation allen and perkins 1951 jeans and holloway 2010 and are the primary flow separation lines the flow is attached to the hull over the windward side while primary and secondary separation and reattachment lines are visible on the leeward side the region enclosed by the primary separation lines grows as the flow approaches the tail as will be shown later this is due to the growth of the vortical wake without a casing the surface pressure coefficient and surface streamlines are symmetric fig 18a but the addition of a casing figs 18b 18d alters the surface pressure and streamlines and can produce asymmetric flow around the hull the region of separated flow is not significantly affected by a casing when the angle of attack is negative fig 18b and remains symmetric the normal force increment due to the casing z c at α 15 β 0 was also shown to be minimal asymmetry is observed if the hull is in drift fig 18c lower pressures are observed at the corners of the casing which precedes an adverse pressure gradient thereby promoting flow separation the surface streamlines also show how a primary separation line is tied to the leeward corner of the casing the adverse pressure gradient at the casing corners is stronger than on the curved hull so primary flow separation is observed to originate at that location the flow on the side of the hull opposite the casing remains visually similar to the flow around a hull without a casing the asymmetric flow around the hull causes the normal force z and pitching moment m to both be non zero with the hull at a positive angle of attack fig 18d the casing is observed to delay flow separation the flow remains attached to the hull as it passes over the sides of the casing when compared to the no casing results fig 18a the primary separation lines are shifted leeward to the corners of the casing the wake region is therefore narrower at this orientation this correlates with a decrease in the magnitude of the normal force z at this orientation at the termination of the casing the separation lines return to a position similar to when there is no casing consider further the deep water images of fig 16 which are repeated below in fig 19 the no casing results figs 19a 19c and 19e show a wake composed of two symmetrical vortices that continually grow in size and strength along the hull the vortices have a circular shape in the mid body and start elongating near the same aft position that the hull begins narrowing at a negative angle of attack fig 19b the with casing wake pattern is similar to the no casing results the casing does not seem to affect the wake in this orientation the casing also does not greatly affect the loads in this orientation see fig 11 at a positive angle of attack fig 19d the wake topology is similar but the strengths of the vortices are weaker due to the afterbody effect of the casing this is also reflected in the reduced magnitudes of the longitudinal force x normal force z and pitching moment m the wake pattern is more complex in drift fig 19f particularly along the tail and downstream up to the end of the deck the wake consists of two vortices but unlike the previous two cases they are not symmetric at the end of the deck one of these vortices is shed and a third small vortex is seen growing along the tail the result is a wake pattern consisting of three primary vortices along the tail flow separation is also observed at the leeward corners of the casing the complicated asymmetric wake in drift caused by the presence of the casing also induces a non zero normal force z and pitching moment m 6 conclusions the unique experimental data of quick and woodyatt 2014 for the joubert bb2 generic submarine hull with a casing has been used to validate cfd predictions of the incremental loads due to the casing the lswt support was found to have considerable effects on the hull wake and surface pressure vortices formed by crossflow separation on the underside of the hull interacted with the wake of the support thereby altering the hydrodynamic loading experienced by the hull the support created intense regions of low pressure on the underside of the hull whose effect could be observed on the topside of the hull the skin friction coefficient along the topside of the hull from the nose to the tail was relatively unaffected by the presence of the support good agreement was observed between the cfd predictions and experimental measurements of the hydrodynamic loads experienced by the joubert bb2 in the lswt up to α and β 25 except the out of plane moment which was generally under predicted for β 25 the load interference effects of the lswt support were minimal when the casing load increment was isolated regardless of whether the geometry was in a wind tunnel environment the predictions of the casing load increment also agreed well with experiment the numerical method is adaptable to various hull and casing shapes which permits many simulations of various geometries of interest for developing a comprehensive hydrodynamic load database the estimated numerical error of the in plane loads were 8 1 and 6 8 for the force and moment respectively the estimated numerical error of the out of plane loads were 2 2 and 3 7 for the force and moment respectively the numerical methodology does not offer a precise estimate of the longitudinal force x or the rolling moment k whose numerical errors were estimated to be 24 0 and 21 8 respectively finer grids are required to make confident predictions of these quantities the addition of a casing to the joubert axisymmetric hull was found to have a significant effect on the hydrodynamic loads positive angles of attack showed more casing influence than negative angles of attack in general the casing added a negative bias to the longitudinal force x across all angles of attack at α 10 z was reduced by 8 89 and m was reduced by 3 84 at α 25 z was reduced by 11 8 and m was reduced by 10 6 the casing introduced a rolling moment k normal force z and pitching moment m at non zero angles of drift the magnitudes of the side force y and yawing moment n were also increased at β 10 y was increased by 30 6 and n was increased by 14 5 at β 25 y was increased by 31 4 and n was increased by 11 5 in comparing the viscous flow results of the joubert axisymmetric hull with a casing to the results without a casing it was found that lower surface pressures are present at the corners of the casing which precedes an adverse pressure gradient when a casing corner was located on the leeward side of the hull it tended to promote flow separation and the adverse pressure gradient following the casing corners was stronger than the gradient observed on the curve axisymmetric hull flow separation was delayed by a casing corner if the corner was located on the leeward side altering the flow separation points on the hull caused the vortical wake to form differently than for an axisymmetric hull in a drifting orientation the wake pattern was very complex with multiple vortices present in the asymmetric wake this was consistent with significant out of plane loading on the hull at a positive angle of attack the casing created an after body effect in the wake and reduced the magnitude of the normal force further work detailing the hydrodynamic effects of a submarine casing in other flow orientations will be a useful addition to a results database and future development of load estimation models acknowledgements the authors would like to thank dr dev ranmuthugala
