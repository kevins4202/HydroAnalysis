21295,bridge alarms are a plausible way to reduce the ship collision probability by timely alerting the officer on watch of a conflict however there currently are no dedicated methods for alerting a stand on ship to compensate the unawareness of or inactive response of a give way ship to dangerous encounter situations therefore this article proposes a collision alert system from the stand on ship perspective to trigger the stand on ship s involvement in the conflict elimination the developed method quantifies the terms of the colregs regarding the stand on ship s responsibility for conflict elimination the conflict severity is divided into 9 classes based on the ship intention estimation conflict evolution analysis and colregs scrutiny these are linked with the 4 stages of the encounter process to helps stand on ship clarify her action responsibilities as per the rules and classify the alert into four levels the available maneuvering margin of the stand on ship is considered to improve the accuracy of severity ranking the results of several case studies in open water with good visibility indicate that the proposed method can support the stand on ship to correctly understand the rules and to fulfil her duties keywords collision alert system stand on ship colregs intention estimation conflict evolution analysis available maneuvering margin 1 introduction the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colregs 1972 consists of various rules for instructing the navigators on how to act under different encounter scenarios 56 of major maritime collision includes violation of colregs statheros et al 2008 correctly understanding and following the rules in colregs is important for passing safely however the colregs rules do not provide specific guidance in actual operation hilgert and baldauf 1997 du et al 2020b especially for the stand on ship under the conflict threat du et al 2020a hence a contextual appreciation is required by the officers on watch based on which the actions of conflict resolution are enacted according to colregs the obligation of give way ship is relatively explicit and constant when the collision risk exists the give way ship is required to act early and sufficiently however the responsibilities of the stand on ship vary at different stages moreover there currently are no clear guidelines to delineate each encounter stage for the stand on ship dangerous encounters and even ship collisions where misinterpretations of the colregs rules by navigators of the stand on ship are not rare the accident report of china maritime safety administration 2018 and maib 2015 and 2019 can attest this the stand on ship s action helps prevent dangerous encounters while the role of the stand on ship is not often considered du et al 2020a considerable research has been dedicated to quantifying the colregs for eliminating conflict johansen et al 2016 szlapczynski and krata 2018 nonetheless most of these strategies are designed from the give way ship perspective only or without distinguishing the stand on ship or the give way ship du et al 2020a it is therefore important to conduct conflict analysis on the activation of the stand on ship s role in conflict elimination to improve safe conflict resolution of ships encountering one another accurately grasping the current encounter stage and understanding its corresponding obligations are the prerequisites for the stand on ships to take appropriate actions in compliance with colregs ship collision alert helps alert the ship of a collision hazard timely rather than directly proposing collision avoidance maneuvers in the current circumstance szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017a the development of collision alert systems cas has attracted significant attention in the maritime domain baldauf et al 2011 menon et al 2013 simsir et al 2014 goerlandt et al 2015 szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017a rizogiannis and thomopoulos 2019 gil et al 2020 however these existing works do not consider the difference of the identity of the ship such as the stand on ship or give way ship as specified in the colregs furthermore many works aim to find the critical condition that alerts the ship to take evasive action beyond this critical condition a collision cannot be avoidable such as last time to take action zhuo and tang 2008 minimum distance to collision montewka et al 2010 2014 and last line of defence baldauf et al 2017 some works have considered colregs for encounter categorization but few of them has distinguished the responsibilities of ships at different stages of the encounter especially for the stand on ship a stand on ship acting too early may violate rule 17 of the colregs while a stand on ship acting too late but before this critical condition has fewer maneuver options besides the available maneuvering margin amm of a ship is not considered in existing studies of alerting the ship of a collision hazard the amm represents the ship s capability to avoid ship collision a higher amm means that the ship has more space and time to execute a collision avoidance maneuver and hence a higher chance to eliminate a dangerous encounter the lack of knowledge of a vessel s amm may lead to inaccurate detection of actual danger huang and van gelder 2019a b huang et al 2019c considered the capability of a ship to prevent ship collision when measuring the ship collision risk in dense water area however the colregs are not considered in that work the stand on ship has an important role in conflict elimination during dangerous encounters quantifying her action responsibilities at different encounter stages in compliance with colregs is a first step to develop a cas targeted for vessels in a stand on situation furthermore the amm of a ship is an important factor to consider for accurately estimating the risk given the above the primary aim of this work is to propose a cas from the stand on ship s perspective by answering what is the action obligation of a stand on ship at different encounter stages our work alerts the ship of a collision hazard timely rather than directly proposing collision avoidance maneuvers this cas furthermore quantifies the action responsibility of the stand on ship at different encounter stages in compliance with colregs the amm is considered to improve the accuracy of ranking the collision risk besides the influence of the own ship on the decision of the target ships is considered this work contributes to the construction of stand on ship as second line of defense slod du et al 2020a and contains 1 a proposed method for classification of conflict severity and the clarification of stand on ship s action responsibility at each different conflict level 2 the design of a collision alert system to support the stand on ship to accurately understand the current conflict state and her corresponding action responsibilities and 3 the application of the proposed method to specific case studies concerning open sea navigation with good visibility the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 focuses on the quantitative analysis of the conflict process including quantifying encounter stages conflict severity and alert level section 3 elaborates on the design of the ship collision alert system from the stand on ship perspective section 4 presents the case study to demonstrate the feasibility of this proposed method a discussion and some recommendations for future research are provided in section 5 section 6 concludes the list of the notations and abbreviations are also given in table 1 and table 2 respectively in the appendix 2 quantitative analysis of conflict process developing an approach for quantitatively describing the conflict process is a precondition for the construction of cas for alerting the stand on ship to act properly in compliance with colregs this includes quantifying alert levels at different encounter stages and quantifying conflict severity which are elaborated in section 2 1 and section 2 2 respectively 2 1 quantifying alert levels at different encounter stages 2 1 1 relevant rules in colregs rule 11 mentioned that rules from 12 to 18 apply to vessels in sight of one another rule 15 concerns the action rule in crossing situation the give way ship should avoid crossing ahead of the other vessel if the circumstances of the case admit rule 17 focuses on the action by the stand on ship it can be interpreted as follows i the stand on ship is not allowed to maneuver when the risk exists unless one of the following two conditions is met ii the stand on ship is permitted to maneuver if the give way ship does not act appropriately in compliance with these rules in particular rule 8 13 14 and 15 iii the stand on ship is required to maneuver when the collision cannot be avoided by the action of the give way vessel alone rule 18 determines the responsibilities between different types of vessels for instance a power driven vessel underway shall keep out of the way of a vessel engaged in fishing 2 1 2 quantifying encounter stages the rules addressed in section 2 1 1 design three protective layers for ships to prevent collisions three protective layers which are illustrated in fig 1 are concluded by du et al 2020a as give way ship as first line of defense flod stand on ship as second line of defense slod and both ships as third line of defense tlod in fig 1 the green color means no conflict and none of flod slod and tlod is activated yellow orange and red color represents the activation of flod slod and tlod respectively flod is activated by the occurrence of ship conflict specifically when there is a conflict between a ship pair the give way ship is required to act when the slod is activated by the rule 17 ii the stand on ship is permitted to act for conflict elimination while the obligation of the give way ship does not vanish since the flod is activated when the encounter situation goes worse that the conflict cannot be avoided by the give way ship s action alone see rule 17 iii tlod is activated where both ships are required to act by colregs based on the order of activation of three protective layers a conflict process can be divided into four stages fig 2 the conflict severity increases from stage 1 to stage 4 in stage 1 there is no conflict existing period both of ship pair has unrestricted action hence the flod slod and tlod are inactive in stage 2 a conflict emerges the stand on ship shall maintain her course and speed and the give way ship is required to act to eliminate the conflict hence only flod is activated in stage 3 a conflict develops as it is evident that the give way ship does not act properly according to colregs the obligation of the give way ship is to act while that of the stand on ship is action permitted hence both flod and slod are activated in stage 4 a conflict escalates so that it cannot be eliminated by the give way ship s action alone thus both ship pair are required to act for passing safely and therefore the flod slod and tlod are activated 2 1 3 quantifying alert levels in line with the imo 2007 recommendations imo 2007 four levels of alert are adopted which are then linked to these four encounter stages the alert level at stage 4 is alarm to indicate navigators on the stand on ship that the action is required immediately for the conflict elimination marked as red color in fig 2 the alert level at stage 3 is warning to indicate navigators on the stand on ship that the action is permitted for the conflict elimination as the dangerous situation may develop if no action is taken marked as orange color in fig 2 the alert level at stage 2 is caution to indicate navigators on the stand on ship that no action is allowed but attention and special consideration of the current situation are required due to the existing conflict marked as yellow color in fig 2 the alert level at stage 1 is safe as the ship pair can pass safely posing no action restriction on each other marked as green color in fig 2 2 2 quantifying conflict severity 2 2 1 conflict concept and measurements the conflict is defined as a situation of near collision which has great potential to be a collision lei et al 2017 a conflict can be measured when a restricted area around one ship is projected to be violated by another vessel wang 2010 weng and xue 2015 the elliptical ship domain is selected to describe the restricted area around one ship as it is the most realistic one based on empirical data hansen et al 2013 the major radius of elliptical ship domain is four times of the ship length and its minor radius is 1 6 times of the ship length fujii and tanaka 1971 hence the conflict is determined by checking whether one ship remaining her current course and speed is projected to violate the elliptical domain around the other ship 2 2 2 conflict severity 2 2 2 1 concept and measurements the conflict severity corresponds to the nearness to an accident which relates to how close this interaction is to be an accident du et al 2020b a conflict with higher severity implies more similarity to an accident to support the stand on ship to read the hazardous situation and understand her responsibility the severity of the conflict is measured according to the interpretation of rule 17 in colregs in particular the action responsibilities of the stand on ship in each encounter stage are in focus further to measure the conflict severity more accurately the amm for a ship to eliminate the conflict is also considered accordingly the conflict severity can be quantitatively subdivided by evaluating 1 whether a conflict exists 2 whether the give way ship is aware of the exiting conflict 3 whether the conflict can be eliminated by the give way ship s action alone 4 whether the amm of the stand on ship is sufficient and 5 whether the give way ship s action violates the colregs these are determined by five aspects respectively 1 conflict detection 2 intention estimation of the give way ship 3 action quality aq assessment of the give way ship 4 amm calculation of the stand on ship and 5 colregs scrutiny of the give way ship conflict detection is elaborated in section 3 3 where ic denotes the index of conflict ic 1 if a conflict exists otherwise ic is 0 intention estimation of the give way ship is elaborated in section 3 4 through an index denoted int int 1 means that the give way ship is aware of the exiting conflict and acts int 0 means that the give way ship is not aware of the exiting conflict or at least that it does not act in accordance with the colregs for the give way ship s aq assessment two categories are used positive evasive action and negative evasive action its index is a q a q 1 means the give way ship takes positive evasive action and a q 1 means the give way ship takes negative evasive action more details are in section 3 5 1 definition 1 positive evasive action is the action from one ship that can effectively eliminate the potential conflict without additional assistance from the other ship definition 2 negative evasive action refers to an action of a ship that cannot eliminate the potential conflict with or without additional assistance from the other ship amm calculation is elaborated in section 3 5 2 and its index is a m m it is divided into three classes high h medium m and low l colregs scrutiny is denoted with the index col see section 3 6 col 1 means the give way ship s action obeys the colregs col 0 means that the give way ship s action violates colregs 2 2 2 2 conflict severity classification the conflict severity cs is refined into 9 classes the conditions measurements and alert level of each class are specified in table 1 own ship os is the stand on ship and target ship ts is the give way ship from cs1 to cs9 the conflict severity increases stage 1 contains cs1 the condition of cs1 is no conflict there is no action limitation for the os as flod slod and tlod are inactivated the alert level is safe stage 2 contains cs2 and cs3 conflict generates and only the flod is activated the os s action obligation is not allowed the alert level is caution rule 17a i for cs2 1 ts is aware of the existing conflict 2 ts takes positive evasive action and 3 ts s action complies with the colregs for cs3 1 ts is aware of this existing conflict 2 ts s action complies with colregs 3 ts takes negative evasive action and 4 the amm of os is high stage 3 contains 4 classes of conflict severity including cs4 cs5 cs6 and cs7 in stage 3 the flod and slod are activated and os is permitted to act this alert level is warning rule 17a ii for cs4 1 ts is aware of this existing conflict 2 ts takes positive evasive action and 3 this action violates the rule 15 in colregs cs5 is similar to cs3 except that the amm of the os is medium for cs6 the ts is not aware of the existing conflict but the amm of os is high cs7 is similar to cs6 but amm of the os is medium stage 4 contains cs8 and cs9 the flod slod and tlod are activated and the os is required to act the alert level is alarm rule 17b cs8 is similar to cs3 and cs5 but the amm of the os is low cs9 is similar to cs6 and cs7 but the amm of the os is low 2 2 2 3 multi vessel encounter scenarios this work is to alert the stand on ship of a collision hazard timely however the determination of the collision avoidance manoeuvres in the current circumstance still needs navigator s involvement our method provides assistance to the navigator in multi encounter situations through analyzing the encounter process between ship pairs the navigator can clearly understand her action obligations and the corresponding risk levels at different encounter stages for different vessels it is then up to the navigator to interpret this information and take the appropriate action the multi vessel encounter is divided into several ship pair encounters and conflict between the own ship and other target ships are assessed separately as the multi vessel encounter is more complicated the following aspects are clarified 1 alert sequence the alert level determines the alert sequence the higher level alert has a higher priority the level of alert is divided into four levels safe caution warning and alarm according to the different collision risk levels table 1 therefore the alert sequence ranks from high to low is alarm warning caution and safe the nine levels of conflict severity from cs1 to cs9 are used within the cas to reveal the cause leading to the current encounter situation this helps clarify the action obligation as per the rules for instance a ship encounters with two ships and os is in the stand on position see fig 3 a the encounter risk between os and ts1 is cs3 while that between os and ts2 is cs8 the alert level of cs3 is caution and that of cs8 is alarm the alert level of this situation is determined as warning if the levels of the alert for different vessels are the same the alert sequences are the same regardless of whether the levels of the conflict severity are the same or different if the encounter risk between os and ts1 is cs4 and that between os and ts2 is cs6 see fig 3 a the alerts of cs4 and cs6 are warning and they have an equal alert level 2 action responsibilities there are two possible situations where a ship has different collision avoidance responsibilities see fig 3 one is that the ship has different collision avoidance responsibilities but with the same identity as shown in fig 3 a os is the stand on ship for both the ship pair encounters between os and ts1 and between os and ts2 if the os has different collision avoidance responsibilities the principle is highest risk first if the encounter risk between os and ts1 is cs3 action not allowed while that between os and ts2 is cs8 action required the os is required to take evasive action another is the rule conflict where a vessel can have two identities simultaneously e g stand on and give way vessel for different vessels as shown in fig 3 b os is give way ship encountering with ts1 meanwhile os is the stand on ship encountering with ts2 the os is required to act when the conflict between os and ts1 exists if the collision risk is cs3 between os and ts2 simultaneously the os is required to keep her current course and speed under this situation the higher level of action obligation has a higher priority hence this cas informs that the os is required to act and the alert level is alarm 3 methodology 3 1 structure of cas from stand on ship perspective fig 4 illustrates how the cas supports the stand on ship in understanding the encounter stage and her action responsibility du et al 2020a when the os encounters a ts in which os is in the stand on position the following five steps are triggered and repeated continuously during the encounter 1 conflict detection if there is no conflict os has no action limitation if a conflict exists then 2 the ts s intention estimation is performed if the ts is aware of the existing conflict 3 the ts s aq is assessed and 4 the colregs is referred afterwards 5 the os s amm calculation is performed if the ts is not aware of the existing conflict the ts s action is negative and violates the colregs hence only 5 the os s amm is calculated finally the proposed cas from the stand on ship perspective provides her action obligation and alert level to support stand on ship s decision making the step 1 2 have been done in previous work du et al 2020a therefore the remaining steps including step 3 4 5 are the focus of this work 3 2 algorithm design of cas from stand on ship perspective the algorithm of utilizing cas from the stand on ship perspective to clarify the encounter stage os s action obligation and alert level is designed in fig 5 os is the stand on ship the inputs for this method are the traffic safety related information of this ship pair involving into conflict the identity of two ships are determined according to their relative course and relative position goerlandt et al 2015 this cas is activated only if os is the stand on ship for os the planned trajectory p t o s x y t speed v o s t and course c o s t are known her maneuverability turning ability index k and turning lag index t nomoto et al 1956 is also explicit from the os s perspective the historical and current motion data of ts including position p t s x y t speed v t s t and course c t s t can be obtained through ais receiver the outputs of the cas are the action obligation of os unrestricted not allowed permitted required and alert level safe caution warning alarm this module links 9 classes of conflict severity with the 4 encounter stages in accordance to colregs based on the logic presented in table 1 this designed algorithm contains three main sub modules conflict detection module detects the conflict between the ship pair give way ship s intention estimation module estimates the intention of the action that is taken by the ts conflict evolution analysis module assesses ts s aq and calculates os s amm and refers to the rules in colregs each module is elaborated from section 3 3 to 3 5 3 3 conflict detection module the velocity obstacle vo projects the spatiotemporal relationship between a ship pair involved in an encounter situation into one ship s velocity domain based on this the conflict can be judged by checking whether the velocity of the ship falls into this velocity obstacle zone huang et al 2018 chen et al 2018 the non linear velocity obstacles nl vo algorithm considers the dynamic nature of ship action during the whole encounter process huang et al 2018 2019a du et al 2020a 2019 therefore the nl vo algorithm is selected for the conflict assessment step 1 in figs 4 and 5 in fig 6 the ts s velocity space is divided into three segments by a velocity obstacle zone namely s1 the area in red s2 the grid area in yellow and s3 the grid area in blue the ts s velocity in the s1 segment will lead to conflict with os in the future in the figure an example velocity v t s 1 indicates this however if the ts s velocity is not in the s1 segment such as v t s 2 in s2 and v t s 3 in s3 the ship pair can pass safely the difference between ts s velocity in s2 and s3 is elaborated in section 3 6 therefore the conflict can be detected 1 i c t 0 1 i f rv v t s t 0 s n l v o t 0 ϕ 0 else where s n l v o t 0 is the velocity obstacle zone at current moment t 0 in ts s velocity space see fig 6 the formula derivation process is elaborated in huang et al 2017 rv v t s t 0 is ts s reachable ship velocity which is determined by her current velocity v t s t 0 and her turning ability see du et al 2020a if the ts s reachable ship velocity rv v t s t 0 has a non empty intersection with the nl vo set s n l v o t 0 a conflict exists fig 5 otherwise there is no conflict see cs1 in table 1 3 4 ts s intention estimation module in du et al 2020a ship intention is defined as the motivation of the actions that is taken by the ship aimed at attaining certain navigational objectives such as accident avoidance and route following the ship intention of ts during the encounter process is classified as normal navigation and evasive action du et al 2020a these can be distinguished by checking whether the conflict exists when the ship action changes there is an assumption here that the course alteration is the only way used to eliminate conflict the ts s intention can be estimated step 2 in figs 4 and 5 2 i n t t 0 1 i f i c t 0 1 δ c t s t 0 0 0 otherwise where i n t t 0 1 means that the ts is aware of the conflict and alters her course for conflict elimination δ c t s t 0 is the course change of ts the examples of the cs2 and cs3 indicate this see fig 5 and table 1 i n t t 0 0 means that ts is not aware of the exiting conflict or at least that it does not act in accordance with the colregs such as the cs6 and cs7 as indicated in fig 5 and table 1 3 5 conflict evolution analysis conflict evolution analysis checks whether the exiting conflict can be eliminated by ts s adopted action with or without additional assistance from os the colregs is scrutinized to check whether ts s action violates the colregs ts s aq assessment step 3 in figs 4 and 5 ts s colregs scrutiny step 4 in figs 4 and 5 and os s amm calculation step 5 in figs 4 and 5 are the main component of the conflict evolution analysis for the condition that ts is not aware of the existing conflict only os s amm is calculated to specify the action obligation of os for the condition that ts is aware of the existing conflict there are two possible results of ts s aq assessment if ts is found to take positive evasive action only colregs scrutiny is needed afterwards to distinguish whether os s action obligation is not allowed or permitted otherwise if the ts takes negative evasive action the os s amm calculation is needed to determine os s obligation action permitted or action required 3 5 1 ts s aq assessment ts s aq is assessed by checking whether the conflict can be eliminated by ts s adopted action alone learning from earlier work zhuo and tang 2008 montewka et al 2014 there is a critical state that a conflict can be eliminated by ts s evasive action alone if the ts acts before a certain critical point here assumptions are that the ts only alters the course for conflict elimination and the rate of turn r o t t of the ts remains unchanged within a certain time therefore this critical state for the ts can be defined from the spatial scales as follows 3 min d i s t s min d i s p o s t p t s t min d i s p o s t e n d p t s t e n d r p t s t δ t p t s t v t s t cos c t s t r o t t δ t sin c t s t r o t t δ t δ t r o t t c t s t c t s t δ t δ t where min d i s t s is the critical state for ts in spatial scales d i s p o s t p t s t is the relative distance between a ship pair when the ts starts to maneuver at time t v t s t is the magnitude of ts s speed the min d i s p o s t e n d p t s t e n d is the minimum distance between the os s trajectory p o s black color line with arrow in fig 7 and the ts s predicted trajectory p t s blue color dotted line with arrow in fig 7 after t os s trajectory p o s is known the os predicts ts s trajectory p t s based on the ts s constant r o t t that is observed by os therefore ts s aq can be classified as follows 4 a q t 0 1 i f d i s p o s t 0 p t s t 0 min d i s t s 1 otherwise where a q t 0 1 means ts takes positive evasive action see definition 1 in section 2 2 2 1 the cs2 and cs4 are the examples indicating this see table 1 and fig 5 a q t 0 1 means ts takes negative evasive action see definition 2 in section 2 2 2 1 the cs3 and cs5 are the situation that the ts takes negative evasive action see table 1 and fig 5 3 5 2 colregs scrutiny as specified in rule 15 in colregs the give way ship should avoid crossing ahead of the other vessel in crossing encounter situation this can be assessed using the nl vo algorithm 5 c o l 1 if v t s s 2 0 if v t s s 3 where c o l 1 means the ts s evasive action obeys the colregs while c o l 0 means the evasive action of the give way ship violates the colregs in fig 6 if the ts s velocity falls in zone s2 there is no conflict between os and ts the os will pass the closest point of approach cpa earlier than the ts hence the ts s evasive action is in compliance with the colregs see the cs2 in table 1 if ts s velocity is in zone s3 the conflict can be eliminated by ts s evasive action alone but the ts s evasive action violates rule 15 in colregs as this leads the ts to pass the os ahead of its bow see cs4 in table 1 details of the proof of this are shown in appendix a in huang et al 2018 3 5 3 os s amm calculation as course alteration is the most used and most effective way for ship conflict elimination baldauf et al 2017 the os is assumed to only alter her course with velocity unchanged to eliminate the conflict the change of ship heading after rudder steering is determined by the ship s maneuverability the nomoto model nomoto et al 1956 a simplification of maneuvering modeling group mmg model is commonly used to describe ship maneuverability because it only requires limited inputted parameters in comparison with abkowitz model zhang and zou 2011 and mmg model tao et al 2019 therefore the nomoto model nomoto et al 1956 is adopted to calculate the os s available velocity after steering du et al 2020a 6 r v o s δ v o s t cos c o s t 0 ϕ δ sin c o s t 0 ϕ δ ϕ δ t r d t k δ t t t e t t where r v o s δ is the os s reachable velocity after steering with a demanded rudder angle δ with 35 δ 35 ϕ δ is the change of ship heading based on her turning ability with a demanded rudder angle δ r is the corresponding yaw rate the os s turning ability index k and turning lag index t vary with ship length and velocity under a demanded rudder angle δ the conflict can be eliminated if the os s velocity can be moved out from the ts s velocity obstacle zone according to the nl vo algorithm 7 i c δ 1 i f v o s t r v o s δ v o s t s n l v o t ϕ 0 o t h e r w i s e here i c δ 1 means that at least one ship speed inside her available speed set r v o s δ is outside the velocity obstacle zone s n l v o t therefore the conflict can be eliminated by the os s maneuver with a demanded rudder angle δ i c δ 0 means that the conflict cannot be eliminated with this maneuver for the calculation of ts s velocity obstacle zone s n l v o t the ts is assumed to keep her current motion state specifically if i n t t 0 0 ts is assumed to sail in a straight line with constant speed see the red dotted line in fig 7 if i n t t 0 1 the ts s trajectory is predicted based on the observed r o t t see the blue dotted line in fig 7 the amm is measured based on the proportion of maneuvers by which the os can eliminate potential conflicts to all its available maneuvers huang et al 2019c 8 a m m t h if δ s t δ a t τ 1 i c δ s t 1 m if τ 1 δ s t δ a t τ 2 i c δ s t 1 l if δ s t δ a t τ 2 i c δ s t 1 where δ s is the value of the adopted rudder angle that makes i c δ 1 δ a is all os s available rudder angle and 35 δ a 35 τ 1 and τ 2 are the thresholds to divide the amm into three classes high h medium m and low l cs3 is the example of a m m t h cs5 and cs8 are the examples of a m m t m and a m m t l respectively see table 1 τ 1 and τ 2 are set as 80 and 60 respectively 4 case study two groups of case studies are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method the first group includes four simulated two ship encounters shown in section 4 1 the second group consists of one multi vessel encounter extracted from historical ais data shown in section 4 2 4 1 two ship encounters based on simulations 4 1 1 encounter scenarios design rules 11 to 18 in the colregs only apply to vessels in sight of one another four crossing encounter scenarios in good visibility between a ship pair are designed as the analyzed context the stand on ship is set as the os 4 1 1 1 ship attributes for the os the ship length l o s is 100m the change interval of rudder angle is 5 for the os s turning ability index k 2 v o s l o s and t 2 l o s v o s hong and yu 2000 for the ts its length l t s is 100m 4 1 1 2 sailing related ship motion data the earth fixed coordinate system o x y is adopted ox points to east and oy points to north ship course is the angle at which the ox axis rotates anticlockwise to the ship velocity the simulation time is 600s the time interval for updating the ship motion and the calculations for the cas are set as 10s the initial position p 0 of the os is 2000m 6000m the ts set initially in the origins of the axis system the magnitude of ship speed v is fixed as 5 m s the initial course c 0 of the os is 210 0 and that of the ts is 90 0 t t p is the designed turning time and c t p is the course change at the turning points c t p 0 means the ship turns to port the os will turn to port 30 0 at 100s for the ts due the uncertainty of ship action there are many possibilities for her action when there is a conflict chauvin and lardjane 2008 therefore four encounter scenarios are designed as shown in table 2 the differences between each scenario is the ts s action time and magnitude of course deviation in scenario 1 the ts sails a straight line in scenario 2 the ts turns to port 30 0 at 200s in scenario 3 the ts turns to starboard 40 0 at 200s in scenario 4 the ts turns to starboard 20 0 at 550s 4 1 2 results the results of these four designed encounter scenarios are elaborated from section 4 1 2 1 to section 4 1 2 4 the different colours indicate different levels of conflict severity and alert during different encounter stages green yellow orange and red represents safe caution warning and alarm respectively consistent with the color scheme in table 1 and fig 5 4 1 2 1 scenario 1 fig 8 is the visualization of ship conflict analysis in scenario 1 as developed in table 2 from the start of the simulation a conflict is present ts does not show any response when the conflict exists because the amm of the os is high before 566s in stage 3 the conflict severity is determined as cs6 fig 8 a this is in the stage 3 that the flod and slod are activated therefore the os s obligation is action permitted fig 8 b and the alert level is warning afterwards the amm of os decreases to medium from 566s to 581s so the conflict severity increases to cs7 in stage 3 where flod and slod are activated hence the os s obligation is still action permitted and the alert level is warning when the os s amm drops to low after 581s the conflict severity becomes even more serious reaching cs9 in stage 4 the flod slod and tlod are activated hence the os s obligation changes to action required the alert level is alarm 4 1 2 2 scenario 2 fig 9 illustrates the result of conflict analysis in scenario 2 as developed in table 2 before the ts s action at 200s the level of conflict severity is cs6 fig 9 a which means that the ts does not act but os s amm is high this is in stage 3 where flod and slod are activated therefore the os s obligation is action permitted and alert level is warning fig 9 b the ts takes evasive action at 200s after the ship steers to turn with a demanded rudder the r o t increases gradually and stables at its peak the observed r o t at 206s does not reach its peak at 206s the conflict cannot be eliminated with ts s action alone while the os s amm is still high therefore the level of conflict severity falls to cs3 at 206s this is in stage 2 with only the flod activated the os s obligation is action not allowed and the alert level is caution at 211s the observed r o t stables at its peak the conflict is expected to be eliminated by ts s positive evasive action however this evasive action violates rule 15 in colregs because the ts is expected to cross the os by its bow v t s s 3 consequently the level of conflict severity increases to cs4 at 211s fig 9 a the flod and slod are activated in stage 3 the os s obligation is action permitted and the alert level is warning fig 9 b with this evasive action the ts successfully moves her velocity outside the vo zone at 226s thus the conflict is eliminated at 226s afterwards the level of conflict severity falls back to cs1 fig 9 a in stage 1 so that the os can move unrestricted with the alert level being safe fig 9 b 4 1 2 3 scenario 3 fig 10 shows the results of scenario 3 as indicated in table 2 from the onset of the simulation to 200s a conflict exists and the ts shows no response the conflict severity is cs6 as os s amm is high the flod and slod are activated in stage 3 fig 10 a therefore the os s obligation is action permitted and the alert level is warning fig 10 b the ts turns to starboard at 200s after the ship turns with a demanded rudder the r o t increases gradually and stabilized at its peak around 211s with the ts s maneuver the conflict severity falls from cs6 to cr3 at 206s and to cr2 at 211s the encounter stage changes from stage 3 to stage 2 the conflict is expected to be eliminated by ts s positive and legal evasive action alone during this period only the flod is activated indicating that the os s obligation is action not allowed and the alert level is caution fig 10 b from 231s onwards the conflict between os and ts3 is eliminated hence the conflict severity is marked as cs1 the flod slod and tlod are inactivate the os can move unrestricted and the alert level is safe consequently the ts s action is positive and legal 4 1 2 4 results of scenario 4 fig 11 presents the evolution of the conflict severity between the os and ts in scenario 4 as indicated in table 2 fig 11 a and the change in the os s obligation during the whole encounter process fig 11 b the conflict severity is cs6 at the beginning of the simulation time before the ts s right turn at 550s it remains in cs6 in stage 3 the flod and slod are activated the os s obligation is action permitted with the alert level at warning the ts starts to change her course from 550s the conflict severity increases to cr8 from 556s as the ts s action is not efficient to eliminate the existing conflict and the amm of the os is low see table 1 and fig 5 this is in the stage 4 where the flod slod and tlod are activated hence the os s obligation is action required and the alert level is alarm fig 11 b after the ts finishes the steering and stabilizes at the designed new course around 586s the ts keeps sailing in a straight line with a constant course as the conflict still exists and the ship pair keeps approaching the conflict severity becomes more serious increasing to cs9 at 586 in stage 4 the flod slod and tlod are activated the os s obligation is action required and the alert level is alarm 4 2 multi vessels encounter based on ais data 4 2 1 encounter scenario description fig 12 visualizes the ship trajectories involved in a multi vessels encounter which was happened in the north atlantic du et al 2020a ship1 is a smaller oil tanker with 96m in length its trjectory is marked in blue in fig 12 ship2 is a fishing vessel with 23m in length with its trajectory marked in red ship3 is a larger oil tanker with 171m in length its trajectory being marked in black the discrete points indicate the historical trajectories of these three ships based on historic ais data after processing the lines linking these points are the ship trajectories after linear interpolation based on the ais data 4 2 2 results fig 13 illustrates the time periods during a conflict exists between each ship pair for the encounter between ship1 and ship2 there are two periods in which a conflict exists ranging from 661s to 721s and from 881s to 911s similarly the collision risk for the encounter between ship1 and ship3 exists between 501s and 531s and between 931s and 941s the time of collision risk existing between ship2 and ship3 is also not consecutive containing four periods from the start to 31s from 431s to 481s from 521s to 591s and from 821s to 1391s the results of ship conflict analysis between different ship pair in multi vessel encounter scenario are elaborated in section 4 2 2 1 4 2 2 2 and 4 2 2 3 respectively the thick line is the trajectory of the os and the thin line is that of the ts the different colours on the os s trajectory indicate different levels of alert during different encounter stages which are consistent with the color set in table 1 and fig 5 the color on the ts s trajectory is the same as that on the os to indicate their relative position 4 2 2 1 ship pair encounter berween ship1 and ship2 ship2 is the stand on ship according to rule 18 in the colregs the ship2 is set as os the results are illustrated in fig 14 before 661s there is no conflict between ship1 and ship2 see fig 14 the conflict severity is cs1 in stage 1 hence the flod slod and tlod are inactive the os can move unrestricted and the alert level is safe however due to the ts s action during this period such as at 441s and 521s for the conflict between ts and ship3 a conflict between os and ts is generated from 661s afterwards ts s evasive action between 661s and 671s is positive however this evasive action violates the colregs so that the conflict severity is cs4 in stage 3 during this period flod and slod are activated therefore that os s obligation is action permitted and the alert level is warning as the ts takes positive and legal evasive action from 671s to 701s the conflict severity decreases to cs2 and only flod is activated hence the os s obligation is action not allowed and the alert level is caution finally with the ts s continous evasive action the conflict between the os and ts is eliminated already from 701s the conflict severity between 701s and 881s is cs1 in stage 1 the os can move unrestricted and the alert level is safe the ts turns to starboard to return to her planned trajectory during this period from 701s to 881s which re generates a conflict between os and ts this action leads the ts to pass the os ahead of its bow therefore the conflict severity increases to cs4 at 901s and this stage remains until 911s both flod and slod are activated hence the os s obligation is action permitted and the alert level is warning there is no conflict between the os and the ts after 911s the ts passes the os ahead of its bow around 2000s none of the flod slod and tlod are activated the os has no action restriction and the alert level is safe 4 2 2 2 ship pair encounter berween ship1 and ship3 ship3 is the stand on ship according to rule 15 and rule 18 in the colregs the ship3 is set as os the results are shown in fig 15 no conflict exists between os and ts before 501s the conflict severity is cs1 in stage 1 the flod slod and tlod are inactive hence the os can move unrestricted and the alert level is safe due to the course change of ts the conflict between os and ts occurs from 501s the ts acts positive and legal so that the existing conflict is expected to be eliminated by the ts s action alone the level of conflict severity is cs2 where only the flod is activated the os is not allowed to act and the alert level is caution this state remains until 521s from 521s to 531s the ts turns to port and the ts s action violates the rule 15 in the colregs the conflict severity increases to cs4 in stage 3 the flod and slod are activated the alert level is warning with the os being permitted to act from 531s to 931s there is no conflict the level of conflict severity returns to cs1 in stage1 so the os has no action restriction and the alert level is safe during this period the ts turns to starboard to return its original trajectory which results in the conflict regeneration from 931s to 941s the period between 931s and 941s is in stage 2 with a conflict severity of cs2 the ts takes positive and legal evasive action so that the existing conflict is expected to be eliminated by ts s action alone only the flod is activated the os is not allowed to act and the alert level is caution the conflict is eliminated at 941s afterwards the os has no action restrictions this is in stage 1 with a conflict severity of cs1 none of the flod slod and tlod are activated the alert level is safe 4 2 2 3 ship pair encounter berween ship2 and ship3 ship2 is the stand on ship according to rule 15 in the colregs the ship2 is set as os from fig 16 a it is seen that ts s action is more complicated the conflict occurs from the beginning because the ts does not act and the os s amm is high the conflict severity is cs6 in stage 3 before 21s the flod and slod are activated the os s obligation is action permitted and the alert level is warning the ts is aware of the existing conflict and starts to act from 21s from 21s to 31s the ts s action is positive and sufficient to eliminate the existing conflict however this action is illegal in the sense that the ts is expected to pass the os ahead of its bow the conflict severity in this period is cs4 in stage 3 the flod and slod are activated hence the os is permitted to act and the alert level is warning with the continuous evasive action of the ts the conflict is eliminated from 31s from 31s to 431s the conflict severity decreases to cs1 in stage 1 with the flod slod and tlod all inactivated the os has no action restriction if the ts keeps her current velocity and course she is expected to safely pass the os s bow the alert level is safe to comply with the colregs to pass the os by its abaft the ts turns to starboard which generates the conflict from 431s afterwards the ts turns to starboard intermittently which makes the encounter stage changes the ts acts continuously from 431s to 481s and from 521s to 591s leading the ts to pass the os safely ahead of its bow the conflict severity during this action period is cs4 which implies that the os is permitted ts to act with an alert level warning there is no conflict between 481s and 521s and between 521s and 821s which is cs1 in stage 1 during these two periods the flod slod and tlod all inactivated the os has no action restriction and alert level is safe ts s intermittent action from 591s to 821s regenerates the conflict since 821s before 921s ts s action is positive but illegal so the conflict severity during this action period is cs4 in stage 3 os is allowed to act and the alert level is warning there is no action taken by ts between 921s and 1111s however the os s amm is high during this period therefore the conflict severity is cs6 in stage 3 and the flod and slod are activated the os is allowed to act the alert level is warning from 1111s to 1171s the conflict severity decreases to cs3 as ts s action is negative but os s amm is high os is not allowed to act during this period and the laert level is caution the situation in the period between 1171s and 1361s is similar to that between 921s and 1111s the ts s turning to starboard at 1361s is positive and complies with colregs the ts is expected to pass abaft the os s abaft with current velocity unchanged during the period from 1361s to 1391s the conflict severity is cs2 which is in stage2 and only the flod is activated the os is not allowed to act the alert level is caution the conflict is completely eliminated from 1391s onwards and the ts s action is legal due to her cultivated turning to starboard the ts passes abaft the os s stern around 2550s afterwards the conflict severity is cs1 in stage 1 none of the flod slod and tlod are activated the os has no action restriction and the alert level is safe 5 discussion 5 1 features of the proposed method the proposed cas from the stand on ship s perspective aims at refining the terms of the colregs regarding the stand on ship s action obligation our method can 1 classify the conflict levels from stage 1 to stage 4 2 reveal the cause leading to the current encounter situation from cs1 to cs9 such as give way ship s positive but illegal evasive action and 3 clarify the stand on ship s action responsibilities from action unrestricted to action required this work helps support this ship s active involvement in conflict elimination through appropriately anticipating the developing situation improved situational awareness and better anticipation of developing dangerous situations may be conductive to reduce the probability of ship collision caused by the misinterpretations of the colregs rules by navigators of the stand on ship the proposed method of cas from the stand on ship perspective has the following features first this work quantifies the terms of the colregs regarding the stand on ship s action obligation according to the different action responsibilities for each ship as specified in colregs the encounter stage is divided in 4 stages correspondingly the conflict severity is subdivided into 9 levels to signify different cases apart from the regulation specified in colregs the classification of conflict severity is also determined with reference to the following two principles the first principle is that the situation is worse when the target ship is not aware of the existing risk compared with that when the ship is aware of it for instance cs9 is more dangerous than cs8 this can be supported by the evidence that a lack of situational awareness has been identified as a main contributing factor in ship collisions liu and wu 2004 gale and patraiko 2007 the second principle is that the risk is more serious when the ship has a limited number of maneuvering options for the navigator to eliminate the existing risk huang and van gelder 2019c hence the conflict severity of cs5 is higher than cs3 based on these subdividing the conflict severity into 9 levels is reasonable these 9 levels of encounter severity are made to distinguish cases in the calculation scheme to account for differences in situations afterwards these 9 levels of conflict severity are used to the division of alert levels this is to simplify the information to support the navigators to make action decision the output of this cas from the stand on ship perspective is the encounter stage the action obligation of the os in the stand on position and the alert level this information can help the navigator onboard the stand on ship compensates the give way ship s lack of or incorrect action in response to an evolving dangerous situation second the dynamic and uncertain nature of the action by the ts are considered in the conflict detection this work adopts the nl vo algorithm to detect the conflict between os and ts this is done instead of making the commonly made assumption that ships sail in a straight line with constant speed the determination of risk fully considers the influence of the os on the decision of the ts hence the application of the nl vo algorithm makes the conflict assessment more realistic and accurate du et al 2020a further the ts s action uncertainty is also considered in principle all possible give way ship s actions should be determined in making the stand on ship s conflict assessment this paper assumes that the give way ship adopts a course alteration strategy for eliminating the encounter risk this is in accordance with the observation done by baldauf et al 2017 therefore the reachable velocity of os is utilized to measure ts s action uncertainty third the amm of the os are considered when determining the conflict severity navigators with a risk taking attitude might accept some risky scenarios and act relatively late huang et al 2020 but this situation leaves a limited number of maneuvering options for the navigator however some navigators on board a stand on ship may illegally act to master the situation when the rule requires the ship to keep her course and speed chauvin and lardjane 2008 which leaves sufficient maneuvering options for the navigator but violates the rule 17 in colregs hence a lack of understanding of the amm of the ship to eliminate the risk may lead to inaccurate detection of a dangerous situation huang and van gelder 2019b therefore when determining the conflict severity the ease of eliminating the conflict should also be considered the amm of os is utilized to measure the capability of os to prevent collision for this reason the accuracy of ranking the conflict severity is improved 5 2 applications of the proposed method this work has the potential to be applied for various purposes under different encounter scenarios firstly it contributes to the autonomous shipping development autonomous ships need to be as safe as a manned counterpart operating in similar circumstances maritime uk 2018 xue et al 2019a b fan et al 2020 two reasons demonstrate this one is that this proposed method takes the colregs into consideration this helps the autonomous ship to understand the conventional ships action moreover the rules for autonomous ships need to be merged with colregs du et al 2020a second is that the amm of the os is considered the autonomous ship can accurately grasp not only the dangerous level of the approaching ships but also the difficulty of avoiding collisions having adequate information about navigational safety including the current encounter stage and her action obligation is important for the autonomous ships to make correct action decision for a safe pass secondly it can be applied in ship pair encounter scenarios and multi vessels encounter scenarios for a ship pair encounter the proposed cas from the stand on ship perspective can help os understand the encounter stage and clarify her action obligation the results of the case study in section 4 can demonstrate this however for a multi vessel encounter the collision avoidance between target ships may lead to own ship s inaccurate estimation of the target ship s intention performing aq assessment of ts1 step 3 in fig 4 can help reduce the impact on the accuracy of risk assessment that caused by this inaccurate ship intention estimation step 2 in fig 4 which is one of the focus of this work see fig 4 taking a three vessel encounter as an example including os ts1 and ts2 see fig 3 a os has the collision risk with ts1 and the collision risk between ts1 and ts2 exists os is the stand on ship if ts1 changes her action for the collision avoidance with ts2 the intention estimation of ts1 from os perspective is that ts1 is aware of the exiting conflict with os in this work there is an assumption that the intention of the action will affect the effect of avoiding collisions that produced by adopted action if ts1 is aware of the collision hazard but ts1 s aq is negative the conflict severity is cs5 if ts1 is not aware of the collision hazard and ts1 s aq is negative the conflict severity is cs6 or cs7 see table 1 cs5 cs6 and cs7 are in the stage 3 that alert levels are warning hence the impact on the accuracy of risk assessment that caused by this inaccurate ship intention estimation is minor for the condition that ts1 s aq is positive ts1 s action helps collision avoidance with os it is reasonable to estimate that ts1 is aware of the collision risk with os and acts for it as we value ts s aq more therefore the collision risk still can be correctly assessed and classified by this proposed method thirdly the method can also be used to determine the alert levels in historic ais data which can be used to obtain further insight in the risk levels in waterways accurate ranking of traffic encounters through a conflict severity hierarchy contributes to the detection of high risk areas with a high occurrence frequency of near miss a near miss is a situation which did not lead to an accident but where an accident was narrowly avoided zhang et al 2015 2016 2017 du et al 2020b the focus of these detected near miss is effective in reducing the number of encounters requiring further examination by experts such as the vts operator besides the knowledge extracted from the analysis of historical waterway traffic risks can support the vts operators to manage waterway traffic and provide guidance to navigators 5 3 limitations and future research 5 3 1 parameters determination first the elliptical domain is selected as a basis of the current work as it is the most realistic one based on empirical data hansen et al 2013 however the elliptical domain still has many limitations szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017b that may undermine the accuracy of ship collision risk classification this issue could be overcome by the adoption of more advanced ship domain models such as knowledge based ship domain zhu et al 2001 pietrzykowski and uriasz 2009 or a model based ship domain rawson et al 2014 krata and montewka 2015 further the shape traffic density and traffic patterns of different sea and waterway regions are known to have an impact on the shape and size of the ship domain ship domains specified to open water pietrzykowski and uriasz 2009 restricted water hansen et al 2013 wang and chin 2016 pietrzykowski 2008 and ice covered water in convoy operations goerlandt et al 2017 are different a balance should be achieved between precisely defining the shape and dimensions of the ship domain and simplifying the computations ultimately the choice of domain is less important than the accuracy of the output level of the cas in the proposed cas method the elliptical domain is only used to help the stand on ship correctly understand the rules and to fulfil her duties the ship domain is only a means to that end instead of a focus therefore if other ship domain such as the fuzzy ship domain proves to be better under other encounter scenarios the proposed approach can be further applied to improve the cas further second the conflict evolution analysis including the ts s aq assessment and the os s amm calculation is performed based on the assumption that the motion state of the ts remains constant within a certain time for the condition that the ts is aware of the existing conflict the ts is assumed to alter course with a constant r o t within a short period which is observed by the os there are two challenges of using r o t as an indicator to do the conflict evolution analysis one challenge is that r o t is currently not a reliable parameter due to the fact that r o t indicator is usually not connected to the ais transponder mestl et al 2016 the second challenge is the quality represented in ais data in this work r o t is calculated from the course in ais data due to the influence of the external environment such as the wind and current a change of ts s course may be not for conflict elimination a more reliable method of the reconstruction of r o t from the ship s heading is needed third the threshold τ 1 and τ 2 to divide the different levels of os s amm are set as 80 and 60 respectively which is however subjective higher thresholds lead to more frequent alerts including many unnecessary or false alerts lower thresholds however may omit some important alerts therefore the determination of thresholds for the division of the different levels of os s amm still needs to be more precise many risk indicators analysis methods can help this goerlandt and kujala 2014 zhang et al 2019 2020 this is also a direction for future work finally the proposed cas has only been demonstrated in a limited number of test scenarios to show its rationale and feasibility more elaborate testing both with simulated scenarios encounters from historic ais data and ultimately in realistic environments with human operators should be performed this is essential for instance to determine the appropriate domain sizes and threshold settings striking a balance between the number of alerts and their actually perceived need 5 3 2 rule conflict in the multi vessel encounter the threat of the os s ship domain being violated is possible from more than one ship in high traffic density areas however most of the existing research about conflict elimination focuses only two ship encounter scenario huang and van gelder 2019c the multi vessel encounters are usually regarded as a linear superposition of multiple ship pair encounters for instance many works have been done to help the own ship to detect the most immediate danger ship brcko 2018 and determine the optimal course alteration maneuver szlapczynski 2007 2008 further the multi vessel encounter situation is not directly included in the colregs rules but relies on the knowledge and experience of the navigator in interpreting the situation based on the colreg rules for pairwise encounters brcko 2018 some work utilizes a traffic complexity van westrenen and ellerbroek 2015 or cooperative game approach liu et al 2019 to measure the global collision risk in multi vessel encounters however none of these considers the colregs nevertheless two critical issues in the multi vessel encounter situation need future work first the conflict between the own ship and other target ships are assessed separately while the conflict between target ships are currently not considered this issue may lead to an inaccurate understanding of the action intention of the target ship ship 1 s abnormal action in multi vessel encounter scenario in section 4 2 reveals this issue for the ship pair encounter between ship1 and ship2 there is no conflict between ship1 and ship2 at the beginning while ship1 s turning to port causes a conflict the motivation of this apparently abnormal action from ship1 can be interpreted by also considering the conflict between ship1 and ship3 from this it can be understood that the action by ship 1 aims to eliminate the conflict with ship3 the maritime traffic system is characterized by a complex interaction between ship human and environment and therefore the multi vessel encounter needs to be considered as a whole second little of research considers the rule conflicts where a vessel can have two identities simultaneously e g stand on and give way vessel for different vessels in a multi vessel encounter situation however in dense traffic areas this issue is not rare for the multi vessel encounter scenarios as described in section 4 2 ship3 is the stand on ship for the encounter with ship1 and ship3 is the give way ship for the encounter with ship2 from fig 16 it is seen that ship3 s actions are more complicated ship3 acts more frequently and takes a longer time to eliminate the conflicts ship 3 s action needs to comply with the colregs hence ship3 should not only give way to ship2 but also needs to fulfil her action obligation as a stand on ship to ship1 further ship3 s action should avoid making the situation worse ship3 s uncoordinated action may make ship1 s evasive actions ineffective however this work does not directly provide collision avoidance solutions in current circumstance the related information of rule conflict is notified to the os in the stand on position while the solution of which still needs navigator s decision consequently it is important to conduct an analysis of rule conflict to further improve the possibility of ships passing safely with each other 6 conclusions the effective response from the stand on ship helps prevent the occurrence of dangerous encounters and even ship collision when the give way ship does not act properly however the colregs rules do not provide specific guidance for the stand on ship although ship collision alert is a plausible way to alert the ship of a collision hazard in a timely fashion by reminding the ship operator of her action duties there is a lack of research focusing on alerting the stand on ship to compensate the give way ship s inappropriate actions therefore this article has proposed a cas from the stand on ship perspective to trigger the stand on ship s involvement in the conflict elimination by quantifying the terms of the colregs regarding the stand on ship s responsibility for conflict elimination the conflict severity is divided into 9 classes with the os s amm considered these classes are linked with the 4 stages of the encounter process and 4 alert levels this helps the stand on ship accurately understand her action responsibilities and clarify the corresponding alert level the results of several case studies demonstrate that the proposed method is feasible to support the stand on ship in making action decisions for conflict elimination this may contribute to the reduction of collisions caused by misinterpretations of the colregs by navigators the dynamic nature and uncertainty of ship actions are also considered in this proposed method to make the conflict assessment more accurate and reliable nonetheless several issues require further improvement the first is the determination of several critical parameters including the shape and size of ship domain r o t and threshold between different levels of os s amm these require further research to increase the universality and reliability of this proposed method the second is that multi vessel encounters need to be considered as a whole rather than a linear superposition of multiple ship pair encounters in particular rule conflicts where vessels can have two identities and opposing action requirements simultaneously is not rare especially in density water area this issue requires new research to find new alternatives for improving the possibility of ships passing safely with each other credit authorship contribution statement lei du conceptualization methodology data curation writing original draft writing review editing visualization formal analysis

21295,bridge alarms are a plausible way to reduce the ship collision probability by timely alerting the officer on watch of a conflict however there currently are no dedicated methods for alerting a stand on ship to compensate the unawareness of or inactive response of a give way ship to dangerous encounter situations therefore this article proposes a collision alert system from the stand on ship perspective to trigger the stand on ship s involvement in the conflict elimination the developed method quantifies the terms of the colregs regarding the stand on ship s responsibility for conflict elimination the conflict severity is divided into 9 classes based on the ship intention estimation conflict evolution analysis and colregs scrutiny these are linked with the 4 stages of the encounter process to helps stand on ship clarify her action responsibilities as per the rules and classify the alert into four levels the available maneuvering margin of the stand on ship is considered to improve the accuracy of severity ranking the results of several case studies in open water with good visibility indicate that the proposed method can support the stand on ship to correctly understand the rules and to fulfil her duties keywords collision alert system stand on ship colregs intention estimation conflict evolution analysis available maneuvering margin 1 introduction the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colregs 1972 consists of various rules for instructing the navigators on how to act under different encounter scenarios 56 of major maritime collision includes violation of colregs statheros et al 2008 correctly understanding and following the rules in colregs is important for passing safely however the colregs rules do not provide specific guidance in actual operation hilgert and baldauf 1997 du et al 2020b especially for the stand on ship under the conflict threat du et al 2020a hence a contextual appreciation is required by the officers on watch based on which the actions of conflict resolution are enacted according to colregs the obligation of give way ship is relatively explicit and constant when the collision risk exists the give way ship is required to act early and sufficiently however the responsibilities of the stand on ship vary at different stages moreover there currently are no clear guidelines to delineate each encounter stage for the stand on ship dangerous encounters and even ship collisions where misinterpretations of the colregs rules by navigators of the stand on ship are not rare the accident report of china maritime safety administration 2018 and maib 2015 and 2019 can attest this the stand on ship s action helps prevent dangerous encounters while the role of the stand on ship is not often considered du et al 2020a considerable research has been dedicated to quantifying the colregs for eliminating conflict johansen et al 2016 szlapczynski and krata 2018 nonetheless most of these strategies are designed from the give way ship perspective only or without distinguishing the stand on ship or the give way ship du et al 2020a it is therefore important to conduct conflict analysis on the activation of the stand on ship s role in conflict elimination to improve safe conflict resolution of ships encountering one another accurately grasping the current encounter stage and understanding its corresponding obligations are the prerequisites for the stand on ships to take appropriate actions in compliance with colregs ship collision alert helps alert the ship of a collision hazard timely rather than directly proposing collision avoidance maneuvers in the current circumstance szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017a the development of collision alert systems cas has attracted significant attention in the maritime domain baldauf et al 2011 menon et al 2013 simsir et al 2014 goerlandt et al 2015 szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017a rizogiannis and thomopoulos 2019 gil et al 2020 however these existing works do not consider the difference of the identity of the ship such as the stand on ship or give way ship as specified in the colregs furthermore many works aim to find the critical condition that alerts the ship to take evasive action beyond this critical condition a collision cannot be avoidable such as last time to take action zhuo and tang 2008 minimum distance to collision montewka et al 2010 2014 and last line of defence baldauf et al 2017 some works have considered colregs for encounter categorization but few of them has distinguished the responsibilities of ships at different stages of the encounter especially for the stand on ship a stand on ship acting too early may violate rule 17 of the colregs while a stand on ship acting too late but before this critical condition has fewer maneuver options besides the available maneuvering margin amm of a ship is not considered in existing studies of alerting the ship of a collision hazard the amm represents the ship s capability to avoid ship collision a higher amm means that the ship has more space and time to execute a collision avoidance maneuver and hence a higher chance to eliminate a dangerous encounter the lack of knowledge of a vessel s amm may lead to inaccurate detection of actual danger huang and van gelder 2019a b huang et al 2019c considered the capability of a ship to prevent ship collision when measuring the ship collision risk in dense water area however the colregs are not considered in that work the stand on ship has an important role in conflict elimination during dangerous encounters quantifying her action responsibilities at different encounter stages in compliance with colregs is a first step to develop a cas targeted for vessels in a stand on situation furthermore the amm of a ship is an important factor to consider for accurately estimating the risk given the above the primary aim of this work is to propose a cas from the stand on ship s perspective by answering what is the action obligation of a stand on ship at different encounter stages our work alerts the ship of a collision hazard timely rather than directly proposing collision avoidance maneuvers this cas furthermore quantifies the action responsibility of the stand on ship at different encounter stages in compliance with colregs the amm is considered to improve the accuracy of ranking the collision risk besides the influence of the own ship on the decision of the target ships is considered this work contributes to the construction of stand on ship as second line of defense slod du et al 2020a and contains 1 a proposed method for classification of conflict severity and the clarification of stand on ship s action responsibility at each different conflict level 2 the design of a collision alert system to support the stand on ship to accurately understand the current conflict state and her corresponding action responsibilities and 3 the application of the proposed method to specific case studies concerning open sea navigation with good visibility the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 focuses on the quantitative analysis of the conflict process including quantifying encounter stages conflict severity and alert level section 3 elaborates on the design of the ship collision alert system from the stand on ship perspective section 4 presents the case study to demonstrate the feasibility of this proposed method a discussion and some recommendations for future research are provided in section 5 section 6 concludes the list of the notations and abbreviations are also given in table 1 and table 2 respectively in the appendix 2 quantitative analysis of conflict process developing an approach for quantitatively describing the conflict process is a precondition for the construction of cas for alerting the stand on ship to act properly in compliance with colregs this includes quantifying alert levels at different encounter stages and quantifying conflict severity which are elaborated in section 2 1 and section 2 2 respectively 2 1 quantifying alert levels at different encounter stages 2 1 1 relevant rules in colregs rule 11 mentioned that rules from 12 to 18 apply to vessels in sight of one another rule 15 concerns the action rule in crossing situation the give way ship should avoid crossing ahead of the other vessel if the circumstances of the case admit rule 17 focuses on the action by the stand on ship it can be interpreted as follows i the stand on ship is not allowed to maneuver when the risk exists unless one of the following two conditions is met ii the stand on ship is permitted to maneuver if the give way ship does not act appropriately in compliance with these rules in particular rule 8 13 14 and 15 iii the stand on ship is required to maneuver when the collision cannot be avoided by the action of the give way vessel alone rule 18 determines the responsibilities between different types of vessels for instance a power driven vessel underway shall keep out of the way of a vessel engaged in fishing 2 1 2 quantifying encounter stages the rules addressed in section 2 1 1 design three protective layers for ships to prevent collisions three protective layers which are illustrated in fig 1 are concluded by du et al 2020a as give way ship as first line of defense flod stand on ship as second line of defense slod and both ships as third line of defense tlod in fig 1 the green color means no conflict and none of flod slod and tlod is activated yellow orange and red color represents the activation of flod slod and tlod respectively flod is activated by the occurrence of ship conflict specifically when there is a conflict between a ship pair the give way ship is required to act when the slod is activated by the rule 17 ii the stand on ship is permitted to act for conflict elimination while the obligation of the give way ship does not vanish since the flod is activated when the encounter situation goes worse that the conflict cannot be avoided by the give way ship s action alone see rule 17 iii tlod is activated where both ships are required to act by colregs based on the order of activation of three protective layers a conflict process can be divided into four stages fig 2 the conflict severity increases from stage 1 to stage 4 in stage 1 there is no conflict existing period both of ship pair has unrestricted action hence the flod slod and tlod are inactive in stage 2 a conflict emerges the stand on ship shall maintain her course and speed and the give way ship is required to act to eliminate the conflict hence only flod is activated in stage 3 a conflict develops as it is evident that the give way ship does not act properly according to colregs the obligation of the give way ship is to act while that of the stand on ship is action permitted hence both flod and slod are activated in stage 4 a conflict escalates so that it cannot be eliminated by the give way ship s action alone thus both ship pair are required to act for passing safely and therefore the flod slod and tlod are activated 2 1 3 quantifying alert levels in line with the imo 2007 recommendations imo 2007 four levels of alert are adopted which are then linked to these four encounter stages the alert level at stage 4 is alarm to indicate navigators on the stand on ship that the action is required immediately for the conflict elimination marked as red color in fig 2 the alert level at stage 3 is warning to indicate navigators on the stand on ship that the action is permitted for the conflict elimination as the dangerous situation may develop if no action is taken marked as orange color in fig 2 the alert level at stage 2 is caution to indicate navigators on the stand on ship that no action is allowed but attention and special consideration of the current situation are required due to the existing conflict marked as yellow color in fig 2 the alert level at stage 1 is safe as the ship pair can pass safely posing no action restriction on each other marked as green color in fig 2 2 2 quantifying conflict severity 2 2 1 conflict concept and measurements the conflict is defined as a situation of near collision which has great potential to be a collision lei et al 2017 a conflict can be measured when a restricted area around one ship is projected to be violated by another vessel wang 2010 weng and xue 2015 the elliptical ship domain is selected to describe the restricted area around one ship as it is the most realistic one based on empirical data hansen et al 2013 the major radius of elliptical ship domain is four times of the ship length and its minor radius is 1 6 times of the ship length fujii and tanaka 1971 hence the conflict is determined by checking whether one ship remaining her current course and speed is projected to violate the elliptical domain around the other ship 2 2 2 conflict severity 2 2 2 1 concept and measurements the conflict severity corresponds to the nearness to an accident which relates to how close this interaction is to be an accident du et al 2020b a conflict with higher severity implies more similarity to an accident to support the stand on ship to read the hazardous situation and understand her responsibility the severity of the conflict is measured according to the interpretation of rule 17 in colregs in particular the action responsibilities of the stand on ship in each encounter stage are in focus further to measure the conflict severity more accurately the amm for a ship to eliminate the conflict is also considered accordingly the conflict severity can be quantitatively subdivided by evaluating 1 whether a conflict exists 2 whether the give way ship is aware of the exiting conflict 3 whether the conflict can be eliminated by the give way ship s action alone 4 whether the amm of the stand on ship is sufficient and 5 whether the give way ship s action violates the colregs these are determined by five aspects respectively 1 conflict detection 2 intention estimation of the give way ship 3 action quality aq assessment of the give way ship 4 amm calculation of the stand on ship and 5 colregs scrutiny of the give way ship conflict detection is elaborated in section 3 3 where ic denotes the index of conflict ic 1 if a conflict exists otherwise ic is 0 intention estimation of the give way ship is elaborated in section 3 4 through an index denoted int int 1 means that the give way ship is aware of the exiting conflict and acts int 0 means that the give way ship is not aware of the exiting conflict or at least that it does not act in accordance with the colregs for the give way ship s aq assessment two categories are used positive evasive action and negative evasive action its index is a q a q 1 means the give way ship takes positive evasive action and a q 1 means the give way ship takes negative evasive action more details are in section 3 5 1 definition 1 positive evasive action is the action from one ship that can effectively eliminate the potential conflict without additional assistance from the other ship definition 2 negative evasive action refers to an action of a ship that cannot eliminate the potential conflict with or without additional assistance from the other ship amm calculation is elaborated in section 3 5 2 and its index is a m m it is divided into three classes high h medium m and low l colregs scrutiny is denoted with the index col see section 3 6 col 1 means the give way ship s action obeys the colregs col 0 means that the give way ship s action violates colregs 2 2 2 2 conflict severity classification the conflict severity cs is refined into 9 classes the conditions measurements and alert level of each class are specified in table 1 own ship os is the stand on ship and target ship ts is the give way ship from cs1 to cs9 the conflict severity increases stage 1 contains cs1 the condition of cs1 is no conflict there is no action limitation for the os as flod slod and tlod are inactivated the alert level is safe stage 2 contains cs2 and cs3 conflict generates and only the flod is activated the os s action obligation is not allowed the alert level is caution rule 17a i for cs2 1 ts is aware of the existing conflict 2 ts takes positive evasive action and 3 ts s action complies with the colregs for cs3 1 ts is aware of this existing conflict 2 ts s action complies with colregs 3 ts takes negative evasive action and 4 the amm of os is high stage 3 contains 4 classes of conflict severity including cs4 cs5 cs6 and cs7 in stage 3 the flod and slod are activated and os is permitted to act this alert level is warning rule 17a ii for cs4 1 ts is aware of this existing conflict 2 ts takes positive evasive action and 3 this action violates the rule 15 in colregs cs5 is similar to cs3 except that the amm of the os is medium for cs6 the ts is not aware of the existing conflict but the amm of os is high cs7 is similar to cs6 but amm of the os is medium stage 4 contains cs8 and cs9 the flod slod and tlod are activated and the os is required to act the alert level is alarm rule 17b cs8 is similar to cs3 and cs5 but the amm of the os is low cs9 is similar to cs6 and cs7 but the amm of the os is low 2 2 2 3 multi vessel encounter scenarios this work is to alert the stand on ship of a collision hazard timely however the determination of the collision avoidance manoeuvres in the current circumstance still needs navigator s involvement our method provides assistance to the navigator in multi encounter situations through analyzing the encounter process between ship pairs the navigator can clearly understand her action obligations and the corresponding risk levels at different encounter stages for different vessels it is then up to the navigator to interpret this information and take the appropriate action the multi vessel encounter is divided into several ship pair encounters and conflict between the own ship and other target ships are assessed separately as the multi vessel encounter is more complicated the following aspects are clarified 1 alert sequence the alert level determines the alert sequence the higher level alert has a higher priority the level of alert is divided into four levels safe caution warning and alarm according to the different collision risk levels table 1 therefore the alert sequence ranks from high to low is alarm warning caution and safe the nine levels of conflict severity from cs1 to cs9 are used within the cas to reveal the cause leading to the current encounter situation this helps clarify the action obligation as per the rules for instance a ship encounters with two ships and os is in the stand on position see fig 3 a the encounter risk between os and ts1 is cs3 while that between os and ts2 is cs8 the alert level of cs3 is caution and that of cs8 is alarm the alert level of this situation is determined as warning if the levels of the alert for different vessels are the same the alert sequences are the same regardless of whether the levels of the conflict severity are the same or different if the encounter risk between os and ts1 is cs4 and that between os and ts2 is cs6 see fig 3 a the alerts of cs4 and cs6 are warning and they have an equal alert level 2 action responsibilities there are two possible situations where a ship has different collision avoidance responsibilities see fig 3 one is that the ship has different collision avoidance responsibilities but with the same identity as shown in fig 3 a os is the stand on ship for both the ship pair encounters between os and ts1 and between os and ts2 if the os has different collision avoidance responsibilities the principle is highest risk first if the encounter risk between os and ts1 is cs3 action not allowed while that between os and ts2 is cs8 action required the os is required to take evasive action another is the rule conflict where a vessel can have two identities simultaneously e g stand on and give way vessel for different vessels as shown in fig 3 b os is give way ship encountering with ts1 meanwhile os is the stand on ship encountering with ts2 the os is required to act when the conflict between os and ts1 exists if the collision risk is cs3 between os and ts2 simultaneously the os is required to keep her current course and speed under this situation the higher level of action obligation has a higher priority hence this cas informs that the os is required to act and the alert level is alarm 3 methodology 3 1 structure of cas from stand on ship perspective fig 4 illustrates how the cas supports the stand on ship in understanding the encounter stage and her action responsibility du et al 2020a when the os encounters a ts in which os is in the stand on position the following five steps are triggered and repeated continuously during the encounter 1 conflict detection if there is no conflict os has no action limitation if a conflict exists then 2 the ts s intention estimation is performed if the ts is aware of the existing conflict 3 the ts s aq is assessed and 4 the colregs is referred afterwards 5 the os s amm calculation is performed if the ts is not aware of the existing conflict the ts s action is negative and violates the colregs hence only 5 the os s amm is calculated finally the proposed cas from the stand on ship perspective provides her action obligation and alert level to support stand on ship s decision making the step 1 2 have been done in previous work du et al 2020a therefore the remaining steps including step 3 4 5 are the focus of this work 3 2 algorithm design of cas from stand on ship perspective the algorithm of utilizing cas from the stand on ship perspective to clarify the encounter stage os s action obligation and alert level is designed in fig 5 os is the stand on ship the inputs for this method are the traffic safety related information of this ship pair involving into conflict the identity of two ships are determined according to their relative course and relative position goerlandt et al 2015 this cas is activated only if os is the stand on ship for os the planned trajectory p t o s x y t speed v o s t and course c o s t are known her maneuverability turning ability index k and turning lag index t nomoto et al 1956 is also explicit from the os s perspective the historical and current motion data of ts including position p t s x y t speed v t s t and course c t s t can be obtained through ais receiver the outputs of the cas are the action obligation of os unrestricted not allowed permitted required and alert level safe caution warning alarm this module links 9 classes of conflict severity with the 4 encounter stages in accordance to colregs based on the logic presented in table 1 this designed algorithm contains three main sub modules conflict detection module detects the conflict between the ship pair give way ship s intention estimation module estimates the intention of the action that is taken by the ts conflict evolution analysis module assesses ts s aq and calculates os s amm and refers to the rules in colregs each module is elaborated from section 3 3 to 3 5 3 3 conflict detection module the velocity obstacle vo projects the spatiotemporal relationship between a ship pair involved in an encounter situation into one ship s velocity domain based on this the conflict can be judged by checking whether the velocity of the ship falls into this velocity obstacle zone huang et al 2018 chen et al 2018 the non linear velocity obstacles nl vo algorithm considers the dynamic nature of ship action during the whole encounter process huang et al 2018 2019a du et al 2020a 2019 therefore the nl vo algorithm is selected for the conflict assessment step 1 in figs 4 and 5 in fig 6 the ts s velocity space is divided into three segments by a velocity obstacle zone namely s1 the area in red s2 the grid area in yellow and s3 the grid area in blue the ts s velocity in the s1 segment will lead to conflict with os in the future in the figure an example velocity v t s 1 indicates this however if the ts s velocity is not in the s1 segment such as v t s 2 in s2 and v t s 3 in s3 the ship pair can pass safely the difference between ts s velocity in s2 and s3 is elaborated in section 3 6 therefore the conflict can be detected 1 i c t 0 1 i f rv v t s t 0 s n l v o t 0 ϕ 0 else where s n l v o t 0 is the velocity obstacle zone at current moment t 0 in ts s velocity space see fig 6 the formula derivation process is elaborated in huang et al 2017 rv v t s t 0 is ts s reachable ship velocity which is determined by her current velocity v t s t 0 and her turning ability see du et al 2020a if the ts s reachable ship velocity rv v t s t 0 has a non empty intersection with the nl vo set s n l v o t 0 a conflict exists fig 5 otherwise there is no conflict see cs1 in table 1 3 4 ts s intention estimation module in du et al 2020a ship intention is defined as the motivation of the actions that is taken by the ship aimed at attaining certain navigational objectives such as accident avoidance and route following the ship intention of ts during the encounter process is classified as normal navigation and evasive action du et al 2020a these can be distinguished by checking whether the conflict exists when the ship action changes there is an assumption here that the course alteration is the only way used to eliminate conflict the ts s intention can be estimated step 2 in figs 4 and 5 2 i n t t 0 1 i f i c t 0 1 δ c t s t 0 0 0 otherwise where i n t t 0 1 means that the ts is aware of the conflict and alters her course for conflict elimination δ c t s t 0 is the course change of ts the examples of the cs2 and cs3 indicate this see fig 5 and table 1 i n t t 0 0 means that ts is not aware of the exiting conflict or at least that it does not act in accordance with the colregs such as the cs6 and cs7 as indicated in fig 5 and table 1 3 5 conflict evolution analysis conflict evolution analysis checks whether the exiting conflict can be eliminated by ts s adopted action with or without additional assistance from os the colregs is scrutinized to check whether ts s action violates the colregs ts s aq assessment step 3 in figs 4 and 5 ts s colregs scrutiny step 4 in figs 4 and 5 and os s amm calculation step 5 in figs 4 and 5 are the main component of the conflict evolution analysis for the condition that ts is not aware of the existing conflict only os s amm is calculated to specify the action obligation of os for the condition that ts is aware of the existing conflict there are two possible results of ts s aq assessment if ts is found to take positive evasive action only colregs scrutiny is needed afterwards to distinguish whether os s action obligation is not allowed or permitted otherwise if the ts takes negative evasive action the os s amm calculation is needed to determine os s obligation action permitted or action required 3 5 1 ts s aq assessment ts s aq is assessed by checking whether the conflict can be eliminated by ts s adopted action alone learning from earlier work zhuo and tang 2008 montewka et al 2014 there is a critical state that a conflict can be eliminated by ts s evasive action alone if the ts acts before a certain critical point here assumptions are that the ts only alters the course for conflict elimination and the rate of turn r o t t of the ts remains unchanged within a certain time therefore this critical state for the ts can be defined from the spatial scales as follows 3 min d i s t s min d i s p o s t p t s t min d i s p o s t e n d p t s t e n d r p t s t δ t p t s t v t s t cos c t s t r o t t δ t sin c t s t r o t t δ t δ t r o t t c t s t c t s t δ t δ t where min d i s t s is the critical state for ts in spatial scales d i s p o s t p t s t is the relative distance between a ship pair when the ts starts to maneuver at time t v t s t is the magnitude of ts s speed the min d i s p o s t e n d p t s t e n d is the minimum distance between the os s trajectory p o s black color line with arrow in fig 7 and the ts s predicted trajectory p t s blue color dotted line with arrow in fig 7 after t os s trajectory p o s is known the os predicts ts s trajectory p t s based on the ts s constant r o t t that is observed by os therefore ts s aq can be classified as follows 4 a q t 0 1 i f d i s p o s t 0 p t s t 0 min d i s t s 1 otherwise where a q t 0 1 means ts takes positive evasive action see definition 1 in section 2 2 2 1 the cs2 and cs4 are the examples indicating this see table 1 and fig 5 a q t 0 1 means ts takes negative evasive action see definition 2 in section 2 2 2 1 the cs3 and cs5 are the situation that the ts takes negative evasive action see table 1 and fig 5 3 5 2 colregs scrutiny as specified in rule 15 in colregs the give way ship should avoid crossing ahead of the other vessel in crossing encounter situation this can be assessed using the nl vo algorithm 5 c o l 1 if v t s s 2 0 if v t s s 3 where c o l 1 means the ts s evasive action obeys the colregs while c o l 0 means the evasive action of the give way ship violates the colregs in fig 6 if the ts s velocity falls in zone s2 there is no conflict between os and ts the os will pass the closest point of approach cpa earlier than the ts hence the ts s evasive action is in compliance with the colregs see the cs2 in table 1 if ts s velocity is in zone s3 the conflict can be eliminated by ts s evasive action alone but the ts s evasive action violates rule 15 in colregs as this leads the ts to pass the os ahead of its bow see cs4 in table 1 details of the proof of this are shown in appendix a in huang et al 2018 3 5 3 os s amm calculation as course alteration is the most used and most effective way for ship conflict elimination baldauf et al 2017 the os is assumed to only alter her course with velocity unchanged to eliminate the conflict the change of ship heading after rudder steering is determined by the ship s maneuverability the nomoto model nomoto et al 1956 a simplification of maneuvering modeling group mmg model is commonly used to describe ship maneuverability because it only requires limited inputted parameters in comparison with abkowitz model zhang and zou 2011 and mmg model tao et al 2019 therefore the nomoto model nomoto et al 1956 is adopted to calculate the os s available velocity after steering du et al 2020a 6 r v o s δ v o s t cos c o s t 0 ϕ δ sin c o s t 0 ϕ δ ϕ δ t r d t k δ t t t e t t where r v o s δ is the os s reachable velocity after steering with a demanded rudder angle δ with 35 δ 35 ϕ δ is the change of ship heading based on her turning ability with a demanded rudder angle δ r is the corresponding yaw rate the os s turning ability index k and turning lag index t vary with ship length and velocity under a demanded rudder angle δ the conflict can be eliminated if the os s velocity can be moved out from the ts s velocity obstacle zone according to the nl vo algorithm 7 i c δ 1 i f v o s t r v o s δ v o s t s n l v o t ϕ 0 o t h e r w i s e here i c δ 1 means that at least one ship speed inside her available speed set r v o s δ is outside the velocity obstacle zone s n l v o t therefore the conflict can be eliminated by the os s maneuver with a demanded rudder angle δ i c δ 0 means that the conflict cannot be eliminated with this maneuver for the calculation of ts s velocity obstacle zone s n l v o t the ts is assumed to keep her current motion state specifically if i n t t 0 0 ts is assumed to sail in a straight line with constant speed see the red dotted line in fig 7 if i n t t 0 1 the ts s trajectory is predicted based on the observed r o t t see the blue dotted line in fig 7 the amm is measured based on the proportion of maneuvers by which the os can eliminate potential conflicts to all its available maneuvers huang et al 2019c 8 a m m t h if δ s t δ a t τ 1 i c δ s t 1 m if τ 1 δ s t δ a t τ 2 i c δ s t 1 l if δ s t δ a t τ 2 i c δ s t 1 where δ s is the value of the adopted rudder angle that makes i c δ 1 δ a is all os s available rudder angle and 35 δ a 35 τ 1 and τ 2 are the thresholds to divide the amm into three classes high h medium m and low l cs3 is the example of a m m t h cs5 and cs8 are the examples of a m m t m and a m m t l respectively see table 1 τ 1 and τ 2 are set as 80 and 60 respectively 4 case study two groups of case studies are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method the first group includes four simulated two ship encounters shown in section 4 1 the second group consists of one multi vessel encounter extracted from historical ais data shown in section 4 2 4 1 two ship encounters based on simulations 4 1 1 encounter scenarios design rules 11 to 18 in the colregs only apply to vessels in sight of one another four crossing encounter scenarios in good visibility between a ship pair are designed as the analyzed context the stand on ship is set as the os 4 1 1 1 ship attributes for the os the ship length l o s is 100m the change interval of rudder angle is 5 for the os s turning ability index k 2 v o s l o s and t 2 l o s v o s hong and yu 2000 for the ts its length l t s is 100m 4 1 1 2 sailing related ship motion data the earth fixed coordinate system o x y is adopted ox points to east and oy points to north ship course is the angle at which the ox axis rotates anticlockwise to the ship velocity the simulation time is 600s the time interval for updating the ship motion and the calculations for the cas are set as 10s the initial position p 0 of the os is 2000m 6000m the ts set initially in the origins of the axis system the magnitude of ship speed v is fixed as 5 m s the initial course c 0 of the os is 210 0 and that of the ts is 90 0 t t p is the designed turning time and c t p is the course change at the turning points c t p 0 means the ship turns to port the os will turn to port 30 0 at 100s for the ts due the uncertainty of ship action there are many possibilities for her action when there is a conflict chauvin and lardjane 2008 therefore four encounter scenarios are designed as shown in table 2 the differences between each scenario is the ts s action time and magnitude of course deviation in scenario 1 the ts sails a straight line in scenario 2 the ts turns to port 30 0 at 200s in scenario 3 the ts turns to starboard 40 0 at 200s in scenario 4 the ts turns to starboard 20 0 at 550s 4 1 2 results the results of these four designed encounter scenarios are elaborated from section 4 1 2 1 to section 4 1 2 4 the different colours indicate different levels of conflict severity and alert during different encounter stages green yellow orange and red represents safe caution warning and alarm respectively consistent with the color scheme in table 1 and fig 5 4 1 2 1 scenario 1 fig 8 is the visualization of ship conflict analysis in scenario 1 as developed in table 2 from the start of the simulation a conflict is present ts does not show any response when the conflict exists because the amm of the os is high before 566s in stage 3 the conflict severity is determined as cs6 fig 8 a this is in the stage 3 that the flod and slod are activated therefore the os s obligation is action permitted fig 8 b and the alert level is warning afterwards the amm of os decreases to medium from 566s to 581s so the conflict severity increases to cs7 in stage 3 where flod and slod are activated hence the os s obligation is still action permitted and the alert level is warning when the os s amm drops to low after 581s the conflict severity becomes even more serious reaching cs9 in stage 4 the flod slod and tlod are activated hence the os s obligation changes to action required the alert level is alarm 4 1 2 2 scenario 2 fig 9 illustrates the result of conflict analysis in scenario 2 as developed in table 2 before the ts s action at 200s the level of conflict severity is cs6 fig 9 a which means that the ts does not act but os s amm is high this is in stage 3 where flod and slod are activated therefore the os s obligation is action permitted and alert level is warning fig 9 b the ts takes evasive action at 200s after the ship steers to turn with a demanded rudder the r o t increases gradually and stables at its peak the observed r o t at 206s does not reach its peak at 206s the conflict cannot be eliminated with ts s action alone while the os s amm is still high therefore the level of conflict severity falls to cs3 at 206s this is in stage 2 with only the flod activated the os s obligation is action not allowed and the alert level is caution at 211s the observed r o t stables at its peak the conflict is expected to be eliminated by ts s positive evasive action however this evasive action violates rule 15 in colregs because the ts is expected to cross the os by its bow v t s s 3 consequently the level of conflict severity increases to cs4 at 211s fig 9 a the flod and slod are activated in stage 3 the os s obligation is action permitted and the alert level is warning fig 9 b with this evasive action the ts successfully moves her velocity outside the vo zone at 226s thus the conflict is eliminated at 226s afterwards the level of conflict severity falls back to cs1 fig 9 a in stage 1 so that the os can move unrestricted with the alert level being safe fig 9 b 4 1 2 3 scenario 3 fig 10 shows the results of scenario 3 as indicated in table 2 from the onset of the simulation to 200s a conflict exists and the ts shows no response the conflict severity is cs6 as os s amm is high the flod and slod are activated in stage 3 fig 10 a therefore the os s obligation is action permitted and the alert level is warning fig 10 b the ts turns to starboard at 200s after the ship turns with a demanded rudder the r o t increases gradually and stabilized at its peak around 211s with the ts s maneuver the conflict severity falls from cs6 to cr3 at 206s and to cr2 at 211s the encounter stage changes from stage 3 to stage 2 the conflict is expected to be eliminated by ts s positive and legal evasive action alone during this period only the flod is activated indicating that the os s obligation is action not allowed and the alert level is caution fig 10 b from 231s onwards the conflict between os and ts3 is eliminated hence the conflict severity is marked as cs1 the flod slod and tlod are inactivate the os can move unrestricted and the alert level is safe consequently the ts s action is positive and legal 4 1 2 4 results of scenario 4 fig 11 presents the evolution of the conflict severity between the os and ts in scenario 4 as indicated in table 2 fig 11 a and the change in the os s obligation during the whole encounter process fig 11 b the conflict severity is cs6 at the beginning of the simulation time before the ts s right turn at 550s it remains in cs6 in stage 3 the flod and slod are activated the os s obligation is action permitted with the alert level at warning the ts starts to change her course from 550s the conflict severity increases to cr8 from 556s as the ts s action is not efficient to eliminate the existing conflict and the amm of the os is low see table 1 and fig 5 this is in the stage 4 where the flod slod and tlod are activated hence the os s obligation is action required and the alert level is alarm fig 11 b after the ts finishes the steering and stabilizes at the designed new course around 586s the ts keeps sailing in a straight line with a constant course as the conflict still exists and the ship pair keeps approaching the conflict severity becomes more serious increasing to cs9 at 586 in stage 4 the flod slod and tlod are activated the os s obligation is action required and the alert level is alarm 4 2 multi vessels encounter based on ais data 4 2 1 encounter scenario description fig 12 visualizes the ship trajectories involved in a multi vessels encounter which was happened in the north atlantic du et al 2020a ship1 is a smaller oil tanker with 96m in length its trjectory is marked in blue in fig 12 ship2 is a fishing vessel with 23m in length with its trajectory marked in red ship3 is a larger oil tanker with 171m in length its trajectory being marked in black the discrete points indicate the historical trajectories of these three ships based on historic ais data after processing the lines linking these points are the ship trajectories after linear interpolation based on the ais data 4 2 2 results fig 13 illustrates the time periods during a conflict exists between each ship pair for the encounter between ship1 and ship2 there are two periods in which a conflict exists ranging from 661s to 721s and from 881s to 911s similarly the collision risk for the encounter between ship1 and ship3 exists between 501s and 531s and between 931s and 941s the time of collision risk existing between ship2 and ship3 is also not consecutive containing four periods from the start to 31s from 431s to 481s from 521s to 591s and from 821s to 1391s the results of ship conflict analysis between different ship pair in multi vessel encounter scenario are elaborated in section 4 2 2 1 4 2 2 2 and 4 2 2 3 respectively the thick line is the trajectory of the os and the thin line is that of the ts the different colours on the os s trajectory indicate different levels of alert during different encounter stages which are consistent with the color set in table 1 and fig 5 the color on the ts s trajectory is the same as that on the os to indicate their relative position 4 2 2 1 ship pair encounter berween ship1 and ship2 ship2 is the stand on ship according to rule 18 in the colregs the ship2 is set as os the results are illustrated in fig 14 before 661s there is no conflict between ship1 and ship2 see fig 14 the conflict severity is cs1 in stage 1 hence the flod slod and tlod are inactive the os can move unrestricted and the alert level is safe however due to the ts s action during this period such as at 441s and 521s for the conflict between ts and ship3 a conflict between os and ts is generated from 661s afterwards ts s evasive action between 661s and 671s is positive however this evasive action violates the colregs so that the conflict severity is cs4 in stage 3 during this period flod and slod are activated therefore that os s obligation is action permitted and the alert level is warning as the ts takes positive and legal evasive action from 671s to 701s the conflict severity decreases to cs2 and only flod is activated hence the os s obligation is action not allowed and the alert level is caution finally with the ts s continous evasive action the conflict between the os and ts is eliminated already from 701s the conflict severity between 701s and 881s is cs1 in stage 1 the os can move unrestricted and the alert level is safe the ts turns to starboard to return to her planned trajectory during this period from 701s to 881s which re generates a conflict between os and ts this action leads the ts to pass the os ahead of its bow therefore the conflict severity increases to cs4 at 901s and this stage remains until 911s both flod and slod are activated hence the os s obligation is action permitted and the alert level is warning there is no conflict between the os and the ts after 911s the ts passes the os ahead of its bow around 2000s none of the flod slod and tlod are activated the os has no action restriction and the alert level is safe 4 2 2 2 ship pair encounter berween ship1 and ship3 ship3 is the stand on ship according to rule 15 and rule 18 in the colregs the ship3 is set as os the results are shown in fig 15 no conflict exists between os and ts before 501s the conflict severity is cs1 in stage 1 the flod slod and tlod are inactive hence the os can move unrestricted and the alert level is safe due to the course change of ts the conflict between os and ts occurs from 501s the ts acts positive and legal so that the existing conflict is expected to be eliminated by the ts s action alone the level of conflict severity is cs2 where only the flod is activated the os is not allowed to act and the alert level is caution this state remains until 521s from 521s to 531s the ts turns to port and the ts s action violates the rule 15 in the colregs the conflict severity increases to cs4 in stage 3 the flod and slod are activated the alert level is warning with the os being permitted to act from 531s to 931s there is no conflict the level of conflict severity returns to cs1 in stage1 so the os has no action restriction and the alert level is safe during this period the ts turns to starboard to return its original trajectory which results in the conflict regeneration from 931s to 941s the period between 931s and 941s is in stage 2 with a conflict severity of cs2 the ts takes positive and legal evasive action so that the existing conflict is expected to be eliminated by ts s action alone only the flod is activated the os is not allowed to act and the alert level is caution the conflict is eliminated at 941s afterwards the os has no action restrictions this is in stage 1 with a conflict severity of cs1 none of the flod slod and tlod are activated the alert level is safe 4 2 2 3 ship pair encounter berween ship2 and ship3 ship2 is the stand on ship according to rule 15 in the colregs the ship2 is set as os from fig 16 a it is seen that ts s action is more complicated the conflict occurs from the beginning because the ts does not act and the os s amm is high the conflict severity is cs6 in stage 3 before 21s the flod and slod are activated the os s obligation is action permitted and the alert level is warning the ts is aware of the existing conflict and starts to act from 21s from 21s to 31s the ts s action is positive and sufficient to eliminate the existing conflict however this action is illegal in the sense that the ts is expected to pass the os ahead of its bow the conflict severity in this period is cs4 in stage 3 the flod and slod are activated hence the os is permitted to act and the alert level is warning with the continuous evasive action of the ts the conflict is eliminated from 31s from 31s to 431s the conflict severity decreases to cs1 in stage 1 with the flod slod and tlod all inactivated the os has no action restriction if the ts keeps her current velocity and course she is expected to safely pass the os s bow the alert level is safe to comply with the colregs to pass the os by its abaft the ts turns to starboard which generates the conflict from 431s afterwards the ts turns to starboard intermittently which makes the encounter stage changes the ts acts continuously from 431s to 481s and from 521s to 591s leading the ts to pass the os safely ahead of its bow the conflict severity during this action period is cs4 which implies that the os is permitted ts to act with an alert level warning there is no conflict between 481s and 521s and between 521s and 821s which is cs1 in stage 1 during these two periods the flod slod and tlod all inactivated the os has no action restriction and alert level is safe ts s intermittent action from 591s to 821s regenerates the conflict since 821s before 921s ts s action is positive but illegal so the conflict severity during this action period is cs4 in stage 3 os is allowed to act and the alert level is warning there is no action taken by ts between 921s and 1111s however the os s amm is high during this period therefore the conflict severity is cs6 in stage 3 and the flod and slod are activated the os is allowed to act the alert level is warning from 1111s to 1171s the conflict severity decreases to cs3 as ts s action is negative but os s amm is high os is not allowed to act during this period and the laert level is caution the situation in the period between 1171s and 1361s is similar to that between 921s and 1111s the ts s turning to starboard at 1361s is positive and complies with colregs the ts is expected to pass abaft the os s abaft with current velocity unchanged during the period from 1361s to 1391s the conflict severity is cs2 which is in stage2 and only the flod is activated the os is not allowed to act the alert level is caution the conflict is completely eliminated from 1391s onwards and the ts s action is legal due to her cultivated turning to starboard the ts passes abaft the os s stern around 2550s afterwards the conflict severity is cs1 in stage 1 none of the flod slod and tlod are activated the os has no action restriction and the alert level is safe 5 discussion 5 1 features of the proposed method the proposed cas from the stand on ship s perspective aims at refining the terms of the colregs regarding the stand on ship s action obligation our method can 1 classify the conflict levels from stage 1 to stage 4 2 reveal the cause leading to the current encounter situation from cs1 to cs9 such as give way ship s positive but illegal evasive action and 3 clarify the stand on ship s action responsibilities from action unrestricted to action required this work helps support this ship s active involvement in conflict elimination through appropriately anticipating the developing situation improved situational awareness and better anticipation of developing dangerous situations may be conductive to reduce the probability of ship collision caused by the misinterpretations of the colregs rules by navigators of the stand on ship the proposed method of cas from the stand on ship perspective has the following features first this work quantifies the terms of the colregs regarding the stand on ship s action obligation according to the different action responsibilities for each ship as specified in colregs the encounter stage is divided in 4 stages correspondingly the conflict severity is subdivided into 9 levels to signify different cases apart from the regulation specified in colregs the classification of conflict severity is also determined with reference to the following two principles the first principle is that the situation is worse when the target ship is not aware of the existing risk compared with that when the ship is aware of it for instance cs9 is more dangerous than cs8 this can be supported by the evidence that a lack of situational awareness has been identified as a main contributing factor in ship collisions liu and wu 2004 gale and patraiko 2007 the second principle is that the risk is more serious when the ship has a limited number of maneuvering options for the navigator to eliminate the existing risk huang and van gelder 2019c hence the conflict severity of cs5 is higher than cs3 based on these subdividing the conflict severity into 9 levels is reasonable these 9 levels of encounter severity are made to distinguish cases in the calculation scheme to account for differences in situations afterwards these 9 levels of conflict severity are used to the division of alert levels this is to simplify the information to support the navigators to make action decision the output of this cas from the stand on ship perspective is the encounter stage the action obligation of the os in the stand on position and the alert level this information can help the navigator onboard the stand on ship compensates the give way ship s lack of or incorrect action in response to an evolving dangerous situation second the dynamic and uncertain nature of the action by the ts are considered in the conflict detection this work adopts the nl vo algorithm to detect the conflict between os and ts this is done instead of making the commonly made assumption that ships sail in a straight line with constant speed the determination of risk fully considers the influence of the os on the decision of the ts hence the application of the nl vo algorithm makes the conflict assessment more realistic and accurate du et al 2020a further the ts s action uncertainty is also considered in principle all possible give way ship s actions should be determined in making the stand on ship s conflict assessment this paper assumes that the give way ship adopts a course alteration strategy for eliminating the encounter risk this is in accordance with the observation done by baldauf et al 2017 therefore the reachable velocity of os is utilized to measure ts s action uncertainty third the amm of the os are considered when determining the conflict severity navigators with a risk taking attitude might accept some risky scenarios and act relatively late huang et al 2020 but this situation leaves a limited number of maneuvering options for the navigator however some navigators on board a stand on ship may illegally act to master the situation when the rule requires the ship to keep her course and speed chauvin and lardjane 2008 which leaves sufficient maneuvering options for the navigator but violates the rule 17 in colregs hence a lack of understanding of the amm of the ship to eliminate the risk may lead to inaccurate detection of a dangerous situation huang and van gelder 2019b therefore when determining the conflict severity the ease of eliminating the conflict should also be considered the amm of os is utilized to measure the capability of os to prevent collision for this reason the accuracy of ranking the conflict severity is improved 5 2 applications of the proposed method this work has the potential to be applied for various purposes under different encounter scenarios firstly it contributes to the autonomous shipping development autonomous ships need to be as safe as a manned counterpart operating in similar circumstances maritime uk 2018 xue et al 2019a b fan et al 2020 two reasons demonstrate this one is that this proposed method takes the colregs into consideration this helps the autonomous ship to understand the conventional ships action moreover the rules for autonomous ships need to be merged with colregs du et al 2020a second is that the amm of the os is considered the autonomous ship can accurately grasp not only the dangerous level of the approaching ships but also the difficulty of avoiding collisions having adequate information about navigational safety including the current encounter stage and her action obligation is important for the autonomous ships to make correct action decision for a safe pass secondly it can be applied in ship pair encounter scenarios and multi vessels encounter scenarios for a ship pair encounter the proposed cas from the stand on ship perspective can help os understand the encounter stage and clarify her action obligation the results of the case study in section 4 can demonstrate this however for a multi vessel encounter the collision avoidance between target ships may lead to own ship s inaccurate estimation of the target ship s intention performing aq assessment of ts1 step 3 in fig 4 can help reduce the impact on the accuracy of risk assessment that caused by this inaccurate ship intention estimation step 2 in fig 4 which is one of the focus of this work see fig 4 taking a three vessel encounter as an example including os ts1 and ts2 see fig 3 a os has the collision risk with ts1 and the collision risk between ts1 and ts2 exists os is the stand on ship if ts1 changes her action for the collision avoidance with ts2 the intention estimation of ts1 from os perspective is that ts1 is aware of the exiting conflict with os in this work there is an assumption that the intention of the action will affect the effect of avoiding collisions that produced by adopted action if ts1 is aware of the collision hazard but ts1 s aq is negative the conflict severity is cs5 if ts1 is not aware of the collision hazard and ts1 s aq is negative the conflict severity is cs6 or cs7 see table 1 cs5 cs6 and cs7 are in the stage 3 that alert levels are warning hence the impact on the accuracy of risk assessment that caused by this inaccurate ship intention estimation is minor for the condition that ts1 s aq is positive ts1 s action helps collision avoidance with os it is reasonable to estimate that ts1 is aware of the collision risk with os and acts for it as we value ts s aq more therefore the collision risk still can be correctly assessed and classified by this proposed method thirdly the method can also be used to determine the alert levels in historic ais data which can be used to obtain further insight in the risk levels in waterways accurate ranking of traffic encounters through a conflict severity hierarchy contributes to the detection of high risk areas with a high occurrence frequency of near miss a near miss is a situation which did not lead to an accident but where an accident was narrowly avoided zhang et al 2015 2016 2017 du et al 2020b the focus of these detected near miss is effective in reducing the number of encounters requiring further examination by experts such as the vts operator besides the knowledge extracted from the analysis of historical waterway traffic risks can support the vts operators to manage waterway traffic and provide guidance to navigators 5 3 limitations and future research 5 3 1 parameters determination first the elliptical domain is selected as a basis of the current work as it is the most realistic one based on empirical data hansen et al 2013 however the elliptical domain still has many limitations szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017b that may undermine the accuracy of ship collision risk classification this issue could be overcome by the adoption of more advanced ship domain models such as knowledge based ship domain zhu et al 2001 pietrzykowski and uriasz 2009 or a model based ship domain rawson et al 2014 krata and montewka 2015 further the shape traffic density and traffic patterns of different sea and waterway regions are known to have an impact on the shape and size of the ship domain ship domains specified to open water pietrzykowski and uriasz 2009 restricted water hansen et al 2013 wang and chin 2016 pietrzykowski 2008 and ice covered water in convoy operations goerlandt et al 2017 are different a balance should be achieved between precisely defining the shape and dimensions of the ship domain and simplifying the computations ultimately the choice of domain is less important than the accuracy of the output level of the cas in the proposed cas method the elliptical domain is only used to help the stand on ship correctly understand the rules and to fulfil her duties the ship domain is only a means to that end instead of a focus therefore if other ship domain such as the fuzzy ship domain proves to be better under other encounter scenarios the proposed approach can be further applied to improve the cas further second the conflict evolution analysis including the ts s aq assessment and the os s amm calculation is performed based on the assumption that the motion state of the ts remains constant within a certain time for the condition that the ts is aware of the existing conflict the ts is assumed to alter course with a constant r o t within a short period which is observed by the os there are two challenges of using r o t as an indicator to do the conflict evolution analysis one challenge is that r o t is currently not a reliable parameter due to the fact that r o t indicator is usually not connected to the ais transponder mestl et al 2016 the second challenge is the quality represented in ais data in this work r o t is calculated from the course in ais data due to the influence of the external environment such as the wind and current a change of ts s course may be not for conflict elimination a more reliable method of the reconstruction of r o t from the ship s heading is needed third the threshold τ 1 and τ 2 to divide the different levels of os s amm are set as 80 and 60 respectively which is however subjective higher thresholds lead to more frequent alerts including many unnecessary or false alerts lower thresholds however may omit some important alerts therefore the determination of thresholds for the division of the different levels of os s amm still needs to be more precise many risk indicators analysis methods can help this goerlandt and kujala 2014 zhang et al 2019 2020 this is also a direction for future work finally the proposed cas has only been demonstrated in a limited number of test scenarios to show its rationale and feasibility more elaborate testing both with simulated scenarios encounters from historic ais data and ultimately in realistic environments with human operators should be performed this is essential for instance to determine the appropriate domain sizes and threshold settings striking a balance between the number of alerts and their actually perceived need 5 3 2 rule conflict in the multi vessel encounter the threat of the os s ship domain being violated is possible from more than one ship in high traffic density areas however most of the existing research about conflict elimination focuses only two ship encounter scenario huang and van gelder 2019c the multi vessel encounters are usually regarded as a linear superposition of multiple ship pair encounters for instance many works have been done to help the own ship to detect the most immediate danger ship brcko 2018 and determine the optimal course alteration maneuver szlapczynski 2007 2008 further the multi vessel encounter situation is not directly included in the colregs rules but relies on the knowledge and experience of the navigator in interpreting the situation based on the colreg rules for pairwise encounters brcko 2018 some work utilizes a traffic complexity van westrenen and ellerbroek 2015 or cooperative game approach liu et al 2019 to measure the global collision risk in multi vessel encounters however none of these considers the colregs nevertheless two critical issues in the multi vessel encounter situation need future work first the conflict between the own ship and other target ships are assessed separately while the conflict between target ships are currently not considered this issue may lead to an inaccurate understanding of the action intention of the target ship ship 1 s abnormal action in multi vessel encounter scenario in section 4 2 reveals this issue for the ship pair encounter between ship1 and ship2 there is no conflict between ship1 and ship2 at the beginning while ship1 s turning to port causes a conflict the motivation of this apparently abnormal action from ship1 can be interpreted by also considering the conflict between ship1 and ship3 from this it can be understood that the action by ship 1 aims to eliminate the conflict with ship3 the maritime traffic system is characterized by a complex interaction between ship human and environment and therefore the multi vessel encounter needs to be considered as a whole second little of research considers the rule conflicts where a vessel can have two identities simultaneously e g stand on and give way vessel for different vessels in a multi vessel encounter situation however in dense traffic areas this issue is not rare for the multi vessel encounter scenarios as described in section 4 2 ship3 is the stand on ship for the encounter with ship1 and ship3 is the give way ship for the encounter with ship2 from fig 16 it is seen that ship3 s actions are more complicated ship3 acts more frequently and takes a longer time to eliminate the conflicts ship 3 s action needs to comply with the colregs hence ship3 should not only give way to ship2 but also needs to fulfil her action obligation as a stand on ship to ship1 further ship3 s action should avoid making the situation worse ship3 s uncoordinated action may make ship1 s evasive actions ineffective however this work does not directly provide collision avoidance solutions in current circumstance the related information of rule conflict is notified to the os in the stand on position while the solution of which still needs navigator s decision consequently it is important to conduct an analysis of rule conflict to further improve the possibility of ships passing safely with each other 6 conclusions the effective response from the stand on ship helps prevent the occurrence of dangerous encounters and even ship collision when the give way ship does not act properly however the colregs rules do not provide specific guidance for the stand on ship although ship collision alert is a plausible way to alert the ship of a collision hazard in a timely fashion by reminding the ship operator of her action duties there is a lack of research focusing on alerting the stand on ship to compensate the give way ship s inappropriate actions therefore this article has proposed a cas from the stand on ship perspective to trigger the stand on ship s involvement in the conflict elimination by quantifying the terms of the colregs regarding the stand on ship s responsibility for conflict elimination the conflict severity is divided into 9 classes with the os s amm considered these classes are linked with the 4 stages of the encounter process and 4 alert levels this helps the stand on ship accurately understand her action responsibilities and clarify the corresponding alert level the results of several case studies demonstrate that the proposed method is feasible to support the stand on ship in making action decisions for conflict elimination this may contribute to the reduction of collisions caused by misinterpretations of the colregs by navigators the dynamic nature and uncertainty of ship actions are also considered in this proposed method to make the conflict assessment more accurate and reliable nonetheless several issues require further improvement the first is the determination of several critical parameters including the shape and size of ship domain r o t and threshold between different levels of os s amm these require further research to increase the universality and reliability of this proposed method the second is that multi vessel encounters need to be considered as a whole rather than a linear superposition of multiple ship pair encounters in particular rule conflicts where vessels can have two identities and opposing action requirements simultaneously is not rare especially in density water area this issue requires new research to find new alternatives for improving the possibility of ships passing safely with each other credit authorship contribution statement lei du conceptualization methodology data curation writing original draft writing review editing visualization formal analysis

21296,a new unified particle model that couples the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph and a discontinuous approach known as the volume compensated particle method vcpm is developed to solve fluid structure interaction fsi problems involving large deformation unlike the model that couples the smoothed particle hydrodynamics and the discrete element method i e sph dem in which the applicable poisson s ratio of the solid material should be less than certain critical values the current unified particle model is able to model solid materials of large poisson s ratio by using only axial interaction between solid particles the coupling between sph and vcpm is accomplished by treating the solid particles of vcpm at the solid fluid interface as dummy particles in sph this paper presents the first sph vcpm coupled method for fsi with comprehensive validations the vcpm solver is firstly verified for solving static and dynamic solid mechanics problems then the proposed solver is used to solve several fsi problems involving free surface i e water column on an aluminum plate flow under an elastic gate dam break problems involving flexible structures and deformation of flexible structure in a rolling oil tank the sph vcpm results match well with the published numerical results obtained from the literature keywords smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph volume compensated particle method vcpm fluid structure interaction fsi particle method free surface lattice spring model lsm 1 introduction fluid structure interaction fsi problems are commonly encountered in numerous engineering applications such as those in coastal engineering liu et al 2019 wu et al 2016 yang et al 2016 bio medical engineering ariane et al 2017 2018 cui et al 2018 deng et al 2018 fan et al 2018 etc in some fsi applications where the structural deformation is very small the structure can be treated as rigid body banks et al 2018 however for applications involving large structural deformation the dynamics of the neighbouring fluid can be significantly affected by the solid deformation as a result it is challenging to model fsi problem due to the mutual dependence between solid and fluid bodies and its inherent transient nature to date mesh based methods such as finite element method fem cheng et al 2019 lozovskiy et al 2019 wang et al 2019 and finite volume method fvm greenshields and weller 2005 have been predominantly applied to model fsi problems nevertheless remeshing is often required for problem involving large structural deformation which may affect the local mesh quality hence the stability and accuracy of the solution besides it is difficult to track capture the location of free surface especially in cases that undergo large deformation using the fixed eulerian mesh in this regard a method that is more suitable for modelling fsi problems involving free surfaces and large structural deformation is desirable smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph is a meshless particle method which is initially developed for astrophysical problems lucy 1977 the method is later adopted in other applications such as free surface modelling monaghan 1994 heat transfer aly and raizah 2018 ng et al 2019 2020 additive manufacturing makino et al 2017 yang et al 2017 etc in general sph method can be grouped into two main categories incompressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics isph and weakly compressible sph wcsph methods the former involves the iterative solution of the poisson pressure equation ppe at each time step therefore the free surface must be tracked at each time step so that the dirichlet pressure boundary condition can be enforced on particles at the free surface prior to solving the ppe in the numerical framework of wcsph however the pressure is calculated explicitly from the density field and the location tracking of free surface is no longer necessary because of this feature a lot of complicated free surface problems involving splashing and wave breaking have been studied using wcsph adami et al 2012 colagrossi and landrini 2003 gomez gesteira et al 2012 ren et al 2019 more recently sph has been coupled with other methods

al 2013 or mesh less benz and asphaug 1995 randles and libersky 1996 method while the former is more popular in engineering application in fact a solid mechanics problem can also be analysed using discontinuous approach it has been reported that discontinuous approach is more suitable for modelling cracking or rupture in solid body due to the fact that continuum based approaches suffer from the singularity issue at crack tip chen et al 2014a b in the discontinuous approach such as the discrete element method dem a discretized solid particle interacts with its neighbouring particles via spring like forces the spring stiffness values are determined using energy equivalency between discontinuous model and its continuum counterpart however most of the discontinuous models cannot model solid body of arbitrary poisson s ratio for example in the sph dem model tan and chen 2017 wu et al 2016 the poisson s ratio should be smaller than certain critical values in order to guarantee a non negative spring stiffness value this issue has been addressed by chen and co workers chen et al 2014a b using a lattice spring model lsm known as the volume compensated particle method vcpm to date vcpm has been successfully applied to various elasticity and plasticity problems and the results match well with fem results chen et al 2015 chen et al 2014a b chen and liu 2016 lin et al 2015 nevertheless the coupling of vcpm with other fluid flow solver for modelling fsi problem has not been reported so far indeed the numerical frameworks of sph and the discontinuous approaches such as dem and vcpm are very similar in which the motion of a particle is governed by the resultant force acting on the particle therefore it would be appealing to couple sph with the discontinuous approach for modelling fsi problems recently a simulation platform called the discrete multi physics dmp that couples sph and discontinuous model such as lsm has been developed to model fsi problems alexiadis 2015 alexiadis et al 2017 ariane et al 2018 however similar to the problem encountered in sph dem model wu et al 2016 the angular spring stiffness value employed in dmp becomes negative for certain poisson s ratios which is unphysical from engineering point of view in the current work a coupled sph vcpm method is developed to model fsi problems in which the fluid and solid mediums are modelled using sph and vcpm respectively the sph vcpm model presented in this paper is the first step of developing a more robust unified particle model for assessing the failure risk of flexible structure subjected to fluid forces e g flooding event blood flow wind flow etc as the vcpm model is capable of modelling solid materials of large poisson s ratio by using only axial interaction since the dynamics of both fluid and structure are modelled using particle based methods the unified particle model can be easily parallelized such as gpu for simulating large scale problems in the future in particular the current work highlights the coupling procedure between sph and vcpm methods at the solid fluid interface and focuses on establishing the validity of the new sph vcpm method in solving various fsi problems involving fluid and elastic solid by comparing the sph vcpm results with those published in the open literature furthermore the spatial order of convergence for vcpm alone which has not been reported earlier is assessed in the current work several conclusions and recommendations for future work are also given 2 mathematical models and numerical methods 2 1 fluid model the fluid motion is governed by mass conservation equation 1 d ρ d t ρ v and momentum conservation equation 2 m d v d t f p f v f e x t here v is the fluid velocity vector ρ is the fluid density and m is the fluid mass the subscripts p v and ext for the force vector f denote fluid force due to fluid pressure fluid viscosity and external sources e g gravity respectively in the context of weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics wcsph model the fluid pressure p can be written as a function of fluid density variation i e p c 2 ρ ρ o here the speed of sound c is typically taken as at least 10 times of the maximum flow speed in the flow domain in order to ensure the density variation is less than 1 the initial fluid density is denoted as ρ o using sph the mass conservation equation can be discretized as 3 d ρ i d t ρ i j v j v i v j i w i j 2 δ h c d i where i w i j d w i j d r r i j r i j and r i j r i r j the above summation is performed on all neighbouring particles j residing within the circular area of compact support radius r c the term 2 δ h c d i appeared in the r h s of equation 3 is introduced to suppress the high frequency pressure noise where δ is usually fixed as 0 1 as it is claimed that the range of variability of this parameter is very narrow antuono et al 2012 sun et al 2017 in the current work following the recent fsi works reported by zhan and co workers zhan et al 2019 and tan and chen 2017 using sph the original δ sph method of molteni and colagrossi 2009 is implemented where the diffusion term d i is expressed as d i σ j ρ j ρ i v j r j i i w i j r j i 2 a renormalized density gradient term can be added in order to improve the accuracy of the diffusion term of free surface particles antuono et al 2012 at the expense of more computational cost incurred for matrix inversion in the current work the smoothing length h is set equal to the initial particle spacing d adami et al 2012 in all simulations the quintic spline kernel morris et al 1997 schoenberg 1946 with compact support radius r c of 3h is adopted in order to ensure the full support of kernel interpolation at the boundary at least r c d layers of dummy particles are placed next to the boundary the discretized momentum equation of fluid particle i can be written as 4 m i d v i d t f p i f v i f e x t i the mass of particle i m i is fixed in the current work i e m i ρ o d d where d is the flow dimension d 2 in the current work from the sph work of hu and adams 2006 the pressure and viscous forces acting on a fluid particle i can be expressed as 5 f p i σ j v i 2 v j 2 p i ρ j p j ρ i ρ i ρ j i w i j and 6 f v i σ j v i 2 v j 2 2 μ i μ j μ i μ j v i v j r i j i w i j r i j r i j f a v i respectively here μ is the fluid dynamic viscosity and v is the particle volume the force due to artificial viscosity f a v i can be added to reduce spurious flow oscillation following the work of monaghan and gingold 1983 the force due to artificial viscosity acting on fluid particle i can be expressed as 7 f a v i σ j m i m j a h i j c i j v i v j r i r j p i j r ij 2 0 01 h i j 2 i w i j where h i j 0 5 h i h j c i j 0 5 c i c j and ρ i j 0 5 ρ i ρ j it should be noted that this artificial force is activated only when a fluid particle i interacts with its neighbouring fluid particles and both particles i and j are approaching each other i e v i v j r i r j 0 the strength of the artificial viscosity force can be controlled via tuning the parameter α the effect of α on the flow result will be discussed in section 3 2 finally the weight of a fluid particle i can be included in the external force term as 8 f e x t i m i g 2 2 solid model the motion of a solid particle i inside a deformable solid body is governed by the newton s second law 9 m i d v i d t f s i f e x t i f d i f f s i where f s i f e x t i f d i and f f s i are spring force external force damping force and fluid force acting on a solid particle i here the solid particle mass m i can be computed as m i ρ s d d where ρ s is the solid particle density again the weight of solid particle i can be included in the external force term f e x t i as f e x t i m i g for modelling quasi static problem it is useful to introduce the damping force term f d i to damp the mechanical wave so that a quasi static solution can be attained the damping force is defined as f d i m i k v i where k is the damping coefficient in the current work the volume compensated particle method vcpm is used to model the solid deformation in vcpm a solid particle i interacts with its neighbouring solid particles via axial springs see fig 2 the stiffness values k l and k d for linear and diagonal springs respectively are generally dependent on the topology of the solid particles and the material properties in order to stay consistent with the initial particle topology of sph i e cartesian the square packing of solid particle is considered in the current work which is shown in fig 2 the corresponding spring like force f s i can be computed as 10 f s i σ j u c e l l δ l i j u ˆ i j where u ˆ i j r i r j r i r j is the unit vector between solid particles i and j the derivative of the total strain energy of a unit cell is 11 u c e l l δ l i j k l δ l i j t 2 σ j 1 8 δ l i j σ m 1 8 δ l j m j ε 1 2 3 4 k d δ l i j t 2 σ j 1 8 δ l i j σ m 1 8 δ l j m k d δ l i j t 2 σ j 1 8 δ l i j σ m 1 8 δ l j m j ε 5 6 7 8 here δ l i j is half of the length change of spring connecting solid particles i and j the index m is introduced to represent the solid neighbours of particle j the parameter t is the non local volumetric parameter which is introduced to consider the distortion energy hence removing the restriction on poisson s ratio in classical lsm for the 2d plane strain problem considered in the current work thick object the stiffness and volumetric parameters can be computed from the young s modulus e and the poisson s ratio υ of an isotropic elastic material 12 k l 2 e 1 υ 13 k d e 1 υ 14 t e 4 υ 1 1 υ 1 2 υ 2 2 2 note υ 1 must be satisfied in order to ensure the positivity of spring stiffness parameters in 12 and 13 meanwhile υ 1 2 is demanded to avoid singularity in the volumetric parameter t the derivation procedure of the above stiffness and volumetric parameters for square packing can be found in appendix 1 the derivation procedure makes use of the unit normal vector pointing from particle i to neighbouring particles j as tabulated in table 1 the remaining question is to determine the fluid force acting on the solid particle i f f s i which is discussed in the following section 2 3 coupling of sph and vcpm as mentioned previously the elastic solid body is discretized into solid particles the solid particles at the solid fluid interface serve as the dummy particles for the sph solver to enforce the no penetration and no slip boundary conditions at the interface the implementation of these boundary conditions can be found in the work by adami and co workers adami et al 2012 the pressure of dummy particle p i can be extrapolated from the fluid pressure based on the adami s approach adami et al 2012 that satisfies momentum balance see fig 1 15 p i i n f p i ρ i g a i r ii w r i i i w r i i here n f is the number of neighbouring fluid particles a i is the acceleration vector of dummy particle i and r i i r i r i no slip condition is enforced via computing the extrapolated dummy particle velocity v i 16 v i 2 v w i j n f v j w r i j j n f w r i j where v w i is the actual velocity of dummy particle i solved from equation 9 this method is attractive as the boundary surface normal information is not required the pressure and viscous forces acting on a fluid particle i while interacting with the dummy particle i can then be written as 17 f p i i v i 2 v i 2 p i ρ i p i ρ i ρ i ρ i i w i i and 18 f v i i v i 2 v i 2 2 μ i μ i μ i μ i v i v i r i i i w i i r i i r i i respectively following equations 5 and 6 note v i is the volume of dummy particle i which is fixed as v i d d in the current work ρ i is calculated by manipulating the state equation of pressure to get ρ i ρ o p i c 2 and μ i is set as μ i finally based on newton s third law the total hydrodynamic force acting on a generic solid particle i i e f f s i can be written as 19 f f s i i n f f p i i f v i i equation 19 can now be substituted into equation 9 for predicting the motion of solid particle i more details are explained in the next section 2 4 solution algorithm in order to simulate the motion of fluid particles the velocity verlet scheme outlined by adami and co workers adami et al 2012 is implemented to integrate the density equation and the equation of motion outlined in 3 and 4 respectively the equation of motion for solid particle given in 9 is integrated in the same manner as that for fluid particle except that the solid particle density is not updated as it is treated as constant throughout the simulation in order to establish the force coupling between fluid and solid particles equation 19 is implemented due to the nature of the fully explicit time integration scheme implemented in the current work the time step size δ t is restricted in the following manner for stability purpose adami et al 2012 chen et al 2014a b 20 δ t min 0 125 p ο h 2 μ 0 25 h a i m a x 0 25 h c 0 5 h c s where a i m a x is the maximum acceleration of flow solid particles and the subscript s denotes solid body the sound speed in the solid body c s can be computed as c s b s 4 g s 3 ρ s where b s e 3 1 2 ν is the bulk modulus and g s e 2 1 ν is the shear modulus in the current work we follow the approach of discrete multi physics dmp framework developed by alexiadis alexiadis 2015 ariane et al 2018 where the governing fluid and solid equations are integrated using the minimum value of time step size calculated from 20 on the other hand as the maximum allowable time step size for solid solver is typically smaller than that of the fluid one sound speed in solid body is higher than that in fluid a step substep coupling method sun et al 2019 can be used to enhance the computational efficiency where the equation of motion of solid particle is integrated several steps within one time step of the fluid evolution 3 results and discussions 3 1 solid mechanics simulation before applying the developed sph vcpm solver to model fsi problems we first verify the vcpm solver in solving static and dynamic solid mechanics problems the results are discussed in the following sections 3 1 1 static tensile test computational works have been performed earlier to verify the validity of vcpm approach in solving solid mechanics problems of a wide range of poisson s ratio chen et al 2014a b chen et al 2014a b for example chen and co workers chen et al 2014a b have compared the solid particle displacement results obtained from vcpm and fem and they reported that the results were in good agreement nevertheless the spatial order of convergence of vcpm has not been reported yet here we have performed a numerical uniaxial tensile test as shown in fig 3 a constant tensile stress σ x of 8 mpa is applied at both ends of the plate two dimensional 2d plane strain condition is assumed the original length l and height h of the plate are 3 cm and 1 cm respectively as the plate is subjected to tension it is expected that the plate elongates in the x direction and shrinks in the y direction as shown in fig 3 the material properties of solid density ρ s young s modulus e and poisson s ratio ν are set to 2700 kgm 3 69 gpa and 0 33 respectively in order to accelerate the steady state calculation for the current transient numerical tensile test we set the damping factor k to 100000 s 1 in order to damp the mechanical wave fig 4 shows that the oscillations of the x and y displacements at the mid points of the right and top edges of the 2d plate respectively see fig 3 are damped as time progresses the simulation is stopped at t 0 2 ms as the results are almost non varying starting at t 0 15 ms we have utilized different particle resolutions to check the spatial order of convergence in terms of the predicted material properties the results are tabulated in table 2 as seen both simulated material properties e sim and ν sim approach to the prescribed values as the particle resolution increases it should be noted that both simulated properties are obtained from the x and y displacements q x and q y measured at the midpoints of the right and top edges of the 2d plate respectively see fig 3 for 2d plane strain problem it can be shown that ν s i m ε y ε y ε x and e s i m 1 ν s i m 2 σ x ε x where ε x 2 q x l and ε y 2 q y h see appendix 2 fig 5 shows that the spatial convergence rates of both ν s i m and e s i m are 1 0 3 1 2 undamped vibration of a 2d plane strain beam due to bending shear the objective of performing this numerical test is to validate the vcpm method from the dynamic point of view as the structural dynamics plays an important role in the fsi studies performed later here we have referred to the test case previously tested by greenshields and weller 2005 using the finite volume method fvm this test case which is outlined in fig 6 involves a structural beam of length l 20 m and height h 5 m at t 0 a constant shear stress τ is applied at the right edge free end of the beam in order to model the fixed wall both x and y displacements of the solid particles at the left edge of the beam are fixed as zeroes the material properties are set as e 4 gpa ν 0 32 and ρ s 1450 kg m3 similar to the numerical settings reported by greenshields and weller 2005 we have set the particle resolution to 320 x 80 the simulation is executed until t 1 0 s without introducing any damping k 0 a monitor point is placed at the mid point of the shear face in order to record the y displacement q y at every 5 ms the result is then compared with the 1d beam analytical solution and the fvm solution as shown in fig 7 as seen the agreement between the vcpm and fvm is very encouraging our measured period of oscillation is 0 295 s or linear frequency f of 3 3898 hz this measured value is slightly higher than the analytical value f 3 35 hz by approximately 1 1 also we have calculated the mean displacement from t 0 s to t 0 89 s trough to trough and the value is 0 304 m which is 1 6 lower than the 1d analytical solution i e 0 309 m 3 2 fluid structural interaction fsi with the verified structural vcpm solver several fsi simulations have been performed and the results are presented in the following sections in order to correctly resolve the dynamics of the elastic structure no artificial damping k 0 is introduced in the structural equation the gravitational acceleration vector g is set to 0 9 81 ms 2 3 2 1 water column on an elastic aluminum plate the current test case shown in fig 8 a serves as a good validation test case for a fsi solver as the analytical solution of the mid span of the aluminum plate is available here the water column of width w 1 m and height h 2 m lies on top of the flexible aluminum plate of thickness 5 cm both left and right ends of the aluminum plate are fixed to the side walls the close up view of the lattice spring network near the left end of the aluminum plate is shown in fig 8 b in order to model the fixed end condition the solid particles near the left and right ends of the aluminum plate are linked with the neighbouring stationary dummy particles the material properties of the 2d aluminum plate undergoing plane strain condition are e 67 5 gpa ν 0 34 ρ s 2700 kgm 3 initially at t 0 s the water pressure is treated as hydrostatic hence ρ ρ o p c 2 by treating ρ o as 1000 kgm 3 and the aluminum plate is not deformed the water dynamic viscosity is set as 0 001 pa s and no artificial viscosity on the fluid side is introduced α 0 at t 0 s the plate is suddenly loaded with the hydrostatic water pressure acting above and hence the plate starts to oscillate as shown in fig 9 as seen the y displacement at the mid span of the plate reaches the equilibrium condition at t 0 06 s from the theoretical solution this equilibrium value is q y equi theo 6 85 x 10 5 m fourey et al 2017 while the plate is oscillating the pressure wave is generated from the bottom of the water tank as shown in fig 10 fig 11 shows quantitatively the propagation of pressure wave within the water column the wave originated from the tank bottom reaches the free surface at t 0 05 s after that the wave bounces back and propagates in the direction towards the tank bottom it is appealing to note that the pressure profile is quite smooth spatially and the free surface pressure is almost retained at p 0 kpa as shown in fig 11 the pressure wave in the water column travels approximately 0 45 m from points a to b or from points b to c see fig 11 within 0 01 s or at the speed of about 45 m s this speed value corresponds to the sound speed value prescribed in the current weakly compressible sph solver i e c 45 m s which is about ten times larger than the reference velocity v r e f g h 4 43 m s for hydrostatic tank adami et al 2012 this prescribed sound speed value is slightly lower than those reported by fourey and co workers fourey et al 2017 i e 50 m s however we have found that changing c 45 m s to c 50 m s gives no significant difference on the y displacement of the mid span of the aluminum plate as shown in fig 9 the oscillation period of the aluminum plate is 4 ms this value is very similar to that reported by fourey and co workers fourey et al 2017 we have simulated this case using five different particle resolutions and the corresponding y displacements at the mid span of the plate at equilibrium condition q y equi are tabulated in table 3 here q y equi is evaluated by averaging the displacement data from t 0 03 s to t 0 07 s as reported in fig 9 as shown in fig 9 there is still a small discrepancy between the theoretical solution and our sph vcpm solution employing the finest particle resolution d 0 2 cm the discrepancy is due to the resolution errors in sph and vcpm with the latter can lead to the occasion where the simulated material properties are not equivalent to the prescribed ones due to the discontinuous nature of vcpm as shown in section 3 1 1 we anticipate that the error due to particle irregularity in sph is minimal as we observe that the sph particle layout is nearly cartesian at the end of the simulation fig 12 shows that q y equi exhibits o d convergence to the theoretical solution 3 2 2 flow through the opening of an elastic gate this case deals with the dam break water flow through an elastic gate whereby the experimental data of the gate displacement is available antoci et al 2007 the initial configuration is shown in fig 13 whereby the width w and height h of the water column are set to 0 1 m and 0 14 m respectively the water density and dynamic viscosity are prescribed as 1000 kgm 3 and 0 001 pa s respectively by taking the reference velocity v r e f g h 1 17 m s we set the sound speed c to 10 v r e f 12 m s in order to model the hinge the elastic gate particles are linked with the neighbouring stationary dummy particles as shown in fig 13 a the thickness and the height of the flexible gate are fixed at 0 005 m and 0 079 m respectively as reported by antoci and co workers antoci et al 2007 the following material properties are used e 12 mpa ν 0 40 and ρ s 1100 kgm 3 the particle spacing for both fluid and solid regions is set as d 1 0 mm as shown in fig 13 b the lower end of the flexible gate is free to move as the water column collapses the fluid force pushes the elastic gate to the right and water particles flow underneath the gate a monitor point a is placed at the bottom right corner of the gate free end in order to record its displacement value as time progresses the sampling period is 5 ms and the simulation is executed until t 0 4 s the time histories of the simulated displacement values at point a are reported in fig 14 the sph vcpm results are compared against the 2d plane strain sph fem solutions d 1 mm given by yang and co workers yang et al 2012 it is appealing to note that the agreement is good in general our predicted gate displacement values do not vary significantly when the artificial viscosity parameter α increases from 0 0 to 1 0 furthermore we have compared our results with the isph sph solutions khayyer et al 2018 and the experimental data antoci et al 2007 while the agreements are encouraging at t 0 08 s our predicted x and y displacements at point a including those of sph fem and isph sph for t 0 08 s are lower than the experimental data antoci et al 2007 yang and co workers yang et al 2012 have argued that better agreement against the experimental data can be attained by modelling the flexible gate using mooney rivlin hyper elasticity model as the current sph vcpm results agree considerably well with those of the 2d sph fem linear elastic plane strain model it is important to note that any discrepancy with the experimental data is due to the inadequacy of linear elastic material model employed in this case and not due to the inaccuracy of our fsi model fig 15 shows the gate openings captured at t 0 2 s and t 0 4 s owing to the fact that our predicted gate opening is smaller than the experimentally measured data as previously highlighted in fig 14 our predicted water level at the reservoir remains higher than that measured as time progresses 3 2 3 dam break with an elastic structure next the sph vcpm solver is tested on fsi problems that involve more complex free surface dynamics the configuration of the problem under investigation is outlined in fig 16 and the dimensions are provided in table 4 here we are interested in simulating two dam break problems i e cases db1 and db2 for both cases the lower end of the flexible structure of dimension l3 h3 see table 4 is fixed to the floor the upper end is free to move 3 2 3 1 case db1 this test case has been previously investigated by idelsohn and co workers idelsohn et al 2008 using the particle finite element method pfem more recently this case has been simulated by yang and co workers yang et al 2016 by combining both sph and the element bending group ebg methods the following material properties of the flexible structure are used e 1 mpa ν 0 0 and ρ s 2500 kgm 3 the water density and viscosity are set as 1000 kgm 3 and 0 001 pa s respectively following the numerical setup reported by yang and co workers yang et al 2016 the particle spacing and sound speed are prescribed as d 2 mm and c 50 m s respectively we have simulated this problem using different artificial viscosity parameters α and the predicted x displacement values q x at the upper left corner free end of the flexible structure are shown in fig 17 the results are compared against the pfem solutions idelsohn et al 2008 at the instant where the water firstly impacts the flexible structure t 0 14 s the structure moves slightly to the left a mild negative x displacement which is agreeable to the pfem solution see details in fig 8 of idelsohn et al 2008 the structure is then deflected to the right and attains its maximum value at t 0 24 s as the water rises from the bottom subsequently the impact of the water particles from both sides of the flexible structure causes the structure to oscillate finally the motion of the flexible structure is damped generally we noticed that those small scale oscillations of the structure t 1 5 s are particularly sensitive to the value of α in particular for particle spacing d 2 mm we have found that our results in general are quite similar to the pfem solutions as we set the α value to 0 2 or 0 25 still our sph vcpm simulation is stable even though no artificial viscosity is employed α 0 fig 18 shows the snapshots of the fluid particles coloured by their pressure values at different time frames in general both sph vcpm and pfem results are qualitatively agreeable with each other it can be noticed that the particle distributions near the free surface and wall regions predicted using the current sph vcpm method are more uniform than those simulated using pfem 3 2 3 2 case db2 this dam break case had been tested by liao and co workers liao et al 2015 both experimentally and numerically the flexible structure is stiffer than that in db1 e 3 5 mpa ν 0 0 and ρ s 1161 54 kgm 3 in the current numerical study we have used the fluid properties reported by liao and co workers liao et al 2015 whereby the water density and dynamic viscosity are set as 997 kgm 3 and 0 00089 pa s respectively the particle spacing and sound speed are prescribed as d 1 mm or h0 d 400 and c 80 m s respectively the total number of particles inclusive of fluid and solid are 89 000 in order to prevent tensile instability a non zero artificial viscosity parameter α is employed here for stabilizing the computation while it is noted that the order of magnitude of α is commonly set as 2 antuono et al 2012 marrone et al 2011 meringolo et al 2019 it has been recently reported by sun and co workers sun et al 2018 that the problem of tensile instability is still apparent when reynolds number increases in order to address this problem some authors have increased the numerical dissipation of the sph scheme by setting α 0 3 tan and chen 2017 α 0 4 adami et al 2012 α 0 5 madhi and yeung 2018 and even α 1 0 antoci et al 2007 while simulating dam break problems in the current simulation we found that α 0 2 is sufficient to stabilize the simulation an advanced treatment by using the non conservative formulation for discretizing the pressure gradient term in negative pressure region sun et al 2018 has been proven effective in suppressing the tensile instability at high reynolds number and this will be left for future work liao and co workers had placed three monitor points i e markers 1 2 and 3 see fig 3 liao et al 2015 at the flexible structure in order to measure the corresponding x displacements when the structure deformed here we have compared the x displacement values near the free end of the flexible structure i e 87 5 mm from the bottom or marker 1 liao et al 2015 against those measured liao et al 2015 and simulated using the very recent sph tlp method h0 d 300 sun et al 2019 the result is shown in fig 19 it is found that our prediction agrees considerably well with the single phase sph tlp solution sun et al 2019 where the x displacement is dipped at t 0 56 s which is not observed experimentally seemingly the air cushion effect is quite significant in this case which justifies the reason why a multiphase approach such as the multi phase sph tlp is able to provide a more accurate prediction as shown in fig 19 and due to the fact that the effect of gate opening is not considered in our simulation the first impact of the water particles onto the flexible structure happens slightly earlier than that measured figs 20 and 21 provide a qualitative comparison of the entire structural deformation process due to the fact that air is not modelled in the current work the flexible structure experiences the impulse of the collapsing water particles earlier at t 0 55 s see fig 21 the returning water particles upon hitting the right wall of the tank have started to impact on the right side of the flexible structure thereby causing the structure to undergo a counter clockwise motion this phenomenon correlates with the apparent decrease of x displacement near the tip at t 0 56 s as observed earlier in fig 19 3 2 4 liquid sloshing in a rolling tank with a bottom clamped elastic structure this case involves the sloshing of sunflower oil of density 917 kgm 3 and dynamic viscosity 0 04585 pa s within a rolling tank shown in fig 22 the width and height of the tank are 609 mm and 344 5 mm respectively initially the oil tank is not tilted θ 0 and a flexible plate of thickness 4 mm is mounted to the middle of the tank bottom point o the height of the plate is 114 8 mm which is similar to the initial height of the oil level in the tank more experimental details can be found from the work of souto iglesias and co workers souto iglesias et al 2008 in the current fsi study the following material properties are employed e 6 0 mpa ν 0 0 and ρ s 1100 kgm 3 the particle spacing d is set to 1 mm and no artificial viscosity α 0 is employed in this study at t 0 the tank is allowed to roll about point o with maximum amplitude of 4 the complete temporal function of θ can be found from the work of paik and carrica 2014 the snapshots of the plate deformation and free surface evolution are compared in fig 23 from the figures it appears that both the predicted plate deformation and free surface profile agree quite well with those observed experimentally nevertheless our numerical results show a rougher free surface at all times this could be due to the absence of surface tension effect in our model the time evolution of the x displacement see the rotated x y rotated coordinate system in fig 22 at the free end of the flexible plate is reported in fig 24 seemingly the amplitude of the oscillation is over predicted using the current sph vcpm solver and the pfem solver souto iglesias et al 2008 nevertheless both sph vcpm and pfem results agree considerably well with each other 4 conclusion a coupled smoothed particle hydrodynamics and volume compensated particle method sph vcpm has been developed to solve fluid structure interaction fsi problems involving large deformation the fluid dynamics has been modelled using sph while the elastic behaviour of solid body has been modelled using vcpm this new unified particle model aims to address the limitation of sph dem model where the poisson ratio of solid materials should be less than certain critical values by treating the solid particles as dummy particles in the sph solver the coupling between these two methods can be easily realized by equating the force magnitude between the solid and fluid particles the elastic force between the solid particles has been modelled using a spring like force before venturing into the fsi problems the vcpm solver has been verified in reproducing the mechanical properties of the simulated solid and the natural frequency of the beam subjected to shear stress at the tip good agreements have been found between the current and published numerical results in addition it has been found that vcpm has first order convergence rate with the verified vcpm solid solver the coupled sph vcpm solver is then used to solve various fsi problems involving free surfaces and flexible structures by using the same numerical setup it has been found that the sph vcpm results agree well with the other numerical fsi results obtained using fem pfem and sph tlp the current fsi model can be further enhanced by incorporating features such as advanced material model e g mooney rivlin hyper elasticity model multiphase model and three dimensionality so that better agreement can be attained between the numerical and experimental results the inherent strength of using vcpm in solid modelling is its capability in solving problems involving solid fracture breakup without any singularity issues which is difficult to be simulated using conventional mesh based methods the current sph vcpm method can be further extended to incorporate this feature by for example removing the axial bonds to dissociate the linkage between two solid particles furthermore it should be noted that the time step size is bounded by the sound speeds in both fluid and solid domains where the sound speed is normally higher in the latter therefore in order to enhance the computational efficiency a step substep algorithm can be implemented by solving the solid equations alone for a few time steps upon evolving the fluid equations for a single time step data exchange can then take place at the same time level furthermore apart from the artificial viscosity method that involves tuning parameter more robust sph schemes in addressing the tensile instability numerical cavitation at high reynolds number should be explored credit authorship contribution statement k c ng

21296,a new unified particle model that couples the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph and a discontinuous approach known as the volume compensated particle method vcpm is developed to solve fluid structure interaction fsi problems involving large deformation unlike the model that couples the smoothed particle hydrodynamics and the discrete element method i e sph dem in which the applicable poisson s ratio of the solid material should be less than certain critical values the current unified particle model is able to model solid materials of large poisson s ratio by using only axial interaction between solid particles the coupling between sph and vcpm is accomplished by treating the solid particles of vcpm at the solid fluid interface as dummy particles in sph this paper presents the first sph vcpm coupled method for fsi with comprehensive validations the vcpm solver is firstly verified for solving static and dynamic solid mechanics problems then the proposed solver is used to solve several fsi problems involving free surface i e water column on an aluminum plate flow under an elastic gate dam break problems involving flexible structures and deformation of flexible structure in a rolling oil tank the sph vcpm results match well with the published numerical results obtained from the literature keywords smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph volume compensated particle method vcpm fluid structure interaction fsi particle method free surface lattice spring model lsm 1 introduction fluid structure interaction fsi problems are commonly encountered in numerous engineering applications such as those in coastal engineering liu et al 2019 wu et al 2016 yang et al 2016 bio medical engineering ariane et al 2017 2018 cui et al 2018 deng et al 2018 fan et al 2018 etc in some fsi applications where the structural deformation is very small the structure can be treated as rigid body banks et al 2018 however for applications involving large structural deformation the dynamics of the neighbouring fluid can be significantly affected by the solid deformation as a result it is challenging to model fsi problem due to the mutual dependence between solid and fluid bodies and its inherent transient nature to date mesh based methods such as finite element method fem cheng et al 2019 lozovskiy et al 2019 wang et al 2019 and finite volume method fvm greenshields and weller 2005 have been predominantly applied to model fsi problems nevertheless remeshing is often required for problem involving large structural deformation which may affect the local mesh quality hence the stability and accuracy of the solution besides it is difficult to track capture the location of free surface especially in cases that undergo large deformation using the fixed eulerian mesh in this regard a method that is more suitable for modelling fsi problems involving free surfaces and large structural deformation is desirable smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph is a meshless particle method which is initially developed for astrophysical problems lucy 1977 the method is later adopted in other applications such as free surface modelling monaghan 1994 heat transfer aly and raizah 2018 ng et al 2019 2020 additive manufacturing makino et al 2017 yang et al 2017 etc in general sph method can be grouped into two main categories incompressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics isph and weakly compressible sph wcsph methods the former involves the iterative solution of the poisson pressure equation ppe at each time step therefore the free surface must be tracked at each time step so that the dirichlet pressure boundary condition can be enforced on particles at the free surface prior to solving the ppe in the numerical framework of wcsph however the pressure is calculated explicitly from the density field and the location tracking of free surface is no longer necessary because of this feature a lot of complicated free surface problems involving splashing and wave breaking have been studied using wcsph adami et al 2012 colagrossi and landrini 2003 gomez gesteira et al 2012 ren et al 2019 more recently sph has been coupled with other methods to model fsi problems involving large deformation such as sph element bending group sph ebg yang et al 2016 sph fem fourey et al 2017 li et al 2015 yang et al 2012 sph total lagrangian particle sph tlp sun et al 2019 sph absolute nodal coordinate formulation sph ancf rakhsha et al 2017 isph sph khayyer et al 2018 and sph smoothed point interpolation s pim zhang et al 2019 the coupling procedures between different methods for solving fsi problem have been recently reviewed by liu and zhang 2019 in most of the aforementioned sph solvers e g sph fem sph tlp s pim the continuum based approach that requires the formulation of complex constitutive equations has been used to analyse the deformation of solid body these constitutive equations can be solved using either mesh based zienkiewicz et al 2013 or mesh less benz and asphaug 1995 randles and libersky 1996 method while the former is more popular in engineering application in fact a solid mechanics problem can also be analysed using discontinuous approach it has been reported that discontinuous approach is more suitable for modelling cracking or rupture in solid body due to the fact that continuum based approaches suffer from the singularity issue at crack tip chen et al 2014a b in the discontinuous approach such as the discrete element method dem a discretized solid particle interacts with its neighbouring particles via spring like forces the spring stiffness values are determined using energy equivalency between discontinuous model and its continuum counterpart however most of the discontinuous models cannot model solid body of arbitrary poisson s ratio for example in the sph dem model tan and chen 2017 wu et al 2016 the poisson s ratio should be smaller than certain critical values in order to guarantee a non negative spring stiffness value this issue has been addressed by chen and co workers chen et al 2014a b using a lattice spring model lsm known as the volume compensated particle method vcpm to date vcpm has been successfully applied to various elasticity and plasticity problems and the results match well with fem results chen et al 2015 chen et al 2014a b chen and liu 2016 lin et al 2015 nevertheless the coupling of vcpm with other fluid flow solver for modelling fsi problem has not been reported so far indeed the numerical frameworks of sph and the discontinuous approaches such as dem and vcpm are very similar in which the motion of a particle is governed by the resultant force acting on the particle therefore it would be appealing to couple sph with the discontinuous approach for modelling fsi problems recently a simulation platform called the discrete multi physics dmp that couples sph and discontinuous model such as lsm has been developed to model fsi problems alexiadis 2015 alexiadis et al 2017 ariane et al 2018 however similar to the problem encountered in sph dem model wu et al 2016 the angular spring stiffness value employed in dmp becomes negative for certain poisson s ratios which is unphysical from engineering point of view in the current work a coupled sph vcpm method is developed to model fsi problems in which the fluid and solid mediums are modelled using sph and vcpm respectively the sph vcpm model presented in this paper is the first step of developing a more robust unified particle model for assessing the failure risk of flexible structure subjected to fluid forces e g flooding event blood flow wind flow etc as the vcpm model is capable of modelling solid materials of large poisson s ratio by using only axial interaction since the dynamics of both fluid and structure are modelled using particle based methods the unified particle model can be easily parallelized such as gpu for simulating large scale problems in the future in particular the current work highlights the coupling procedure between sph and vcpm methods at the solid fluid interface and focuses on establishing the validity of the new sph vcpm method in solving various fsi problems involving fluid and elastic solid by comparing the sph vcpm results with those published in the open literature furthermore the spatial order of convergence for vcpm alone which has not been reported earlier is assessed in the current work several conclusions and recommendations for future work are also given 2 mathematical models and numerical methods 2 1 fluid model the fluid motion is governed by mass conservation equation 1 d ρ d t ρ v and momentum conservation equation 2 m d v d t f p f v f e x t here v is the fluid velocity vector ρ is the fluid density and m is the fluid mass the subscripts p v and ext for the force vector f denote fluid force due to fluid pressure fluid viscosity and external sources e g gravity respectively in the context of weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics wcsph model the fluid pressure p can be written as a function of fluid density variation i e p c 2 ρ ρ o here the speed of sound c is typically taken as at least 10 times of the maximum flow speed in the flow domain in order to ensure the density variation is less than 1 the initial fluid density is denoted as ρ o using sph the mass conservation equation can be discretized as 3 d ρ i d t ρ i j v j v i v j i w i j 2 δ h c d i where i w i j d w i j d r r i j r i j and r i j r i r j the above summation is performed on all neighbouring particles j residing within the circular area of compact support radius r c the term 2 δ h c d i appeared in the r h s of equation 3 is introduced to suppress the high frequency pressure noise where δ is usually fixed as 0 1 as it is claimed that the range of variability of this parameter is very narrow antuono et al 2012 sun et al 2017 in the current work following the recent fsi works reported by zhan and co workers zhan et al 2019 and tan and chen 2017 using sph the original δ sph method of molteni and colagrossi 2009 is implemented where the diffusion term d i is expressed as d i σ j ρ j ρ i v j r j i i w i j r j i 2 a renormalized density gradient term can be added in order to improve the accuracy of the diffusion term of free surface particles antuono et al 2012 at the expense of more computational cost incurred for matrix inversion in the current work the smoothing length h is set equal to the initial particle spacing d adami et al 2012 in all simulations the quintic spline kernel morris et al 1997 schoenberg 1946 with compact support radius r c of 3h is adopted in order to ensure the full support of kernel interpolation at the boundary at least r c d layers of dummy particles are placed next to the boundary the discretized momentum equation of fluid particle i can be written as 4 m i d v i d t f p i f v i f e x t i the mass of particle i m i is fixed in the current work i e m i ρ o d d where d is the flow dimension d 2 in the current work from the sph work of hu and adams 2006 the pressure and viscous forces acting on a fluid particle i can be expressed as 5 f p i σ j v i 2 v j 2 p i ρ j p j ρ i ρ i ρ j i w i j and 6 f v i σ j v i 2 v j 2 2 μ i μ j μ i μ j v i v j r i j i w i j r i j r i j f a v i respectively here μ is the fluid dynamic viscosity and v is the particle volume the force due to artificial viscosity f a v i can be added to reduce spurious flow oscillation following the work of monaghan and gingold 1983 the force due to artificial viscosity acting on fluid particle i can be expressed as 7 f a v i σ j m i m j a h i j c i j v i v j r i r j p i j r ij 2 0 01 h i j 2 i w i j where h i j 0 5 h i h j c i j 0 5 c i c j and ρ i j 0 5 ρ i ρ j it should be noted that this artificial force is activated only when a fluid particle i interacts with its neighbouring fluid particles and both particles i and j are approaching each other i e v i v j r i r j 0 the strength of the artificial viscosity force can be controlled via tuning the parameter α the effect of α on the flow result will be discussed in section 3 2 finally the weight of a fluid particle i can be included in the external force term as 8 f e x t i m i g 2 2 solid model the motion of a solid particle i inside a deformable solid body is governed by the newton s second law 9 m i d v i d t f s i f e x t i f d i f f s i where f s i f e x t i f d i and f f s i are spring force external force damping force and fluid force acting on a solid particle i here the solid particle mass m i can be computed as m i ρ s d d where ρ s is the solid particle density again the weight of solid particle i can be included in the external force term f e x t i as f e x t i m i g for modelling quasi static problem it is useful to introduce the damping force term f d i to damp the mechanical wave so that a quasi static solution can be attained the damping force is defined as f d i m i k v i where k is the damping coefficient in the current work the volume compensated particle method vcpm is used to model the solid deformation in vcpm a solid particle i interacts with its neighbouring solid particles via axial springs see fig 2 the stiffness values k l and k d for linear and diagonal springs respectively are generally dependent on the topology of the solid particles and the material properties in order to stay consistent with the initial particle topology of sph i e cartesian the square packing of solid particle is considered in the current work which is shown in fig 2 the corresponding spring like force f s i can be computed as 10 f s i σ j u c e l l δ l i j u ˆ i j where u ˆ i j r i r j r i r j is the unit vector between solid particles i and j the derivative of the total strain energy of a unit cell is 11 u c e l l δ l i j k l δ l i j t 2 σ j 1 8 δ l i j σ m 1 8 δ l j m j ε 1 2 3 4 k d δ l i j t 2 σ j 1 8 δ l i j σ m 1 8 δ l j m k d δ l i j t 2 σ j 1 8 δ l i j σ m 1 8 δ l j m j ε 5 6 7 8 here δ l i j is half of the length change of spring connecting solid particles i and j the index m is introduced to represent the solid neighbours of particle j the parameter t is the non local volumetric parameter which is introduced to consider the distortion energy hence removing the restriction on poisson s ratio in classical lsm for the 2d plane strain problem considered in the current work thick object the stiffness and volumetric parameters can be computed from the young s modulus e and the poisson s ratio υ of an isotropic elastic material 12 k l 2 e 1 υ 13 k d e 1 υ 14 t e 4 υ 1 1 υ 1 2 υ 2 2 2 note υ 1 must be satisfied in order to ensure the positivity of spring stiffness parameters in 12 and 13 meanwhile υ 1 2 is demanded to avoid singularity in the volumetric parameter t the derivation procedure of the above stiffness and volumetric parameters for square packing can be found in appendix 1 the derivation procedure makes use of the unit normal vector pointing from particle i to neighbouring particles j as tabulated in table 1 the remaining question is to determine the fluid force acting on the solid particle i f f s i which is discussed in the following section 2 3 coupling of sph and vcpm as mentioned previously the elastic solid body is discretized into solid particles the solid particles at the solid fluid interface serve as the dummy particles for the sph solver to enforce the no penetration and no slip boundary conditions at the interface the implementation of these boundary conditions can be found in the work by adami and co workers adami et al 2012 the pressure of dummy particle p i can be extrapolated from the fluid pressure based on the adami s approach adami et al 2012 that satisfies momentum balance see fig 1 15 p i i n f p i ρ i g a i r ii w r i i i w r i i here n f is the number of neighbouring fluid particles a i is the acceleration vector of dummy particle i and r i i r i r i no slip condition is enforced via computing the extrapolated dummy particle velocity v i 16 v i 2 v w i j n f v j w r i j j n f w r i j where v w i is the actual velocity of dummy particle i solved from equation 9 this method is attractive as the boundary surface normal information is not required the pressure and viscous forces acting on a fluid particle i while interacting with the dummy particle i can then be written as 17 f p i i v i 2 v i 2 p i ρ i p i ρ i ρ i ρ i i w i i and 18 f v i i v i 2 v i 2 2 μ i μ i μ i μ i v i v i r i i i w i i r i i r i i respectively following equations 5 and 6 note v i is the volume of dummy particle i which is fixed as v i d d in the current work ρ i is calculated by manipulating the state equation of pressure to get ρ i ρ o p i c 2 and μ i is set as μ i finally based on newton s third law the total hydrodynamic force acting on a generic solid particle i i e f f s i can be written as 19 f f s i i n f f p i i f v i i equation 19 can now be substituted into equation 9 for predicting the motion of solid particle i more details are explained in the next section 2 4 solution algorithm in order to simulate the motion of fluid particles the velocity verlet scheme outlined by adami and co workers adami et al 2012 is implemented to integrate the density equation and the equation of motion outlined in 3 and 4 respectively the equation of motion for solid particle given in 9 is integrated in the same manner as that for fluid particle except that the solid particle density is not updated as it is treated as constant throughout the simulation in order to establish the force coupling between fluid and solid particles equation 19 is implemented due to the nature of the fully explicit time integration scheme implemented in the current work the time step size δ t is restricted in the following manner for stability purpose adami et al 2012 chen et al 2014a b 20 δ t min 0 125 p ο h 2 μ 0 25 h a i m a x 0 25 h c 0 5 h c s where a i m a x is the maximum acceleration of flow solid particles and the subscript s denotes solid body the sound speed in the solid body c s can be computed as c s b s 4 g s 3 ρ s where b s e 3 1 2 ν is the bulk modulus and g s e 2 1 ν is the shear modulus in the current work we follow the approach of discrete multi physics dmp framework developed by alexiadis alexiadis 2015 ariane et al 2018 where the governing fluid and solid equations are integrated using the minimum value of time step size calculated from 20 on the other hand as the maximum allowable time step size for solid solver is typically smaller than that of the fluid one sound speed in solid body is higher than that in fluid a step substep coupling method sun et al 2019 can be used to enhance the computational efficiency where the equation of motion of solid particle is integrated several steps within one time step of the fluid evolution 3 results and discussions 3 1 solid mechanics simulation before applying the developed sph vcpm solver to model fsi problems we first verify the vcpm solver in solving static and dynamic solid mechanics problems the results are discussed in the following sections 3 1 1 static tensile test computational works have been performed earlier to verify the validity of vcpm approach in solving solid mechanics problems of a wide range of poisson s ratio chen et al 2014a b chen et al 2014a b for example chen and co workers chen et al 2014a b have compared the solid particle displacement results obtained from vcpm and fem and they reported that the results were in good agreement nevertheless the spatial order of convergence of vcpm has not been reported yet here we have performed a numerical uniaxial tensile test as shown in fig 3 a constant tensile stress σ x of 8 mpa is applied at both ends of the plate two dimensional 2d plane strain condition is assumed the original length l and height h of the plate are 3 cm and 1 cm respectively as the plate is subjected to tension it is expected that the plate elongates in the x direction and shrinks in the y direction as shown in fig 3 the material properties of solid density ρ s young s modulus e and poisson s ratio ν are set to 2700 kgm 3 69 gpa and 0 33 respectively in order to accelerate the steady state calculation for the current transient numerical tensile test we set the damping factor k to 100000 s 1 in order to damp the mechanical wave fig 4 shows that the oscillations of the x and y displacements at the mid points of the right and top edges of the 2d plate respectively see fig 3 are damped as time progresses the simulation is stopped at t 0 2 ms as the results are almost non varying starting at t 0 15 ms we have utilized different particle resolutions to check the spatial order of convergence in terms of the predicted material properties the results are tabulated in table 2 as seen both simulated material properties e sim and ν sim approach to the prescribed values as the particle resolution increases it should be noted that both simulated properties are obtained from the x and y displacements q x and q y measured at the midpoints of the right and top edges of the 2d plate respectively see fig 3 for 2d plane strain problem it can be shown that ν s i m ε y ε y ε x and e s i m 1 ν s i m 2 σ x ε x where ε x 2 q x l and ε y 2 q y h see appendix 2 fig 5 shows that the spatial convergence rates of both ν s i m and e s i m are 1 0 3 1 2 undamped vibration of a 2d plane strain beam due to bending shear the objective of performing this numerical test is to validate the vcpm method from the dynamic point of view as the structural dynamics plays an important role in the fsi studies performed later here we have referred to the test case previously tested by greenshields and weller 2005 using the finite volume method fvm this test case which is outlined in fig 6 involves a structural beam of length l 20 m and height h 5 m at t 0 a constant shear stress τ is applied at the right edge free end of the beam in order to model the fixed wall both x and y displacements of the solid particles at the left edge of the beam are fixed as zeroes the material properties are set as e 4 gpa ν 0 32 and ρ s 1450 kg m3 similar to the numerical settings reported by greenshields and weller 2005 we have set the particle resolution to 320 x 80 the simulation is executed until t 1 0 s without introducing any damping k 0 a monitor point is placed at the mid point of the shear face in order to record the y displacement q y at every 5 ms the result is then compared with the 1d beam analytical solution and the fvm solution as shown in fig 7 as seen the agreement between the vcpm and fvm is very encouraging our measured period of oscillation is 0 295 s or linear frequency f of 3 3898 hz this measured value is slightly higher than the analytical value f 3 35 hz by approximately 1 1 also we have calculated the mean displacement from t 0 s to t 0 89 s trough to trough and the value is 0 304 m which is 1 6 lower than the 1d analytical solution i e 0 309 m 3 2 fluid structural interaction fsi with the verified structural vcpm solver several fsi simulations have been performed and the results are presented in the following sections in order to correctly resolve the dynamics of the elastic structure no artificial damping k 0 is introduced in the structural equation the gravitational acceleration vector g is set to 0 9 81 ms 2 3 2 1 water column on an elastic aluminum plate the current test case shown in fig 8 a serves as a good validation test case for a fsi solver as the analytical solution of the mid span of the aluminum plate is available here the water column of width w 1 m and height h 2 m lies on top of the flexible aluminum plate of thickness 5 cm both left and right ends of the aluminum plate are fixed to the side walls the close up view of the lattice spring network near the left end of the aluminum plate is shown in fig 8 b in order to model the fixed end condition the solid particles near the left and right ends of the aluminum plate are linked with the neighbouring stationary dummy particles the material properties of the 2d aluminum plate undergoing plane strain condition are e 67 5 gpa ν 0 34 ρ s 2700 kgm 3 initially at t 0 s the water pressure is treated as hydrostatic hence ρ ρ o p c 2 by treating ρ o as 1000 kgm 3 and the aluminum plate is not deformed the water dynamic viscosity is set as 0 001 pa s and no artificial viscosity on the fluid side is introduced α 0 at t 0 s the plate is suddenly loaded with the hydrostatic water pressure acting above and hence the plate starts to oscillate as shown in fig 9 as seen the y displacement at the mid span of the plate reaches the equilibrium condition at t 0 06 s from the theoretical solution this equilibrium value is q y equi theo 6 85 x 10 5 m fourey et al 2017 while the plate is oscillating the pressure wave is generated from the bottom of the water tank as shown in fig 10 fig 11 shows quantitatively the propagation of pressure wave within the water column the wave originated from the tank bottom reaches the free surface at t 0 05 s after that the wave bounces back and propagates in the direction towards the tank bottom it is appealing to note that the pressure profile is quite smooth spatially and the free surface pressure is almost retained at p 0 kpa as shown in fig 11 the pressure wave in the water column travels approximately 0 45 m from points a to b or from points b to c see fig 11 within 0 01 s or at the speed of about 45 m s this speed value corresponds to the sound speed value prescribed in the current weakly compressible sph solver i e c 45 m s which is about ten times larger than the reference velocity v r e f g h 4 43 m s for hydrostatic tank adami et al 2012 this prescribed sound speed value is slightly lower than those reported by fourey and co workers fourey et al 2017 i e 50 m s however we have found that changing c 45 m s to c 50 m s gives no significant difference on the y displacement of the mid span of the aluminum plate as shown in fig 9 the oscillation period of the aluminum plate is 4 ms this value is very similar to that reported by fourey and co workers fourey et al 2017 we have simulated this case using five different particle resolutions and the corresponding y displacements at the mid span of the plate at equilibrium condition q y equi are tabulated in table 3 here q y equi is evaluated by averaging the displacement data from t 0 03 s to t 0 07 s as reported in fig 9 as shown in fig 9 there is still a small discrepancy between the theoretical solution and our sph vcpm solution employing the finest particle resolution d 0 2 cm the discrepancy is due to the resolution errors in sph and vcpm with the latter can lead to the occasion where the simulated material properties are not equivalent to the prescribed ones due to the discontinuous nature of vcpm as shown in section 3 1 1 we anticipate that the error due to particle irregularity in sph is minimal as we observe that the sph particle layout is nearly cartesian at the end of the simulation fig 12 shows that q y equi exhibits o d convergence to the theoretical solution 3 2 2 flow through the opening of an elastic gate this case deals with the dam break water flow through an elastic gate whereby the experimental data of the gate displacement is available antoci et al 2007 the initial configuration is shown in fig 13 whereby the width w and height h of the water column are set to 0 1 m and 0 14 m respectively the water density and dynamic viscosity are prescribed as 1000 kgm 3 and 0 001 pa s respectively by taking the reference velocity v r e f g h 1 17 m s we set the sound speed c to 10 v r e f 12 m s in order to model the hinge the elastic gate particles are linked with the neighbouring stationary dummy particles as shown in fig 13 a the thickness and the height of the flexible gate are fixed at 0 005 m and 0 079 m respectively as reported by antoci and co workers antoci et al 2007 the following material properties are used e 12 mpa ν 0 40 and ρ s 1100 kgm 3 the particle spacing for both fluid and solid regions is set as d 1 0 mm as shown in fig 13 b the lower end of the flexible gate is free to move as the water column collapses the fluid force pushes the elastic gate to the right and water particles flow underneath the gate a monitor point a is placed at the bottom right corner of the gate free end in order to record its displacement value as time progresses the sampling period is 5 ms and the simulation is executed until t 0 4 s the time histories of the simulated displacement values at point a are reported in fig 14 the sph vcpm results are compared against the 2d plane strain sph fem solutions d 1 mm given by yang and co workers yang et al 2012 it is appealing to note that the agreement is good in general our predicted gate displacement values do not vary significantly when the artificial viscosity parameter α increases from 0 0 to 1 0 furthermore we have compared our results with the isph sph solutions khayyer et al 2018 and the experimental data antoci et al 2007 while the agreements are encouraging at t 0 08 s our predicted x and y displacements at point a including those of sph fem and isph sph for t 0 08 s are lower than the experimental data antoci et al 2007 yang and co workers yang et al 2012 have argued that better agreement against the experimental data can be attained by modelling the flexible gate using mooney rivlin hyper elasticity model as the current sph vcpm results agree considerably well with those of the 2d sph fem linear elastic plane strain model it is important to note that any discrepancy with the experimental data is due to the inadequacy of linear elastic material model employed in this case and not due to the inaccuracy of our fsi model fig 15 shows the gate openings captured at t 0 2 s and t 0 4 s owing to the fact that our predicted gate opening is smaller than the experimentally measured data as previously highlighted in fig 14 our predicted water level at the reservoir remains higher than that measured as time progresses 3 2 3 dam break with an elastic structure next the sph vcpm solver is tested on fsi problems that involve more complex free surface dynamics the configuration of the problem under investigation is outlined in fig 16 and the dimensions are provided in table 4 here we are interested in simulating two dam break problems i e cases db1 and db2 for both cases the lower end of the flexible structure of dimension l3 h3 see table 4 is fixed to the floor the upper end is free to move 3 2 3 1 case db1 this test case has been previously investigated by idelsohn and co workers idelsohn et al 2008 using the particle finite element method pfem more recently this case has been simulated by yang and co workers yang et al 2016 by combining both sph and the element bending group ebg methods the following material properties of the flexible structure are used e 1 mpa ν 0 0 and ρ s 2500 kgm 3 the water density and viscosity are set as 1000 kgm 3 and 0 001 pa s respectively following the numerical setup reported by yang and co workers yang et al 2016 the particle spacing and sound speed are prescribed as d 2 mm and c 50 m s respectively we have simulated this problem using different artificial viscosity parameters α and the predicted x displacement values q x at the upper left corner free end of the flexible structure are shown in fig 17 the results are compared against the pfem solutions idelsohn et al 2008 at the instant where the water firstly impacts the flexible structure t 0 14 s the structure moves slightly to the left a mild negative x displacement which is agreeable to the pfem solution see details in fig 8 of idelsohn et al 2008 the structure is then deflected to the right and attains its maximum value at t 0 24 s as the water rises from the bottom subsequently the impact of the water particles from both sides of the flexible structure causes the structure to oscillate finally the motion of the flexible structure is damped generally we noticed that those small scale oscillations of the structure t 1 5 s are particularly sensitive to the value of α in particular for particle spacing d 2 mm we have found that our results in general are quite similar to the pfem solutions as we set the α value to 0 2 or 0 25 still our sph vcpm simulation is stable even though no artificial viscosity is employed α 0 fig 18 shows the snapshots of the fluid particles coloured by their pressure values at different time frames in general both sph vcpm and pfem results are qualitatively agreeable with each other it can be noticed that the particle distributions near the free surface and wall regions predicted using the current sph vcpm method are more uniform than those simulated using pfem 3 2 3 2 case db2 this dam break case had been tested by liao and co workers liao et al 2015 both experimentally and numerically the flexible structure is stiffer than that in db1 e 3 5 mpa ν 0 0 and ρ s 1161 54 kgm 3 in the current numerical study we have used the fluid properties reported by liao and co workers liao et al 2015 whereby the water density and dynamic viscosity are set as 997 kgm 3 and 0 00089 pa s respectively the particle spacing and sound speed are prescribed as d 1 mm or h0 d 400 and c 80 m s respectively the total number of particles inclusive of fluid and solid are 89 000 in order to prevent tensile instability a non zero artificial viscosity parameter α is employed here for stabilizing the computation while it is noted that the order of magnitude of α is commonly set as 2 antuono et al 2012 marrone et al 2011 meringolo et al 2019 it has been recently reported by sun and co workers sun et al 2018 that the problem of tensile instability is still apparent when reynolds number increases in order to address this problem some authors have increased the numerical dissipation of the sph scheme by setting α 0 3 tan and chen 2017 α 0 4 adami et al 2012 α 0 5 madhi and yeung 2018 and even α 1 0 antoci et al 2007 while simulating dam break problems in the current simulation we found that α 0 2 is sufficient to stabilize the simulation an advanced treatment by using the non conservative formulation for discretizing the pressure gradient term in negative pressure region sun et al 2018 has been proven effective in suppressing the tensile instability at high reynolds number and this will be left for future work liao and co workers had placed three monitor points i e markers 1 2 and 3 see fig 3 liao et al 2015 at the flexible structure in order to measure the corresponding x displacements when the structure deformed here we have compared the x displacement values near the free end of the flexible structure i e 87 5 mm from the bottom or marker 1 liao et al 2015 against those measured liao et al 2015 and simulated using the very recent sph tlp method h0 d 300 sun et al 2019 the result is shown in fig 19 it is found that our prediction agrees considerably well with the single phase sph tlp solution sun et al 2019 where the x displacement is dipped at t 0 56 s which is not observed experimentally seemingly the air cushion effect is quite significant in this case which justifies the reason why a multiphase approach such as the multi phase sph tlp is able to provide a more accurate prediction as shown in fig 19 and due to the fact that the effect of gate opening is not considered in our simulation the first impact of the water particles onto the flexible structure happens slightly earlier than that measured figs 20 and 21 provide a qualitative comparison of the entire structural deformation process due to the fact that air is not modelled in the current work the flexible structure experiences the impulse of the collapsing water particles earlier at t 0 55 s see fig 21 the returning water particles upon hitting the right wall of the tank have started to impact on the right side of the flexible structure thereby causing the structure to undergo a counter clockwise motion this phenomenon correlates with the apparent decrease of x displacement near the tip at t 0 56 s as observed earlier in fig 19 3 2 4 liquid sloshing in a rolling tank with a bottom clamped elastic structure this case involves the sloshing of sunflower oil of density 917 kgm 3 and dynamic viscosity 0 04585 pa s within a rolling tank shown in fig 22 the width and height of the tank are 609 mm and 344 5 mm respectively initially the oil tank is not tilted θ 0 and a flexible plate of thickness 4 mm is mounted to the middle of the tank bottom point o the height of the plate is 114 8 mm which is similar to the initial height of the oil level in the tank more experimental details can be found from the work of souto iglesias and co workers souto iglesias et al 2008 in the current fsi study the following material properties are employed e 6 0 mpa ν 0 0 and ρ s 1100 kgm 3 the particle spacing d is set to 1 mm and no artificial viscosity α 0 is employed in this study at t 0 the tank is allowed to roll about point o with maximum amplitude of 4 the complete temporal function of θ can be found from the work of paik and carrica 2014 the snapshots of the plate deformation and free surface evolution are compared in fig 23 from the figures it appears that both the predicted plate deformation and free surface profile agree quite well with those observed experimentally nevertheless our numerical results show a rougher free surface at all times this could be due to the absence of surface tension effect in our model the time evolution of the x displacement see the rotated x y rotated coordinate system in fig 22 at the free end of the flexible plate is reported in fig 24 seemingly the amplitude of the oscillation is over predicted using the current sph vcpm solver and the pfem solver souto iglesias et al 2008 nevertheless both sph vcpm and pfem results agree considerably well with each other 4 conclusion a coupled smoothed particle hydrodynamics and volume compensated particle method sph vcpm has been developed to solve fluid structure interaction fsi problems involving large deformation the fluid dynamics has been modelled using sph while the elastic behaviour of solid body has been modelled using vcpm this new unified particle model aims to address the limitation of sph dem model where the poisson ratio of solid materials should be less than certain critical values by treating the solid particles as dummy particles in the sph solver the coupling between these two methods can be easily realized by equating the force magnitude between the solid and fluid particles the elastic force between the solid particles has been modelled using a spring like force before venturing into the fsi problems the vcpm solver has been verified in reproducing the mechanical properties of the simulated solid and the natural frequency of the beam subjected to shear stress at the tip good agreements have been found between the current and published numerical results in addition it has been found that vcpm has first order convergence rate with the verified vcpm solid solver the coupled sph vcpm solver is then used to solve various fsi problems involving free surfaces and flexible structures by using the same numerical setup it has been found that the sph vcpm results agree well with the other numerical fsi results obtained using fem pfem and sph tlp the current fsi model can be further enhanced by incorporating features such as advanced material model e g mooney rivlin hyper elasticity model multiphase model and three dimensionality so that better agreement can be attained between the numerical and experimental results the inherent strength of using vcpm in solid modelling is its capability in solving problems involving solid fracture breakup without any singularity issues which is difficult to be simulated using conventional mesh based methods the current sph vcpm method can be further extended to incorporate this feature by for example removing the axial bonds to dissociate the linkage between two solid particles furthermore it should be noted that the time step size is bounded by the sound speeds in both fluid and solid domains where the sound speed is normally higher in the latter therefore in order to enhance the computational efficiency a step substep algorithm can be implemented by solving the solid equations alone for a few time steps upon evolving the fluid equations for a single time step data exchange can then take place at the same time level furthermore apart from the artificial viscosity method that involves tuning parameter more robust sph schemes in addressing the tensile instability numerical cavitation at high reynolds number should be explored credit authorship contribution statement k c ng

21297,in this study the effective wake factors of a self propelled container ship were investigated by telfer s geosim method based on cfd computational fluid dynamics for this purpose the self propulsion characteristics of kcs kriso container ship at three different model scales and full scale were determined at fr 0 26 by unsteady rans reynolds averaged navier stokes solver all scales corresponded to a wide range of reynolds numbers turbulent flow around the kcs hull has been investigated by the k ε turbulence model heave and pitch motions of kcs hulls have been modeled with the dfbi dynamic fluid body interaction method and overset mesh technique the rotational motion of kp505 propeller has been simulated using the rbm rigid body motion approach the result obtained by the extrapolation of the effective wake fraction with the geosim method was compared with the full scale ones of cfd and ittc methods the results by the geosim method are more compatible with those of full scale cfd than the results of 1978 ittc method in the wake region where viscous effects are predominant the change of effective wake fraction with reynolds number has been successfully represented by the geosim method thus more robust and reliable results have been found keywords geosim series effective wake fraction self propulsion full scale kcs rigid body motion scale effect 1 introduction service and maximum velocities of ships should be set in the concept and initial design stages to achieve this the effective wake field and fraction should be calculated accurately this is due to not only the design of the wake adapted propeller but also for having optimum vibration acoustic properties of the ship in general resistance and propulsion characteristics including effective wake are obtained at model scale and then the computed and or measured results are extrapolated to full scaled ship although simulation of flow around a ship at full scale is possible with developed processing capability it is not an efficient way yet due to expensive computational costs since the self propulsion analysis needs a small time step therefore extrapolation techniques are still important to predict the full scale ship results accurately propeller hull interaction is on the other hand one of the most important issues in cfd computational fluid dynamics analyses of self propelled ships there are several approaches for propulsion simulations such as virtual disc mrf moving reference frame and rbm rigid body motion methods while other methods model the propeller indirectly the rbm method enables to simulate the propeller physically in the simulation setup delen et al 2019 recently the rbm approach became a popular method to simulate the propeller hull interactions castro et al 2011 made self propulsion computations for kcs kriso container ship hull at full scale which is a benchmark form in naval hydrodynamics three cases have been considered propeller open water performance resistance test and self propelled condition at full scale the results of this study have been used for comparison with the results of the present study in section 5 bugalski and hoffmann 2011 also used the same method which separates the mesh domain into two regions one as a rotating cylinder around the propeller and the rest of the computational domain in the study of shen et al 2015 self propulsion analyses were performed for kcs with overset to estimate the vertical motion and a rotation controller was used to catch the self propulsion point wang et al 2016 investigated the propulsion characteristics of a benchmark form onr tumblehome using unsteady rans reynolds averaged navier stokes solver with an overset method to solve the vertical motion and rbm method to solve the propeller hull interaction sezen et al 2018 compared the body force method based on actuator disc and self propelled cases for benchmark darpa the defense advanced research projects agency submarine form it was noted that with the self propulsion scenario propulsive efficiency was predicted higher than that of the body force method and the reason for this can be the modeling of propeller hull interaction successfully in another study bekhit 2018 examined the actuator disc and rbm motion method for benchmark jbc japanese bulk carrier hull and indicated that especially around the propeller actuator disc is incapable to solve flow field accurately kinaci et al 2018 used an iterative method which is called spe self propulsion estimation to predict the self propulsion point by using open water propeller characteristics and bare hull resistance values lungu 2018 investigated the resistance open water propeller and self propulsion performance of kcs hull and pointed out that although the sliding grid technique is not cost effective computationally it is the most compatible way to solve unsteady interaction between the propeller and hull in the study of jasak et al 2018 self propulsion analyses were performed with the actuator disc model for two different types of full scale ships and the numerical results were compared with those of sea trials grid sensitivity analyses were also done for the self propulsion point in the study in another study the free surface effect on self propulsion characteristics of joubert bb2 which is a benchmark submarine form was estimated using a dynamic overset technique to change the level of submarine under the free surface carrica et al 2019 in other studies gokce et al 2019 and kinaci et al 2020 used the spe iterative method based on propeller open water performance and empirical approaches they applied the method to jbc and dtc duisburg test case hulls respectively and compared the results with unsteady rans results of direct self propulsion analyses sun et al 2020 carried out a sliding mesh technique to implement the rbm and simulate the propeller at full scale for self propulsion analyses results by sea trials were compared with those of numerical method and the roughness effect was also included in the computations in the study of wu et al 2019 resistance self propulsion and flow field characteristics of kcs hull were considered in waves as well as in calm water the propeller effect was simulated using velocity components from the blade element theory and these data were provided to unsteady rans solver as an input data experimental and computational analyses were performed and the results compared with each other in detail it was stated that the numerical and experimental results were in good agreement on the other hand the wake characteristics of a ship have a significant effect on the ship s propulsive performance the nominal wake is measured and or computed at the propeller disc without propeller while the effective wake is calculated by considering the propeller induced velocities at the same disc when the propeller is providing the thrust force to drive the hull at the design speed as indicated in miller and brizzolara 2019 the nominal wake characteristics can provide the main input for the initial design of the propeller operating behind the ship however the effective wake should be calculated for the wake adapted propeller carlton 2012 there is a very complicated interaction between the hull and propeller and this affects the wake properties significantly rijpkema et al 2013 investigated the propeller hull interaction problem by using a coupling approach of bem and rans steady state rans and unsteady bem were performed sequentially to obtain nominal wake and distribute propeller loading they suggested to calculate effective wake by subtracting propeller induced velocities from total wake field with the coupled method kinnas et al 2013 investigated effective wake of a ducted propeller with a coupling of bem and a wall transpiration model in order to adopt boundary layer solver to panel method they indicated that the results by hybrid method and rans simulations are in a good agreement wang et al 2016 made an investigation about the wake field of self propelled kcs hull with a geosim geometrically similar and a non geosim model which is called as smart dummy model to figure out the wake factors a smart dummy model was generated under some geometric limitations such as keeping the gap between the hull and shaft as same compatible results were obtained for the smart dummy with the geosim model regener et al 2018 examined the propeller hull interaction problem by considering the wake characteristics and cavitation effect at model and full scales a coupled solution method was used by bem for propeller and rans for flow around ship it was stated that model scale nominal and effective wakes led to a significant underestimation of the cavitation parameters farkas et al 2018 presented a detailed comparison of turbulence models and extrapolation methods for resistance and self propulsion characteristics in this study the nominal wake of a full scale ship was computed at different draughts and compared with each other in addition to the previous study farkas et al 2019 made double body simulations for a full scale ship to determine the resistance and wake characteristics the effects of the turbulence models on the wake field were also discussed in the study sun et al 2019 examined the nominal wake field of a four screw ship experimentally and numerically a numerical study was done for a geosim family without considering the free surface effects the results showed that the nominal wake increased towards full scale and the computational results were compatible with the experimental wake results in another study sun et al 2019 investigated the propeller loading and propulsion performance of kcs hull in terms of effective wake fraction they proposed an iterative coupling with bem and rans methods and stated that the relative difference between the proposed method and fully rans results is in a relatively lower level while the coupled method needs less computational time solak 2020 studied on aft form optimization to reduce the viscous resistance of a ship using metamodeling techniques between the optimized hull and the original hull were also made examinations on the nominal wake one of the key problems in ship hydrodynamics is the scale effect e g effective and nominal wake form factor appendage resistance etc caused by the mismatch of the re reynolds numbers between model and ship on the other hand the scale effect or the extrapolation of viscous phenomena can be consistently examined the change of the related feature according to the re numbers by geosim series in the study of lee et al 2018 geometrically similar model families were considered for different types of benchmark ships to calculate the form factor at full scale using logarithmic reynolds number based extrapolation method in another study three different model scales of kcs considered based on the geosim approach for ship resistance terziev et al 2019 both double body and multiphase analyses were performed to estimate the form factor and total resistance delen and bal 2019 investigated telfer s geosim method on total ship resistance by using cfd analyses instead of model tests geometrically similar model family of kcs hull was generated according to telfer s propositions and model tests were replaced by cfd analyses furthermore the method was revisited to obtain a more accurate extrapolation approach and the results were compared with those of the 1978 ittc the international towing tank conference method and full scale cfd results it was noted that telfer s geosim method has a high accuracy to predict the results at full scale compared to other conventional extrapolation methods this study has been a basis for the present study and detailed explanations are given in the following sections dogrul et al 2020 carried out numerical resistance analyses of kcs and kvlcc2 hulls at different scales with both free surface and double body simulations the scale effect on each component of total ship resistance was discussed in detail it is known that telfer s geosim method was originally developed to calculate the total resistance of a ship by using test results of models at different scales it is indeed a very effective way of extrapolating of test results from model scale to full scale it is also regarded as the most accurate prediction method among others and avoids theoretically the decomposition of total resistance bertram 2012 molland et al 2011 it was used only for research purposes since the costs for model tests were very high for practical purposes in the past but now cfd can be used instead of model tests and it has been shown that the method is a very effective alternative way delen and bal 2019 in the present study telfer s geosim method has been applied to obtain an accurate extrapolation technique to predict the effective wake fraction of full scale kcs hull a model family has been generated with three different scale ratios and then propulsion analyses have been performed at fr 0 26 and the corresponding re numbers for this model family and full scale ship the propulsion results and effective wake patterns have been validated with the available experimental and computational results then the effective wake fraction results of the geosim series have been extrapolated to full scale by using modified telfer s geosim method the change of the effective wake fraction concerning the re number has been successfully represented by the geosim method the comparison of the full scale effective wake fraction has been also presented with those obtained from the 1978 ittc method and full scale cfd results the results obtained with the geosim method are much well matched with the full scale results compared to the ones obtained with the 1978 ittc method with the geosim method more reliable and robust results have been obtained since the effect of the re number on the viscous flow phenomena around the hull can be examined more accurately 2 ship and propeller geometry benchmark case kcs hull was frequently used in various numbers of computational and experimental studies especially in tokyo 2015 larsson et al 2018 gothenburg 2010 larsson et al 2013 and tokyo 2005 hino 2005 cfd workshops was selected for investigation of effective wake fraction topic with geosim series in this study a geometrically similar model family has been generated for the hull geometry to consider telfer s suggestions telfer 1927 the model family consists of three different scaled models of kcs geometry and computational study has been performed at fr 0 26 for these models for two members of the model family scale ratios λ 37 89 and λ 31 60 a comprehensive benchmarking study has been made with experimental and computational cases in cfd workshops mentioned above an additional model scale has been selected as λ 60 75 in this study computational as well as experimental resistance characteristics of kcs hull have been presented in the studies of delen and bal 2019 2015 the main particulars of kcs hull and the corresponding kp505 propeller are given in tables 1 and 2 respectively the views of the kcs hull and the kp505 propeller are also shown in figs 1 and 2 respectively here m1 m2 m3 and fs represent model 1 model 2 model 3 and full scale ship respectively 3 theoretical background 3 1 governing equations in this study the flow around hulls is considered as three dimensional unsteady and incompressible under these conditions the continuity equation is 1 u i x i 0 the rans equations are also expressed as follows 2 u i t u i u j x j 1 ρ p x i u i u j x j ν 2 u i x j 2 here u i is mean velocity i subscript represents the ith direction of the cartesian coordinate system ρ is the density of fluid p is the mean pressure τ ij τ i j u i u j is the reynolds stress term and ν is the kinematic viscosity of fluid the turbulent flow region is simulated by using the two equation k ε turbulence model modeling of reynolds stresses τ ij is performed in this way in the standard model k is the turbulence kinetic energy and ε is the rate of dissipation and the expressions of these parameters are given below 3 k t x j k u j τ ij u i x j ε x j ν ν t σ k k x j 4 ε t x j ε u j c ε 1 ε k τ

statistical methods further explanation can be found in wilcox 2006 3 2 telfer s geosim method it is known that to provide both geometric and dynamic similarity in the investigation of ship resistance the corresponding re number and fr number of the ship and model must be the same the total resistance of a ship can be written as follows 5 r t ρ s v 2 f f r r e this similarity is generally difficult to satisfy conventional methods however satisfy the partial dynamic similarity by equalizing only fr numbers to get practical solutions and total resistance is decomposed into its components such as viscous and wave drags on the other hand telfer proposed a different approach to estimate the ship total resistance telfer 1927 telfer generated the geosim model series and measured total ship resistance at least two different model scales he then plotted the non dimensional resistance coefficient versus reynolds number in the logarithmic scale thus the total resistance of a ship could easily be extrapolated using the result of geosim series there is no need for any separation of total resistance into its components here the total resistance coefficient is written as a function of re number as follows 6 c t a log r e x b telfer suggested x power be taken as 1 3 bertram 2012 so a and b variables can be calculated easily by resistance coefficients of two models therefore a system of linear equations is obtained and can be solved easily in this study x power has been assumed to be an unknown and three models at different scales are required to solve a and b variables and x power a nonlinear equation can then be obtained the same can be written for effective wake fraction as follows 7 w t a log r e x b the unknowns a b and x in equation 7 were calculated by a nonlinear curve fitting method note that the coefficients a b and x for different ships will change there are no universal coefficients the point here is to propose a simple and accurate alternative extrapolation technique based on cfd of computing effective wake fraction at full scale rather than suggesting a generalized regression function geosim method needs data in three different model scales but cfd produces results in small scales very quickly and consumes not so much resources as in full scale this is the advantage of the method the method can also be applied to much complex hull forms with different appendages as the number of appendages increases geosim method is expected to give more accurate results this is because viscous effects are getting more dominant with increasing number of appendages and the method includes these effects directly to the computations these modifications make it possible to estimate full scale effective wake fraction in terms of re number accurately 3 3 1978 ittc performance prediction method 1978 ittc method is an extrapolation procedure which uses the model tests for the prediction of hydrodynamic performance of full scale ship especially resistance and propulsion characteristics of a ship at full scale can be extrapolated by applying the instructions of ittc 2017a and ittc 2017b the method is briefly summarized here for the completeness of the paper for propulsion tests non dimensional thrust t and torque q coefficients are given as follows 8 k t t ρ n 2 d 4 9 k q q ρ n 2 d 5 here ρ is the density of fluid n is the revolution rate of propeller and d is the diameter of propeller furthermore j t is the advance coefficient of propeller which is calculated by thrust identity and effective wake fraction w t can then be calculated as 10 w t 1 j t n d v thrust reduction t coefficient represents increased ship resistance due to propeller induced negative pressure and it can be calculated as 11 t t f d r t t where r t is total resistance of the hull f d is the skin friction correction and it is implemented such as an additional thrust force in the model scale measurements and or solutions f d aims to ensure that the model propeller and the full scale propeller operate under similar loading conditions f d force can be calculated as follows 12 f d 1 2 ρ m s m v m 2 c t m c t s here m and s subscripts represent model and ship scales respectively the effective wake at full scale can then be calculated empirically with ittc recommendation ittc 2017b as 13 w t s t 0 04 w t m t 0 04 1 k c f s δ c f 1 k c f m where 1 k is the form factor evaluated by prohaska 1966 δc f is the roughness allowance c f is derived from ittc 1957 model ship correlation line versus re numbers r e v l ν where v is the advance velocity of hull l is the length of hull and ν is the kinematic viscosity for both model and ship scale and it is expressed by 14 c f 0 075 log r e 2 2 4 numerical setup 4 1 boundary conditions and grid structure the dimensions of computational domain should be large enough to well capture the flow field around the hull taking into account the computational costs kahramanoglu et al 2020 dimensions of the computational domain were determined as recommended by ittc 2011 and delen and bal 2019 the origin point of the domain is intersection point of fore perpendicular fp with the loaded waterline and the dimensions 1 x l pp 3 1 5 y l pp 1 5 1 5 z l pp 0 5 concerning origin were chosen as in the streamwise x direction transversal y direction and upward z direction respectively entry to the domain from the foreside of the ship was defined as velocity inlet boundary condition and it generates uniform velocity distribution similarly top and bottom planes of the domain were defined as velocity inlet too the outlet of domain was defined as the pressure outlet and it imposes zero pressure gradient at the boundary the hull surface of kcs was defined as the no slip wall which imposes all velocity components at the surface of ship is zero two additional boundaries have been defined in the simulation as the overset boundary to capture the vertical motion of the hull during the self propulsion computations and rotating region to simulate the propeller flow dimensions of the computational domain and the boundary conditions are shown in fig 3 the symmetry boundary condition has been defined for the boundaries on both the port side and the starboard side of the ship with symmetry boundary conditions on the far sides it is ensured that the flow is not affected by any reflection there are few options to simulate moving boundaries in computational ship hydrodynamics such as analytical weighted re gridding mesh morphing or dynamic overset approaches stern et al 2013 the dynamic overset method on the self propulsion problem is suitable for several benchmark hull geometries by simulating the motion including free to sink and trim cases carrica et al 2010 shen et al 2015 in these simulations there are three main domains as the overset region to model the ship motion rotating region to simulate the propeller rotation and background region that contains the rest of the computational domain two types of the grid have been used to model the static and dynamic regions in the simulations overset grid that is a dynamic type of grid can move freely with the dynamic body and the flow properties can be transferred to the background region by minimizing the undesirable grid distortion benek et al 1986 the dimensions of overset grid have been specified as 0 12 x l pp 1 12 0 12 y l pp 0 12 and 0 12 z l pp 0 12 in the x y and z directions respectively the propeller zone has been modeled as a discrete region from the rest of the computational domain rigid and static types of the grid have been used for background region and the interconnections of the regions have been adjusted by defining the interface surfaces between them the overset region around the hull rotating region of the propeller zone and the background region is shown with grid structure in fig 4 for m1 from the smallest model to the full scale ship the grid structure was systematically refined in terms of cell size in this study fvm finite volume method and trimmer mesh algorithm have been applied for spatial discretization trimmer mesh algorithm enables to avoid tetrahedral elements and the computational domain has been discretized to fully unstructured hexahedral elements even for complex geometries cd adapco 2017 local mesh refinements have been employed by defining additional control volumes in the simulations overset region free surface and rotating zone of the propeller have local mesh settings furthermore geometric curvatures at the bow and stern regions are higher than that at the parallel mid body so additional control volumes are necessary for these regions therefore relatively finer meshes have been generated in these control volumes to well capture the flow field and kelvin wave pattern because of relatively higher pressure gradients the general representation of these control volumes is shown for m1 in fig 5 the control volumes for the other models and the full scale ship have been expanded taking into account the scales mesh structure around the propeller and rudder is shown in fig 6 for m1 model number of elements in overset rotating and background regions for all scales of kcs are given in table 3 4 2 solution strategy as stated above the fvm method has been used to discretize the governing equations a segregated strategy was used for each state variable of the flow solution and the connection between the continuity and momentum equations was carried out by simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equations algorithm second order upwind scheme was used for the convective terms in the governing equation and first order euler implicit scheme was used for transient terms flow field has been considered as a fully turbulent and the realizable k ε has been implemented to simulate turbulent flow ittc mentioned that the two equation turbulence models are suitable for computational ship hydrodynamics problems ittc 2011 querard et al 2008 stated that k ε model is more economical than k ω model computationally around 25 in terms of cpu time realizable version of k ε model was derived from the standard k ε model with some modifications while the standard model can be handled for boundary layer flows over prediction of turbulence viscosity is occurred in flow field which has a massive separation or high mean shear rate so in the realizable k ε model turbulence viscosity term was revised to overcome incorrect physical approaches and dissipation term was also modified by adding a function shih et al 1994 with the two equation turbulence models two possible scenarios occur for near wall modeling these are the usage of near wall turbulence models or treatment of the wall functions ittc 2014a although the near wall model is more compatible with the physical considerations of the problem it is a necessity to keep y value under one y 1 for the model and this condition causes some difficulties such as the requirement of a great number of elements or numerical instabilities when wall function was used this limitation is removed and y range can increase to the range 30 y 300 in this study y values for all computations satisfied this condition furthermore used two layer y wall treatment enables a wall function to handle both low y 1 and high y 30 y values with a more robust solution cd adapco 2017 the flow field has been simulated as multiphase by using the vof method developed by hirt and nichols 1981 all cases had 2 dof to compute heave and pitch motions with the dfbi dynamic fluid body interaction method rotation of the propeller has been achieved by the rbm method sliding mesh technique which discretizes the propeller to rigid meshes and rotates that region at a specified revolution of the propeller although the rbm method is not the most cost effective way to model propeller the method is more capable over other propeller modeling methods to capture the flow field around the propeller sezen and bal 2020 time step selection is an important part of self propulsion analyses because propellers have relatively high revolution rates and compatible time steps should be specified for simulations the time step between 0 5 and 2 degrees of propeller rotation per time interval is recommended by ittc 2014b and the time step selection has been made to rotate the propeller one degree for all computations 5 numerical results first a verification study was performed for model family and full scale kcs hull to determine the numerical uncertainty after verification study self propulsion computations were made and propulsive parameters have been estimated for each member of the model family and full scale kcs it is aimed to get full scale effective wake fraction by modification of telfer s geosim extrapolation method telfer s geosim method was originally presented for ship resistance even though the method gives accurate results for ship resistance predictions it was used in limited numbers of research due to high costs for practical purposes bertram 2012 today instead of model tests cfd simulations can be applied safely it is possible to use geosim based methods in computational studies lee et al 2018 terziev et al 2019 especially in the study for kcs hull appended with rudder delen and bal 2019 applied telfer s geosim method and successfully predicted the full scale ship resistance without any separation process of resistance components unlike recommended by ittc and other conventional methods the mathematical model set up for resistance analysis has been expanded to the study of propulsion characteristics the f d values in table 5 are slightly different from the f d forces of efd experimental fluid dynamics results because the cfd results of both the geosim series and the full scale ship in the delen and bal 2019 were used for the f d calculation propeller open water characteristics were also required to calculate the propulsive parameters and these experimental values were acquired from the report of national maritime research institute fujisawa et al 2000 as stated in the study of castro et al 2011 since the scale effect is negligible in propeller open water characteristics experimental open water characteristics were used for the advance coefficient j t obtained by thrust identity all cfd analyses have been carried out for the cases in which the hull and propeller are included propulsive parameters were examined by considering a significant change of re number from model scales to full scale with the geosim based method used in this study effective wake fraction w t was predicted as a function of re number and the viscous effects depending on re number have been included in the extrapolation method 5 1 verification study in this study uncertainty estimation was made for numerical simulations by using grid convergence index gci method gci method was presented by roache 1998 firstly and several improvements have been adopted to the method ittc recommends the method to calculate numerical uncertainty in computational ship hydrodynamics studies ittc 2011 predominant component of total uncertainty usually arises from spatial discretization so only this component was considered in this study numerical uncertainty analyses were performed according to celik et al 2008 and a brief explanation is given below all scales of kcs hull were included in the uncertainty assessment because uncertainty of each case has an important role on total uncertainty for scale effect studies uncertainty estimation was made for total resistance coefficients of kcs hull half of the hull geometry was used because of symmetric geometry and flow properties in resistance computations after uncertainty estimation the grid structure has been determined and then adjusted to the self propulsion computations let n 1 n 2 and n 3 be total number of elements for different grid structures which are prepared for uncertainty assessment and h 1 h 2 and h 3 are corresponding grid sizes refinement rates r21 and r32 are as follows 15 r 21 h 2 h 1 r 32 h 3 h 2 celik et al 2008 stated that the refinement rate should be greater than 1 3 grid refinement was taken as 2 in the numerical studies ozdemir et al 2016 tezdogan et al 2015 in this study the refinement rate was taken as r 1 3 approximately for successive grids ε 21 and ε 32 represents difference between interested results of the successive grids ε 21 x 2 x 1 and ε 32 x 3 x 2 and convergence condition r parameter is defined as follows 16 r ε 21 ε 32 two convergence possibilities are expected at the end of verification studies 0 r 1 means that the solution is monotonically convergent 1 r 0 means that the solution has oscillatory convergence further explanations about the uncertainty assessment process can be found in celik et al 2008 numerical uncertainty results for all cases of kcs hull are presented in table 4 φ i values represent the total resistance coefficients of the interested refinement rate and gci parameter shows the uncertainty value in table 4 r parameters are in the range of 0 1 for each case so the characteristics of the solution sets are monotonically convergent furthermore calculated uncertainties are lower than 0 5 for the model family while the value is 3 52 for the full scale 5 2 self propulsion results self propelled characteristics for model family and full scale of kcs hull are comprehensively presented in this section with some other numerical and experimental results comparatively experimental propulsion factors of kcs hull have been provided by cfd workshops for m3 hino 2005 larsson et al 2018 2013 experimental study for the m3 model and the numerical study of castro et al 2011 for the full scale kcs were performed without a rudder while the numerical study of song et al 2019 presented the results w and w o rudder in this study all simulations have been carried out with a rudder fr number for model family and full scale ship is set to 0 26 and the 2 dof condition has been applied to determine sinkage and trim values with the propeller effect skin friction correction f d force has been calculated for each model as described in section 3 3 above and added to the thrust force generated by the propeller during the determination of self propulsion point in this way in line with ittc s recommendation the f d forces were acted as an additional thrust force and the propeller rate of revolution was recorded where the sum of the thrust forces equals the total resistance ittc 2017b the propeller rate of revolution has been determined by changing the value and checking the balance of thrust and resistance forces iteratively computed self propulsion characteristics of the model family with rudder are given in table 5 non dimensional sinkage quantities σ σ l p p of geosim series and full scale ship are almost the same as expected this shows that dimensional sinkage values can be extrapolated linearly the negative sinkage represents the hull moving in the direction of gravity with the negative pressure effect created by the propeller the sinkage quantities in the case of self propulsion have slightly increased as compared to the sinkage quantities in the resistance tests sinkage values in the resistance tests are given in delen and bal 2019 trim quantities τ of hulls are almost the same although the trim value of the full scale ship was slightly different the self propulsion points of the hulls decreased curvilinearly with the re number from the smallest model to the full scale with the f d force the k t values of the models and consequently j t values are obtained almost at the same level table 6 shows the self propulsion factors of kcs hull at full scale the results of the full scale cfd analysis have been compared with the available ones in the literature in this study the kcs hull appended with a rudder the total resistance coefficient in the self propelled case c t sp has been estimated to be approximately 3 different from song s c t sp result in the case of the rudder the self propulsion point of full scale kcs hull is close to the one given in song et al 2020 due to the rudder effect the k t quantity is a little higher than those given in song et al 2020 and castro et al 2011 as expected the relative difference for k t between the study of song et al 2020 and the present one is 1 7 in the case of the rudder the thrust deduction 1 t value is also within the range of results given in other studies j t value obtained by thrust identity is also similar to other studies in table 6 it can be noted that self propulsion results at full scale are compatible with those of other numerical solutions 5 3 effective wake results in propulsion analysis proper modeling of propeller hull interaction determines the accuracy of the self propulsion estimation the effective wake coefficient that helps to interpret the concordance of the propeller with hull refers to the advance ship speed v s and the average speed of incoming flow to the propeller v a thrust identity method has been applied for calculation of effective wake fraction first k t thrust coefficient of propeller and n rate of revolution of propeller are calculated from self propulsion analysis j t advance coefficient is later calculated by using this k t in the propeller open water pow curve v a average velocity in the propeller disc is then calculated by considering ittc s recommendations 17 v a j t n d taylor wake fraction w t can be calculated as follows 18 w t 1 v a v s by doing so it is possible to compare the computed wake fractions with those of song et al 2020 the flow diagram for computation of effective wake fraction is shown in fig 7 the nominal wake characteristics of kcs at model and full scale were examined in delen and bal 2019 and the nominal wake fraction w n of the full scale was successfully estimated by the geosim method effective wake fraction can be evaluated by considering either the magnitude of averaged incoming velocity to propeller disc or just axial component of incoming velocity components of incoming velocity can also be investigated separately to make a comprehensive assessment of the wake field in fig 8 the axial velocity component is presented at a plane behind the propeller x l pp 0 9911 as a contour plot and compared with the experimental results for the m3 model there are two differences from the experimental case the first one is the presence of the rudder and the second one is the application of different f d forces due to the effect of the rudder on resistance computations it can be noted that axial velocities decrease around the propeller center by the hub effect and acceleration occurs in the outward direction from the center to blade tips as a common pattern maximum velocities occur in the starboard side depending propeller rotation direction clockwise view from stern although axial velocity distributions have considerable similarities the main discrepancy between two results arises from the presence of the rudder in the present study the rudder intersects the measurement plane and changes the flow field the rudder causes local velocity decreases due to generating boundary layer around itself and axial velocity distribution differs due to the same reason furthermore each component of the velocity has been calculated at both model and full scale at the intersection line of x l pp 0 9911 and z l pp 0 03 planes first axial velocities with and without propeller for the geosim series and full scale ship at the intersection line of the respective planes are shown in fig 9 while nominal axial velocity profiles were derived from the resistance simulations from the study of delen and bal 2019 effective axial profiles were obtained from self propulsion simulations performed in present study the axial velocity profiles with and without propeller are increasing consistently from the smallest model to the full scale ship it can be clearly seen the effective axial velocity profiles have higher axial velocities than the nominal ones due to the propeller induced velocities in the corresponding range of propeller diameters the velocity profiles along the line probe are also shown separately for axial horizontal and vertical velocities at the model and full scale in figs 10 12 respectively the velocity profiles are compared with the experimental data of hino 2005 for the m3 model λ 31 60 and the numerical result of castro et al 2011 at full scale note that the experimental and numerical results in other studies have been made in the case of no rudder of kcs hull while the present study has been performed with the appended rudder this comparison shows that the rudder has a significant effect on the wake field clearly fig 10 shows the axial velocity as compared with experiments note that there is a good correlation between numerical results and experiments except for the region where the flow is forced to stagnation due to the presence of the rudder therefore the results show that there is no data between 0 0012l pp because the measurement plane intersects with the rudder in that range the overall difference between models and full scale for axial velocity can be seen clearly here this is due to the effect of boundary layer and viscous shear stresses since the models and the ship s re numbers are quite different fig 11 shows the horizontal u y component of the velocity at the intersection line of x l pp 0 9911 and z l pp 0 03 planes the velocity profiles both at model scales and full scale are in a good agreement and full scale velocity values are slightly higher than those at model scales out of some local rudder region the behavior of the curves is very similar nevertheless it is obvious that the velocities are different from experiments in the rudder range of the present study the horizontal velocity values are affected by the viscous effects nearby rudder while the results have good compliance again with the experiments in the outward direction from the rudder it should also be noted that the velocity values are lower than the axial ones because the propeller induces much dominant flow in the axial direction vertical velocity components u z are also shown in fig 12 and the results seem to be quite compatible with the experiments it can be noted that the vertical velocity components by the present method are slightly lower at the model scales and full scale as also stated earlier there is no data in the rudder domain due to the intersection of the rudder with the measurement plane and the velocity components are in a good agreement with experiments except this region the axial velocity components at model scales and full scale are shown on the same plane for all cases x l pp 0 9911 studied here in fig 13 it is clear from the figure that the boundary layer around the stern form is getting thinner if the re number increases it is also obvious that the axial velocity increases gradually from m1 to fs ship from this point of view it can be noted that the viscous effects have a significant role in the axial velocity component in the wake field it should also be reported that the similar wake patterns occur for all cases studied here the contours of axial velocity of kcs hull at model scales and full scale are shown just on propeller disk in fig 14 the effective wake fractions are also included in the same figure the axial velocity component has been made non dimensional by ship velocity note that the velocity patterns of the model family and full scale ship show similarity furthermore it can also be observed that the axial velocities increase from the smallest scale m1 to the full scale ship neatly it can be reported that the viscous effects cause a significant effect on the wake field it can also be noted that the wake fraction has decreased quantitatively from model scale to full scale as also shown in fig 15 1978 ittc extrapolation technique is also applied using the effective wake fraction at each model scale thus full scale factors have been estimated separately for each member of the model family and these results are given in table 7 full scale cfd computed directly no extrapolation method and geosim results are also presented in table 7 the relative differences for each extrapolated wake fraction have been calculated according to the full scale cfd result as follows 19 δ w t 100 w t w t c f d w t c f d note that the geosim method predicts the effective wake fraction at full scale more successfully than the 1978 ittc method in fig 15 effective wake fractions by full scale cfd geosim and 1978 ittc methods are also shown for all model family and full scale kcs the coefficients in equation 7 have been calculated as a 1 159 107 b 0 220 and x 9 894 full scale ittc extrapolations have been obtained by using each model scale cfd results geosim curve is more compatible with full scale cfd results than any ittc result 6 conclusion in this study ship propulsion problem has been investigated for a benchmark kcs hull by telfer s geosim method based on cfd in all simulations free to heave and pitch motion cases were considered rotation of propeller was performed with the rbm method which enables the presence of propeller in the simulation model self propulsion factors and wake field characteristics have been validated with the experimental results in the literature the self propulsion and wake field computed by the present method also have harmony with similar numerical results in the literature after the validation study the geosim method has been applied for effective wake fraction by using three different model scales effective wake fraction curve has been obtained by the geosim method for kcs form at a constant froude number fr 0 26 and thus the wake parameter for any given re number can be estimated 1978 ittc method has also been used as another extrapolation method to estimate wake fraction and the comparison was expanded the effective wake fraction at full scale of kcs hull was estimated with 2 42 relative difference by geosim method while the minimum ittc result is far away above 11 compared to full scale cfd result the other results by 1978 ittc method have around 18 and 25 relative differences this study shows that geosim approach based on cfd makes the method more practical by removing the need of experiments and the method is not only applicable in ship resistance problem but also valid for effective wake estimations geosim method has been exhibited a successful prediction about the effective wake fraction compared to the 1978 ittc method by considering viscous effects directly in terms of re number furthermore geosim method required less cpu time to estimate full scale effective wake fractions than direct cfd simulations at full scale as the number of appendages increases geosim method is expected to give more accurate results this is because viscous effects are getting more dominant with increasing number of appendages and the method includes these effects directly to the computations the method provides more compatible approach with physical aspects and claims more accurate results than other conventional methods from these points of view geosim method is an alternative way to estimate effective wake fraction at

21297,in this study the effective wake factors of a self propelled container ship were investigated by telfer s geosim method based on cfd computational fluid dynamics for this purpose the self propulsion characteristics of kcs kriso container ship at three different model scales and full scale were determined at fr 0 26 by unsteady rans reynolds averaged navier stokes solver all scales corresponded to a wide range of reynolds numbers turbulent flow around the kcs hull has been investigated by the k ε turbulence model heave and pitch motions of kcs hulls have been modeled with the dfbi dynamic fluid body interaction method and overset mesh technique the rotational motion of kp505 propeller has been simulated using the rbm rigid body motion approach the result obtained by the extrapolation of the effective wake fraction with the geosim method was compared with the full scale ones of cfd and ittc methods the results by the geosim method are more compatible with those of full scale cfd than the results of 1978 ittc method in the wake region where viscous effects are predominant the change of effective wake fraction with reynolds number has been successfully represented by the geosim method thus more robust and reliable results have been found keywords geosim series effective wake fraction self propulsion full scale kcs rigid body motion scale effect 1 introduction service and maximum velocities of ships should be set in the concept and initial design stages to achieve this the effective wake field and fraction should be calculated accurately this is due to not only the design of the wake adapted propeller but also for having optimum vibration acoustic properties of the ship in general resistance and propulsion characteristics including effective wake are obtained at model scale and then the computed and or measured results are extrapolated to full scaled ship although simulation of flow around a ship at full scale is possible with developed processing capability it is not an efficient way yet due to expensive computational costs since the self propulsion analysis needs a small time step therefore extrapolation techniques are still important to predict the full scale ship results accurately propeller hull interaction is on the other hand one of the most important issues in cfd computational fluid dynamics analyses of self propelled ships there are several approaches for propulsion simulations such as virtual disc mrf moving reference frame and rbm rigid body motion methods while other methods model the propeller indirectly the rbm method enables to simulate the propeller physically in the simulation setup delen et al 2019 recently the rbm approach became a popular method to simulate the propeller hull interactions castro et al 2011 made self propulsion computations for kcs kriso container ship hull at full scale which is a benchmark form in naval hydrodynamics three cases have been considered propeller open water performance resistance test and self propelled condition at full scale the results of this study have been used for comparison with the results of the present study in section 5 bugalski and hoffmann 2011 also used the same method which separates the mesh domain into two regions one as a rotating cylinder around the propeller and the rest of the computational domain in the study of shen et al 2015 self propulsion analyses were performed for kcs with overset to estimate the vertical motion and a rotation controller was used to catch the self propulsion point wang et al 2016 investigated the propulsion characteristics of a benchmark form onr tumblehome using unsteady rans reynolds averaged navier stokes solver with an overset method to solve the vertical motion and rbm method to solve the propeller hull interaction sezen et al 2018 compared the body force method based on actuator disc and self propelled cases for benchmark darpa the defense advanced research projects agency submarine form it was noted that with the self propulsion scenario propulsive efficiency was predicted higher than that of the body force method and the reason for this can be the modeling of propeller hull interaction successfully in another study bekhit 2018 examined the actuator disc and rbm motion method for benchmark jbc japanese bulk carrier hull and indicated that especially around the propeller actuator disc is incapable to solve flow field accurately kinaci et al 2018 used an iterative method which is called spe self propulsion estimation to predict the self propulsion point by using open water propeller characteristics and bare hull resistance values lungu 2018 investigated the resistance open water propeller and self propulsion performance of kcs hull and pointed out that although the sliding grid technique is not cost effective computationally it is the most compatible way to solve unsteady interaction between the propeller and hull in the study of jasak et al 2018 self propulsion analyses were performed with the actuator disc model for two different types of full scale ships and the numerical results were compared with those of sea trials grid sensitivity analyses were also done for the self propulsion point in the study in another study the free surface effect on self propulsion characteristics of joubert bb2 which is a benchmark submarine form was estimated using a dynamic overset technique to change the level of submarine under the free surface carrica et al 2019 in other studies gokce et al 2019 and kinaci et al 2020 used the spe iterative method based on propeller open water performance and empirical approaches they applied the method to jbc and dtc duisburg test case hulls respectively and compared the results with unsteady rans results of direct self propulsion analyses sun et al 2020 carried out a sliding mesh technique to implement the rbm and simulate the propeller at full scale for self propulsion analyses results by sea trials were compared with those of numerical method and the roughness effect was also included in the computations in the study of wu et al 2019 resistance self propulsion and flow field characteristics of kcs hull were considered in waves as well as in calm water the propeller effect was simulated using velocity components from the blade element theory and these data were provided to unsteady rans solver as an input data experimental and computational analyses were performed and the results compared with each other in detail it was stated that the numerical and experimental results were in good agreement on the other hand the wake characteristics of a ship have a significant effect on the ship s propulsive performance the nominal wake is measured and or computed at the propeller disc without propeller while the effective wake is calculated by considering the propeller induced velocities at the same disc when the propeller is providing the thrust force to drive the hull at the design speed as indicated in miller and brizzolara 2019 the nominal wake characteristics can provide the main input for the initial design of the propeller operating behind the ship however the effective wake should be calculated for the wake adapted propeller carlton 2012 there is a very complicated interaction between the hull and propeller and this affects the wake properties significantly rijpkema et al 2013 investigated the propeller hull interaction problem by using a coupling approach of bem and rans steady state rans and unsteady bem were performed sequentially to obtain nominal wake and distribute propeller loading they suggested to calculate effective wake by subtracting propeller induced velocities from total wake field with the coupled method kinnas et al 2013 investigated effective wake of a ducted propeller with a coupling of bem and a wall transpiration model in order to adopt boundary layer solver to panel method they indicated that the results by hybrid method and rans simulations are in a good agreement wang et al 2016 made an investigation about the wake field of self propelled kcs hull with a geosim geometrically similar and a non geosim model which is called as smart dummy model to figure out the wake factors a smart dummy model was generated under some geometric limitations such as keeping the gap between the hull and shaft as same compatible results were obtained for the smart dummy with the geosim model regener et al 2018 examined the propeller hull interaction problem by considering the wake characteristics and cavitation effect at model and full scales a coupled solution method was used by bem for propeller and rans for flow around ship it was stated that model scale nominal and effective wakes led to a significant underestimation of the cavitation parameters farkas et al 2018 presented a detailed comparison of turbulence models and extrapolation methods for resistance and self propulsion characteristics in this study the nominal wake of a full scale ship was computed at different draughts and compared with each other in addition to the previous study farkas et al 2019 made double body simulations for a full scale ship to determine the resistance and wake characteristics the effects of the turbulence models on the wake field were also discussed in the study sun et al 2019 examined the nominal wake field of a four screw ship experimentally and numerically a numerical study was done for a geosim family without considering the free surface effects the results showed that the nominal wake increased towards full scale and the computational results were compatible with the experimental wake results in another study sun et al 2019 investigated the propeller loading and propulsion performance of kcs hull in terms of effective wake fraction they proposed an iterative coupling with bem and rans methods and stated that the relative difference between the proposed method and fully rans results is in a relatively lower level while the coupled method needs less computational time solak 2020 studied on aft form optimization to reduce the viscous resistance of a ship using metamodeling techniques between the optimized hull and the original hull were also made examinations on the nominal wake one of the key problems in ship hydrodynamics is the scale effect e g effective and nominal wake form factor appendage resistance etc caused by the mismatch of the re reynolds numbers between model and ship on the other hand the scale effect or the extrapolation of viscous phenomena can be consistently examined the change of the related feature according to the re numbers by geosim series in the study of lee et al 2018 geometrically similar model families were considered for different types of benchmark ships to calculate the form factor at full scale using logarithmic reynolds number based extrapolation method in another study three different model scales of kcs considered based on the geosim approach for ship resistance terziev et al 2019 both double body and multiphase analyses were performed to estimate the form factor and total resistance delen and bal 2019 investigated telfer s geosim method on total ship resistance by using cfd analyses instead of model tests geometrically similar model family of kcs hull was generated according to telfer s propositions and model tests were replaced by cfd analyses furthermore the method was revisited to obtain a more accurate extrapolation approach and the results were compared with those of the 1978 ittc the international towing tank conference method and full scale cfd results it was noted that telfer s geosim method has a high accuracy to predict the results at full scale compared to other conventional extrapolation methods this study has been a basis for the present study and detailed explanations are given in the following sections dogrul et al 2020 carried out numerical resistance analyses of kcs and kvlcc2 hulls at different scales with both free surface and double body simulations the scale effect on each component of total ship resistance was discussed in detail it is known that telfer s geosim method was originally developed to calculate the total resistance of a ship by using test results of models at different scales it is indeed a very effective way of extrapolating of test results from model scale to full scale it is also regarded as the most accurate prediction method among others and avoids theoretically the decomposition of total resistance bertram 2012 molland et al 2011 it was used only for research purposes since the costs for model tests were very high for practical purposes in the past but now cfd can be used instead of model tests and it has been shown that the method is a very effective alternative way delen and bal 2019 in the present study telfer s geosim method has been applied to obtain an accurate extrapolation technique to predict the effective wake fraction of full scale kcs hull a model family has been generated with three different scale ratios and then propulsion analyses have been performed at fr 0 26 and the corresponding re numbers for this model family and full scale ship the propulsion results and effective wake patterns have been validated with the available experimental and computational results then the effective wake fraction results of the geosim series have been extrapolated to full scale by using modified telfer s geosim method the change of the effective wake fraction concerning the re number has been successfully represented by the geosim method the comparison of the full scale effective wake fraction has been also presented with those obtained from the 1978 ittc method and full scale cfd results the results obtained with the geosim method are much well matched with the full scale results compared to the ones obtained with the 1978 ittc method with the geosim method more reliable and robust results have been obtained since the effect of the re number on the viscous flow phenomena around the hull can be examined more accurately 2 ship and propeller geometry benchmark case kcs hull was frequently used in various numbers of computational and experimental studies especially in tokyo 2015 larsson et al 2018 gothenburg 2010 larsson et al 2013 and tokyo 2005 hino 2005 cfd workshops was selected for investigation of effective wake fraction topic with geosim series in this study a geometrically similar model family has been generated for the hull geometry to consider telfer s suggestions telfer 1927 the model family consists of three different scaled models of kcs geometry and computational study has been performed at fr 0 26 for these models for two members of the model family scale ratios λ 37 89 and λ 31 60 a comprehensive benchmarking study has been made with experimental and computational cases in cfd workshops mentioned above an additional model scale has been selected as λ 60 75 in this study computational as well as experimental resistance characteristics of kcs hull have been presented in the studies of delen and bal 2019 2015 the main particulars of kcs hull and the corresponding kp505 propeller are given in tables 1 and 2 respectively the views of the kcs hull and the kp505 propeller are also shown in figs 1 and 2 respectively here m1 m2 m3 and fs represent model 1 model 2 model 3 and full scale ship respectively 3 theoretical background 3 1 governing equations in this study the flow around hulls is considered as three dimensional unsteady and incompressible under these conditions the continuity equation is 1 u i x i 0 the rans equations are also expressed as follows 2 u i t u i u j x j 1 ρ p x i u i u j x j ν 2 u i x j 2 here u i is mean velocity i subscript represents the ith direction of the cartesian coordinate system ρ is the density of fluid p is the mean pressure τ ij τ i j u i u j is the reynolds stress term and ν is the kinematic viscosity of fluid the turbulent flow region is simulated by using the two equation k ε turbulence model modeling of reynolds stresses τ ij is performed in this way in the standard model k is the turbulence kinetic energy and ε is the rate of dissipation and the expressions of these parameters are given below 3 k t x j k u j τ ij u i x j ε x j ν ν t σ k k x j 4 ε t x j ε u j c ε 1 ε k τ i j u i x j c ε 2 ε 2 k x j v v t σ ε ε x j here ν t is the turbulence viscosity and calculated as ν t c μ k 2 ε c ε1 1 44 c ε2 1 92 c μ 0 09 σ k 1 0 σ ε 1 3 are the model coefficients based on statistical methods further explanation can be found in wilcox 2006 3 2 telfer s geosim method it is known that to provide both geometric and dynamic similarity in the investigation of ship resistance the corresponding re number and fr number of the ship and model must be the same the total resistance of a ship can be written as follows 5 r t ρ s v 2 f f r r e this similarity is generally difficult to satisfy conventional methods however satisfy the partial dynamic similarity by equalizing only fr numbers to get practical solutions and total resistance is decomposed into its components such as viscous and wave drags on the other hand telfer proposed a different approach to estimate the ship total resistance telfer 1927 telfer generated the geosim model series and measured total ship resistance at least two different model scales he then plotted the non dimensional resistance coefficient versus reynolds number in the logarithmic scale thus the total resistance of a ship could easily be extrapolated using the result of geosim series there is no need for any separation of total resistance into its components here the total resistance coefficient is written as a function of re number as follows 6 c t a log r e x b telfer suggested x power be taken as 1 3 bertram 2012 so a and b variables can be calculated easily by resistance coefficients of two models therefore a system of linear equations is obtained and can be solved easily in this study x power has been assumed to be an unknown and three models at different scales are required to solve a and b variables and x power a nonlinear equation can then be obtained the same can be written for effective wake fraction as follows 7 w t a log r e x b the unknowns a b and x in equation 7 were calculated by a nonlinear curve fitting method note that the coefficients a b and x for different ships will change there are no universal coefficients the point here is to propose a simple and accurate alternative extrapolation technique based on cfd of computing effective wake fraction at full scale rather than suggesting a generalized regression function geosim method needs data in three different model scales but cfd produces results in small scales very quickly and consumes not so much resources as in full scale this is the advantage of the method the method can also be applied to much complex hull forms with different appendages as the number of appendages increases geosim method is expected to give more accurate results this is because viscous effects are getting more dominant with increasing number of appendages and the method includes these effects directly to the computations these modifications make it possible to estimate full scale effective wake fraction in terms of re number accurately 3 3 1978 ittc performance prediction method 1978 ittc method is an extrapolation procedure which uses the model tests for the prediction of hydrodynamic performance of full scale ship especially resistance and propulsion characteristics of a ship at full scale can be extrapolated by applying the instructions of ittc 2017a and ittc 2017b the method is briefly summarized here for the completeness of the paper for propulsion tests non dimensional thrust t and torque q coefficients are given as follows 8 k t t ρ n 2 d 4 9 k q q ρ n 2 d 5 here ρ is the density of fluid n is the revolution rate of propeller and d is the diameter of propeller furthermore j t is the advance coefficient of propeller which is calculated by thrust identity and effective wake fraction w t can then be calculated as 10 w t 1 j t n d v thrust reduction t coefficient represents increased ship resistance due to propeller induced negative pressure and it can be calculated as 11 t t f d r t t where r t is total resistance of the hull f d is the skin friction correction and it is implemented such as an additional thrust force in the model scale measurements and or solutions f d aims to ensure that the model propeller and the full scale propeller operate under similar loading conditions f d force can be calculated as follows 12 f d 1 2 ρ m s m v m 2 c t m c t s here m and s subscripts represent model and ship scales respectively the effective wake at full scale can then be calculated empirically with ittc recommendation ittc 2017b as 13 w t s t 0 04 w t m t 0 04 1 k c f s δ c f 1 k c f m where 1 k is the form factor evaluated by prohaska 1966 δc f is the roughness allowance c f is derived from ittc 1957 model ship correlation line versus re numbers r e v l ν where v is the advance velocity of hull l is the length of hull and ν is the kinematic viscosity for both model and ship scale and it is expressed by 14 c f 0 075 log r e 2 2 4 numerical setup 4 1 boundary conditions and grid structure the dimensions of computational domain should be large enough to well capture the flow field around the hull taking into account the computational costs kahramanoglu et al 2020 dimensions of the computational domain were determined as recommended by ittc 2011 and delen and bal 2019 the origin point of the domain is intersection point of fore perpendicular fp with the loaded waterline and the dimensions 1 x l pp 3 1 5 y l pp 1 5 1 5 z l pp 0 5 concerning origin were chosen as in the streamwise x direction transversal y direction and upward z direction respectively entry to the domain from the foreside of the ship was defined as velocity inlet boundary condition and it generates uniform velocity distribution similarly top and bottom planes of the domain were defined as velocity inlet too the outlet of domain was defined as the pressure outlet and it imposes zero pressure gradient at the boundary the hull surface of kcs was defined as the no slip wall which imposes all velocity components at the surface of ship is zero two additional boundaries have been defined in the simulation as the overset boundary to capture the vertical motion of the hull during the self propulsion computations and rotating region to simulate the propeller flow dimensions of the computational domain and the boundary conditions are shown in fig 3 the symmetry boundary condition has been defined for the boundaries on both the port side and the starboard side of the ship with symmetry boundary conditions on the far sides it is ensured that the flow is not affected by any reflection there are few options to simulate moving boundaries in computational ship hydrodynamics such as analytical weighted re gridding mesh morphing or dynamic overset approaches stern et al 2013 the dynamic overset method on the self propulsion problem is suitable for several benchmark hull geometries by simulating the motion including free to sink and trim cases carrica et al 2010 shen et al 2015 in these simulations there are three main domains as the overset region to model the ship motion rotating region to simulate the propeller rotation and background region that contains the rest of the computational domain two types of the grid have been used to model the static and dynamic regions in the simulations overset grid that is a dynamic type of grid can move freely with the dynamic body and the flow properties can be transferred to the background region by minimizing the undesirable grid distortion benek et al 1986 the dimensions of overset grid have been specified as 0 12 x l pp 1 12 0 12 y l pp 0 12 and 0 12 z l pp 0 12 in the x y and z directions respectively the propeller zone has been modeled as a discrete region from the rest of the computational domain rigid and static types of the grid have been used for background region and the interconnections of the regions have been adjusted by defining the interface surfaces between them the overset region around the hull rotating region of the propeller zone and the background region is shown with grid structure in fig 4 for m1 from the smallest model to the full scale ship the grid structure was systematically refined in terms of cell size in this study fvm finite volume method and trimmer mesh algorithm have been applied for spatial discretization trimmer mesh algorithm enables to avoid tetrahedral elements and the computational domain has been discretized to fully unstructured hexahedral elements even for complex geometries cd adapco 2017 local mesh refinements have been employed by defining additional control volumes in the simulations overset region free surface and rotating zone of the propeller have local mesh settings furthermore geometric curvatures at the bow and stern regions are higher than that at the parallel mid body so additional control volumes are necessary for these regions therefore relatively finer meshes have been generated in these control volumes to well capture the flow field and kelvin wave pattern because of relatively higher pressure gradients the general representation of these control volumes is shown for m1 in fig 5 the control volumes for the other models and the full scale ship have been expanded taking into account the scales mesh structure around the propeller and rudder is shown in fig 6 for m1 model number of elements in overset rotating and background regions for all scales of kcs are given in table 3 4 2 solution strategy as stated above the fvm method has been used to discretize the governing equations a segregated strategy was used for each state variable of the flow solution and the connection between the continuity and momentum equations was carried out by simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equations algorithm second order upwind scheme was used for the convective terms in the governing equation and first order euler implicit scheme was used for transient terms flow field has been considered as a fully turbulent and the realizable k ε has been implemented to simulate turbulent flow ittc mentioned that the two equation turbulence models are suitable for computational ship hydrodynamics problems ittc 2011 querard et al 2008 stated that k ε model is more economical than k ω model computationally around 25 in terms of cpu time realizable version of k ε model was derived from the standard k ε model with some modifications while the standard model can be handled for boundary layer flows over prediction of turbulence viscosity is occurred in flow field which has a massive separation or high mean shear rate so in the realizable k ε model turbulence viscosity term was revised to overcome incorrect physical approaches and dissipation term was also modified by adding a function shih et al 1994 with the two equation turbulence models two possible scenarios occur for near wall modeling these are the usage of near wall turbulence models or treatment of the wall functions ittc 2014a although the near wall model is more compatible with the physical considerations of the problem it is a necessity to keep y value under one y 1 for the model and this condition causes some difficulties such as the requirement of a great number of elements or numerical instabilities when wall function was used this limitation is removed and y range can increase to the range 30 y 300 in this study y values for all computations satisfied this condition furthermore used two layer y wall treatment enables a wall function to handle both low y 1 and high y 30 y values with a more robust solution cd adapco 2017 the flow field has been simulated as multiphase by using the vof method developed by hirt and nichols 1981 all cases had 2 dof to compute heave and pitch motions with the dfbi dynamic fluid body interaction method rotation of the propeller has been achieved by the rbm method sliding mesh technique which discretizes the propeller to rigid meshes and rotates that region at a specified revolution of the propeller although the rbm method is not the most cost effective way to model propeller the method is more capable over other propeller modeling methods to capture the flow field around the propeller sezen and bal 2020 time step selection is an important part of self propulsion analyses because propellers have relatively high revolution rates and compatible time steps should be specified for simulations the time step between 0 5 and 2 degrees of propeller rotation per time interval is recommended by ittc 2014b and the time step selection has been made to rotate the propeller one degree for all computations 5 numerical results first a verification study was performed for model family and full scale kcs hull to determine the numerical uncertainty after verification study self propulsion computations were made and propulsive parameters have been estimated for each member of the model family and full scale kcs it is aimed to get full scale effective wake fraction by modification of telfer s geosim extrapolation method telfer s geosim method was originally presented for ship resistance even though the method gives accurate results for ship resistance predictions it was used in limited numbers of research due to high costs for practical purposes bertram 2012 today instead of model tests cfd simulations can be applied safely it is possible to use geosim based methods in computational studies lee et al 2018 terziev et al 2019 especially in the study for kcs hull appended with rudder delen and bal 2019 applied telfer s geosim method and successfully predicted the full scale ship resistance without any separation process of resistance components unlike recommended by ittc and other conventional methods the mathematical model set up for resistance analysis has been expanded to the study of propulsion characteristics the f d values in table 5 are slightly different from the f d forces of efd experimental fluid dynamics results because the cfd results of both the geosim series and the full scale ship in the delen and bal 2019 were used for the f d calculation propeller open water characteristics were also required to calculate the propulsive parameters and these experimental values were acquired from the report of national maritime research institute fujisawa et al 2000 as stated in the study of castro et al 2011 since the scale effect is negligible in propeller open water characteristics experimental open water characteristics were used for the advance coefficient j t obtained by thrust identity all cfd analyses have been carried out for the cases in which the hull and propeller are included propulsive parameters were examined by considering a significant change of re number from model scales to full scale with the geosim based method used in this study effective wake fraction w t was predicted as a function of re number and the viscous effects depending on re number have been included in the extrapolation method 5 1 verification study in this study uncertainty estimation was made for numerical simulations by using grid convergence index gci method gci method was presented by roache 1998 firstly and several improvements have been adopted to the method ittc recommends the method to calculate numerical uncertainty in computational ship hydrodynamics studies ittc 2011 predominant component of total uncertainty usually arises from spatial discretization so only this component was considered in this study numerical uncertainty analyses were performed according to celik et al 2008 and a brief explanation is given below all scales of kcs hull were included in the uncertainty assessment because uncertainty of each case has an important role on total uncertainty for scale effect studies uncertainty estimation was made for total resistance coefficients of kcs hull half of the hull geometry was used because of symmetric geometry and flow properties in resistance computations after uncertainty estimation the grid structure has been determined and then adjusted to the self propulsion computations let n 1 n 2 and n 3 be total number of elements for different grid structures which are prepared for uncertainty assessment and h 1 h 2 and h 3 are corresponding grid sizes refinement rates r21 and r32 are as follows 15 r 21 h 2 h 1 r 32 h 3 h 2 celik et al 2008 stated that the refinement rate should be greater than 1 3 grid refinement was taken as 2 in the numerical studies ozdemir et al 2016 tezdogan et al 2015 in this study the refinement rate was taken as r 1 3 approximately for successive grids ε 21 and ε 32 represents difference between interested results of the successive grids ε 21 x 2 x 1 and ε 32 x 3 x 2 and convergence condition r parameter is defined as follows 16 r ε 21 ε 32 two convergence possibilities are expected at the end of verification studies 0 r 1 means that the solution is monotonically convergent 1 r 0 means that the solution has oscillatory convergence further explanations about the uncertainty assessment process can be found in celik et al 2008 numerical uncertainty results for all cases of kcs hull are presented in table 4 φ i values represent the total resistance coefficients of the interested refinement rate and gci parameter shows the uncertainty value in table 4 r parameters are in the range of 0 1 for each case so the characteristics of the solution sets are monotonically convergent furthermore calculated uncertainties are lower than 0 5 for the model family while the value is 3 52 for the full scale 5 2 self propulsion results self propelled characteristics for model family and full scale of kcs hull are comprehensively presented in this section with some other numerical and experimental results comparatively experimental propulsion factors of kcs hull have been provided by cfd workshops for m3 hino 2005 larsson et al 2018 2013 experimental study for the m3 model and the numerical study of castro et al 2011 for the full scale kcs were performed without a rudder while the numerical study of song et al 2019 presented the results w and w o rudder in this study all simulations have been carried out with a rudder fr number for model family and full scale ship is set to 0 26 and the 2 dof condition has been applied to determine sinkage and trim values with the propeller effect skin friction correction f d force has been calculated for each model as described in section 3 3 above and added to the thrust force generated by the propeller during the determination of self propulsion point in this way in line with ittc s recommendation the f d forces were acted as an additional thrust force and the propeller rate of revolution was recorded where the sum of the thrust forces equals the total resistance ittc 2017b the propeller rate of revolution has been determined by changing the value and checking the balance of thrust and resistance forces iteratively computed self propulsion characteristics of the model family with rudder are given in table 5 non dimensional sinkage quantities σ σ l p p of geosim series and full scale ship are almost the same as expected this shows that dimensional sinkage values can be extrapolated linearly the negative sinkage represents the hull moving in the direction of gravity with the negative pressure effect created by the propeller the sinkage quantities in the case of self propulsion have slightly increased as compared to the sinkage quantities in the resistance tests sinkage values in the resistance tests are given in delen and bal 2019 trim quantities τ of hulls are almost the same although the trim value of the full scale ship was slightly different the self propulsion points of the hulls decreased curvilinearly with the re number from the smallest model to the full scale with the f d force the k t values of the models and consequently j t values are obtained almost at the same level table 6 shows the self propulsion factors of kcs hull at full scale the results of the full scale cfd analysis have been compared with the available ones in the literature in this study the kcs hull appended with a rudder the total resistance coefficient in the self propelled case c t sp has been estimated to be approximately 3 different from song s c t sp result in the case of the rudder the self propulsion point of full scale kcs hull is close to the one given in song et al 2020 due to the rudder effect the k t quantity is a little higher than those given in song et al 2020 and castro et al 2011 as expected the relative difference for k t between the study of song et al 2020 and the present one is 1 7 in the case of the rudder the thrust deduction 1 t value is also within the range of results given in other studies j t value obtained by thrust identity is also similar to other studies in table 6 it can be noted that self propulsion results at full scale are compatible with those of other numerical solutions 5 3 effective wake results in propulsion analysis proper modeling of propeller hull interaction determines the accuracy of the self propulsion estimation the effective wake coefficient that helps to interpret the concordance of the propeller with hull refers to the advance ship speed v s and the average speed of incoming flow to the propeller v a thrust identity method has been applied for calculation of effective wake fraction first k t thrust coefficient of propeller and n rate of revolution of propeller are calculated from self propulsion analysis j t advance coefficient is later calculated by using this k t in the propeller open water pow curve v a average velocity in the propeller disc is then calculated by considering ittc s recommendations 17 v a j t n d taylor wake fraction w t can be calculated as follows 18 w t 1 v a v s by doing so it is possible to compare the computed wake fractions with those of song et al 2020 the flow diagram for computation of effective wake fraction is shown in fig 7 the nominal wake characteristics of kcs at model and full scale were examined in delen and bal 2019 and the nominal wake fraction w n of the full scale was successfully estimated by the geosim method effective wake fraction can be evaluated by considering either the magnitude of averaged incoming velocity to propeller disc or just axial component of incoming velocity components of incoming velocity can also be investigated separately to make a comprehensive assessment of the wake field in fig 8 the axial velocity component is presented at a plane behind the propeller x l pp 0 9911 as a contour plot and compared with the experimental results for the m3 model there are two differences from the experimental case the first one is the presence of the rudder and the second one is the application of different f d forces due to the effect of the rudder on resistance computations it can be noted that axial velocities decrease around the propeller center by the hub effect and acceleration occurs in the outward direction from the center to blade tips as a common pattern maximum velocities occur in the starboard side depending propeller rotation direction clockwise view from stern although axial velocity distributions have considerable similarities the main discrepancy between two results arises from the presence of the rudder in the present study the rudder intersects the measurement plane and changes the flow field the rudder causes local velocity decreases due to generating boundary layer around itself and axial velocity distribution differs due to the same reason furthermore each component of the velocity has been calculated at both model and full scale at the intersection line of x l pp 0 9911 and z l pp 0 03 planes first axial velocities with and without propeller for the geosim series and full scale ship at the intersection line of the respective planes are shown in fig 9 while nominal axial velocity profiles were derived from the resistance simulations from the study of delen and bal 2019 effective axial profiles were obtained from self propulsion simulations performed in present study the axial velocity profiles with and without propeller are increasing consistently from the smallest model to the full scale ship it can be clearly seen the effective axial velocity profiles have higher axial velocities than the nominal ones due to the propeller induced velocities in the corresponding range of propeller diameters the velocity profiles along the line probe are also shown separately for axial horizontal and vertical velocities at the model and full scale in figs 10 12 respectively the velocity profiles are compared with the experimental data of hino 2005 for the m3 model λ 31 60 and the numerical result of castro et al 2011 at full scale note that the experimental and numerical results in other studies have been made in the case of no rudder of kcs hull while the present study has been performed with the appended rudder this comparison shows that the rudder has a significant effect on the wake field clearly fig 10 shows the axial velocity as compared with experiments note that there is a good correlation between numerical results and experiments except for the region where the flow is forced to stagnation due to the presence of the rudder therefore the results show that there is no data between 0 0012l pp because the measurement plane intersects with the rudder in that range the overall difference between models and full scale for axial velocity can be seen clearly here this is due to the effect of boundary layer and viscous shear stresses since the models and the ship s re numbers are quite different fig 11 shows the horizontal u y component of the velocity at the intersection line of x l pp 0 9911 and z l pp 0 03 planes the velocity profiles both at model scales and full scale are in a good agreement and full scale velocity values are slightly higher than those at model scales out of some local rudder region the behavior of the curves is very similar nevertheless it is obvious that the velocities are different from experiments in the rudder range of the present study the horizontal velocity values are affected by the viscous effects nearby rudder while the results have good compliance again with the experiments in the outward direction from the rudder it should also be noted that the velocity values are lower than the axial ones because the propeller induces much dominant flow in the axial direction vertical velocity components u z are also shown in fig 12 and the results seem to be quite compatible with the experiments it can be noted that the vertical velocity components by the present method are slightly lower at the model scales and full scale as also stated earlier there is no data in the rudder domain due to the intersection of the rudder with the measurement plane and the velocity components are in a good agreement with experiments except this region the axial velocity components at model scales and full scale are shown on the same plane for all cases x l pp 0 9911 studied here in fig 13 it is clear from the figure that the boundary layer around the stern form is getting thinner if the re number increases it is also obvious that the axial velocity increases gradually from m1 to fs ship from this point of view it can be noted that the viscous effects have a significant role in the axial velocity component in the wake field it should also be reported that the similar wake patterns occur for all cases studied here the contours of axial velocity of kcs hull at model scales and full scale are shown just on propeller disk in fig 14 the effective wake fractions are also included in the same figure the axial velocity component has been made non dimensional by ship velocity note that the velocity patterns of the model family and full scale ship show similarity furthermore it can also be observed that the axial velocities increase from the smallest scale m1 to the full scale ship neatly it can be reported that the viscous effects cause a significant effect on the wake field it can also be noted that the wake fraction has decreased quantitatively from model scale to full scale as also shown in fig 15 1978 ittc extrapolation technique is also applied using the effective wake fraction at each model scale thus full scale factors have been estimated separately for each member of the model family and these results are given in table 7 full scale cfd computed directly no extrapolation method and geosim results are also presented in table 7 the relative differences for each extrapolated wake fraction have been calculated according to the full scale cfd result as follows 19 δ w t 100 w t w t c f d w t c f d note that the geosim method predicts the effective wake fraction at full scale more successfully than the 1978 ittc method in fig 15 effective wake fractions by full scale cfd geosim and 1978 ittc methods are also shown for all model family and full scale kcs the coefficients in equation 7 have been calculated as a 1 159 107 b 0 220 and x 9 894 full scale ittc extrapolations have been obtained by using each model scale cfd results geosim curve is more compatible with full scale cfd results than any ittc result 6 conclusion in this study ship propulsion problem has been investigated for a benchmark kcs hull by telfer s geosim method based on cfd in all simulations free to heave and pitch motion cases were considered rotation of propeller was performed with the rbm method which enables the presence of propeller in the simulation model self propulsion factors and wake field characteristics have been validated with the experimental results in the literature the self propulsion and wake field computed by the present method also have harmony with similar numerical results in the literature after the validation study the geosim method has been applied for effective wake fraction by using three different model scales effective wake fraction curve has been obtained by the geosim method for kcs form at a constant froude number fr 0 26 and thus the wake parameter for any given re number can be estimated 1978 ittc method has also been used as another extrapolation method to estimate wake fraction and the comparison was expanded the effective wake fraction at full scale of kcs hull was estimated with 2 42 relative difference by geosim method while the minimum ittc result is far away above 11 compared to full scale cfd result the other results by 1978 ittc method have around 18 and 25 relative differences this study shows that geosim approach based on cfd makes the method more practical by removing the need of experiments and the method is not only applicable in ship resistance problem but also valid for effective wake estimations geosim method has been exhibited a successful prediction about the effective wake fraction compared to the 1978 ittc method by considering viscous effects directly in terms of re number furthermore geosim method required less cpu time to estimate full scale effective wake fractions than direct cfd simulations at full scale as the number of appendages increases geosim method is expected to give more accurate results this is because viscous effects are getting more dominant with increasing number of appendages and the method includes these effects directly to the computations the method provides more compatible approach with physical aspects and claims more accurate results than other conventional methods from these points of view geosim method is an alternative way to estimate effective wake fraction at

21298,the microbiologically influenced corrosion mic is a serious issue that should be considered for effective risk based integrity management of offshore systems under mic this paper presents a proper methodology by using a hybrid bayesian network bn and markov process to predict the mic rate failure probability and critical failure year of an internally corroded subsea pipeline the bn model is developed to probabilistically obtain the mic rate considering the dynamic non linearity and interdependency among vital input factors the effects of the nonlinear interactions of various prominent factors are evaluated and their degree of influence is explored the markov process is employed to predict the failure probability critical failure year and the time evolution mic pit depth distribution using the predicted mic rate as a transition intensity the developed model is adaptive and captures the evolving impact of mic the proposed integrated methodology is tested on a case study and the most critical parameters that influence the mic rate and system failure are identified the proposed approach would provide an early warning guide for a timely intervention to prevent total failure of corroded subsea pipelines and associated consequences keywords failure assessment bayesian network markov process pipeline failure probability pit depth microbiologically influenced corrosion 1 introduction corrosion plays a critical role in the failure of infrastructures in the oil and gas industry several catastrophic steel failure events in marine and offshore environments have been attributed to undesirable corrosion phenomenon paik and kim 2012 the complexity of the corrosion mechanisms in the petroleum industry depends on numerous operational environmental and material related factors chandrasekaran 2016 chandrasekaran and jain 2016 little and lee 2007 these factors may include biofouling presence of carbon dioxide ph pollutants temperature pressure water velocity carbonate solubility salinity amount of suspended solids presence of bacteria material composition and surface roughness in petroleum production processes oil gas and water exist under various flow regimes and process conditions due to the ionic nature of oil and gas the emulsion is formed at a low concentration of water the emulsions may exist in the form of either water in oil or oil in water papavinasam et al 2007 2010 the oil in water emulsions having contact with the pipe wall provide a stimulating environment that may favor microbial growth and carbonic acid formation due to co2 dissolution nesic et al 2005 papavinasam et al 2007 the resulting carbonic acid may initiate different types of internal corrosion and the bacteria enhance their growth especially in carbon steel pipelines renpu 2011 several corrosion induced failures occur in vertical and or deviated subsea oil pipelines as a result of water hang up which provides a stimulating environment that activates corrosion influencing factors such as bacteria dissolved salts and volatile fatty acids ibrahim et al 2018 the water hang up builds sufficient pressure that causes periodic spasms of slugging palmer and king 2008 at high slug formation frequencies of 50 90 per minute the corrosion rate may linearly increase with slug frequency jepson 1996 the slug frequency depends on the inclination of the pipeline and the corrosion rate increases by 50 when the slug frequency is doubled jepson 1996 in addition steel composition and microstructural configuration as well as the micro organisms in the area of corrosion initiation play vital roles in the corrosion growth rate this is shown in the high rate of material degradation in the dynamic and bacteria infested environment marciales et al 2019 according to the literature the failure of the marine and offshore oil and gas infrastructures due to corrosion defects significantly depends on the depth of the defect and the corrosion growth rate therefore a proper understanding of corrosive environmental dynamics and the material response is crucial in failure prediction and corrosion management in the oil and gas industry moreover the associated dynamics in corrosion mechanisms under the microbial influence need to be adequately understood to predict and also inhibit the risks of failure of critical infrastructures in the marine and offshore industry microbiologically influenced corrosion mic describes the degradation process of various systems instigated by the presence and metabolic activities of micro organisms such as bacteria and fungi beech and gaylarde 1999 the formation of metabolites organic and inorganic acids by the bacteria influences the electrochemical mechanisms and complicates the corrosion process previous research studies have shown that microbiologically influenced internal corrosion contributes to several onshore and offshore systems failure with catastrophic consequences al jaroudi et al 2011 eckert 2003 witt et al 2016 the microbial growth is promoted by the availability of the supporting nutrients in the environment these nutrients synergize with the metallic surface and abiotic corrosion product to provide a sustainable growing environment for the bacteria heterogeneous material surfaces in the presence of water accelerate the formation of bacteria colonies called biofilms the fused microbial cells and extracellular polymeric substances eps form the biofilm which provides a favorable mode of subsistence for the microorganisms even in a hostile environment the biofilm also promotes a more sustainable environment that enhances reproduction and growth of metabolisms greatly influencing the corrosion mechanisms beech and gaylarde 1999 machuca 2016 the polymeric substances within the multispecies bacteria colony produce a mixed complex array of dynamic corrosive microenvironments that boost the steel material deterioration this complexity poses difficulty in the understanding of the microbial process and addressing the subsequent challenges machuca 2016 the marine and offshore infrastructures under the microbial biofilm complexity continue to experience severe degradation especially in micro organism communities where the sulphate reducing bacteria iron oxidizing bacteria manganese oxidizing sulphate oxidizing bacteria acid producing bacteria and the exopolymers coexist in the same colony or biofilm beech and gaylarde 1999 this synergistic consortium alters the electrochemical processes resulting in microbiologically influenced localized pitting corrosion that reduces the integrity of the structure the byproduct of the bacteria metabolism cracks the corrosion protection layer thereby exposes the steel material to severe degradation chandrasekaran and jain 2016 the loss of structural integrity occurs when the structure becomes susceptible owing to the breakdown of the thin passive oxide film that resists corrosion the breakdown is due to the formation of organic and inorganic deposits on the structure surfaces that compromise the stability of the oxide film beech and gaylarde 1999 further growth of the micro organisms sustains the growth of pit formation and pit density across the length of the pipeline resulting in mic induced failures of offshore shipping and process systems for example pipeline leakages and ruptures ballast tank and cargo tank leakages beech and gaylarde 1999 eckert 2003 paik and kim 2012 these mic induced failures lead to direct and indirect consequences with associated economic losses risks to model the mic potential and its propagation several researchers have proposed mechanistic models marciales et al 2019 for instance gu et al 2009 proposed a bioenergetic based theory to describe the thermodynamic mechanism for type i mic formation by sulphate reducing bacteria srb the type 1 mic formation occurs due to the process of microbes respiration on exogenous oxidants this process involves an extracellular electron transfer by the sulphate or nitrate ions into the microbial cytoplasm this is mostly involved in electrogenic biofilms formation the authors emphasized the possibility of alteration in the electrochemical corrosion mechanisms during this phenomenon they argued that the process of thermodynamic equilibrium based potential analysis only determines the potential of mic formation but does not alter the rate of corrosion wastage they also concluded that an integrated mechanistic model through involvement of microbial growth kinetics mass transfer and various chemical biochemical and electrochemical reactions would provide a more reliable tool for prediction of mic potential sørensen et al 2012 proposed a risk based mic model for the worst case pitting corrosion rate and risk factors based on sulphate reducing archaea sra sulphate reducing bacteria srb and methanogens met the authors showed that in the combined colony of the bacteria the rate of wastage increases they suggested a proactive plan for the potentially high pit generation rate due to the exponential growth of microbial cells al darbi et al 2005 developed a mathematically and or numerically based polarization model they described the cathodic srb mediated polarization as it affects the corrosion rate overtime at different pit depth increments the developed anaerobic model in the srb environment was based on cathodic depolarization which describes the corrosion rate dependency on the consumption rate of sulphate by the srb and the change in pit depth more details on the mechanistic models for mic potential and rate prediction and their limitations are presented in marciales et al 2019 generally these models are not dynamically structured to reflect the complexity and nonlinear interdependency among mic influencing factors for real time application and failure probability prediction in the recent years advanced models approaches that better predict the microbial potential based on the screening and operating parameters and their influence on corrosion wastage of oil and gas infrastructures have been introduced these include experimental regression quantitative and probabilistic tools heyer 2013 huang et al 1997 liu and cheng 2018 caleyo et al 2009 taleb berrouane et al 2018 wolodko et al 2018 papavinasam et al 2010 experimentally analyzed effects of physical pipeline parameters and fluid characteristics on internal pitting corrosion the researchers identified the pipe diameter thickness inclination angle production rate co 2 partial pressure and concentration of bicarbonates sulphate h 2 s and chloride as pit corrosion contributing factors pots et al 2002 proposed a quantitative methodology to assess critical parameters contributing to the corrosion rate in a microbial infested environment six factors such as water presence ph salinity water wetting dissolved solids and temperature exhibited the key roles however the complex nature of the interactions of the biotic and abiotic parameters poses a challenge in the application of this model further models that correlate the operating parameters metallurgical properties pit formation and its propagation over time are found in the open sources caleyo et al 2009 mahmoodian and li 2018 ossai et al 2015 the stochastic nature of mic pit formation and growth requires dynamic models such as the markov poisson petri nets and bayesian network approaches for pit depth distribution prediction for example hong 1999 used the combined inhomogeneous poisson and markov strategies to model pit generation and its depth growth it was found that the point of surface wetting and coating breakdown play key roles in pit generation the kolmogorov forward equation through a time transformation condensation method was used similarly other researchers ossai et al 2016a valor and caleyo 2007 valor et al 2013 proposed a nonhomogeneous and continuous time linear growth pure birth markov procedure for pit depth distribution they made efforts to predict pit growth characteristics and the corroded pipeline failure time under the influence of the pipeline s operating parameters although the probabilistic models provide a better representation of the randomness in corrosion pit nucleation and growth compared to deterministic tools kaduková et al 2014 shabarchin and tesfamariam 2016 suarez and polomka 2018 bazán and beck 2013 the reviewed probabilistic models do not consider the microbial influence on corrosion rate and failure probability some of them are also empirically formulated with multiple inspection data fitted for a comparative framework that have limitations due to sparse data availability and an associated high degree of uncertainties generally mic significantly contributes to the failures of offshore systems and the associated risks pipeline deterioration progressively increases the risk of failure over time the safety of a pipeline is dependent on the management of the remaining useful life and the reliability estimation which determine the intervention measures over time hasan et al 2012 mishra et al 2019 nizamani et al 2016 ossai et al 2015 these can only be forecasted if the failure probability of the defective pipeline is known the recent improvements in inspection techniques such as acoustic emission guided waves ultrasonic testing gwut visual imaging and photography autonomous underwater vehicles auvs remotely operating vehicles rovs and marine inspection robotic assistant mira systems have enhanced the capacity for marine offshore assets integrity assessment for failure based prediction abbas and shafiee 2020 ahmed et al 2015 carellan et al 2014 giurgiutiu et al 2015 despite considerable attempts to understand predict and manage mic in the oil and gas industry one critical aspect of offshore systems integrity management under mic that remains unsolved is how to dynamically predict the mic rate failure probability and future mic pit depth distribution of a corroding offshore system from single inspection data and by monitoring operating parameters the existing models are not adequate for the precise prediction of the corrosion rate and failure probability in a dynamic and complex microbial infested environment there are a limited number of dynamic quantitative models to evaluate the mic rate and failure probability considering dynamic nonlinear interdependency among contributory factors the main objective of this research is to develop an integrated bn markov process model for predicting the mic rate failure probability and future pit depth distribution under microbiologically influenced internal corrosion and its effects on offshore system structural integrity the mic influential factors are represented using bn to capture their dynamics nonlinear dependency and interdependency the system failure characteristics based on the critical pit depth state and the future mic pit depth distribution are estimated using a markovian process for an offshore system the remaining of the paper is structured as follows section 2 presents the failure assessment due to mic section 3 briefly describes the proposed research methodology section 4 includes and illustrates the application of the methodology using a case study section 5 provides the research results and discussion and section 6 highlights the most important findings of this study 2 failure assessment due to microbiologically influenced corrosion several probabilistic approaches have demonstrated high potential for assessing the failure of offshore systems with corrosion defects especially pitting corrosion ossai et al 2016a valor and caleyo 2007 valor et al 2013 the integrated bn markov process provides a better multi dimensional dependency modeling capability for the prediction of the mic rate and corroding offshore systems failure probability the main elements of the integrated model are briefly illustrated in the following subsections 2 1 bayesian network several modeling and deterministic methodologies have shown limitations for modeling of complex and dynamic dependencies among the contributory parameters arabloo et al 2015 ghiasi et al 2015 kamari et al 2014a kamari et al 2014b kamari et al 2015 zendehboudi et al 2018 the application of a bn tool for probability modeling can capture the interactions of the multivariate influential factors and their dynamic dependency nature and predict their nonlinear relationships adedigba et al 2016b khakzad et al 2013 taleb berrouane et al 2018 the bn is a strong approach for complex system modeling especially in stochastically formulated scenarios where deterministic or mathematical models have shown limited applications in fact bn provides a better dependency framework for both multi state and multi dimensional configurations chandrasekaran 2015 islam et al 2018 some of the recent studies focusing on the use of bn for mic potential prediction can be found in the literature bhandari et al 2017 dawuda 2019 taleb berrouane et al 2018 the bn technique is a probabilistic inference tool for reasoning and prediction under uncertainties adumene et al 2020 chandrasekaran 2016 it is represented by a specific graphical model called a directed acyclic graph which demonstrates the logical relationship between random variables in terms of their conditional probabilities the nodes are characterized by directed arcs that depict causal conditional dependencies among parent and child nodes an assigned conditional probability table is used to model the dependencies among the nodes adedigba et al 2016a khakzad et al 2013 using bn modeling the process of dependency representation can be vertically and horizontally framed the former describes where the intermediate nodes depend on the root cause nodes while the latter describes the dependency of root cause nodes on each other taleb berrouane et al 2018 this configuration exhibits both the qualitative and quantitative capability of bn for a random set of operating variables u x 1 x n the chain rule and joint probability distribution p u based on conditional independence is mathematically represented by the following equation jensen and nielsen 2007 1 p u i 1 n p x i p x x i where p x x i introduces the parent of variable x i and p u refers to the joint probability distribution of the variables the probability of x i is calculated as follows 2 p x i u x i p u where the summation is taken over all the variables except x i the bn updates the prior probability of events upon the availability of new information called evidence e using bayes theorem to produce the consequence probability called posterior equation 3 is used to estimate the posterior probability also in bn canonical probabilistic models are utilized to signify the canonical interactions between nodes and provide techniques for statistical dependencies and nonlinear modeling adedigba et al 2016a 3 p u e p u e p e p u e u p u e in the recent research works bhandari et al 2017 palencia et al 2019 taleb berrouane et al 2018 the bn model technique has exhibited good potential for mic susceptibility and defect growth prediction in the dynamic marine environment hence the current work builds on the technique practicality to determine the mic rate considering the dynamics of the monitoring operating parameters and the environmental factors 2 2 markov chain approach the markov chain tool stochastically uses random variables to model the probability of future events on the basis of the present events in sequence the markov model assumes a memoryless principle where given the likelihood of the present event the probability of the future event is independent of the past event but relies on the present sheskin 2011 for a markov chain of n states designated by 1 2 n the random variable x n represents the state of the process at any specified time step the indexed sequence of the random variables x 0 x 1 x 2 is observed at different time steps over the system life cycle if this sequence x 0 x 1 x 2 satisfies the markov property its mathematical formulation gives the following expression grabski 2015 4 p x t 1 s x t s t x t 1 s t 1 x 0 s 0 p x t 1 s x t s t for all t 1 2 3 and for all states s 0 s 1 s t s the markov chain is formulated given the system states and the transitions between different states the transition intensity rate μ i j and the transition probability p i j characterize the markov approach these transition probabilities are estimated by a set of kolmogorov s forward equation kfe and for the multi state markov process the laplace stieltjes transform and its inverse are used to estimate the states transition probabilities lisnianski et al 2010 the generated transition probability matrix is represented by a vector notation as p i j where i j represents the conditional probability that the system will next be in state j given that it is now in state i the state dependent transition probability from state i to state j provides p i j p x t 1 j x t i therefore for t step transition probabilities p t i j p x t j x 0 i p x n t j x n i for any n several researchers have demonstrated the practicality of markovian models in various engineering applications arzaghi et al 2020 ossai et al 2016b rinn et al 2016 this work builds on its usefulness by adopting the technique and integrates it with the partition theorem for probability distribution prediction of the states in any given t step transition the probability function is mathematically expressed by equation 5 therefore the row vector π t p t as shown below gives the probability distribution of x t for all t 1 2 3 in this work the markov model is treated to have a finite number of states as n designates 5 p x t j i 1 n p x t j x t 1 i p x t 1 i i 1 n p t i j π i π t p t j 3 bn markov method for mic rate and failure assessment this section presents the developmental stages of an integrated bn markov methodology for prediction of mic rate failure probability and future pit wastage propagation of a corroding offshore system under the microbial influence as shown in fig 1 the modeling approach begins with assessing the contributory factors to microbial growth and their probabilities microbial counts and sets of inspection data followed by the use of the bn model to forecast the mic rate and then integrate it into the markov approach to estimate the failure probability the following subsections describe the hybridized modeling strategy 3 1 collection of relevant information and data information regarding the offshore system is collected by the inspection measurements and fluid analysis this information data may include but not limited to the operating characteristics and parameters e g temperature salinity ph velocity exposure time alloy composition sulphate ions chloride ions co2 partial pressure water cut microbial count mechanical properties design characteristics extent of corrosion flaws and their geometry 3 2 estimation of mic rate using bayesian network according to several research studies guedes soares et al 2005 ossai et al 2016a 2015 papavinasam et al 2010 pots et al 2002 there are different degrees of correlations among the monitoring operating parameters e g co 2 partial pressure bicarbonates concentration sulphate concentration h 2 s content chloride concentration water cut ph salinity temperature with the corrosion rate and the maximum defect depth in particular ossai et al 2015 used the regression model to analyze the linear dependencies among the operating parameters and defect growth although the approach is able to determine the corrosion rate under the prevailing environmental conditions it is limited to analyze the non linearity and dynamic interdependencies among the operating parameters and their effects on the microbial corrosion defect rate for complex relationships between the operating parameters corrosion influencing parameters and the microbial corrosion defect rate bn provides a reliable modeling capacity it captures the multi dimensional interactions and influences of the operating parameters and the srb on the microbial corrosion rate simultaneously at any given operating condition bn also offers a practical probabilistic network based model for prediction of mic defect rate where a single set of inspection data is available with a historical data log for the monitoring operating variables environmental factors and micro organisms adumene et al 2020 to implement the bn model the probabilities of the mic influencing factors are estimated prior probabilities from the available monitoring operating parameters and environmental factors data set information by data partitioning the operating parameters metallurgical parameters and environmental factors are used as the input parameters to simulate the process based on their prior estimated probabilities the cause consequences relationships are then modeled using the bn framework the conditional probabilities define the dependency among the corrosion influencing parameters the conditional probabilities for the intermediate srb node and the child mic rate node are created by exploring the dynamic relationships among different microbial corrosion influencing factors in long term exposure also a part of the information is derived from theoretical and experimental corrosion model proposed by the researchers de waard et al 1991 papavinasam et al 2010 and available field data by inputting the prior probabilities of these mic vital factors and the conditional probabilities the mic rate is predicted for this research some of the bn nodes are categorized into high moderate and low states depending on the range of the available operational data in contrast others are expressed in two states present and absent or yes and no which describe a state of the positive assertion of a cause of a specific variable and their interacting effect on the mic rate it is important to note that upon the availability of new information data the model is dynamically updated and the evidence can be set on the various mic rate categories to predict the posterior probabilities of the contributory factors for different scenarios all the bns in this work are simulated in the genie software environment 3 3 mic pit states and pipe wall discretization the pipeline wall thickness is discretized into mic pit states as shown in fig 2 the discretized states given by i 1 2 n represent the different degrees of corrosion wastage on the internal surface of the offshore pipeline the initial state and subsequent states are bounded by a given interval to define different mic pit depths of the pipeline the critical depth n is the corrosion penetration depth of the pipe wall that results in total failure over time i e over 80 corrosion wastage the continuous growth of the mic pit is depth and time dependent the greater the depth of the pit the higher the corrosion rate with time 3 4 estimation of mic pit depth states transition probabilities given the present pit depth state g n at time n the pipeline future pit depth state after time n can be described by g n 1 g n 2 while the past state is g 0 g n 1 if the value g n i is known the future pit depth evolution of the chain can be predicted which depends only on i it is stochastically independent of the past values or states g n 1 g 0 therefore given the present state of the mic pit depth with characterized mic rate μ i j across the state over time the transition probability function of the mic pit depth states as shown in fig 1 can be defined by the kolmogorov forward equations as follows 6 d p g 11 t d t μ 12 t p g 11 t d p g 12 t d t μ 12 t p g 11 t μ 23 t p g 12 t d p g 13 t d t μ 23 t p g 12 t μ 34 t p g 13 t d p g n t d t μ n t p g n t where g 1 g n introduce the mic pit depth states p g 11 t p g n t are the probabilities of the pits in the state g i j i j 1 2 n with the sum of the pit depth state transition probability function equal to one as presented below 7 i 1 n p g i t p g 11 t p g 12 t p g n t 1 for a pit depth in state 1 after inspection the prior distribution gives p g 11 t 1 the prior distribution serves as the initial condition for future pit depth propagation prediction over time applying the multi state element approach equation 6 is solved for the transition probability across the states using the laplace stieljes transformation and its corresponding inverse transform lisnianski et al 2010 the resulting state transition probability matrix and generator matrix are written below 8 t r a n s i t i o n m a t r i x p p i j p g 11 p g 12 p g 13 p g 21 p g 22 p g 23 p g n 1 p g n 2 p g n 3 9 generator matrix q μ 12 t μ 12 t 0 0 0 μ 23 t μ 23 t 0 0 0 μ 34 t μ 34 t the element in the i t h row and j t h column p i j indicates the probability when going from pit depth state i to pit depth state j in one step this is referred to as one step pit depth transition probability while the square transition matrix p p i j i j s is called the one step pit depth transition matrix 3 5 prediction of pit depth distribution and failure probability having the mic rate as evaluated in subsection 3 2 and the mic state transition probability see subsection 3 4 the pit depth state failure probability is predicted for the critical pit depth using the markovian procedure this is achieved through a probabilistic formulation using equation 5 the time dependent failure probability is then evaluated over the life cycle of the offshore pipeline the failure profile of the system is drawn to estimate the likelihood of exceeding the target threshold probability based on the annual target probability safety class for offshore pipelines dnv 2010 the time of occurrence is also estimated from the failure probability profile for the different defect depths and geometries therefore given the evaluated corrosion rate the time dependent linear corrosion growth models presented by mahmoodian and li 2017 and witek 2018 are adopted for the future pit depth prediction in the research analysis the decision making process in offshore system health management is often limited by inadequate knowledge of the operating parameters and the stochastic degradation due to environmental factors also limited data and restricted access to the offshore systems platform could impair accurate information for decision making hence based on the predicted failure likelihood and future state of the asset critical decision making against total failure can be inferred by operators and integrity managers the outcomes of the nonlinear parametric interactions between the monitoring operating variables using bn provide reliable predictions of mic rate at various prevailing environmental conditions the likely failure probability and critical failure year are predicted based on the evaluated corrosion rate the proposed methodology presents a new application of the bn markovian methodology in mic analysis the proposed approach offers an efficient operational decision making strategy under mic the illustrative computational example for the hybrid connectionist methodology is shown in the supplementary material 4 application of methodology case study the proposed methodology is demonstrated with a case study using inspection data and operating parameters eckert 2003 based on the established cause effect interaction among monitoring operating parameters and the mic defect rate the limited available data is used as the mean value for the analysis it is further used to simulate data set for a period of 5 years cases of offshore subsea pipeline failure due to corrosion defects have been reported in the literature liu et al 2016 mohd and kee 2013 eckert 2003 three segments of an offshore subsea oil pipeline with different internal mic pit depths taken from the available data information are used to assess the methodology the pipeline segments pit depths for the case study are shown in table 1 for this analysis the offshore subsea pipeline defect is microbiologically influenced and the initial single corrosion pit depth is used for the case study the wall thickness is discretized into four pit depth states to reduce the mathematical complexity and computational costs associated with complex multi state systems the mic pits are assumed stable and there is a sustainable growth over the period under consideration predicting the time dependent failure likelihood of microbiologically influenced corroded offshore pipeline is paramount in safety and integrity management in the oil and gas industry as the corrosion defect grows in an in service pipeline the pipeline gradually loses its strength and is prone to failure at any time when the residual strength is equal to or less than the operating pressure of the pipeline due to the stochastic nature of mic pit formation and its propagation the mic rate is probabilistically predicted it is used as the transition intensity for the failure probability estimation in this study assuming at the time of inspection 5 1 years the operating conditions and the measured parameters are the same for the three segments the monitoring operating parameters are then partitioned into set bounds high moderate and low to estimate the parameters prior probabilities based on the data counts within the range as shown in table 2 for characterization of the prevalent operating environmental conditions the estimated prior probabilities and the conditional probabilities are used as the probabilistic input data for the bn model for the conditional probabilities additional information from the theoretical and experimental corrosion model proposed by the previous works de waard et al 1991 papavinasam et al 2010 is obtained in the case of incomplete information data from subject matter experts and the literature bhandari et al 2017 taleb berrouane et al 2018 is used for the analysis the mechanical properties of the api 5l pipeline are listed in table 3 all parameters see tables 2 and 3 are required to predict the critical mic pit depth probability of failure critical year of failure and the time evolution pit depth distribution of the offshore subsea pipeline furthermore the following assumptions are made in this hybrid modeling a the data bounds as reported in table 3 represent the prevailing environmental conditions for the period under consideration b the future defect growth is predicted based on the mic defect rate it is constant for the period under study c the markovian method is established based on the assumption that the asset is at an initial state with no defects at the commencement of the offshore operation d the mic defect growth is assumed to linearly propagate e the different pipe segments are subjected to the same environmental conditions the computational procedure is found in the supplementary material 5 results and discussion the primary objective of developing the integrated bn markov model is to precisely predict the mic rate from a single set of inspection data and the operational parameters the mic rate is used as the transition intensity for determination of the probability of failure and the critical failure year of an internally corroded subsea pipeline to model the mic rate the bn is built connecting the intermediate and basic events by arcs designating the dependency and interdependency among the contributory factors the vital parameters and their probabilities are given in table 2 see section 4 they serve as the input parameters and are used to simulate the bn model the bn is constructed based on a cause consequences relationship among the operating parameters environmental factors material properties and the mic rate the parametric learning of the developed bn uses the prior probabilities and conditional probabilities for the monitoring of operating parameters as the input data to predict the mic rate fig 3 demonstrates the developed bn model which dynamically predicts the mic rate given the prior probabilities of the monitoring operating parameters environmental factors and metallurgical properties it is found that temperature water cut flow velocity and ph are of importance in the microbial growth and the mic rate simultaneously the predicted mic rates from the parametric simulation of the bn model for the corroding offshore subsea oil pipeline under the prevailing conditions are obtained to be 0 0779 0 1423 0 3672 and 0 4125 respectively for the low moderate high and severe corrosion categories the results explore the parameters interactions this is in agreement with the findings and data of ossai et al 2016a and nace rp0775 2005 furthermore a sensitivity analysis is performed on the bn model to identify the degree of influence of each operating parameter on the mic rate it follows that within the temperature range 21 oc 45 oc the mic rate increases by 4 2 the bn model analysis shows that temperature is a key factor contributing to the srb metabolism and the rate of defect growth under mic further confirmation on the effects of temperature on microbial corrosion in the marine environment is obtained based on the previous studies bhandari et al 2017 guedes soares et al 2005 melchers 2002 the effect of seawater salinity on the mic phenomenon and rate is crucial especially in seawater environments according to the sensitivity analysis the salinity exhibits a moderate support for srb sustenance for the case study with an increase in the mic rate of 1 7 however the degree of influence is mainly site specific the effect of alloy composition is premised on its susceptibility due to the breakdown of the passive protective film at this point the mic of identifiable depth is formed evaluating the effect of the alloy composition an increase of 1 9 in the mic rate is noticed the sensitivity analysis of the ph based on an overly acidic state indicates that the mic rate increases by 1 7 this confirms the important role of the water phase of the multiphase flow systems in the carbonic acid formation and buffering of ph in oil and gas production processes according to the bn modeling results ph which is a dependent variable is positively correlated with temperature and co2 partial pressure the combined characteristic effects of these parameters promote a high rate of system degradation in a microbial infested environment flowing velocity exhibits different distribution for both internal and external microbial corrosion in the marine environment the low fluid velocity supports the formation and sustainability of complex microbial biofilms on the internal surface of the pipeline hence it is crucial to dynamically analyze the effect of flow velocity on the srb metabolism and the corrosion rate for low fluid speed and high water cut it is observed that the mic rate increases by 2 7 and 1 6 respectively this reflects the significant effect of these operating parameters on the mic rate of the corroded subsea oil pipeline the systematic analysis of the impacts of sulphate ion concentration chloride concentration and the co 2 partial pressure reveals their relative contribution to the mic rate it is found that the mic rate increases by 2 4 2 7 and 1 6 respectively due to the sulphate ion concentration chloride ion concentration and co 2 partial pressure effects at this condition inorganic acid is formed and can be further metabolized by oxidation to form so 4 2 which creates sustainable nutrient sources for srb growth and promotes a severe mic rate upon an increase in the exposure time and the srb counts the mic rate increases by 2 1 and 10 1 respectively which is in agreement with the findings of melchers and jeffrey 2008 based on the parametric sensitivity analysis the srb count exhibits a severe effect on the mic rate compared to other parameters under the same operating conditions hence the srb significantly affects the mic rate and future mic pit depth distribution for the subsea pipeline table 4 reports a summary of the percentage effects of the operating parameters on the mic rate this phase of the study provides an initial validation of the model fig 4 further highlights the impacts of the operating parameters on the srb enhancement more analysis of the contributory factors lower and upper bound probability effects on the mic rate is performed by setting evidence on the bounds of the influential factors new sets of mic rates are predicted as shown in figs 5 and 6 it is noticed that the mic rate is increased by 40 4 for the severe corrosion category with evidence on the upper bound probability compared with the parametric learning result this confirms the dynamics of the contributory parameters on the mic rate the bn framework also shows the capacity to model the dynamic nonlinear dependencies among the key factors the summary of the results for the different scenarios is given in table 5 a comparative analysis of the lower and upper bounds mic rates shows an increase of 11 33 and 53 2 for the high and severe corrosion category respectively this increase in the mic rate will promote a rapid failure in offshore systems where water hang up and slug formation pose critical challenges it is important to avoid such a sudden system failure through development of a useful and reliable predictive strategy the estimated upper bound mic rate is integrated into the markovian stochastic procedure to evaluate the mic pit depth state transition probabilities the formulated transition probability function and the defined prior pit depth state distribution are then used to determine the failure probability for the three corroded subsea pipeline segments at the point of inspection the corrosion defect for pipe segment 1 is at pit depth state 1 segment 2 at pit depth state 2 and segment 3 at pit depth state 3 based on the pipeline s wall thickness discretization the results of the analysis are presented in fig 7 for the three segments of the subsea pipeline with different mic pit depths it is found that the time evolution failure probability for the three segments is progressively increased with a higher magnitude for the third pipeline segment it is concluded that under the same operating and environmental conditions components with greater corrosion depth segment 3 will experience an early failure compared to the two other components this finding is in agreement with the previous studies aljaroudi et al 2015 ossai et al 2016a it implies that the critical failure year and risk increase for a severely corroded offshore pipeline the predicted failure probability for the three segments and the mean first passage time critical failure year are provided in table 6 these parameters are estimated from the failure probability profile of the critical pit depth state exceeding 80 of the pipe wall thickness as shown in fig 7 based on the normal safety class annual target probability of failure for corroded offshore pipelines dnv 2010 the results exhibit the time dependent effect of microorganisms on the degradation process of offshore pipelines the stochastic natures of the operating parameters affect the residual strength of the corroding subsea pipeline it follows that as the mic rate increases the residual strength continues to decline limiting the structural resistance to the internal pressure loading most importantly the residual strength is exponentially reduced when the microbial biofilm results in a sustainable growth and a protective environment the biofilm lowers the effect of corrosion inhibitors biocides and continues to influence the development of the mic pit at multiple growth rates a sudden failure is inevitable under this condition in the absence of a proactive monitoring framework and model for failure probability prediction the impacts of mic rate on failure probability and critical failure time are illustrated in fig 8 and table 7 according to the results if the mic rate is increased the failure probability increases while the critical failure year decreases thus an early failure of the pipeline is anticipated by increasing the mic rate a comparative analysis of figs 7 and 8 reveals a backward shift in the critical failure year which reflects the dynamics of the mic rate on the system failure time and probability figs 9 11 present the time evolution mic pit depth distribution for the three pipeline segments the extreme upper bound mic rate is tripled to reflect the dynamics of the mic rate increase on pit depth distribution over time it is found that the future pit depth distribution is significantly increased with an increase in depth and growth rate this is in agreement with the previous research works ossai et al 2016a valor and caleyo 2007 valor et al 2013 however for the first pipeline segment the low corrosion category shows less significant growth over the pipeline s life cycle this might be due to a low mic rate and less influence from the contributory factors a gradual or limited growth may be experienced at a specific corrosion rate lower than the low corrosion category threshold the predicted time evolution pit depth distribution provides a guide on the likelihood of how microorganisms enhance the pit corrosion wastage in offshore pipelines it is important to note that due to the complexity of microbial behaviors and colony formation the mic rate may exponentially increase and result in a sudden failure of the system fig 12 displays the time evolution probabilities for the first and second corroded pipeline segments pit depth states 1 and 2 respectively this is important to show the point of lower bound intersection between the two states probabilities this indicates the likely threshold for inspection or intervention decision making to avoid a total failure as mentioned earlier in the 9th year of exposure the pits depth states probabilities for the first and intermediate states are at the midpoint based on fig 7 the predicted critical pit depth failure probability increases and exceeds the threshold as the year of exposure increases e g at the 11th year 14th year and 18th year for the three pipe segments respectively the introduced method provides guidelines tips for timely decision making to prevent the total failure of the corroding subsea pipeline hence an optimal cost effective and timely intervention plan could be implemented 6 conclusions the present study demonstrates the application of an integrated bn markov methodology for the prediction of a time dependent mic rate failure probability and critical failure year of the corroding subsea pipeline more emphasis is placed on the effects of the operating parameters and srb on the mic rate this also covers the effect of mic rate on the likelihood of failure of the pipeline after long term exposure the developed model is tested using three corroded subsea pipeline segments the bn demonstrates the potential for complex dependency modeling among the mic rate influencing parameters and quantitatively predicts their values the degree of influence of the corrosion controlling parameters on the mic rate is explored the capacity of the bn is also assessed to update the mic rate given a new set of information about the operating conditions of the pipeline according to the parametric sensitivity analysis temperature fluid velocity and srb among other factors cause a severe effect on the mic rate and the failure of the pipeline this is also confirmed by the previous studies the predicted mic rate is used in the markovian approach to predict the failure probability and critical failure year for the three segments under the same operating conditions but with different mic pit depth states it is concluded that as the corrosion pit depth increases the failure likelihood and risk of failure increase with time while the critical failure time decreases this is anticipated in aging corroded offshore pipelines this further highlights the reliability and accuracy of the proposed approach nevertheless only the linear defect growth corrosion model is considered for the future pit depth distribution based on the results of the critical pit depth failure probability profile for the three pipeline segments the following decision making can be inferred if the corroded pipe segments are assumed to be in series failure of one segment constitutes pipeline failures an optimal and cost effective 3 5 year inspection or intervention plan can be made otherwise if the failure of all segments is required for the system to fail an individual inspection plan may be required for this case study a 4 year e g 9th year 13th year and 17th year respectively inspection or intervention plan can be implemented for the three corroded pipe segments to protect them from sudden failure and its consequences in addition improving material composition and pipeline design practical parametric monitoring and proper application of pigging and high quality site specific biocides can mitigate sudden failures due to mic the proposed model presents an effective early warning and monitoring tool upon mic formation on offshore components and for decision making nevertheless the model can be improved in future research by considering the time nonhomogeneous markovian approach nonlinear corrosion model integration and multi failure mechanisms under the

21298,the microbiologically influenced corrosion mic is a serious issue that should be considered for effective risk based integrity management of offshore systems under mic this paper presents a proper methodology by using a hybrid bayesian network bn and markov process to predict the mic rate failure probability and critical failure year of an internally corroded subsea pipeline the bn model is developed to probabilistically obtain the mic rate considering the dynamic non linearity and interdependency among vital input factors the effects of the nonlinear interactions of various prominent factors are evaluated and their degree of influence is explored the markov process is employed to predict the failure probability critical failure year and the time evolution mic pit depth distribution using the predicted mic rate as a transition intensity the developed model is adaptive and captures the evolving impact of mic the proposed integrated methodology is tested on a case study and the most critical parameters that influence the mic rate and system failure are identified the proposed approach would provide an early warning guide for a timely intervention to prevent total failure of corroded subsea pipelines and associated consequences keywords failure assessment bayesian network markov process pipeline failure probability pit depth microbiologically influenced corrosion 1 introduction corrosion plays a critical role in the failure of infrastructures in the oil and gas industry several catastrophic steel failure events in marine and offshore environments have been attributed to undesirable corrosion phenomenon paik and kim 2012 the complexity of the corrosion mechanisms in the petroleum industry depends on numerous operational environmental and material related factors chandrasekaran 2016 chandrasekaran and jain 2016 little and lee 2007 these factors may include biofouling presence of carbon dioxide ph pollutants temperature pressure water velocity carbonate solubility salinity amount of suspended solids presence of bacteria material composition and surface roughness in petroleum production processes oil gas and water exist under various flow regimes and process conditions due to the ionic nature of oil and gas the emulsion is formed at a low concentration of water the emulsions may exist in the form of either water in oil or oil in water papavinasam et al 2007 2010 the oil in water emulsions having contact with the pipe wall provide a stimulating environment that may favor microbial growth and carbonic acid formation due to co2 dissolution nesic et al 2005 papavinasam et al 2007 the resulting carbonic acid may initiate different types of internal corrosion and the bacteria enhance their growth especially in carbon steel pipelines renpu 2011 several corrosion induced failures occur in vertical and or deviated subsea oil pipelines as a result of water hang up which provides a stimulating environment that activates corrosion influencing factors such as bacteria dissolved salts and volatile fatty acids ibrahim et al 2018 the water hang up builds sufficient pressure that causes periodic spasms of slugging palmer and king 2008 at high slug formation frequencies of 50 90 per minute the corrosion rate may linearly increase with slug frequency jepson 1996 the slug frequency depends on the inclination of the pipeline and the corrosion rate increases by 50 when the slug frequency is doubled jepson 1996 in addition steel composition and microstructural configuration as well as the micro organisms in the area of corrosion initiation play vital roles in the corrosion growth rate this is shown in the high rate of material degradation in the dynamic and bacteria infested environment marciales et al 2019 according to the literature the failure of the marine and offshore oil and gas infrastructures due to corrosion defects significantly depends on the depth of the defect and the corrosion growth rate therefore a proper understanding of corrosive environmental dynamics and the material response is crucial in failure prediction and corrosion management in the oil and gas industry moreover the associated dynamics in corrosion mechanisms under the microbial influence need to be adequately understood to predict and also inhibit the risks of failure of critical infrastructures in the marine and offshore industry microbiologically influenced corrosion mic describes the degradation process of various systems instigated by the presence and metabolic activities of micro organisms such as bacteria and fungi beech and gaylarde 1999 the formation of metabolites organic and inorganic acids by the bacteria influences the electrochemical mechanisms and complicates the corrosion process previous research studies have shown that microbiologically influenced internal corrosion contributes to several onshore and offshore systems failure with catastrophic consequences al jaroudi et al 2011 eckert 2003 witt et al 2016 the microbial growth is promoted by the availability of the supporting nutrients in the environment these nutrients synergize with the metallic surface and abiotic corrosion product to provide a sustainable growing environment for the bacteria heterogeneous material surfaces in the presence of water accelerate the formation of bacteria colonies called biofilms the fused microbial cells and extracellular polymeric substances eps form the biofilm which provides a favorable mode of subsistence for the microorganisms even in a hostile environment the biofilm also promotes a more sustainable environment that enhances reproduction and growth of metabolisms greatly influencing the corrosion mechanisms beech and gaylarde 1999 machuca 2016 the polymeric substances within the multispecies bacteria colony produce a mixed complex array of dynamic corrosive microenvironments that boost the steel material deterioration this complexity poses difficulty in the understanding of the microbial process and addressing the subsequent challenges machuca 2016 the marine and offshore infrastructures under the microbial biofilm complexity continue to experience severe degradation especially in micro organism communities where the sulphate reducing bacteria iron oxidizing bacteria manganese oxidizing sulphate oxidizing bacteria acid producing bacteria and the exopolymers coexist in the same colony or biofilm beech and gaylarde 1999 this synergistic consortium alters the electrochemical processes resulting in microbiologically influenced localized pitting corrosion that reduces the integrity of the structure the byproduct of the bacteria metabolism cracks the corrosion protection layer thereby exposes the steel material to severe degradation chandrasekaran and jain 2016 the loss of structural integrity occurs when the structure becomes susceptible owing to the breakdown of the thin passive oxide film that resists corrosion the breakdown is due to the formation of organic and inorganic deposits on the structure surfaces that compromise the stability of the oxide film beech and gaylarde 1999 further growth of the micro organisms sustains the growth of pit formation and pit density across the length of the pipeline resulting in mic induced failures of offshore shipping and process systems for example pipeline leakages and ruptures ballast tank and cargo tank leakages beech and gaylarde 1999 eckert 2003 paik and kim 2012 these mic induced failures lead to direct and indirect consequences with associated economic losses risks to model the mic potential and its propagation several researchers have proposed mechanistic models marciales et al 2019 for instance gu et al 2009 proposed a bioenergetic based theory to describe the thermodynamic mechanism for type i mic formation by sulphate reducing bacteria srb the type 1 mic formation occurs due to the process of microbes respiration on exogenous oxidants this process involves an extracellular electron transfer by the sulphate or nitrate ions into the microbial cytoplasm this is mostly involved in electrogenic biofilms formation the authors emphasized the possibility of alteration in the electrochemical corrosion mechanisms during this phenomenon they argued that the process of thermodynamic equilibrium based potential analysis only determines the potential of mic formation but does not alter the rate of corrosion wastage they also concluded that an integrated mechanistic model through involvement of microbial growth kinetics mass transfer and various chemical biochemical and electrochemical reactions would provide a more reliable tool for prediction of mic potential sørensen et al 2012 proposed a risk based mic model for the worst case pitting corrosion rate and risk factors based on sulphate reducing archaea sra sulphate reducing bacteria srb and methanogens met the authors showed that in the combined colony of the bacteria the rate of wastage increases they suggested a proactive plan for the potentially high pit generation rate due to the exponential growth of microbial cells al darbi et al 2005 developed a mathematically and or numerically based polarization model they described the cathodic srb mediated polarization as it affects the corrosion rate overtime at different pit depth increments the developed anaerobic model in the srb environment was based on cathodic depolarization which describes the corrosion rate dependency on the consumption rate of sulphate by the srb and the change in pit depth more details on the mechanistic models for mic potential and rate prediction and their limitations are presented in marciales et al 2019 generally these models are not dynamically structured to reflect the complexity and nonlinear interdependency among mic influencing factors for real time application and failure probability prediction in the recent years advanced models approaches that better predict the microbial potential based on the screening and operating parameters and their influence on corrosion wastage of oil and gas infrastructures have been introduced these include experimental regression quantitative and probabilistic tools heyer 2013 huang et al 1997 liu and cheng 2018 caleyo et al 2009 taleb berrouane et al 2018 wolodko et al 2018 papavinasam et al 2010 experimentally analyzed effects of physical pipeline parameters and fluid characteristics on internal pitting corrosion the researchers identified the pipe diameter thickness inclination angle production rate co 2 partial pressure and concentration of bicarbonates sulphate h 2 s and chloride as pit corrosion contributing factors pots et al 2002 proposed a quantitative methodology to assess critical parameters contributing to the corrosion rate in a microbial infested environment six factors such as water presence ph salinity water wetting dissolved solids and temperature exhibited the key roles however the complex nature of the interactions of the biotic and abiotic parameters poses a challenge in the application of this model further models that correlate the operating parameters metallurgical properties pit formation and its propagation over time are found in the open sources caleyo et al 2009 mahmoodian and li 2018 ossai et al 2015 the stochastic nature of mic pit formation and growth requires dynamic models such as the markov poisson petri nets and bayesian network approaches for pit depth distribution prediction for example hong 1999 used the combined inhomogeneous poisson and markov strategies to model pit generation and its depth growth it was found that the point of surface wetting and coating breakdown play key roles in pit generation the kolmogorov forward equation through a time transformation condensation method was used similarly other researchers ossai et al 2016a valor and caleyo 2007 valor et al 2013 proposed a nonhomogeneous and continuous time linear growth pure birth markov procedure for pit depth distribution they made efforts to predict pit growth characteristics and the corroded pipeline failure time under the influence of the pipeline s operating parameters although the probabilistic models provide a better representation of the randomness in corrosion pit nucleation and growth compared to deterministic tools kaduková et al 2014 shabarchin and tesfamariam 2016 suarez and polomka 2018 bazán and beck 2013 the reviewed probabilistic models do not consider the microbial influence on corrosion rate and failure probability some of them are also empirically formulated with multiple inspection data fitted for a comparative framework that have limitations due to sparse data availability and an associated high degree of uncertainties generally mic significantly contributes to the failures of offshore systems and the associated risks pipeline deterioration progressively increases the risk of failure over time the safety of a pipeline is dependent on the management of the remaining useful life and the reliability estimation which determine the intervention measures over time hasan et al 2012 mishra et al 2019 nizamani et al 2016 ossai et al 2015 these can only be forecasted if the failure probability of the defective pipeline is known the recent improvements in inspection techniques such as acoustic emission guided waves ultrasonic testing gwut visual imaging and photography autonomous underwater vehicles auvs remotely operating vehicles rovs and marine inspection robotic assistant mira systems have enhanced the capacity for marine offshore assets integrity assessment for failure based prediction abbas and shafiee 2020 ahmed et al 2015 carellan et al 2014 giurgiutiu et al 2015 despite considerable attempts to understand predict and manage mic in the oil and gas industry one critical aspect of offshore systems integrity management under mic that remains unsolved is how to dynamically predict the mic rate failure probability and future mic pit depth distribution of a corroding offshore system from single inspection data and by monitoring operating parameters the existing models are not adequate for the precise prediction of the corrosion rate and failure probability in a dynamic and complex microbial infested environment there are a limited number of dynamic quantitative models to evaluate the mic rate and failure probability considering dynamic nonlinear interdependency among contributory factors the main objective of this research is to develop an integrated bn markov process model for predicting the mic rate failure probability and future pit depth distribution under microbiologically influenced internal corrosion and its effects on offshore system structural integrity the mic influential factors are represented using bn to capture their dynamics nonlinear dependency and interdependency the system failure characteristics based on the critical pit depth state and the future mic pit depth distribution are estimated using a markovian process for an offshore system the remaining of the paper is structured as follows section 2 presents the failure assessment due to mic section 3 briefly describes the proposed research methodology section 4 includes and illustrates the application of the methodology using a case study section 5 provides the research results and discussion and section 6 highlights the most important findings of this study 2 failure assessment due to microbiologically influenced corrosion several probabilistic approaches have demonstrated high potential for assessing the failure of offshore systems with corrosion defects especially pitting corrosion ossai et al 2016a valor and caleyo 2007 valor et al 2013 the integrated bn markov process provides a better multi dimensional dependency modeling capability for the prediction of the mic rate and corroding offshore systems failure probability the main elements of the integrated model are briefly illustrated in the following subsections 2 1 bayesian network several modeling and deterministic methodologies have shown limitations for modeling of complex and dynamic dependencies among the contributory parameters arabloo et al 2015 ghiasi et al 2015 kamari et al 2014a kamari et al 2014b kamari et al 2015 zendehboudi et al 2018 the application of a bn tool for probability modeling can capture the interactions of the multivariate influential factors and their dynamic dependency nature and predict their nonlinear relationships adedigba et al 2016b khakzad et al 2013 taleb berrouane et al 2018 the bn is a strong approach for complex system modeling especially in stochastically formulated scenarios where deterministic or mathematical models have shown limited applications in fact bn provides a better dependency framework for both multi state and multi dimensional configurations chandrasekaran 2015 islam et al 2018 some of the recent studies focusing on the use of bn for mic potential prediction can be found in the literature bhandari et al 2017 dawuda 2019 taleb berrouane et al 2018 the bn technique is a probabilistic inference tool for reasoning and prediction under uncertainties adumene et al 2020 chandrasekaran 2016 it is represented by a specific graphical model called a directed acyclic graph which demonstrates the logical relationship between random variables in terms of their conditional probabilities the nodes are characterized by directed arcs that depict causal conditional dependencies among parent and child nodes an assigned conditional probability table is used to model the dependencies among the nodes adedigba et al 2016a khakzad et al 2013 using bn modeling the process of dependency representation can be vertically and horizontally framed the former describes where the intermediate nodes depend on the root cause nodes while the latter describes the dependency of root cause nodes on each other taleb berrouane et al 2018 this configuration exhibits both the qualitative and quantitative capability of bn for a random set of operating variables u x 1 x n the chain rule and joint probability distribution p u based on conditional independence is mathematically represented by the following equation jensen and nielsen 2007 1 p u i 1 n p x i p x x i where p x x i introduces the parent of variable x i and p u refers to the joint probability distribution of the variables the probability of x i is calculated as follows 2 p x i u x i p u where the summation is taken over all the variables except x i the bn updates the prior probability of events upon the availability of new information called evidence e using bayes theorem to produce the consequence probability called posterior equation 3 is used to estimate the posterior probability also in bn canonical probabilistic models are utilized to signify the canonical interactions between nodes and provide techniques for statistical dependencies and nonlinear modeling adedigba et al 2016a 3 p u e p u e p e p u e u p u e in the recent research works bhandari et al 2017 palencia et al 2019 taleb berrouane et al 2018 the bn model technique has exhibited good potential for mic susceptibility and defect growth prediction in the dynamic marine environment hence the current work builds on the technique practicality to determine the mic rate considering the dynamics of the monitoring operating parameters and the environmental factors 2 2 markov chain approach the markov chain tool stochastically uses random variables to model the probability of future events on the basis of the present events in sequence the markov model assumes a memoryless principle where given the likelihood of the present event the probability of the future event is independent of the past event but relies on the present sheskin 2011 for a markov chain of n states designated by 1 2 n the random variable x n represents the state of the process at any specified time step the indexed sequence of the random variables x 0 x 1 x 2 is observed at different time steps over the system life cycle if this sequence x 0 x 1 x 2 satisfies the markov property its mathematical formulation gives the following expression grabski 2015 4 p x t 1 s x t s t x t 1 s t 1 x 0 s 0 p x t 1 s x t s t for all t 1 2 3 and for all states s 0 s 1 s t s the markov chain is formulated given the system states and the transitions between different states the transition intensity rate μ i j and the transition probability p i j characterize the markov approach these transition probabilities are estimated by a set of kolmogorov s forward equation kfe and for the multi state markov process the laplace stieltjes transform and its inverse are used to estimate the states transition probabilities lisnianski et al 2010 the generated transition probability matrix is represented by a vector notation as p i j where i j

bn markov method for mic rate and failure assessment this section presents the developmental stages of an integrated bn markov methodology for prediction of mic rate failure probability and future pit wastage propagation of a corroding offshore system under the microbial influence as shown in fig 1 the modeling approach begins with assessing the contributory factors to microbial growth and their probabilities microbial counts and sets of inspection data followed by the use of the bn model to forecast the mic rate and then integrate it into the markov approach to estimate the failure probability the following subsections describe the hybridized modeling strategy 3 1 collection of relevant information and data information regarding the offshore system is collected by the inspection measurements and fluid analysis this information data may include but not limited to the operating characteristics and parameters e g temperature salinity ph velocity exposure time alloy composition sulphate ions chloride ions co2 partial pressure water cut microbial count mechanical properties design characteristics extent of corrosion flaws and their geometry 3 2 estimation of mic rate using bayesian network according to several research studies guedes soares et al 2005 ossai et al 2016a 2015 papavinasam et al 2010 pots et al 2002 there are different degrees of correlations among the monitoring operating parameters e g co 2 partial pressure bicarbonates concentration sulphate concentration h 2 s content chloride concentration water cut ph salinity temperature with the corrosion rate and the maximum defect depth in particular ossai et al 2015 used the regression model to analyze the linear dependencies among the operating parameters and defect growth although the approach is able to determine the corrosion rate under the prevailing environmental conditions it is limited to analyze the non linearity and dynamic interdependencies among the operating parameters and their effects on the microbial corrosion defect rate for complex relationships between the operating parameters corrosion influencing parameters and the microbial corrosion defect rate bn provides a reliable modeling capacity it captures the multi dimensional interactions and influences of the operating parameters and the srb on the microbial corrosion rate simultaneously at any given operating condition bn also offers a practical probabilistic network based model for prediction of mic defect rate where a single set of inspection data is available with a historical data log for the monitoring operating variables environmental factors and micro organisms adumene et al 2020 to implement the bn model the probabilities of the mic influencing factors are estimated prior probabilities from the available monitoring operating parameters and environmental factors data set information by data partitioning the operating parameters metallurgical parameters and environmental factors are used as the input parameters to simulate the process based on their prior estimated probabilities the cause consequences relationships are then modeled using the bn framework the conditional probabilities define the dependency among the corrosion influencing parameters the conditional probabilities for the intermediate srb node and the child mic rate node are created by exploring the dynamic relationships among different microbial corrosion influencing factors in long term exposure also a part of the information is derived from theoretical and experimental corrosion model proposed by the researchers de waard et al 1991 papavinasam et al 2010 and available field data by inputting the prior probabilities of these mic vital factors and the conditional probabilities the mic rate is predicted for this research some of the bn nodes are categorized into high moderate and low states depending on the range of the available operational data in contrast others are expressed in two states present and absent or yes and no which describe a state of the positive assertion of a cause of a specific variable and their interacting effect on the mic rate it is important to note that upon the availability of new information data the model is dynamically updated and the evidence can be set on the various mic rate categories to predict the posterior probabilities of the contributory factors for different scenarios all the bns in this work are simulated in the genie software environment 3 3 mic pit states and pipe wall discretization the pipeline wall thickness is discretized into mic pit states as shown in fig 2 the discretized states given by i 1 2 n represent the different degrees of corrosion wastage on the internal surface of the offshore pipeline the initial state and subsequent states are bounded by a given interval to define different mic pit depths of the pipeline the critical depth n is the corrosion penetration depth of the pipe wall that results in total failure over time i e over 80 corrosion wastage the continuous growth of the mic pit is depth and time dependent the greater the depth of the pit the higher the corrosion rate with time 3 4 estimation of mic pit depth states transition probabilities given the present pit depth state g n at time n the pipeline future pit depth state after time n can be described by g n 1 g n 2 while the past state is g 0 g n 1 if the value g n i is known the future pit depth evolution of the chain can be predicted which depends only on i it is stochastically independent of the past values or states g n 1 g 0 therefore given the present state of the mic pit depth with characterized mic rate μ i j across the state over time the transition probability function of the mic pit depth states as shown in fig 1 can be defined by the kolmogorov forward equations as follows 6 d p g 11 t d t μ 12 t p g 11 t d p g 12 t d t μ 12 t p g 11 t μ 23 t p g 12 t d p g 13 t d t μ 23 t p g 12 t μ 34 t p g 13 t d p g n t d t μ n t p g n t where g 1 g n introduce the mic pit depth states p g 11 t p g n t are the probabilities of the pits in the state g i j i j 1 2 n with the sum of the pit depth state transition probability function equal to one as presented below 7 i 1 n p g i t p g 11 t p g 12 t p g n t 1 for a pit depth in state 1 after inspection the prior distribution gives p g 11 t 1 the prior distribution serves as the initial condition for future pit depth propagation prediction over time applying the multi state element approach equation 6 is solved for the transition probability across the states using the laplace stieljes transformation and its corresponding inverse transform lisnianski et al 2010 the resulting state transition probability matrix and generator matrix are written below 8 t r a n s i t i o n m a t r i x p p i j p g 11 p g 12 p g 13 p g 21 p g 22 p g 23 p g n 1 p g n 2 p g n 3 9 generator matrix q μ 12 t μ 12 t 0 0 0 μ 23 t μ 23 t 0 0 0 μ 34 t μ 34 t the element in the i t h row and j t h column p i j indicates the probability when going from pit depth state i to pit depth state j in one step this is referred to as one step pit depth transition probability while the square transition matrix p p i j i j s is called the one step pit depth transition matrix 3 5 prediction of pit depth distribution and failure probability having the mic rate as evaluated in subsection 3 2 and the mic state transition probability see subsection 3 4 the pit depth state failure probability is predicted for the critical pit depth using the markovian procedure this is achieved through a probabilistic formulation using equation 5 the time dependent failure probability is then evaluated over the life cycle of the offshore pipeline the failure profile of the system is drawn to estimate the likelihood of exceeding the target threshold probability based on the annual target probability safety class for offshore pipelines dnv 2010 the time of occurrence is also estimated from the failure probability profile for the different defect depths and geometries therefore given the evaluated corrosion rate the time dependent linear corrosion growth models presented by mahmoodian and li 2017 and witek 2018 are adopted for the future pit depth prediction in the research analysis the decision making process in offshore system health management is often limited by inadequate knowledge of the operating parameters and the stochastic degradation due to environmental factors also limited data and restricted access to the offshore systems platform could impair accurate information for decision making hence based on the predicted failure likelihood and future state of the asset critical decision making against total failure can be inferred by operators and integrity managers the outcomes of the nonlinear parametric interactions between the monitoring operating variables using bn provide reliable predictions of mic rate at various prevailing environmental conditions the likely failure probability and critical failure year are predicted based on the evaluated corrosion rate the proposed methodology presents a new application of the bn markovian methodology in mic analysis the proposed approach offers an efficient operational decision making strategy under mic the illustrative computational example for the hybrid connectionist methodology is shown in the supplementary material 4 application of methodology case study the proposed methodology is demonstrated with a case study using inspection data and operating parameters eckert 2003 based on the established cause effect interaction among monitoring operating parameters and the mic defect rate the limited available data is used as the mean value for the analysis it is further used to simulate data set for a period of 5 years cases of offshore subsea pipeline failure due to corrosion defects have been reported in the literature liu et al 2016 mohd and kee 2013 eckert 2003 three segments of an offshore subsea oil pipeline with different internal mic pit depths taken from the available data information are used to assess the methodology the pipeline segments pit depths for the case study are shown in table 1 for this analysis the offshore subsea pipeline defect is microbiologically influenced and the initial single corrosion pit depth is used for the case study the wall thickness is discretized into four pit depth states to reduce the mathematical complexity and computational costs associated with complex multi state systems the mic pits are assumed stable and there is a sustainable growth over the period under consideration predicting the time dependent failure likelihood of microbiologically influenced corroded offshore pipeline is paramount in safety and integrity management in the oil and gas industry as the corrosion defect grows in an in service pipeline the pipeline gradually loses its strength and is prone to failure at any time when the residual strength is equal to or less than the operating pressure of the pipeline due to the stochastic nature of mic pit formation and its propagation the mic rate is probabilistically predicted it is used as the transition intensity for the failure probability estimation in this study assuming at the time of inspection 5 1 years the operating conditions and the measured parameters are the same for the three segments the monitoring operating parameters are then partitioned into set bounds high moderate and low to estimate the parameters prior probabilities based on the data counts within the range as shown in table 2 for characterization of the prevalent operating environmental conditions the estimated prior probabilities and the conditional probabilities are used as the probabilistic input data for the bn model for the conditional probabilities additional information from the theoretical and experimental corrosion model proposed by the previous works de waard et al 1991 papavinasam et al 2010 is obtained in the case of incomplete information data from subject matter experts and the literature bhandari et al 2017 taleb berrouane et al 2018 is used for the analysis the mechanical properties of the api 5l pipeline are listed in table 3 all parameters see tables 2 and 3 are required to predict the critical mic pit depth probability of failure critical year of failure and the time evolution pit depth distribution of the offshore subsea pipeline furthermore the following assumptions are made in this hybrid modeling a the data bounds as reported in table 3 represent the prevailing environmental conditions for the period under consideration b the future defect growth is predicted based on the mic defect rate it is constant for the period under study c the markovian method is established based on the assumption that the asset is at an initial state with no defects at the commencement of the offshore operation d the mic defect growth is assumed to linearly propagate e the different pipe segments are subjected to the same environmental conditions the computational procedure is found in the supplementary material 5 results and discussion the primary objective of developing the integrated bn markov model is to precisely predict the mic rate from a single set of inspection data and the operational parameters the mic rate is used as the transition intensity for determination of the probability of failure and the critical failure year of an internally corroded subsea pipeline to model the mic rate the bn is built connecting the intermediate and basic events by arcs designating the dependency and interdependency among the contributory factors the vital parameters and their probabilities are given in table 2 see section 4 they serve as the input parameters and are used to simulate the bn model the bn is constructed based on a cause consequences relationship among the operating parameters environmental factors material properties and the mic rate the parametric learning of the developed bn uses the prior probabilities and conditional probabilities for the monitoring of operating parameters as the input data to predict the mic rate fig 3 demonstrates the developed bn model which dynamically predicts the mic rate given the prior probabilities of the monitoring operating parameters environmental factors and metallurgical properties it is found that temperature water cut flow velocity and ph are of importance in the microbial growth and the mic rate simultaneously the predicted mic rates from the parametric simulation of the bn model for the corroding offshore subsea oil pipeline under the prevailing conditions are obtained to be 0 0779 0 1423 0 3672 and 0 4125 respectively for the low moderate high and severe corrosion categories the results explore the parameters interactions this is in agreement with the findings and data of ossai et al 2016a and nace rp0775 2005 furthermore a sensitivity analysis is performed on the bn model to identify the degree of influence of each operating parameter on the mic rate it follows that within the temperature range 21 oc 45 oc the mic rate increases by 4 2 the bn model analysis shows that temperature is a key factor contributing to the srb metabolism and the rate of defect growth under mic further confirmation on the effects of temperature on microbial corrosion in the marine environment is obtained based on the previous studies bhandari et al 2017 guedes soares et al 2005 melchers 2002 the effect of seawater salinity on the mic phenomenon and rate is crucial especially in seawater environments according to the sensitivity analysis the salinity exhibits a moderate support for srb sustenance for the case study with an increase in the mic rate of 1 7 however the degree of influence is mainly site specific the effect of alloy composition is premised on its susceptibility due to the breakdown of the passive protective film at this point the mic of identifiable depth is formed evaluating the effect of the alloy composition an increase of 1 9 in the mic rate is noticed the sensitivity analysis of the ph based on an overly acidic state indicates that the mic rate increases by 1 7 this confirms the important role of the water phase of the multiphase flow systems in the carbonic acid formation and buffering of ph in oil and gas production processes according to the bn modeling results ph which is a dependent variable is positively correlated with temperature and co2 partial pressure the combined characteristic effects of these parameters promote a high rate of system degradation in a microbial infested environment flowing velocity exhibits different distribution for both internal and external microbial corrosion in the marine environment the low fluid velocity supports the formation and sustainability of complex microbial biofilms on the internal surface of the pipeline hence it is crucial to dynamically analyze the effect of flow velocity on the srb metabolism and the corrosion rate for low fluid speed and high water cut it is observed that the mic rate increases by 2 7 and 1 6 respectively this reflects the significant effect of these operating parameters on the mic rate of the corroded subsea oil pipeline the systematic analysis of the impacts of sulphate ion concentration chloride concentration and the co 2 partial pressure reveals their relative contribution to the mic rate it is found that the mic rate increases by 2 4 2 7 and 1 6 respectively due to the sulphate ion concentration chloride ion concentration and co 2 partial pressure effects at this condition inorganic acid is formed and can be further metabolized by oxidation to form so 4 2 which creates sustainable nutrient sources for srb growth and promotes a severe mic rate upon an increase in the exposure time and the srb counts the mic rate increases by 2 1 and 10 1 respectively which is in agreement with the findings of melchers and jeffrey 2008 based on the parametric sensitivity analysis the srb count exhibits a severe effect on the mic rate compared to other parameters under the same operating conditions hence the srb significantly affects the mic rate and future mic pit depth distribution for the subsea pipeline table 4 reports a summary of the percentage effects of the operating parameters on the mic rate this phase of the study provides an initial validation of the model fig 4 further highlights the impacts of the operating parameters on the srb enhancement more analysis of the contributory factors lower and upper bound probability effects on the mic rate is performed by setting evidence on the bounds of the influential factors new sets of mic rates are predicted as shown in figs 5 and 6 it is noticed that the mic rate is increased by 40 4 for the severe corrosion category with evidence on the upper bound probability compared with the parametric learning result this confirms the dynamics of the contributory parameters on the mic rate the bn framework also shows the capacity to model the dynamic nonlinear dependencies among the key factors the summary of the results for the different scenarios is given in table 5 a comparative analysis of the lower and upper bounds mic rates shows an increase of 11 33 and 53 2 for the high and severe corrosion category respectively this increase in the mic rate will promote a rapid failure in offshore systems where water hang up and slug formation pose critical challenges it is important to avoid such a sudden system failure through development of a useful and reliable predictive strategy the estimated upper bound mic rate is integrated into the markovian stochastic procedure to evaluate the mic pit depth state transition probabilities the formulated transition probability function and the defined prior pit depth state distribution are then used to determine the failure probability for the three corroded subsea pipeline segments at the point of inspection the corrosion defect for pipe segment 1 is at pit depth state 1 segment 2 at pit depth state 2 and segment 3 at pit depth state 3 based on the pipeline s wall thickness discretization the results of the analysis are presented in fig 7 for the three segments of the subsea pipeline with different mic pit depths it is found that the time evolution failure probability for the three segments is progressively increased with a higher magnitude for the third pipeline segment it is concluded that under the same operating and environmental conditions components with greater corrosion depth segment 3 will experience an early failure compared to the two other components this finding is in agreement with the previous studies aljaroudi et al 2015 ossai et al 2016a it implies that the critical failure year and risk increase for a severely corroded offshore pipeline the predicted failure probability for the three segments and the mean first passage time critical failure year are provided in table 6 these parameters are estimated from the failure probability profile of the critical pit depth state exceeding 80 of the pipe wall thickness as shown in fig 7 based on the normal safety class annual target probability of failure for corroded offshore pipelines dnv 2010 the results exhibit the time dependent effect of microorganisms on the degradation process of offshore pipelines the stochastic natures of the operating parameters affect the residual strength of the corroding subsea pipeline it follows that as the mic rate increases the residual strength continues to decline limiting the structural resistance to the internal pressure loading most importantly the residual strength is exponentially reduced when the microbial biofilm results in a sustainable growth and a protective environment the biofilm lowers the effect of corrosion inhibitors biocides and continues to influence the development of the mic pit at multiple growth rates a sudden failure is inevitable under this condition in the absence of a proactive monitoring framework and model for failure probability prediction the impacts of mic rate on failure probability and critical failure time are illustrated in fig 8 and table 7 according to the results if the mic rate is increased the failure probability increases while the critical failure year decreases thus an early failure of the pipeline is anticipated by increasing the mic rate a comparative analysis of figs 7 and 8 reveals a backward shift in the critical failure year which reflects the dynamics of the mic rate on the system failure time and probability figs 9 11 present the time evolution mic pit depth distribution for the three pipeline segments the extreme upper bound mic rate is tripled to reflect the dynamics of the mic rate increase on pit depth distribution over time it is found that the future pit depth distribution is significantly increased with an increase in depth and growth rate this is in agreement with the previous research works ossai et al 2016a valor and caleyo 2007 valor et al 2013 however for the first pipeline segment the low corrosion category shows less significant growth over the pipeline s life cycle this might be due to a low mic rate and less influence from the contributory factors a gradual or limited growth may be experienced at a specific corrosion rate lower than the low corrosion category threshold the predicted time evolution pit depth distribution provides a guide on the likelihood of how microorganisms enhance the pit corrosion wastage in offshore pipelines it is important to note that due to the complexity of microbial behaviors and colony formation the mic rate may exponentially increase and result in a sudden failure of the system fig 12 displays the time evolution probabilities for the first and second corroded pipeline segments pit depth states 1 and 2 respectively this is important to show the point of lower bound intersection between the two states probabilities this indicates the likely threshold for inspection or intervention decision making to avoid a total failure as mentioned earlier in the 9th year of exposure the pits depth states probabilities for the first and intermediate states are at the midpoint based on fig 7 the predicted critical pit depth failure probability increases and exceeds the threshold as the year of exposure increases e g at the 11th year 14th year and 18th year for the three pipe segments respectively the introduced method provides guidelines tips for timely decision making to prevent the total failure of the corroding subsea pipeline hence an optimal cost effective and timely intervention plan could be implemented 6 conclusions the present study demonstrates the application of an integrated bn markov methodology for the prediction of a time dependent mic rate failure probability and critical failure year of the corroding subsea pipeline more emphasis is placed on the effects of the operating parameters and srb on the mic rate this also covers the effect of mic rate on the likelihood of failure of the pipeline after long term exposure the developed model is tested using three corroded subsea pipeline segments the bn demonstrates the potential for complex dependency modeling among the mic rate influencing parameters and quantitatively predicts their values the degree of influence of the corrosion controlling parameters on the mic rate is explored the capacity of the bn is also assessed to update the mic rate given a new set of information about the operating conditions of the pipeline according to the parametric sensitivity analysis temperature fluid velocity and srb among other factors cause a severe effect on the mic rate and the failure of the pipeline this is also confirmed by the previous studies the predicted mic rate is used in the markovian approach to predict the failure probability and critical failure year for the three segments under the same operating conditions but with different mic pit depth states it is concluded that as the corrosion pit depth increases the failure likelihood and risk of failure increase with time while the critical failure time decreases this is anticipated in aging corroded offshore pipelines this further highlights the reliability and accuracy of the proposed approach nevertheless only the linear defect growth corrosion model is considered for the future pit depth distribution based on the results of the critical pit depth failure probability profile for the three pipeline segments the following decision making can be inferred if the corroded pipe segments are assumed to be in series failure of one segment constitutes pipeline failures an optimal and cost effective 3 5 year inspection or intervention plan can be made otherwise if the failure of all segments is required for the system to fail an individual inspection plan may be required for this case study a 4 year e g 9th year 13th year and 17th year respectively inspection or intervention plan can be implemented for the three corroded pipe segments to protect them from sudden failure and its consequences in addition improving material composition and pipeline design practical parametric monitoring and proper application of pigging and high quality site specific biocides can mitigate sudden failures due to mic the proposed model presents an effective early warning and monitoring tool upon mic formation on offshore components and for decision making nevertheless the model can be improved in future research by considering the time nonhomogeneous markovian approach nonlinear corrosion model integration and multi failure mechanisms under the

21299,pipeline walking is a global axial movement caused by the asymmetric distribution of axial force along the pipeline during the repetitive operational loading cycle the pipeline walking rate increasing with the loading cycles may lead to high stress thereby the failure of connectors at plets or plems current research studies and design guidelines focused on free end pipelines and neglected changes in the pipeline walking rate and axial resistance with effects of pipeline end structures however in practice several pipelines are adjacent to plets or plems which potentially affect the pipeline walking and expansion behaviour thereby walking rate and axial displacement this study analyses the walking phenomenon considering the effects of mobilisation of the resistance at the pipeline end structures and develops new analytical solutions for the present problem in terms of different walking mechanism maximum axial resistance p max and positions of pipeline end structures the analytical solutions are validated through numerical simulation results the case study results indicate the axial resistance generated by plets plems can effectively mitigate pipeline walking rate compared with free end pipeline walking in particular the influence of plets plems is investigated highlighting the sensitivity of the pipeline walking to the end boundary conditions covering different design scenarios keywords subsea pipeline pipeline walking rate pipeline neighbouring plet plem walking mitigation 1 introduction subsea pipelines play an important role in offshore oil and gas development projects as they are an efficient type of transportation facility the temperature and pressure of hydrocarbon resources in pipelines is generally very high and the pipeline exhibits large additional expansive axial force while in operation in addition the soil restriction on deep sea pipeline is weak and the additional expansive axial force therefore causes axial on bottom stability issues within the whole pipeline service duration pipelines are designed such that they can be maintained multiple times jayson et al 2008 thompson et al 2009 solano et al 2009 white et al 2015 dnvgl st f101 when the pipeline is shut down during maintenance the temperature of pipeline cools down to ambient temperature and the additional axial force is released after the maintenance pipeline is opened again the temperature of the pipeline heats up and the additional axial force is regenerated on the pipeline cross section in practice the axial force is asymmetrically distributed along the pipeline triggering the whole pipeline moving globally toward one direction after one loading cycle this global movement is termed as pipeline walking the walking rate accumulated with the pipeline loading cycle numbers and this may increase to a large enough magnitude to threaten the safety of neighbouring connecters or lose the pre stress of risers carr et al 2003 in the early stage of pipeline walking study several walking mechanisms were proposed and discussed to explain the walking phenomenon driskill 1981 konuk 1998 tornes et al 2000 carr et al 2006 calculated the walking rate based on the analysis of the effective axial force eaf profiles in the heating up and cooling down stages and indicated that the main three walking mechanisms are steel catenary riser scr tension seabed slope and thermal transient the eaf profiles based analysis method considers several key aspects such as boundary conditions soil restriction and loading conditions subsequently the impact factors on walking rate such as cyclic hardening behaviour of seabed soil hong et al 2019 multiphase flow behaviour bruton et al 2010 deformation velocity guha et al 2019 transverse and longitudinal vibrations in the fluid olunloyo et al 2007 lateral buckling and feed in cumming et al 2009 zhou et al 2010 and spacer pipe friction chen and chia 2010 were analysed and the walking rate prediction method are to be promoted these provide the significant basis for the comprehension and estimation of subsea pipeline walking yet most of proposed methods to evaluate the walking rate are currently assumed with a free end pipeline ignoring the effects of the operational modules e g pipeline end terminations plets and pipeline end manifolds plems connected to the subsea pipeline table 1 summarises the previous studies with different analyses methods and boundary conditions for assessing the walking rate of subsea pipelines the hot short pipe with the free end assumption is commonly considered in the analyses but additional considerations have been well noticed by castelo and galgoul 2012 they investigate the walking behaviour of a pipeline connected to a plet through a sliding component where the walking phenomenon is effectively mitigated by a stopper unit assembled on the sliding rail reda et al 2018 2019 presents more comprehensive studies for a short pipeline scr system considering design limits of scr anchorage spools etc and provides a clear design chart for positioning a hold back anchor to mitigate the subsea pipeline walking or expansion these highlight the potential effects of the subsea infrastructures on the behaviour of pipeline walking in fact several pipelines are often connected to plets or plems in practice with mudmats on the bottom of structures to maintain on bottom stability they may give a fully constraint e g plems or mobile e g plets where the mobile mudmat can be employed boundary to the subsea pipeline the reaction from plets or plems to the pipeline and how they influence the magnitude of walking rate are significant in the design practice of subsea pipeline these are the main focuses and innovations of this study and could provide useful supplement for the current design code such as dnv gl rp f114 2019 the next level of sophistication presented in this paper is to investigate these effects from the pipeline end structures that can slide freely or be in place completely at the pipeline ends to account for this issue we analyse the scr tension and downslope induced walking stage considering the influence of a plet plem using the analytical method then a series of analytical solutions for different situation have been provided for design practice the numerical simulation method is used to prove the reliability of analytical solutions based on the case study results the walking mitigation effect produced by the mudmat is discussed by the consideration of the installation position the magnitude of available resistance of mudmat 2 analytical solutions for predicting scr tension and downslope induced walking 2 1 scope of study the following analytical analyses of pipeline walking with effects of pipeline end structures are performed with the effective axial force eaf profiles based method both heating up and cooling down stages are accounted for and can be thought as a typical loading cycle in the analysis of pipeline walking two types of subsea structures connected to the pipeline of concern in the study are considered one is the plem in which the skirted mudmat or suction anchor is employed as underlaying foundation to anchor the whole structure in place while the other is the plet in which the surface mudmat called as mobile mudmat foundation is often used with the certain sliding distance along the pipeline allowed as evident the additional resistance can be provided from plem plet to their connected pipeline this potentially influences walking behaviour in particular the resistance magnitude and the position of the applied resistance could change the evolution of eaf and thus the walking rate as consideration above the entire analyses in this paper are divided into two main loading scenarios scr tension induced and downslope induced walking analyses each of which three sub analysis themes are included in terms of the magnitude of available resistance from the plem plet more details are tabulated in table 2 the mobilisation of resistance p from the plem plet against sliding distance s is considered as a linearly increasing elastic following a perfect plastic response for theme i and iv the magnitude of maximum available resistance p max is low and the pipeline end structure can freely slide through a loading cycle for theme ii and v the magnitude of maximum available resistance p max is intermediate and both conditions of freely sliding and completely in place are possible for the pipeline end structure through a cycle for theme iii and vi the value of p max is sufficiently large so that the pipeline end structure can be completely in place through a whole loading cycle considering the completely in place conditions of mudmat in the analysis the specified values of ranging p max can be simply identified by the calculation of resultant force along the axial pipeline for a whole pipe from terminal a to b see table 2 for instance for a scr tension induced walking analysis the necessary p max is equal to f l f f l is the axial soil friction and f is the scr tension force when the whole pipeline section ab moves towards terminal a and the mudmat is installed at terminal b with no movement allowed will be described in the later sub sections note for down slope scenario two installation positions of mudmat i e top and bottom of slope are also implemented when the different ranges of p max are considering in the analysis 2 2 analytical solutions of scr tension induced pipeline walking 2 2 1 theme i fig 1 demonstrates the eaf profiles during heating up stage of a pipeline with a length of l when the maximum axial resistance p max of the mudmat satisfies p max f l f the soil friction acting on the unit length of pipeline is f f μ w where μ is the equivalent friction coefficient and w is the submerged weight of pipeline per unit length the entire heating up stage was divided into two substages pipeline mobilisation substage and post mobilisation substage they can be identified by the timing when all pipeline sections i e section ag d1d2 and etc are motivated to expand as temperature increases the eaf profiles of the two substages are shown in fig 1 a and b respectively during the pipeline mobilisation substage some pipeline sections are fixed at its origin position and therefore the expansion in this substage does not account for the walking rate w t however the mudmat connected to the pipeline terminal b may slide with the expansion of pipeline and the axial soil resistance which generates in the interaction between the mudmat and the seabed and acts at the pipeline terminal b increases during this stage once the pipeline is fully mobilised an already mobilised resistance p h1 from mudmat will apply at terminal b and affect the subsequent distributions of eaf profiles the initial axial resistance p h1 acting on pipeline terminal b at the fully mobilised moment could be estimated by eaf profile based analyses during mobilisation substage as is illustrated in fig 1 a the eaf profile before heating up stage is line a gb the soil friction on pipeline section ag is mobilised due to the scr tension loaded at point a further the slope of line a g equals to the soil friction f the rest of the pipeline section gb is fixed on the seabed at this moment and will be gradually motivated in the mobilisation substage once the whole pipeline is heated with a tiny temperature increment x a c the eaf profile can be represented by line a d1 e1 b section gd1 and section be1 expand due to this temperature increment the length of section gd1 and section be1 can be expressed with the temperature increment x a c as follows 1 l gd 1 l be 1 e a α x a f when the temperature increment reaches 2x a c the eaf profile can be represented by line a d2 e2 b1 section d1d2 and section e1e2 start to expand during this temperature increment the length of section d1d2 is the same as section gd1 since the boundary and loading conditions remain unchanged however the axial resistance p of the mudmat acting on terminal b changes section e1e2 the axial resistance p is relative to the sliding distance s p ks where k is the equivalent elastic stiffness which depends on the interaction between mudmat and soil representing a horizontal mobilisation of mudmat under the tensile force from the connected pipeline in the process of temperature increasing from x a c to 2x a c the mudmat slides due to the expansion of section be1 which is motivated in the last temperature increment therefore the axial resistance p rises and makes section e1e2 shorter than section be1 the length of section e1e2 can be expressed as 2 l e 2 e 1 e a α x a p f e a α x a l

of section be1 when the temperature continually rises an increasing number of pipeline sections are excited and start to expand when the whole length of section gb is motivated after temperature increases n times with an interval of x a c the pipeline is fully mobilised therefore the total length can be determined based on the geometry feature shown in fig 1 a and can be expressed as the sum of each motivated pipeline section as the pipeline is fully mobilised 3 l gb l f f n e a α x a f 1 n 1 α x a k f n 1 e a α x a f according to eq 3 a specific number of temperature increments n could be calculated and an arbitrary tiny temperature increasing interval x a is determined therefore the temperature increment δt h when the pipeline is fully mobilised can be calculated δt h nx a based on the temperature increment δt h the initial axial resistance p h1 of the mudmat when the pipeline is fully mobilised can be calculated as follows 4 p h 1 e a α δ t h l bh 1 f e a α n x a l l ac l ch 1

axial displacement of midpoint o during one loading cycle is selected to represent the walking rate and this displacement can be divided into two parts axial displacement generated in heating up stage w th and axial displacement generated in cooling down stage w tc fig 1 b shows the evolution of eaf profiles in a subsequent post mobilisation substage and the axial eaf along pipeline at the fully mobilised time is represented as line a h1 b pipeline ab expands symmetrically around h1 and the virtual anchor point vap is h1 as terminal b expands with increasing temperature and the mudmat slides

δt h k of each step the axial resistance of the mudmat is p hi and the vap is h i at i th 1 i k heating step when the pipeline is heated from i th to i 1 th step the vap shifts from h i to h i 1

equation 5 can be expressed as 6 p h i 1 k p h i k α δ t p h i 1 p h i e a l 2 p h i 1 f 2 f therefore p h i 1 can be calculated based on the value of p hi the initial axial resistance p h1 is obtained according to eq 4 at the i th heating step the relative distance between midpoint o and vap h i can be expressed as 7 l oh i p h i f 2 f when the pipeline is heated from i th to i 1 th step midpoint o slides towards scr due to the expansion of the pipeline section oh i therefore the axial sliding displacement of midpoint o when the pipeline is heated from i th to i 1 th step can be calculated as follows 8 w th i ε l oh i 1 α δ t p h i 1 f 2 f combining eq 6 and eq 8 the axial slipping displacement of midpoint o when pipeline is heated from i th to i 1 th step can be solved therefore the axial slipping displacement of midpoint o during the post mobilisation substage can be expressed as 9 w th i 1 i k w th i i 1 i k ε l oh i 1 i 1 i k α δ t p h i 1 f 2 f similarly the whole cooling down stage can be divided into two substages pipeline mobilisation substage and post mobilisation substage the eaf profiles of the two substages are shown in fig 2 a and fig 2 b respectively the displacement in the mobilisation substage is also a part of the pipeline walking rate however the mobilisation process affects the initial axial resistance p c1 when the pipeline is first fully motivated in the cooling down stage fig 2 a shows the shift in eaf profiles in the mobilisation substage the contraction length of the pipeline section reaches the whole length of pipeline

for scr tension induced walking with plet plem proposed above is valid for the situation wherein the maximum axial resistance p max is lower than f l f when the value of p max satisfies f l f p max f l f the heating up mobilisation substage is same as that in theme i and eq 1 to eq 4 are still valid the vap shifts towards terminal b until it reaches terminal b in the heating up post mobilisation substage the position of vap remains at terminal b since p max is equal or larger than f l f the evaluation of eaf profiles in the heating up post mobilisation substage is shown in fig 3 a although the eaf profiles of theme ii in the heating up post mobilisation substage is different from those of theme i the accumulated axial displacement w th can also be calculated using eq 5 to eq 9 owing to the different distribution of eaf in the heating up stage the cooling down mobilisation substage is also different from it in theme i and these eaf profiles are illustrated in fig 3 b eq 10 is still valid for estimate initial axial resistance p c1 in theme ii however eq 11 should be updated as follows 16 p c 1 e a α δ t c p hk e a α n x b p hk besides other equations in theme i are still valid the accumulated axial displacement in the cooling down stage w tc can also be calculated with eq 12 to eq 14 the total walking can be estimated according to eq 15 2 2 3 theme iii the eaf profiles for maximum axial resistance p max satisfying p max f l f is shown in fig 4 in this situation the vap in the heating up and cooling down stages will finally reach terminal b and terminal b can be regarded as a reference point to evaluate scr induced walking rate w t after one loading cycle the walking rate w t equals to the difference between the mudmat slipping distance s in heating up stage and slipping distance s in heating up stage in addition as the axial resistance p at any heating up or cooling down step cannot exceed maximum axial resistance p max the slipping distance s and s change linearly with the axial resistance p therefore the scr tension induced walking rate w t after one loading cycle can be calculated as 17 w t s s p h k p c k k 2 f k 2 3 analytical solutions of

downslope induced walking rate w st is also follows the same procedure when the mudmat is installed at the top of the slope and the maximum axial resistance p max of the mudmat satisfies f 2 l p max f 1 l the major difference of eaf profiles is the cooling down mobilisation substage as shown in fig 7 thus the following equation should be used to replace eq 23 to calculate the initial axial

mudmat at the bottom of slope and p max satisfying p max f 2 l the second situation of theme iv therefore the equations in the second situation of theme iv are also valid 2 3 3 theme vi once the maximum axial resistance p max is equal or larger than f 1 l the eaf profiles during one loading cycle of downslope induced walking with the mudmat at the top of the slope and at the bottom of the slope are illustrated in fig 8 a and b respectively the vap shifts finally to the position of the mudmat and the walking rate of the entire pipeline can be evaluated with the axial displacement of the mudmat for pipeline with the mudmat installed at the top of slope the downslope induced walking rate w st can be calculated as follows 34 w st p c k p h k k f 1 l f 2 l k 2 w sin ϕ l k for the

eq 35 it can be found that the downslope induced walking rate w st equals w sb when the maximum axial resistance p max is equal or larger than f 1 l the position of the mudmat has no effect on the walking rate in this situation 2 4 summary of analytical solutions and its application scope the analytical solutions for different situations proposed herein is summarised in fig 9 for a clear demonstration sets of equations can be chosen to predict different walking mechanism maximum axial resistance p max and mudmat positions note the mobilisation distance of axial soil resistance along the pipeline is not considered in the analytical derivation which could lead to an overestimation in walking rate carr et al 2006 reda et al 2019 and the conservative estimation in design practice 3 finite element analyses 3 1 fea model description the proposed analytical solutions were validated with numerical simulation results using the commercially available software abaqus with standard analyses adopted dassault systèmes 2010 the pipeline is prescribed with the element type pipe31 as this study focusses on axial deformation of pipeline during the heating up and cooling down stages the pipeline is only allowed to move axially lateral movement is fixed during simulation the entire pipeline is divided homogeneously into 4000 meshes the seabed which acts as a frictional interface in simulation is simulated with the element type of c3d8r with all sides and bottom boundaries restricted the seabed is divided into 10 elements in the lateral direction 4000 elements in the axial direction and 1 element in the vertical direction the interaction between pipeline and seabed is modelled with the penalty method with a constant equivalate axial frictional coefficient μ the mobilisation distance for the pipe soil interaction takes 0 01d 0 003 m in this study by defining the penalty contact with the elastic slipping distance in the tangential behaviour specified as the detailed outline of upper structure of plet plem has no effect on pipeline walking it is equivalent to vertical pressure in simulation the mudmat is modelled as a rigid body with a square plate tied with one endpoint of the pipeline for passing the soil resistance on the mudmat to the pipeline hence the inline force can directly transfer from mudmat to underlying soil with no permit of deformation at the mudmat pipeline connection it is thought to be reasonable since the stiffness of connection between mudmat and pipeline is considerably larger than that mudmat and seabed soil the length and width of the mudmat are termed as l m and b its location depends on the simulation condition the maximum soil resistance in the heating up and cooling down stages are termed as p max and p max and corresponding mobilisation distance are s m and s m the gain in soil resistance feng and gourvenec 2016 yan et al 2014 zhou et al 2020a 2020b was considered in the simulation and the value of p max is larger than p max regarding the horizontal stiffness of mudmat k under the tensile force along the pipeline a linear elastic stiffness is adopted in the analysis it is calculated when p max or p max and s m or s m are known with p max or p max ks m or s m note p max or p max can be set up using the penalty contact method with p max or p max μm w m where μm is the frictional coefficient between mudmat and soil and w m is the submerged weight of mudmat the details of the pipeline as well as the mudmat and seabed properties are summarised in tables 3 and 4 the entire simulations are implemented in the scope of static analyses the loading conditions are specified as follows 1 the vertical component of the gravity was applied on the entire pipeline to make pipeline contact with seabed 2 for pipeline walking induced by scr tension a concentrated force is applied on one end of the pipeline to simulate the scr tension scenario for pipeline walking induced by seabed slope a tangential component of the gravity i e a tangential gravity component with value of w sinφ 44 5 n m applied on the pipeline in table 3 is applied on the pipeline to simulate the influence of slope 3 the pipeline is gradually and homogeneously heated up and the temperature of pipeline element rises only 1 c in each increment until the temperature reaches 100 c 4 the temperature of whole pipeline reduces with 1 c in each increment until the temperature falls to 0 c fig 10 shows the details of the finite element analysis model three types of scenarios scr tension induced walking downslope induced walking under the condition that the mudmat is installed on the top of the slope and downslope induced walking under the condition that the mudmat is installed on the bottom of the slope are calculated with the finite element method to verify the correction of our proposed analytical solutions 3 2 validation of fem model the reliability of the fem model was checked before using it to calibrate the proposed analytical solutions in this paper the publication related to the pipeline walking expansion covers case i and ii under a free end boundary condition documented by carr et al 2006 and white et al 2015 and case iii with a hold back anchor considered reda et al 2018 the relevant parameters adopted in the validation analyses are illustrated in table 5 the corresponding results are shown in fig 11 a and b from comparisons the accumulated walking displacements show almost identical responses see fig 11 a and only slight differences less than 3 in the axial displacements for both hot and cold end can be found see fig 11 b these prove that the fem model in this study is robust to be used for the further comparison with the proposed analytical results 3 3 comparison of walking rates from analytical and fem methods 3 3 1 scr tension induced pipeline walking the scr tension induced pipeline walking neighbouring plet plem was calculated with both finite element and analytical methods because values of p max and p max are both greater than fl f but smaller than fl f which is same with the assumption of theme ii the analytical result was calculated according to eqs 1 10 eqs 12 14 and eq 16 fig 12 a shows the comparison of eaf distribution between analytical results and fea results the eaf along pipeline extrapolated by every other 20 heating and cooling increments was plotted the axial slipping distance of the mudmat s exceeds the mobilisation distance s m when temperature reduction is larger than 24 c the axial resistance acting on the mudmat and pipeline terminal remains stable for the rest of the cooling down stage therefore the eaf distribution remains unchanged until the finish of this loading cycle fig 12 a shows that the development of eaf distribution with changing temperature which we assumed in solving the analytical solution agrees with fea results there is slight difference between analytical and fea results in eaf distribution and the prediction of axial resistance acting on the mudmat and eaf along the entire pipeline has high accuracy fig 12 b reveals the axial slipping trace of midpoint during the loading cycle according to two methods the midpoint moves towards scr in the heating up stage and moves slightly opposite to scr in the cooling down stage as the vap is located between the midpoint and the mudmat after the whole pipeline is heated and mobilised fig 12 a and the shifting of vap is quite small due to the short distance between the mudmat and the vap at the moment when the entire pipeline is just mobilised the increment in axial slipping of midpoint during heating up stage is almost linear in the cooling down stage the position of vap shifts from its initial position which is between scr and midpoint to its end position which is located between the midpoint and the mudmat and the decrease in axial slipping of midpoint with the decrement in temperature is nonlinear the axial slipping traces according to two methods are almost same during the whole loading cycle the walking rates after one loading cycle calculated with the analytical and fea methods are 0 514 m and 0 525 m respectively the analytical result is 2 14 lower than the fea result the analytical solution shows high accuracy in calculating walking rate note for better comparison the analytical results are modified with the mobilisation distance specified in the fem analyses of 0 003 m subtracted this processing is applied for the following comparisons described below 3 3 2 downslope induced pipeline walking the downslope induced pipeline walking neighbouring plet plem was calculated with both fea and analytical methods as the maximum axial resistance in the heating up stage p max is smaller than f 2 l which is same with the assumption of theme iv when the mudmat is installed at the top of the slope the analytical result was calculated according to eqs 18 25 when the mudmat is installed at the bottom of the slope the maximum axial resistance in cooling down stage p max is greater than f 2 l but smaller than f 1 l which is same with assumption of theme v the analytical result was calculated according to eqs 27 31 fig 13 a illustrates the eaf profiles extrapolated by every other 20 heating and cooling increments during one loading cycle when the mudmat is installed on the top of the slope the axial resistance on the mudmat reaches the maximum value when the temperature reduction reaches 69 c in the cooling down stage the eaf profile remains unchanged in the rest of the cooling stage the analytical results are still similar to the fea results fig 13 b demonstrates the development of the axial slipping of midpoint during the loading cycle because vap shifts heavily in both the heating up and cooling down stages the axial slipping distance of midpoint towards the bottom of the slope increases nonlinearly with the variation in temperature the increasing rate of axial slipping in the heating up stage or decreasing rate of axial slipping in the cooling down stage rises with the continued variations in temperature load the comparison between analytical results and fea results shows that the development tendency of axial slipping of midpoint according to the two methods are similar however the analytical solution may slightly overestimate walking rate due to the neglect to the initial tensile force caused by the tangential component of gravity before heating up the main relative error between the two methods mainly arises from the overestimated slipping generated in the beginning of the heating up stage the walking rates after one loading cycle are 0 096 m according to the analytical solution and 0 084 m according to the fea method the analytical result is 12 5 relatively higher than the fea result fig 14 a shows the eaf profiles extrapolated every other 20 heating and cooling increments when the mudmat is installed on the bottom of the slope the axial resistance on the mudmat reaches the maximum value when the temperature rises to 56 c in the heating up stage fig 14 b shows the corresponding axial slipping of midpoint the axial slipping trace according to analytical and fea methods are almost similar and the walking rates after one loading cycle are 0 135 m according to the analytical solution and 0 124 m according to the fea method the analytical result is 8 15 relatively higher than the fea result it is worth noting that the walking rate in fig 13 b is smaller than it in fig 14 b and it implies that the location of the mudmat on top or bottom of slope influence the walking rate in this case the mudmat performance is better in mitigating the walking rate when it is installed on top of the slope for other four loading cases themes i iii v and vi described earlier the further compared analyses are implemented note the parameters of pipelines and soil are not changed but the maximum axial resistance of mudmat p max in the heating up and cooling down processes are taken as the same value for each analysis theme indicating no consolidation hardening of soil involved in the analyses the corresponding values of p max and results are shown in table 6 it can be found that the discrepancy between results obtained by the analytical and fem methods are also close and the absolute value of discrepancy is not larger than 0 03 m 4 discussion the walking rates per loading cycle of free end pipelines with the same parameters listed in table 3 are calculated to compare it with walking rates of the pipeline neighbouring a plet plem the scr tension induced walking rate of free end pipeline is 0 845 m per loading cycle which is larger than the walking rate of the pipeline neighbouring a plet plem the downslope induced walking rate of the free end pipeline is 0 178 m per loading cycle which is also much larger than walking rate of pipeline affected by axial resistance of plet plem the tension and downslope induced walking rate and maximum axial resistance during one loading cycle under different endpoint boundaries are demonstrated in fig 15 the walking rate per loading cycle of the pipeline neighbouring a plet plem but without consideration of soil hardening is also calculated and proposed in fig 15 for illustrating the influence of neighbouring a plet plem on walking analysis fig 15 a shows that the mudmat generates an axial concentrated force of 216 kn at the endpoint of the pipeline and this axial resistance has a mitigation effect on tension induced walking rate leading to a 37 9 reduction in tension induced walking rate per loading cycle the walking rate is 0 521 m when the influence of axial resistance generated by the mudmat is considered but soil hardening is not considered which is smaller than the walking rate considering soil hardening the maximum axial resistance acting on the pipeline endpoint without considering soil hardening is 185 kn also lower than the axial resistance considering soil hardening therefore the reduction in walking rate contributed by the mudmat is not decided by the magnitude of axial resistance and the smaller axial resistance may contribute to a greater walking rate mitigation effect the walking rate mitigation effect of axial resistance generated by the mudmat for downslope induced pipeline walking is more complex as shown in fig 15 b the magnitude of walking rate reduction is influenced by both soil hardening effect and the position of the mudmat in this case the mudmat installed at the top of the slope perform better than those at the bottom of the slope the best performance in mitigating walking rate is observed when the mudmat is at the top of the slope and soil hardening is considered and the walking rate per loading cycle is 0 084 m an approximate 52 8 reduction compared with the walking rate of free end pipeline the worst performance is observed when the mudmat is at the bottom of the slope and soil hardening is considered the walking rate per loading cycle is 0 124 m and there is a reduction of 30 3 compared with the walking rate of the free end pipeline which is not bad in terms of controlling pipeline walking performance the comparisons between walking rate of free end pipelines and walking rate of the pipeline neighbouring the plet plem in both fig 15 a and b imply that the added axial resistance generated by the neighbouring mudmat can reduce the walking rate in practice the walking rate mitigation effect does not simply depend on the magnitude of maximum axial resistance the design is optimised according to different situations to achieve a greater walking rate reduction with less added axial resistance acting on the pipeline endpoint 5 conclusions this paper reports the analytical solutions to the walking rate of subsea pipelines neighbouring the plet plem under both scr tension and downslope conditions the influences of mobility of mudmat the magnitude of available resistance and the installation position of mudmat on the pipeline walking behaviour are examined on investigating the three different working themes for each loading scenario the mitigation effect on the walking rate of subsea pipeline can be observed by comparing a free boundary condition with some key insights as below for low available resistance from mudmat foundation theme i and iv the mudmat slips with pipeline during both heating up and cooling down stages yet its resistance still contributes to the build up of eaf of pipeline and gives an additional translation of vap resulting some certain reduce in walking rate for intermediate available resistance from mudmat foundation theme ii and v the mudmat though is completely fixed through the heating up stage the sliding occurs in the cooling down stage the resistance from mudmat can make more contributions to increase in eaf and reduce in translation of vap along the same direction in both heating up and cooling down stages and thus leads to more reduces in walking rate for high available resistance from mudmat foundation theme iii and vi the mudmat is completely in place through a whole loading cycle so the pipeline is restricted on the seabed this will lead to significantly large concentrated force at the connection between pipeline and mudmat so the localised strength checking in structure and larger mudmat in size are necessary in design the walking rate will entirely come from the axial deformation of mudmat notable that the proposed analytical solution mainly focuses on straight hot short pipelines neighbouring the plets plems where routine curves along the pipe and deformation of connection between the plet plem and the pipeline are neglected besides only constant or stepping increase in soil friction along the pipe are considered more complicated mobilisation of friction can refer to guha et al 2019 and hong et al 2019 however it is believable that the proposed analytical solution can provide a valuable supplement to the current code in subsea pipeline design as well some useful information to sizing the mudmat of the plet plem credit authorship contribution statement zhaohui hong

21299,pipeline walking is a global axial movement caused by the asymmetric distribution of axial force along the pipeline during the repetitive operational loading cycle the pipeline walking rate increasing with the loading cycles may lead to high stress thereby the failure of connectors at plets or plems current research studies and design guidelines focused on free end pipelines and neglected changes in the pipeline walking rate and axial resistance with effects of pipeline end structures however in practice several pipelines are adjacent to plets or plems which potentially affect the pipeline walking and expansion behaviour thereby walking rate and axial displacement this study analyses the walking phenomenon considering the effects of mobilisation of the resistance at the pipeline end structures and develops new analytical solutions for the present problem in terms of different walking mechanism maximum axial resistance p max and positions of pipeline end structures the analytical solutions are validated through numerical simulation results the case study results indicate the axial resistance generated by plets plems can effectively mitigate pipeline walking rate compared with free end pipeline walking in particular the influence of plets plems is investigated highlighting the sensitivity of the pipeline walking to the end boundary conditions covering different design scenarios keywords subsea pipeline pipeline walking rate pipeline neighbouring plet plem walking mitigation 1 introduction subsea pipelines play an important role in offshore oil and gas development projects as they are an efficient type of transportation facility the temperature and pressure of hydrocarbon resources in pipelines is generally very high and the pipeline exhibits large additional expansive axial force while in operation in addition the soil restriction on deep sea pipeline is weak and the additional expansive axial force therefore causes axial on bottom stability issues within the whole pipeline service duration pipelines are designed such that they can be maintained multiple times jayson et al 2008 thompson et al 2009 solano et al 2009 white et al 2015 dnvgl st f101 when the pipeline is shut down during maintenance the temperature of pipeline cools down to ambient temperature and the additional axial force is released after the maintenance pipeline is opened again the temperature of the pipeline heats up and the additional axial force is regenerated on the pipeline cross section in practice the axial force is asymmetrically distributed along the pipeline triggering the whole pipeline moving globally toward one direction after one loading cycle this global movement is termed as pipeline walking the walking rate accumulated with the pipeline loading cycle numbers and this may increase to a large enough magnitude to threaten the safety of neighbouring connecters or lose the pre stress of risers carr et al 2003 in the early stage of pipeline walking study several walking mechanisms were proposed and discussed to explain the walking phenomenon driskill 1981 konuk 1998 tornes et al 2000 carr et al 2006 calculated the walking rate based on the analysis of the effective axial force eaf profiles in the heating up and cooling down stages and indicated that the main three walking mechanisms are steel catenary riser scr tension seabed slope and thermal transient the eaf profiles based analysis method considers several key aspects such as boundary conditions soil restriction and loading conditions subsequently the impact factors on walking rate such as cyclic hardening behaviour of seabed soil hong et al 2019 multiphase flow behaviour bruton et al 2010 deformation velocity guha et al 2019 transverse and longitudinal vibrations in the fluid olunloyo et al 2007 lateral buckling and feed in cumming et al 2009 zhou et al 2010 and spacer pipe friction chen and chia 2010 were analysed and the walking rate prediction method are to be promoted these provide the significant basis for the comprehension and estimation of subsea pipeline walking yet most of proposed methods to evaluate the walking rate are currently assumed with a free end pipeline ignoring the effects of the operational modules e g pipeline end terminations plets and pipeline end manifolds plems connected to the subsea pipeline table 1 summarises the previous studies with different analyses methods and boundary conditions for assessing the walking rate of subsea pipelines the hot short pipe with the free end assumption is commonly considered in the analyses but additional considerations have been well noticed by castelo and galgoul 2012 they investigate the walking behaviour of a pipeline connected to a plet through a sliding component where the walking phenomenon is effectively mitigated by a stopper unit assembled on the sliding rail reda et al 2018 2019 presents more comprehensive studies for a short pipeline scr system considering design limits of scr anchorage spools etc and provides a clear design chart for positioning a hold back anchor to mitigate the subsea pipeline walking or expansion these highlight the potential effects of the subsea infrastructures on the behaviour of pipeline walking in fact several pipelines are often connected to plets or plems in practice with mudmats on the bottom of structures to maintain on bottom stability they may give a fully constraint e g plems or mobile e g plets where the mobile mudmat can be employed boundary to the subsea pipeline the reaction from plets or plems to the pipeline and how they influence the magnitude of walking rate are significant in the design practice of subsea pipeline these are the main focuses and innovations of this study and could provide useful supplement for the current design code such as dnv gl rp f114 2019 the next level of sophistication presented in this paper is to investigate these effects from the pipeline end structures that can slide freely or be in place completely at the pipeline ends to account for this issue we analyse the scr tension and downslope induced walking stage considering the influence of a plet plem using the analytical method then a series of analytical solutions for different situation have been provided for design practice the numerical simulation method is used to prove the reliability of analytical solutions based on the case study results the walking mitigation effect produced by the mudmat is discussed by the consideration of the installation position the magnitude of available resistance of mudmat 2 analytical solutions for predicting scr tension and downslope induced walking 2 1 scope of study the following analytical analyses of pipeline walking with effects of pipeline end structures are performed with the effective axial force eaf profiles based method both heating up and cooling down stages are accounted for and can be thought as a typical loading cycle in the analysis of pipeline walking two types of subsea structures connected to the pipeline of concern in the study are considered one is the plem in which the skirted mudmat or suction anchor is employed as underlaying foundation to anchor the whole structure in place while the other is the plet in which the surface mudmat called as mobile mudmat foundation is often used with the certain sliding distance along the pipeline allowed as evident the additional resistance can be provided from plem plet to their connected pipeline this potentially influences walking behaviour in particular the resistance magnitude and the position of the applied resistance could change the evolution of eaf and thus the walking rate as consideration above the entire analyses in this paper are divided into two main loading scenarios scr tension induced and downslope induced walking analyses each of which three sub analysis themes are included in terms of the magnitude of available resistance from the plem plet more details are tabulated in table 2 the mobilisation of resistance p from the plem plet against sliding distance s is considered as a linearly increasing elastic following a perfect plastic response for theme i and iv the magnitude of maximum available resistance p max is low and the pipeline end structure can freely slide through a loading cycle for theme ii and v the magnitude of maximum available resistance p max is intermediate and both conditions of freely sliding and completely in place are possible for the pipeline end structure through a cycle for theme iii and vi the value of p max is sufficiently large so that the pipeline end structure can be completely in place through a whole loading cycle considering the completely in place conditions of mudmat in the analysis the specified values of ranging p max can be simply identified by the calculation of resultant force along the axial pipeline for a whole pipe from terminal a to b see table 2 for instance for a scr tension induced walking analysis the necessary p max is equal to f l f f l is the axial soil friction and f is the scr tension force when the whole pipeline section ab moves towards terminal a and the mudmat is installed at terminal b with no movement allowed will be described in the later sub sections note for down slope scenario two installation positions of mudmat i e top and bottom of slope are also implemented when the different ranges of p max are considering in the analysis 2 2 analytical solutions of scr tension induced pipeline walking 2 2 1 theme i fig 1 demonstrates the eaf profiles during heating up stage of a pipeline with a length of l when the maximum axial resistance p max of the mudmat satisfies p max f l f the soil friction acting on the unit length of pipeline is f f μ w where μ is the equivalent friction coefficient and w is the submerged weight of pipeline per unit length the entire heating up stage was divided into two substages pipeline mobilisation substage and post mobilisation substage they can be identified by the timing when all pipeline sections i e section ag d1d2 and etc are motivated to expand as temperature increases the eaf profiles of the two substages are shown in fig 1 a and b respectively during the pipeline mobilisation substage some pipeline sections are fixed at its origin position and therefore the expansion in this substage does not account for the walking rate w t however the mudmat connected to the pipeline terminal b may slide with the expansion of pipeline and the axial soil resistance which generates in the interaction between the mudmat and the seabed and acts at the pipeline terminal b increases during this stage once the pipeline is fully mobilised an already mobilised resistance p h1 from mudmat will apply at terminal b and affect the subsequent distributions of eaf profiles the initial axial resistance p h1 acting on pipeline terminal b at the fully mobilised moment could be estimated by eaf profile based analyses during mobilisation substage as is illustrated in fig 1 a the eaf profile before heating up stage is line a gb the soil friction on pipeline section ag is mobilised due to the scr tension loaded at point a further the slope of line a g equals to the soil friction f the rest of the pipeline section gb is fixed on the seabed at this moment and will be gradually motivated in the mobilisation substage once the whole pipeline is heated with a tiny temperature increment x a c the eaf profile can be represented by line a d1 e1 b section gd1 and section be1 expand due to this temperature increment the length of section gd1 and section be1 can be expressed with the temperature increment x a c as follows 1 l gd 1 l be 1 e a α x a f when the temperature increment reaches 2x a c the eaf profile can be represented by line a d2 e2 b1 section d1d2 and section e1e2 start to expand during this temperature increment the length of section d1d2 is the same as section gd1 since the boundary and loading conditions remain unchanged however the axial resistance p of the mudmat acting on terminal b changes section e1e2 the axial resistance p is relative to the sliding distance s p ks where k is the equivalent elastic stiffness which depends on the interaction between mudmat and soil representing a horizontal mobilisation of mudmat under the tensile force from the connected pipeline in the process of temperature increasing from x a c to 2x a c the mudmat slides due to the expansion of section be1 which is motivated in the last temperature increment therefore the axial resistance p rises and makes section e1e2 shorter than section be1 the length of section e1e2 can be expressed as 2 l e 2 e 1 e a α x a p f e a α x a l be 1 α x a k f 1 α x a k f e a α x a f where e is young s modulus of steel a denotes the cross sectional area of pipe α is the steel thermal expansion coefficient and αx a represents the axial strain of section be1 when the temperature continually rises an increasing number of pipeline sections are excited and start to expand when the whole length of section gb is motivated after temperature increases n times with an interval of x a c the pipeline is fully mobilised therefore the total length can be determined based on the geometry feature shown in fig 1 a and can be expressed as the sum of each motivated pipeline section as the pipeline is fully mobilised 3 l gb l f f n e a α x a f 1 n 1 α x a k f n 1 e a α x a f according to eq 3 a specific number of temperature increments n could be calculated and an arbitrary tiny temperature increasing interval x a is determined therefore the temperature increment δt h when the pipeline is fully mobilised can be calculated δt h nx a based on the temperature increment δt h the initial axial resistance p h1 of the mudmat when the pipeline is fully mobilised can be calculated as follows 4 p h 1 e a α δ t h l bh 1 f e a α n x a l l ac l ch 1 f e a α n x a l f f n e a α x a f f 2 e a α n x a l f f in the post mobilisation substage the entire pipeline is excited and generates asymmetry displacement that accounts for walking rate w t the axial displacement of midpoint o during one loading cycle is selected to represent the walking rate and this displacement can be divided into two parts axial displacement generated in heating up stage w th and axial displacement generated in cooling down stage w tc fig 1 b shows the evolution of eaf profiles in a subsequent post mobilisation substage and the axial eaf along pipeline at the fully mobilised time is represented as line a h1 b pipeline ab expands symmetrically around h1 and the virtual anchor point vap is h1 as terminal b expands with increasing temperature and the mudmat slides with terminal b the axial resistance keeps changing and so does the eaf profiles the subsequent post mobilisation substage is divided into k heating steps with the same temperature increment δt δt δt δt h k of each step the axial resistance of the mudmat is p hi and the vap is h i at i th 1 i k heating step when the pipeline is heated from i th to i 1 th step the vap shifts from h i to h i 1 moving towards terminal b the added slipping distance of terminal b in this heating stage equals the expansion displacement of section bh i 1 5 s i 1 s i ε l bh i 1 δ r e a l bh i 1 α δ t p h i 1 p h

equation 5 can be expressed as 6 p h i 1 k p h i k α δ t p h i 1 p h i e a l 2 p h i 1 f 2 f therefore p h i 1 can be calculated based on the value of p hi the initial axial resistance p h1 is obtained according to eq 4 at the i th heating step the relative distance between midpoint o and vap h i can be expressed as 7 l oh i p h i f 2 f when the pipeline is heated from i th to i 1 th step midpoint o slides towards scr due to the expansion of the pipeline section oh i therefore the axial sliding displacement of midpoint o when the pipeline is heated from i th to i 1 th step can be calculated as follows 8 w th i ε l oh i 1 α δ t p h i 1 f 2 f combining eq 6 and eq 8 the axial slipping displacement of midpoint o when pipeline is heated from i th to i 1 th step can be solved therefore the axial slipping displacement of midpoint o during the post mobilisation substage can be expressed as 9 w th i 1 i k w th i i 1 i k ε l oh i 1 i 1 i k α δ t p h i 1 f 2 f similarly the whole cooling down stage can be divided into two substages pipeline mobilisation substage and post mobilisation substage the eaf profiles of the two substages are shown in fig 2 a and fig 2 b respectively the displacement in the mobilisation substage is also a part of the pipeline walking rate however the mobilisation process affects the initial axial resistance p c1 when the pipeline is first fully motivated in the cooling down stage fig 2 a shows the shift in eaf profiles in the mobilisation substage the contraction length of the pipeline section reaches the whole length of pipeline l when pipeline is fully mobilised and it also equals the sum length of motivated sections during n th cooling down with same temperature decrement x b of each cooling down stage therefore 10 l ab l n

is determined the temperature increment δt c when the pipeline is fully mobilised can calculated δt c nx b based on the temperature increment δt c the initial axial resistance p c1 of the mudmat in cooling down stage when the pipeline is fully mobilised can be calculated as follows 11 p c 1 e a α δ t c 2 l bh k f p hk e a α n x b 2 l bh k f p hk fig 2 b shows the evolution of eaf profiles in subsequent post mobilisation cooling down substage and the post mobilisation substage is divided into k heating steps with the same temperature increment δt δt δt δt c k of each step the axial resistance of the mudmat is p ci and the vap is c i at i th 1 i k cooling step when the pipeline is cooled from i th to i 1 th step the vap shifts from c i to c i 1 moving towards terminal b the added slipping distance of terminal b in this cooling down stage equals to the contraction displacement of section bc i 1 12 s i 1 s i p c i 1 k p c i k ε l bc i 1 δ r e a l bc i 1 α δ t p c i 1 p c i e a l 2 f p c i 1 2 f according to eq 12 p c i 1 can be obtained according to the value of p ci the initial axial resistance in the post mobilisation substage can be calculated according to eq 11 at the i

mobilisation substage can be calculated as the sum of axial slipping displacement during k cooling down steps 14 w tc i 1 i k ε l oc i 1 e a α δ t p c i 1 p c i e a f p c i 1 2 f if p c i 1 f α δ t p

for scr tension induced walking with plet plem proposed above is valid for the situation wherein the maximum axial resistance p max is lower than f l f when the value of p max satisfies f l f p max f l f the heating up mobilisation substage is same as that in theme i and eq 1 to eq 4 are still valid the vap shifts towards terminal b until it reaches terminal b in the heating up post mobilisation substage the position of vap remains at terminal b since p max is equal or larger than f l f the evaluation of eaf profiles in the heating up post mobilisation substage is shown in fig 3 a although the eaf profiles of theme ii in the heating up post mobilisation substage is different from those of theme i the accumulated axial displacement w th can also be calculated using eq 5 to eq 9 owing to the different distribution of eaf in the heating up stage the cooling down mobilisation substage is also different from it in theme i and these eaf profiles are illustrated in fig 3 b eq 10 is still valid for estimate initial axial resistance p c1 in theme ii however eq 11 should be updated as follows 16 p c 1 e a α δ t c p hk e a α n x b p hk besides other equations in theme i are still valid the accumulated axial displacement in the cooling down stage w tc can also be calculated with eq 12 to eq 14 the total walking can be estimated according to eq 15 2 2 3 theme iii the eaf profiles for maximum axial resistance p max satisfying p max f l f is shown in fig 4 in this situation the vap in the heating up and cooling down stages will finally reach terminal b and terminal b can be regarded as a reference point to evaluate scr induced walking rate w t after one loading cycle the walking rate w t equals to the difference between the mudmat slipping distance s in heating up stage and slipping distance s in heating up stage in addition as the axial resistance p at any heating up or cooling down step cannot exceed maximum axial resistance p max the slipping distance s and s change linearly with the axial resistance p therefore the scr tension induced walking rate w t after one loading cycle can be calculated as 17 w t s s p h k p c k k 2 f k 2 3 analytical solutions of downslope induced pipeline walking 2 3 1 theme iv fig 5 shows the eaf profiles during one loading cycle of a pipeline with length l with the mudmat on top of the slope and the maximum axial resistance

downslope induced walking rate w st is also follows the same procedure when the mudmat is installed at the top of the slope and the maximum axial resistance p max of the mudmat satisfies f 2 l p max f 1 l the major difference of eaf profiles is the cooling down mobilisation substage as shown in fig 7 thus the following equation should be used to replace eq 23 to calculate the initial axial

mudmat at the bottom of slope and p max satisfying p max f 2 l the second situation of theme iv therefore the equations in the second situation of theme iv are also valid 2 3 3 theme vi once the maximum axial resistance p max is equal or larger than f 1 l the eaf profiles during one loading cycle of downslope induced walking with the mudmat at the top of the slope and at the bottom of the slope are illustrated in fig 8 a and b respectively the vap shifts finally to the position of the mudmat and the walking rate of the entire pipeline can be evaluated with the axial displacement of the mudmat for pipeline with the mudmat installed at the top of slope the downslope induced walking rate w st can be calculated as follows 34 w st p c k p h k k f 1 l f 2 l k 2 w sin ϕ l k for the pipeline with the mudmat installed at the bottom of the slope the downslope induced walking rate w sb can be calculated as follows 35 w sb p c k p h k k f 2 l f 1 l k 2 w sin ϕ l k comparing eq 34 to eq 35 it can be found that the downslope induced walking rate w st equals w sb when the maximum axial resistance p max is equal or larger than f 1 l the position of the mudmat has no effect on the walking rate in this situation 2 4 summary of analytical solutions and its application scope the analytical solutions for different situations proposed herein is summarised in fig 9 for a clear demonstration sets of equations can be chosen to predict different walking mechanism maximum axial resistance p max and mudmat positions note the mobilisation distance of axial soil resistance along the pipeline is not considered in the analytical derivation which could lead to an overestimation in walking rate carr et al 2006 reda et al 2019 and the conservative estimation in design practice 3 finite element analyses 3 1 fea model description the proposed analytical solutions were validated with numerical simulation results using the commercially available software abaqus with standard analyses adopted dassault systèmes 2010 the pipeline is prescribed with the element type pipe31 as this study focusses on axial deformation of pipeline during the heating up and cooling down stages the pipeline is only allowed to move axially lateral movement is fixed during simulation the entire pipeline is divided homogeneously into 4000 meshes the seabed which acts as a frictional interface in simulation is simulated with the element type of c3d8r with all sides and bottom boundaries restricted the seabed is divided into 10 elements in the lateral direction 4000 elements in the axial direction and 1 element in the vertical direction the interaction between pipeline and seabed is modelled with the penalty method with a constant equivalate axial frictional coefficient μ the mobilisation distance for the pipe soil interaction takes 0 01d 0 003 m in this study by defining the penalty contact with the elastic slipping distance in the tangential behaviour specified as the detailed outline of upper structure of plet plem has no effect on pipeline walking it is equivalent to vertical pressure in simulation the mudmat is modelled as a rigid body with a square plate tied with one endpoint of the pipeline for passing the soil resistance on the mudmat to the pipeline hence the inline force can directly transfer from mudmat to underlying soil with no permit of deformation at the mudmat pipeline connection it is thought to be reasonable since the stiffness of connection between mudmat and pipeline is considerably larger than that mudmat and seabed soil the length and width of the mudmat are termed as l m and b its location depends on the simulation condition the maximum soil resistance in the heating up and cooling down stages are termed as p max and p max and corresponding mobilisation distance are s m and s m the gain in soil resistance feng and gourvenec 2016 yan et al 2014 zhou et al 2020a 2020b was considered in the simulation and the value of p max is larger than p max regarding the horizontal stiffness of mudmat k under the tensile force along the pipeline a linear elastic stiffness is adopted in the analysis it is calculated when p max or p max and s m or s m are known with p max or p max ks m or s m note p max or p max can be set up using the penalty contact method with p max or p max μm w m where μm is the frictional coefficient between mudmat and soil and w m is the submerged weight of mudmat the details of the pipeline as well as the mudmat and seabed properties are summarised in tables 3 and 4 the entire simulations are implemented in the scope of static analyses the loading conditions are specified as follows 1 the vertical component of the gravity was applied on the entire pipeline to make pipeline contact with seabed 2 for pipeline walking induced by scr tension a concentrated force is applied on one end of the pipeline to simulate the scr tension scenario for pipeline walking induced by seabed slope a tangential component of the gravity i e a tangential gravity component with value of w sinφ 44 5 n m applied on the pipeline in table 3 is applied on the pipeline to simulate the influence of slope 3 the pipeline is gradually and homogeneously heated up and the temperature of pipeline element rises only 1 c in each increment until the temperature reaches 100 c 4 the temperature of whole pipeline reduces with 1 c in each increment until the temperature falls to 0 c fig 10 shows the details of the finite element analysis model three types of scenarios scr tension induced walking downslope induced walking under the condition that the mudmat is installed on the top of the slope and downslope induced walking under the condition that the mudmat is installed on the bottom of the slope are calculated with the finite element method to verify the correction of our proposed analytical solutions 3 2 validation of fem model the reliability of the fem model was checked before using it to calibrate the proposed analytical solutions in this paper the publication related to the pipeline walking expansion covers case i and ii under a free end boundary condition documented by carr et al 2006 and white et al 2015 and case iii with a hold back anchor considered reda et al 2018 the relevant parameters adopted in the validation analyses are illustrated in table 5 the corresponding results are shown in fig 11 a and b from comparisons the accumulated walking displacements show almost identical responses see fig 11 a and only slight differences less than 3 in the axial displacements for both hot and cold end can be found see fig 11 b these prove that the fem model in this study is robust to be used for the further comparison with the proposed analytical results 3 3 comparison of walking rates from analytical and fem methods 3 3 1 scr tension induced pipeline walking the scr tension induced pipeline walking neighbouring plet plem was calculated with both finite element and analytical methods because values of p max and p max are both greater than fl f but smaller than fl f which is same with the assumption of theme ii the analytical result was calculated according to eqs 1 10 eqs 12 14 and eq 16 fig 12 a shows the comparison of eaf distribution between analytical results and fea results the eaf along pipeline extrapolated by every other 20 heating and cooling increments was plotted the axial slipping distance of the mudmat s exceeds the mobilisation distance s m when temperature reduction is larger than 24 c the axial resistance acting on the mudmat and pipeline terminal remains stable for the rest of the cooling down stage therefore the eaf distribution remains unchanged until the finish of this loading cycle fig 12 a shows that the development of eaf distribution with changing temperature which we assumed in solving the analytical solution agrees with fea results there is slight difference between analytical and fea results in eaf distribution and the prediction of axial resistance acting on the mudmat and eaf along the entire pipeline has high accuracy fig 12 b reveals the axial slipping trace of midpoint during the loading cycle according to two methods the midpoint moves towards scr in the heating up stage and moves slightly opposite to scr in the cooling down stage as the vap is located between the midpoint and the mudmat after the whole pipeline is heated and mobilised fig 12 a and the shifting of vap is quite small due to the short distance between the mudmat and the vap at the moment when the entire pipeline is just mobilised the increment in axial slipping of midpoint during heating up stage is almost linear in the cooling down stage the position of vap shifts from its initial position which is between scr and midpoint to its end position which is located between the midpoint and the mudmat and the decrease in axial slipping of midpoint with the decrement in temperature is nonlinear the axial slipping traces according to two methods are almost same during the whole loading cycle the walking rates after one loading cycle calculated with the analytical and fea methods are 0 514 m and 0 525 m respectively the analytical result is 2 14 lower than the fea result the analytical solution shows high accuracy in calculating walking rate note for better comparison the analytical results are modified with the mobilisation distance specified in the fem analyses of 0 003 m subtracted this processing is applied for the following comparisons described below 3 3 2 downslope induced pipeline walking the downslope induced pipeline walking neighbouring plet plem was calculated with both fea and analytical methods as the maximum axial resistance in the heating up stage p max is smaller than f 2 l which is same with the assumption of theme iv when the mudmat is installed at the top of the slope the analytical result was calculated according to eqs 18 25 when the mudmat is installed at the bottom of the slope the maximum axial resistance in cooling down stage p max is greater than f 2 l but smaller than f 1 l which is same with assumption of theme v the analytical result was calculated according to eqs 27 31 fig 13 a illustrates the eaf profiles extrapolated by every other 20 heating and cooling increments during one loading cycle when the mudmat is installed on the top of the slope the axial resistance on the mudmat reaches the maximum value when the temperature reduction reaches 69 c in the cooling down stage the eaf profile remains unchanged in the rest of the cooling stage the analytical results are still similar to the fea results fig 13 b demonstrates the development of the axial slipping of midpoint during the loading cycle because vap shifts heavily in both the heating up and cooling down stages the axial slipping distance of midpoint towards the bottom of the slope increases nonlinearly with the variation in temperature the increasing rate of axial slipping in the heating up stage or decreasing rate of axial slipping in the cooling down stage rises with the continued variations in temperature load the comparison between analytical results and fea results shows that the development tendency of axial slipping of midpoint according to the two methods are similar however the analytical solution may slightly overestimate walking rate due to the neglect to the initial tensile force caused by the tangential component of gravity before heating up the main relative error between the two methods mainly arises from the overestimated slipping generated in the beginning of the heating up stage the walking rates after one loading cycle are 0 096 m according to the analytical solution and 0 084 m according to the fea method the analytical result is 12 5 relatively higher than the fea result fig 14 a shows the eaf profiles extrapolated every other 20 heating and cooling increments when the mudmat is installed on the bottom of the slope the axial resistance on the mudmat reaches the maximum value when the temperature rises to 56 c in the heating up stage fig 14 b shows the corresponding axial slipping of midpoint the axial slipping trace according to analytical and fea methods are almost similar and the walking rates after one loading cycle are 0 135 m according to the analytical solution and 0 124 m according to the fea method the analytical result is 8 15 relatively higher than the fea result it is worth noting that the walking rate in fig 13 b is smaller than it in fig 14 b and it implies that the location of the mudmat on top or bottom of slope influence the walking rate in this case the mudmat performance is better in mitigating the walking rate when it is installed on top of the slope for other four loading cases themes i iii v and vi described earlier the further compared analyses are implemented note the parameters of pipelines and soil are not changed but the maximum axial resistance of mudmat p max in the heating up and cooling down processes are taken as the same value for each analysis theme indicating no consolidation hardening of soil involved in the analyses the corresponding values of p max and results are shown in table 6 it can be found that the discrepancy between results obtained by the analytical and fem methods are also close and the absolute value of discrepancy is not larger than 0 03 m 4 discussion the walking rates per loading cycle of free end pipelines with the same parameters listed in table 3 are calculated to compare it with walking rates of the pipeline neighbouring a plet plem the scr tension induced walking rate of free end pipeline is 0 845 m per loading cycle which is larger than the walking rate of the pipeline neighbouring a plet plem the downslope induced walking rate of the free end pipeline is 0 178 m per loading cycle which is also much larger than walking rate of pipeline affected by axial resistance of plet plem the tension and downslope induced walking rate and maximum axial resistance during one loading cycle under different endpoint boundaries are demonstrated in fig 15 the walking rate per loading cycle of the pipeline neighbouring a plet plem but without consideration of soil hardening is also calculated and proposed in fig 15 for illustrating the influence of neighbouring a plet plem on walking analysis fig 15 a shows that the mudmat generates an axial concentrated force of 216 kn at the endpoint of the pipeline and this axial resistance has a mitigation effect on tension induced walking rate leading to a 37 9 reduction in tension induced walking rate per loading cycle the walking rate is 0 521 m when the influence of axial resistance generated by the mudmat is considered but soil hardening is not considered which is smaller than the walking rate considering soil hardening the maximum axial resistance acting on the pipeline endpoint without considering soil hardening is 185 kn also lower than the axial resistance considering soil hardening therefore the reduction in walking rate contributed by the mudmat is not decided by the magnitude of axial resistance and the smaller axial resistance may contribute to a greater walking rate mitigation effect the walking rate mitigation effect of axial resistance generated by the mudmat for downslope induced pipeline walking is more complex as shown in fig 15 b the magnitude of walking rate reduction is influenced by both soil hardening effect and the position of the mudmat in this case the mudmat installed at the top of the slope perform better than those at the bottom of the slope the best performance in mitigating walking rate is observed when the mudmat is at the top of the slope and soil hardening is considered and the walking rate per loading cycle is 0 084 m an approximate 52 8 reduction compared with the walking rate of free end pipeline the worst performance is observed when the mudmat is at the bottom of the slope and soil hardening is considered the walking rate per loading cycle is 0 124 m and there is a reduction of 30 3 compared with the walking rate of the free end pipeline which is not bad in terms of controlling pipeline walking performance the comparisons between walking rate of free end pipelines and walking rate of the pipeline neighbouring the plet plem in both fig 15 a and b imply that the added axial resistance generated by the neighbouring mudmat can reduce the walking rate in practice the walking rate mitigation effect does not simply depend on the magnitude of maximum axial resistance the design is optimised according to different situations to achieve a greater walking rate reduction with less added axial resistance acting on the pipeline endpoint 5 conclusions this paper reports the analytical solutions to the walking rate of subsea pipelines neighbouring the plet plem under both scr tension and downslope conditions the influences of mobility of mudmat the magnitude of available resistance and the installation position of mudmat on the pipeline walking behaviour are examined on investigating the three different working themes for each loading scenario the mitigation effect on the walking rate of subsea pipeline can be observed by comparing a free boundary condition with some key insights as below for low available resistance from mudmat foundation theme i and iv the mudmat slips with pipeline during both heating up and cooling down stages yet its resistance still contributes to the build up of eaf of pipeline and gives an additional translation of vap resulting some certain reduce in walking rate for intermediate available resistance from mudmat foundation theme ii and v the mudmat though is completely fixed through the heating up stage the sliding occurs in the cooling down stage the resistance from mudmat can make more contributions to increase in eaf and reduce in translation of vap along the same direction in both heating up and cooling down stages and thus leads to more reduces in walking rate for high available resistance from mudmat foundation theme iii and vi the mudmat is completely in place through a whole loading cycle so the pipeline is restricted on the seabed this will lead to significantly large concentrated force at the connection between pipeline and mudmat so the localised strength checking in structure and larger mudmat in size are necessary in design the walking rate will entirely come from the axial deformation of mudmat notable that the proposed analytical solution mainly focuses on straight hot short pipelines neighbouring the plets plems where routine curves along the pipe and deformation of connection between the plet plem and the pipeline are neglected besides only constant or stepping increase in soil friction along the pipe are considered more complicated mobilisation of friction can refer to guha et al 2019 and hong et al 2019 however it is believable that the proposed analytical solution can provide a valuable supplement to the current code in subsea pipeline design as well some useful information to sizing the mudmat of the plet plem credit authorship contribution statement zhaohui hong
