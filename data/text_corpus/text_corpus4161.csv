20805,a numerical method solving for the diffraction potential on the hull is coupled with a boundary element method bem to evaluate the propeller induced hull pressures the bem is first implemented for the hydrodynamic analysis of non cavitating cavitating propellers in the absence of the hull and the predicted solutions are taken as the known unbounded potentials in the hull pressure calculations a tip loaded propeller tlp is adopted as the model propeller and mounted under the flat hull subject to uniform inflow the tlp is operated close to the hull so that infinite speed of sound can be assumed reducing the frequency domain helmholtz equation to laplace s equation which can be solved by a bem solver unsteady sheet cavitation and developed tip vortex cavitation are predicted on the propeller by the hydrodynamic bem and considered in the calculation of the hull pressures several loading conditions are imposed on the propeller and the corresponding pressure predictions and cavitation patterns are compared to published experimental data and to those from unsteady full blown reynolds averaged navier stokes rans simulations very good agreement is achieved between the predicted and measured results especially under moderately loaded condition keywords propeller induced hull pressures boundary element method sheet cavitation tip vortex cavitation diffraction potential tip loaded propeller 1 introduction reducing on board noise and propulsion oriented intermittent vibrations on the ship hull have been of great interest and research tasks among naval architects and propulsion communities accurate predictions of the propeller induced hull vibrations early in designing stage are crucial aspects to the commercial passenger ships for on board comfort and even more critical to navy submarines which hide themselves behind tranquility of the ocean to effectively predict the propeller induced hull pressures there have been several attempts through the numerical and experimental approaches for the former breslin et al 1982 hwang et al 2006 and kim and kinnas 2020a used the outputs of a hydrodynamic boundary element method bem for an open propeller analysis to predict the fluctuating hull pressures induced by the propeller its wake and cavitation breslin et al 1982 introduced the bem based mathematical foundation for a representation of a hull in the presence of intermittently cavitating propellers and the free surface hwang et al 2006 extended the method to a single hull with twin propellers with some preliminary results of the hull excitation considering phase difference between the two propellers kim and kinnas 2020a further extended the pressure bem with central focus on considering the effects of unsteady wake and tip vortex cavitation to this end both the hydrodynamic bem and pressure bem were modified such that the former can produce cavity sources on the unsteady partial cavity and tip vortex cavity and the latter can consider them in the calculation of the fluctuating hull pressures kehr and kao 2011 developed a numerical method that can predict the underwater acoustic field and pressure fluctuations on a ship hull due to unsteady propeller sheet cavitation by a linear acoustic theory in particular the noise scattered from the ship hull or reflected from the free surface are considered their method can be used to predict the acoustic pressures at the near field and addresses an important aspect of scattering noise given the ship hull is closely located to the propeller later kao 2018 presented an improved numerical scheme to predict the pressure fluctuations on the ship hull due to unsteady sheet cavitation of a propeller based on a two cyclic iterating scheme in order to satisfy the boundary integral equation in the time domain in the work of kinns and bloor 2004 an acoustic boundary element model of a modern twin screw cruiser liner is used to show how the fluctuating pressures above the propeller and hull forces causing ship vibrations change relative to each other with the nature of propeller sources in their research a simple analysis of dipole and monopole sources is used to interpret numerical results and to demonstrate why the solution of the helmholtz equation which includes effects of a finite speed of sound is needed for an accurate evaluation of the hull disturbing forces on the other hand as for experimental approaches hallander and lindell 2013 performed experiments with a model scale ship with pressure transducers mounted on the hull to measure the propeller induced hull pressures and noise levels they used a 1 20 t h scaled model hull m t olympus positioned on the ceiling of the cavitation tunnel at its designed ballast draft the measurements therefore accounted for the interactions between the inflow and 3d hull geometry including the model 4 bladed propeller ship stern part and rudder geometry for another attempt the naval surface warfare center carderock division nswccd designed p2504 tip loaded propeller tlp using the standard united states navy practice for propeller designing p2504 has positive hydrorake winglet like tip on the pressure side and was manufactured as a 1 26 t h scaled model propeller for the tests of open water and cavitation performance at the facilities of the canal de experiencias hidrodinámicas de el pardo 1 1 https www inta es icts cehipar es cehipar in spain the tlp was tested at the viable pressure cavitation tunnel and the pressure pulses on the flat plate were measured among many other propeller types the tlp was selected due to its promise in increasing propeller efficiency without sacrificing cavitation performance this article will mainly investigate the tlp induced pressure fluctuations on the hull predicted by the pressure bem and their comparisons with the pressure pulses measured at cehipar under various loading conditions here and elsewhere the hydrodynamic bem represents a bem for the analysis of open propeller performance in the absence of the hull and the pressure bem a bem which calculates the propeller induced hull pressures with a propeller its wake and cavitation taken into account in terms of the unbounded potentials induced on the hull details on the open propeller characteristics of the model tlp are omitted in this article as those are not the main focus proper ways to consider viscous effects on the tlp blade wake alignment scheme and open water characteristics are presented in kim and kinnas 2020b besides brown et al 2014 presented potential flow simulations and reynolds averaged navier stokes rans viscous flow simulations to assess the performance of the model tlp along with the comparisons with experiments later brown et al 2015 also investigated impacts of the tip vortex wake interaction on the tlp performance with an emphasis on the tip vortex evolution 2 numerical methods 2 1 hydrodynamic bem representation of a propeller in the presence of cavitation in this section a summary of a lower order panel method and algorithms for detecting a partial cavity and tip vortex cavity are presented if the system of the coordinates is fixed on a rotating propeller the total velocity q can be decomposed into the background velocity u i n including the effective wake relative rotational velocity and the perturbation velocity u 1 q u i n ω r u the last component is equivalent to the gradient of the velocity potential φ which satisfies the laplace s equation in an inviscid and irrotational flow 2 u φ 3 2 φ 0 according to green s third identity equation 3 can be converted into the boundary integral form equation 4 in which s includes the propeller surface on a wetted part s b surfaces beneath the sheet cavity s c and tip vortex cavity s t as shown in fig 1 4 φ p 2 s s b s c s t g p q φ q n q g p q n q φ q d s s w δ φ w g p q n d s where s w represents the wake surface n q denotes the vector at point q directing into the fluid n is the normal vector on the wake surface g p q is the three dimensional green s function equivalent to 1 4 π r p q and a field point p is apart from a variable point q by the distance r p q on the wake surface the kutta condition is applied where the wake dipole strength δ φ w is equal to the difference between the potentials on each side of the blade trailing edge 5 δ φ w φ t φ t where the superscripts and correspond to the suction and pressure sides at the trailing edge respectively once the velocity potential φ p is known on the propeller boundary induced velocity at any point in a flow can be evaluated by taking a gradient on equation 4 with φ p 2 replaced by φ p for outside s 6 u 1 4 π s s b s c s t ϕ q n q 1 r p q ϕ q n q 1 r p q d s 1 4 π s w δ ϕ w r q n 1 r p q d s the analytic formulation equation 4 will be solved for the unknown dipole strength φ p on the wetted surface and for the source strength φ p n p on the surfaces beneath the cavity at the same time the kinematic boundary condition equation 7 is enforced on the wetted surface and the dynamic boundary condition equation 8 which describes a constant pressure in and on the cavity should be satisfied on the cavitating surface the kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions can be converted to a neumann type and a dirichlet type boundary conditions and provide the unknown source and dipole strengths in equation 4 respectively 7 φ p n p u i n ω r n o n s b 8 φ p φ c s o n s c s t where s in equation 8 denotes the dominant flow direction on the cavity surface 2 2 determination of dipole strengths on a cavity surface at the lower cavitation number σ n equation 9 sheet cavity arises on the blade surface and close to the tip it might develop into the developed tip vortex cavitation depending on the loading imposed on the propeller the sheet cavity planform could remain within the chord extent partial cavity or exceed the blade trailing edge thus developing into a super cavity in such cases dipole strengths can be directly evaluated via the dynamic boundary condition that can be derived from the bernoulli equation by connecting the two points i e one on the cavity surface and the other on the shaft axis far upstream 9 σ n p 0 p v ρ 2 n 2 d 2 10 p 0 ρ 1 2 u i n 2 ω 2 r 2 φ t p v ρ 1 2 q t 2 g y s where n and d are the propeller revolutions per second and diameter respectively ρ is the fluid density r the radial distance from the axis of rotation q t the total cavity velocity y s the vertical distance from the horizontal plane through the propeller axis p 0 and p v are the reference pressure far upstream and the vapor pressure respectively equation 10 can be rearranged to represent the total cavity velocity in terms of the cavitation number 11 q t 2 n 2 d 2 σ n u i n 2 ω 2 r 2 2 g y s 2 φ t by introducing a directional derivative of the perturbation potential φ along the curvilinear coordinate system on the local surfaces beneath the sheet cavity or tip vortex cavity the total cavity velocity q t can also be written in terms of the directional derivatives combining it with equation 11 yields a quadratic formulation of the unknown total velocity in the s and v directions 12 v v 2 2 v v v s c o s ψ v s 2 s i n 2 ψ v n 2 s i n 2 ψ n 2 d 2 σ n u i n 2 ω 2 r 2 2 g y s 2 φ t 13 v v φ v u v 14 v s φ s u s 15 v n φ n u n where ψ is the angle between the local s and v axes on the cavity fig 1 v v v s and v n are the total velocity components composed of the perturbation velocity and the effective inflow in the local v s and n directions equation 12 is solved for the unknown total velocity considering the dominant flow direction on the cavity surface on the surface beneath the sheet cavity for example equation 12 is solved for v s because the flow in chordwise direction is dominant over the spanwise component kinnas and fine 1993 while the same equation is solved for v v on the tip vortex cavity as the strong swirl velocity component is established around the vortex core kim and kinnas 2020a in any case there are two solutions for each of φ s and φ v and the solution with a positive square root is adopted to have the solution potentials increase in the positive s or v directions therefore on the sheet cavity we have 16 φ s v t φ 0 v 0 s u s v v cos ψ sin ψ n 2 d 2 σ n u i n 2 ω 2 r 2 2 g y s 2 φ t v v 2 d s and on the tip vortex cavity we have 17 φ s v t φ s 0 0 v u v v s cos ψ sin ψ n 2 d 2 σ n u i n 2 ω 2 r 2 2 g y s 2 φ t v s 2 u n 2 d v it has to be pointed out that the total velocity in the surface normal direction v n is omitted in equation 16 and approximated to the inflow component u n in equation 17 to avoid the full non linearity of the method that could cause negative values inside the square root during the iterative calculations both equations are integrated along the positive s and v directions using the trapezoidal quadrature once the velocity potentials are known source strengths on the cavity surfaces remain as the unknowns and are obtained by solving equation 4 portions of the blade covered by the sheet cavity or tip vortex cavity are varying depending on the given loading or inflow conditions thus the discretized green s formulation needs to be generalized to account for this change in time and space it is achieved by dynamic allocation in a bem matrix by changing its size and configuration iteratively to ignore collapsed cavities and to apply different boundary conditions on s b s c and s t accordingly 2 3 determination of cavity thickness cavity thickness can be computed from the kinematic boundary condition this condition finds the actual cavity surface based on the known singularity strengths by requiring the total derivative of the cavity surface vanish on the cavity surface for a sheet cavity the boundary integral equation equation 4 is solved with the assumed cavity planforms as the initial guesses but the computed cavity thickness at its trailing edge is normally under over predicted due to the wrong assumptions at the first attempt therefore the assumed cavity length needs to be adjusted iteratively to achieve zero thickness at the cavity trailing edge a two point newton raphson method is used to find the new cavity lengths over span which will become updated cavity planforms for subsequent iterations this process continues until the cavity thickness at the cavity trailing edge falls below a small number less than the predefined tolerance at all blade stations kinnas and fine 1993 tip vortex cavity relies on the similar approach as to the sheet cavity algorithm once the solution potentials are known on the initial guess of the tip vortex cavity kinematic boundary condition is applied to adjust the tip vortex radii different from the cavity on the blade an additional boundary condition named the potential jump condition needs to be satisfied this condition requires the potential difference between the panels connected to the upper and lower surface of the wake to be equal to the potential jump across the wake surface the initial cavity geometry is a cylindrical shape at the first revolution and the rest revolutions take the adjusted geometry from the previous revolutions based on the time step locations of the key blade boundary integral equation is resolved using the updated cavity shapes and the boundary conditions are reapplied to find new cavity radii this process continues until the completion of total revolutions and normally 3 or 4 revolutions are sufficient to produce the converged forces for mild unsteady problems some portions on the tip vortex might be cavitating while some others might not have enough vortex core strength that leads to the collapse of the tip vortex cavity in such event viscous core reappears and that cannot be considered in the current inviscid panel method no tip vortex cavity zone is introduced to go around this issue by neglecting the collapsed sections in the boundary integral equation size of the bem matrix thus varies dynamically in time and space depending on the local vortex strength along the tip vortex strand more details on the concept of no tip vortex cavity zone can be found in kim and kinnas 2020a 2 4 pressure bem representation of the hull in the presence of a propeller and its wake in the pressure bem instead of solving for oscillating pressures velocity potential φ n h is solved on the hull boundary at different blade passing frequencies n n 1 n m a x n m a x total number of harmonics considered the potential field φ n h is governed by the helmholtz equation in the frequency domain as follows 18 2 φ n h k 2 φ n h 0 19 k ω c 0 2 π l where k is the wave number ω the angular speed c 0 the speed of sound and l the wave length for the near field underwater noise wavelength of acoustic sound is much longer than the dimension of the domain of interest thus infinite speed of sound c 0 can be assumed so that the helmholtz equation can be reduced to the laplace s equation which can be solved by a pressure bem solver 2 2 we call this pressure bem because the diffraction potential is proportional to pressure as shown by equation 31 20 2 φ n h 0 from green s 3rd identity for points on the surface of boundary we have 21 φ n h 2 s h g φ n h n φ n h g n d s s p g φ n p n φ n p g n d s s w δ φ n w p g n d s 22 g 1 4 π r where the integrals will be performed on two separate boundaries one on the hull surface s h including its image beyond the free surface or tunnel wall and the other on the surfaces s p s w conforming a propeller and its trailing wake the nth velocity potential φ n h is the diffraction potential on the hull due to the presence of the propeller for a rigid hull boundary φ n h n 0 holds on s h where the noise due to the hull vibration caused by the propeller will be ignored once the singularity strengths on the propeller boundary are known through the hydrodynamic bem the second and third terms on the right hand side of equation 21 can be reduced to the unbounded potential φ n p h induced on the hull by the propeller φ n p h is calculated by superposition of φ n p and φ n p n over the propeller s p and the wake strength δ φ n w p on s w thus equation 21 can be written as equation 23 and will be solved for φ n h at different harmonic frequencies by the pressure bem 23 φ n h 2 s h g φ n h n φ n h g n d s φ n p h in our problem since the hull does not vibrate kinematic boundary condition of zero normal velocity φ n h n 0 eliminates the source term in equation 23 representing the diffraction potential as a function of φ n p h and dipole distributions over the hull in an unbounded flow changes in cavity volume if any cavity is detected does not require additional boundary conditions to satisfy the continuity of the flow however in the case of a bounded flow such as the flow inside the tunnel boundary conditions on the inlet and outlet should be modified to account for the changes in the cavity volume kinnas et al 1998 in addition to the fluctuating pressures on the hull it is of practical interest to calculate the solid body factor sbf which varies significantly over the curved hull surface the sbf is the ratio of the potential on the wall φ n h to the potential of the unbounded flow φ n p h the sbf near the propeller is practically close to 2 0 due to the image effect and this fact will be checked in discussions equation 23 finally becomes 24 φ n h 2 s h φ n h g n d s φ n p h equation 24 will be solved for the harmonic amplitudes at different frequencies n 1 n m a x after performing harmonic analysis on the unsteady potentials φ n p h radiated as evenly spaced data by the time step δ t real and imaginary parts of the harmonics are evaluated on the hull control points up to the n m a x blade passing frequency discretized green s formula of equation 24 can be written as 25 h d i j φ n h j φ n p h i 26 d i j δ i j 2 s h i j n 1 4 π r i j d s where d i j is the induced potential at i due to the dipole singularity over the panel j the discretized formula is solved iteratively on the hull s h as well as its image s i iterative scheme solves for the potentials on each half of the double hull hull image with the effect of the other half being considered in the right hand side of equation 25 as the known values thus dimension of a bem matrix becomes the total number of panels on each half of the double hull 3 3 potential could be solved for the double hull hull image simultaneously but the authors opted for the iterative method without significant burden of computing time 27 d h i j φ n h h j φ n h p h i d i i j φ n i h j 28 d h i j φ n i h j φ n i p h i d i i j φ n h h j where d h i j and d i i j are the influence coefficient matrices from the hull panel j to the hull panel i and from the hull panel j to the image hull panel i respectively φ n h h j and φ n i h j are the solution vectors of the panels on the hull and its image convergence history of the iterative solution method shows the solution vectors converge in general after 10 to 15 iterations with one iteration including a set of solving equations 27 and 28 convergence criterion is set in terms of the potential difference terminating the method if the difference between the new and old solutions falls below a certain tolerance the present method endorses double hull model with positive image in the case of solid wall equation 29 and negative image in the case of the free surface under the assumption of very large froude number equation 30 29 φ n h φ n h h φ n i h 30 φ n h φ n h h φ n i h once the diffraction potential φ n h is known time history of the pressure fluctuations on the hull p t is finally obtained by 31 p t ρ φ h t ρ n 1 n m a x i n z ω φ n h e i n z ω t where z is the blade number ω is the shaft rate frequency unbounded flow does not require additional iterative process between the propeller and the hull as the uniformity of the inflow is secured however in the case of tunnel problems propeller problem and the tunnel problem are solved separately with the effect of one on the other being considered in an iterative manner until the total flow converges 3 results 3 1 numerical model p2504 tip loaded propeller in this section a numerical model for p2504 tip loaded propeller tlp is presented fig 2 shows p2504 tlp with positive hydrorake designed at nswccd brown et al 2014 and manufactured in 1 26 t h scale at cehipar for the assessment of open water and cavitation performance blade sections assume a naca 66 thickness profile and a customized chordwise loading distribution which produces more loading toward the trailing edge than the traditional naca a 0 8 mean line basic parameters for this propeller are shown in table 1 and fig 3 shows the predicted circulation distributions over the blade span at three different advance ratios in the figure the non dimensional circulation g r is defined as 32 g r γ 2 π r u r where γ is the predicted circulation and u r v s 2 0 7 n π d 2 is the reference velocity with v s and d being the ship speed and propeller diameter respectively p2504 tlp is designed to produce the maximum loading near the r r 0 8 spanwise location as shown in fig 3 where the bem also predicts the maximum circulation close to r r 0 8 as designed 71 32 chordwise spanwise panels are used for blade discretization with a full cosine and a half cosine spacing respectively as shown in fig 4 since the actual profiles are not given on the hub geometry in the experiment report hub is modeled as a cylindrical shape that has different radii at the mid and downstream parts upstream part is closed with quadratic hub as close to the benchmark model fully aligned trailing wake is also shown in fig 4 at the design loading j s 0 911 it is worth noting the crosses of streamlines downstream due to the pitch difference between the sides of the tip plate fig 5 shows open water performance of the model tlp predicted by the present method in comparison with the experimental measurement over a range of advance ratios the thrust coefficient k t and the torque coefficient k q in the figure are defined following the equations 33 k t t ρ n 2 d 4 34 k q q ρ n 2 d 5 where t and q are the predicted propeller thrust and torque overall the comparisons show very good agreement especially around the design condition j s 0 911 and even down to very high loading j s 0 4 maintaining less than 6 error in this study inflow is assumed to be a uniform inflow therefore the bem results are time independent in the open water condition in other words both the steady and unsteady runs with without consideration of spatial variations in the inflow practically produce the same results similarly the predicted hull pressures are not much affected by the different wake alignment schemes even though the propeller induced hull pressures are unsteady vibrations hence this article will adopt the full wake alignment fwa scheme tian and kinnas 2012 kim et al 2018 due to its reasonable accuracy in a steady axisymmetric flow and fast calculations over the unsteady wake alignment uwa scheme kim and kinnas 2020a lee 2002 the uwa is normally slower than the fwa in computing speed but adequate for time dependent problems under the non axisymmetric effective inflow 3 2 propeller induced hull pressures in the experiment three different loading conditions are tested by changing the advance ratio in the cavitation tunnel tests are made at the design loading increasing or decreasing 20 of the design j s with the fixed cavitaion number σ n 4 092 and the froude number f n 5 734 throughout the tests fig 6 shows a flat plate used as the model hull where the fluctuating hull pressures are measured at 11 different transducer locations panels on the plate are dense close to the propeller plane and become coarse away from the propeller in the experiment a horizontal flat plate is positioned on the ceiling of the cavitation tunnel with holes to place the pressure transducers the location of the flat plate is fixed so that the flow in the tunnel does not perturb its initial position the arrangement of the transducers is shown in fig 7 where the layout is viewed from the top transducer 5 t 5 is located on the vertical position of the generator line of the key blade when it is on the 0 blade angle 3 2 1 case 1 increasing j s by 20 j s 1 0932 in the first case with a relatively mild loading neither back nor face cavitation were detected in both the experiment and present method a hand drawing of the cavitation patterns observed in the experiment is compared to the bem predictions in fig 8 given the fully wetted results from both approaches 3d unsteady rans simulations can be conducted with a single phase flow for comparisons with the bem results loading conditions used in rans are summarized in table 2 in rans 4 4 in all rans calculations ansys fluent version 18 2 is used unstructured meshing model is used for the fluid zone where a 5 bladed propeller wall rotates with meshing motion in a constant r p s n k ω sst turbulent model is adopted and q u i c k scheme and s i m p l e c schemes are used for the spatial discretization and the pressure correction respectively over 0 86 milion polyhedral meshes are used to discretize the fluid zone second order implicit scheme is used for the time stepping in a transient model to record the pressure pulses on the top wall non slip boundary condition is applied on the top wall propeller and the hub inlet boundary condition is set at the upstream boundary with 1 0 m s inlet velocity zero pressure gradient is imposed at the outlet boundary it took about 2 h for rans to reach the converged blade forces with 192 intel xeon platinum 8160 2 1 ghz cores time step size in this case is fixed to δ t 0 005 fig 9 shows the predicted propeller induced hull pressures the present method first calculates the propeller induced pressures at the panel centroids and then interpolates the scattered data to the exact transducer locations loading in this case is lower than the design so the overall predictions seem to follow the measurements on most transducers the magnitude of pressure pulse amplitudes agree well with each other except for the transducers t 1 and t 3 at the upstream of the propeller plane in rans however the pressure pulses at the same locations are closer to the bem indicating environmental aspects in the experiment might have caused some differences given the high gradient in the pressure contours at the upstream region in fig 10 small changes in the transducer locations might cause big differences in the pressure peak value except those overall predictions are in good agreement among rans bem and the experiment the predicted pressure pulses are sinusoidal functions in time due to the strong low order harmonics high order harmonics are relatively very minor about one tenth at the most and vanish quickly as the harmonic order increases considering that the cavitation is one of the major excitation sources associated with the high order harmonics the low order dominant predictions without any cavitation look reasonable to investigate the influence of the cavity on the high order frequency kim and kinnas 2020a applied the current pressure bem to a 1 20 scaled model ship hallander and lindell 2013 with a 4 bladed propeller in a ship behind condition under the effective wake for the sake of instant comparisons representative results from kim and kinnas 2020a are presented in figs 11 and 12 it is shown that the predicted hull pressures are close to sinusoidal functions in the fully wetted condition similar as to the presented tlp case but the high frequency starts to appear and at some transducer locations downstream dominates the pressure pulses in case both the sheet cavity and tip vortex cavity are present as the propeller induced noise highly depends on the inflow condition especially under the non uniform effective wake high order frequencies can be captured even in the wetted condition as shown little in the wake peak region transducer d and more in the downstream transducers a and b in the present tlp case however pressure fluctuations are most likely limited to the low order harmonics even in the cavitating condition this is because of the uniformity in the inflow in which the noise associated with cavity volume variations is relatively minor gravity effects can cause some changes in the cavity volumes as the vertical elevation of the blade is periodic but these effects are too minor to overcome the distance from the cavity sources on the blade to the hull compared to the influence of propeller loading more details on the effective wake calculation and the effects of geometry such as the rudder or front part of the hull which are missing in fig 11 on the hull pressure fluctuations can be found in kim and kinnas 2020a su and kinnas 2017 grid independence study has been performed by changing panel density as shown in fig 13 for this study five different mesh qualities are selected as summarized in table 3 from the coarsest super coarse to densest super dense mesh grid densities are doubled except from super coarse to coarse the integrated pressure forces in the free surface direction seem to converge from the dense option in which the difference is within 2 solid body factor is practically 2 0 at the nearest hull panel from the propeller tip for all cases as expected it is worth noting the computing efficiency in the table showing that the present method takes only a few minutes even with a high panel resolution which renders the present method flexible to various testing conditions in a time efficient way fig 14 shows the convergence history of the pressure amplitudes up to the third order blade passing frequency n 1 3 among the panel densities present mesh is used and the convergence is checked on the panel with the minimum clearance off the propeller tip as shown the predictions show solid convergence after the 9 t h iteration of solving equations 27 and 28 fig 15 shows the predicted first and second pressure harmonic amplitudes p ρ n 2 d 2 with different grid densities at all transducer locations similar to the integrated pressure forces on the hull the pressure amplitudes seem to converge from the present mesh quality some fluctuations are detected in coarse and super coarse but soon stabilized as the panel number increases 3 2 2 case 2 the design j s j s 0 9110 in the experiment under the design loading no face cavitation has been detected same as the previous case on the back side however two strands of the developed tip vortex cavities are observed throughout propeller revolution one detached from the outer edge of the tip plate in unstable condition and the other from the bent junction of the tip plate in stable condition no other types of cavitation are detected in the experiment the present method also captures developed tip vortex cavitation evolving from the tip leading edge and a very small amount of sheet cavities on the blade surface fig 16 in this case trajectory of the tip vortex cavity follows the outermost wake panels wake tip in the downstream although a stable tip vortex strand developing and flowing over the bent region is observed in the experiment it is neglected in the present method rans simulations done by brown et al 2014 also show surface streamlines at the blade winglet where the flow is split as is going over the blade tip region and eventually developed into two separate tip vortices in order to capture the missing tip vortex cavity established around the bent region the current method needs to be modified such that the trailing wake can detach from the leading edge of the bent junction as well as the square tip of the tlp it might require dense panels on the wake close to the tip to sufficiently represent the rollup within small vortex radii which in some cases could cause singularity issues due to the entangled panels or panel intersections fig 17 shows comparisons of the propeller induced hull pressures between the pressure bem results and the measurements similar as to the previous case the predicted pressure pulses are still sinusoidal in time because of the minute high order frequency as the unsteady propeller loading is highly affected by the inflow condition its induced hull pressure could become a low order dominant signal even with the cavitation under the uniform inflow overall the magnitude of pressure pulse is increased compared to the lower loading case and good agreement is achieved between the two approaches at most transducers except for the transducers t 2 and t 3 a possible explanation for the high pressure predictions from the bem might be found in the absence of the tip vortex cavity at the bent junction smaller cavity volumes than the experiment due to the missing tip vortex cavity most likely increase the blade loading and consequently predicts the high pressures on the hull at t 2 and t 3 near the blade tip 3 2 3 case 3 decreasing j s by 20 j s 0 7288 in this case a higher loading than the design condition is imposed on the blade figs 18 and 19 show cavity patterns observed during the experiment compared with the bem predictions sheet cavitation is in stable condition throughout propeller revolution and it becomes cloud cavitation close to leaving the trailing edge in addition two tip vortex cavities are observed at the end plate with different pitches in fig 20 trajectories of the predicted tip vortex cavity are shown at two different loading conditions the higher loading condition contracts radial expansions of the tip vortex cavity near the trailing edge and expands it downstream more than the lower loading condition cavity volumes are also increased with larger cavity radii at the high loading as the vortex core inside gets stronger fig 21 shows the hull pressures with both the sheet cavity and tip vortex cavity considered the bem predictions are still close to sinusoidal fluctuations and cavitation does not significantly contribute to the high order frequency in both the bem and measurements the bem predictions on the transducers t 2 and t 3 show distinct deviations from the measurement which is mainly due to the under predicted cavity volume although the overall cavity volumes are increased compared to the design condition as expected the bem predictions are less than the observation which will lead to higher loading on the blade and consequently higher pressures on the hull in particular given the vortex evolving before the trailing edge lowers the local pressures when it comes close to or touches the blade surface the absence of the inner tip vortex flowing over the bent corner could increase the local pressures in the bem if the local pressures are high around the region the present method predicts two major cavity detachment points on the same station where the surface pressure p exceeds the vapor pressure as shown in fig 22 one near the leading edge successfully captures the sheet cavity that evolves from the leading edge to 0 4 chord but the rear one on the bent corner does not allow cavity inception which consequently makes the cavitating pressures in c p p 0 p ρ 2 n 2 d 2 after the mid chord close to the wetted results in such case where more than two cavity bubbles are detected on the same station the current algorithm cannot capture the cavities on multiple locations but rather searches for the biggest cavity planform in the presented case however the algorithm is forced to favor the front detachment point at the leading edge in our case to avoid cavity discontinuity across the below and above the bent leading edge if the missing cavity is modeled as sheet cavitation it is shown to be tip vortex together with cloud cavitation in observations as indicated with blue arrows in fig 18 it might be merging with the other cavity bubble or most likely develop into a super cavity either case could possibly lower the pressure on the blade and subsequently the hull pressures induced by the propeller this numerical issue affects the transducer t 1 less but more t 2 and t 3 the most although they sit on the same axial position this is because of the trajectory of the cavitation as observed in the tunnel fig 18 as the propeller rotates cavities approach to the tunnel ceiling and the distance becomes minimum when the blade passes before and after the 0 angular position the transducers t 2 and t 3 thus could monitor the absence more than other transducer locations especially when the cavities arise on the suction side of the blade quantitative comparisons are presented in fig 23 that shows the first order harmonics of the pressure pulse amplitude y axis for three different advance ratios x axis those advance ratios are the tested values in case 1 to 3 predictions from the present method are overall in reasonable agreement with the measurements at most transducers and show a consistent trend of increased harmonics magnitude as the advance ratio decreases exceptions happen at the transducers t 2 and t 3 where the measurements show an evident drop at the highest loading as discussed 4 conclusions and future work in this article a bem for the hydrodynamic analysis of a propeller and a bem for the prediction of propeller induced hull pressure fluctuations are described and then applied to predict the performance of a tip loaded propeller tlp and its induced hull pressures on a tunnel wall in uniform flow in fully wetted and cavitating conditions the relatively short distance between the propeller and the hull allows for the infinite sound speed assumption thus simplifying the acoustic equation for the hull pressures the numerical models are described for cases where sheet cavitation and developed tip vortex cavitation are both present the present methods are then applied to several operating conditions by changing the advance ratio as reported in the referenced experiment the hydrodynamic performance of the model tlp is first predicted by the bem and the results are found to be in satisfactory agreement with the experimental measurements over a range of advance ratios besides the predicted sheet cavity patterns on the blade and the trajectories of the developed tip vortex cavity are in reasonable agreement with those observed in the cavitation tunnel for the tested loading conditions moreover the predicted hull pressures agree well with both those measured and those from unsteady rans at design and moderately loaded conditions and for a wide range of transducer locations for the highest loading condition the predicted hull pressures deviate at the transducers near the blade tip because of the under predicted cavity volume and the missing tip vortex cavity from the bent corner of the tip plate which the present method cannot model currently future work includes studying the effects of finite speed of sound to predict far field underwater propeller noise in this case the flow field around the propeller can still be solved for by the present method and the predicted time dependent variables will be taken as the known noise sources in solving the ffowcs williams hawkings acoustic equation in the time domain this approach is expected to be more accurate in case the characteristic lengths of the ship or upstream obstacles are longer than the acoustic wave length induced by the propeller the present method might not work in such a case because it neglects the time travel of the acoustic waves extending the current cavity model to allow for more than one cavity on the same side of a blade section will allow for better predictions at conditions where a partial cavity is followed by a super cavity on the same side of a propeller blade credit authorship contribution statement seungnam kim conceptualization methodology software data

20805,a numerical method solving for the diffraction potential on the hull is coupled with a boundary element method bem to evaluate the propeller induced hull pressures the bem is first implemented for the hydrodynamic analysis of non cavitating cavitating propellers in the absence of the hull and the predicted solutions are taken as the known unbounded potentials in the hull pressure calculations a tip loaded propeller tlp is adopted as the model propeller and mounted under the flat hull subject to uniform inflow the tlp is operated close to the hull so that infinite speed of sound can be assumed reducing the frequency domain helmholtz equation to laplace s equation which can be solved by a bem solver unsteady sheet cavitation and developed tip vortex cavitation are predicted on the propeller by the hydrodynamic bem and considered in the calculation of the hull pressures several loading conditions are imposed on the propeller and the corresponding pressure predictions and cavitation patterns are compared to published experimental data and to those from unsteady full blown reynolds averaged navier stokes rans simulations very good agreement is achieved between the predicted and measured results especially under moderately loaded condition keywords propeller induced hull pressures boundary element method sheet cavitation tip vortex cavitation diffraction potential tip loaded propeller 1 introduction reducing on board noise and propulsion oriented intermittent vibrations on the ship hull have been of great interest and research tasks among naval architects and propulsion communities accurate predictions of the propeller induced hull vibrations early in designing stage are crucial aspects to the commercial passenger ships for on board comfort and even more critical to navy submarines which hide themselves behind tranquility of the ocean to effectively predict the propeller induced hull pressures there have been several attempts through the numerical and experimental approaches for the former breslin et al 1982 hwang et al 2006 and kim and kinnas 2020a used the outputs of a hydrodynamic boundary element method bem for an open propeller analysis to predict the fluctuating hull pressures induced by the propeller its wake and cavitation breslin et al 1982 introduced the bem based mathematical foundation for a representation of a hull in the presence of intermittently cavitating propellers and the free surface hwang et al 2006 extended the method to a single hull with twin propellers with some preliminary results of the hull excitation considering phase difference between the two propellers kim and kinnas 2020a further extended the pressure bem with central focus on considering the effects of unsteady wake and tip vortex cavitation to this end both the hydrodynamic bem and pressure bem were modified such that the former can produce cavity sources on the unsteady partial cavity and tip vortex cavity and the latter can consider them in the calculation of the fluctuating hull pressures kehr and kao 2011 developed a numerical method that can predict the underwater acoustic field and pressure fluctuations on a ship hull due to unsteady propeller sheet cavitation by a linear acoustic theory in particular the noise scattered from the ship hull or reflected from the free surface are considered their method can be used to predict the acoustic pressures at the near field and addresses an important aspect of scattering noise given the ship hull is closely located to the propeller later kao 2018 presented an improved numerical scheme to predict the pressure fluctuations on the ship hull due to unsteady sheet cavitation of a propeller based on a two cyclic iterating scheme in order to satisfy the boundary integral equation in the time domain in the work of kinns and bloor 2004 an acoustic boundary element model of a modern twin screw cruiser liner is used to show how the fluctuating pressures above the propeller and hull forces causing ship vibrations change relative to each other with the nature of propeller sources in their research a simple analysis of dipole and monopole sources is used to interpret numerical results and to demonstrate why the solution of the helmholtz equation which includes effects of a finite speed of sound is needed for an accurate evaluation of the hull disturbing forces on the other hand as for experimental approaches hallander and lindell 2013 performed experiments with a model scale ship with pressure transducers mounted on the hull to measure the propeller induced hull pressures and noise levels they used a 1 20 t h scaled model hull m t olympus positioned on the ceiling of the cavitation tunnel at its designed ballast draft the measurements therefore accounted for the interactions between the inflow and 3d hull geometry including the model 4 bladed propeller ship stern part and rudder geometry for another attempt the naval surface warfare center carderock division nswccd designed p2504 tip loaded propeller tlp using the standard united states navy practice for propeller designing p2504 has positive hydrorake winglet like tip on the pressure side and was manufactured as a 1 26 t h scaled model propeller for the tests of open water and cavitation performance at the facilities of the canal de experiencias hidrodinámicas de el pardo 1 1 https www inta es icts cehipar es cehipar in spain the tlp was tested at the viable pressure cavitation tunnel and the pressure pulses on the flat plate were measured among many other propeller types the tlp was selected due to its promise in increasing propeller efficiency without sacrificing cavitation performance this article will mainly investigate the tlp induced pressure fluctuations on the hull predicted by the pressure bem and their comparisons with the pressure pulses measured at cehipar under various loading conditions here and elsewhere the hydrodynamic bem represents a bem for the analysis of open propeller performance in the absence of the hull and the pressure bem a bem which calculates the propeller induced hull pressures with a propeller its wake and cavitation taken into account in terms of the unbounded potentials induced on the hull details on the open propeller characteristics of the model tlp are omitted in this article as those are not the main focus proper ways to consider viscous effects on the tlp blade wake alignment scheme and open water characteristics are presented in kim and kinnas 2020b besides brown et al 2014 presented potential flow simulations and reynolds averaged navier stokes rans viscous flow simulations to assess the performance of the model tlp along with the comparisons with experiments later brown et al 2015 also investigated impacts of the tip vortex wake interaction on the tlp performance with an emphasis on the tip vortex evolution 2 numerical methods 2 1 hydrodynamic bem representation of a propeller in the presence of cavitation in this section a summary of a lower order panel method and algorithms for detecting a partial cavity and tip vortex cavity are presented if the system of the coordinates is fixed on a rotating propeller the total velocity q can be decomposed into the background velocity u i n including the effective wake relative rotational velocity and the perturbation velocity u 1 q u i n ω r u the last component is equivalent to the gradient of the velocity potential φ which satisfies the laplace s equation in an inviscid and irrotational flow 2 u φ 3 2 φ 0 according to green s third identity equation 3 can be converted into the boundary integral form equation 4 in which s includes the propeller surface on a wetted part s b surfaces beneath the sheet cavity s c and tip vortex cavity s t as shown in fig 1 4 φ p 2 s s b s c s t g p q φ q n q g p q n q φ q d s s w δ φ w g p q n d s where s w represents the wake surface n q denotes the vector at point q directing into the fluid n is the normal vector on the wake surface g p q is the three dimensional green s function equivalent to 1 4 π r p q and a field point p is apart from a variable point q by the distance r p q on the wake surface the kutta condition is applied where the wake dipole strength δ φ w is equal to the difference between the potentials on each side of the blade trailing edge 5 δ φ w φ t φ t where the superscripts and correspond to the suction and pressure sides at the trailing edge respectively once the velocity potential φ p is known on the propeller boundary induced velocity at any point in a flow can be evaluated by taking a gradient on equation 4 with φ p 2 replaced by φ p for outside s 6 u 1 4 π s s b s c s t ϕ q n q 1 r p q ϕ q n q 1 r p q d s 1 4 π s w δ ϕ w r q n 1 r p q d s the analytic formulation equation 4 will be solved for the unknown dipole strength φ p on the wetted surface and for the source strength φ p n p on the surfaces beneath the cavity at the same time the kinematic boundary condition equation 7 is enforced on the wetted surface and the dynamic boundary condition equation 8 which describes a constant pressure in and on the cavity should be satisfied on the cavitating surface the kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions can be converted to a neumann type and a dirichlet type boundary conditions and provide the unknown source and dipole strengths in equation 4 respectively 7 φ p n p u i n ω r n o n s b 8 φ p φ c s o n s c s t where s in equation 8 denotes the dominant flow direction on the cavity surface 2 2 determination of dipole strengths on a cavity surface at the lower cavitation number σ n equation 9 sheet cavity arises on the blade surface and close to the tip it might develop into the developed tip vortex cavitation depending on the loading imposed on the propeller the sheet cavity planform could remain within the chord extent partial cavity or exceed the blade trailing edge thus developing into a super cavity in such cases dipole strengths can be directly evaluated via the dynamic boundary condition that can be derived from the bernoulli equation by connecting the two points i e one on the cavity surface and the other on the shaft axis far upstream 9 σ n p 0 p v ρ 2 n 2 d 2 10 p 0 ρ 1 2 u i n 2 ω 2 r 2 φ t p v ρ 1 2 q t 2 g y s where n and d are the propeller revolutions per second and diameter respectively ρ is the fluid density r the radial distance from the axis of rotation q t the total cavity velocity y s the vertical distance from the horizontal plane through the propeller axis p 0 and p v are the reference pressure far upstream and the vapor pressure respectively equation 10 can be rearranged to represent the total cavity velocity in terms of the cavitation number 11 q t 2 n 2 d 2 σ n u i n 2 ω 2 r 2 2 g y s 2 φ t by introducing a directional derivative of the perturbation potential φ along the curvilinear coordinate system on the local surfaces beneath the sheet cavity or tip vortex cavity the total cavity velocity q t can also be written in terms of the directional derivatives combining it with equation 11 yields a quadratic formulation of the unknown total velocity in the s and v directions 12 v v 2 2 v v v s c o s ψ v s 2 s i n 2 ψ v n 2 s i n 2 ψ n 2 d 2 σ n u i n 2 ω 2 r 2 2 g y s 2 φ t 13 v v φ v u v 14 v s φ s u s 15 v n φ n u n where ψ is the angle between the local s and v axes on the cavity fig 1 v v v s and v n are the total velocity components composed of the perturbation velocity and the effective inflow in the local v s and n directions equation 12 is solved for the unknown total velocity considering the dominant flow direction on the cavity surface on the surface beneath the sheet cavity for example equation 12 is solved for v s because the flow in chordwise direction is dominant over the spanwise component kinnas and fine 1993 while the same equation is solved for v v on the tip vortex cavity as the strong swirl velocity component is established around the vortex core kim and kinnas 2020a in any case there are two solutions for each of φ s and φ v and the solution with a positive square root is adopted to have the solution potentials increase in the positive s or v directions therefore on the sheet cavity we have 16 φ s v t φ 0 v 0 s u s v v cos ψ sin ψ n 2 d 2 σ n u i n 2 ω 2 r 2 2 g y s 2 φ t v v 2 d s and on the tip vortex cavity we have 17 φ s v t φ s 0 0 v u v v s cos ψ sin ψ n 2 d 2 σ n u i n 2 ω 2 r 2 2 g y s 2 φ t v s 2 u n 2 d v it has to be pointed out that the total velocity in the surface normal direction v n is omitted in equation 16 and approximated to the inflow component u n in equation 17 to avoid the full non linearity of the method that could cause negative values inside the square root during the iterative calculations both equations are integrated along the positive s and v directions using the trapezoidal quadrature once the velocity potentials are known source strengths on the cavity surfaces remain as the unknowns and are obtained by solving equation 4 portions of the blade covered by the sheet cavity or tip vortex cavity are varying depending on the given loading or inflow conditions thus the discretized green s formulation needs to be generalized to account for this change in time and space it is achieved by dynamic allocation in a bem matrix by changing its size and configuration iteratively to ignore collapsed cavities and to apply different boundary conditions on s b s c and s t accordingly 2 3 determination of cavity thickness cavity thickness can be computed from the kinematic boundary condition this condition finds the actual cavity surface based on the known singularity strengths by requiring the total derivative of the cavity surface vanish on the cavity surface for a sheet cavity the boundary integral equation equation 4 is solved with the assumed cavity planforms as the initial guesses but the computed cavity thickness at its trailing edge is normally under over predicted due to the wrong assumptions at the first attempt therefore the assumed cavity length needs to be adjusted iteratively to achieve zero thickness at the cavity trailing edge a two point newton raphson method is used to find the new cavity lengths over span which will become updated cavity planforms for subsequent iterations this process continues until the cavity thickness at the cavity trailing edge falls below a small number less than the predefined tolerance at all blade stations kinnas and fine 1993 tip vortex cavity relies on the similar approach as to the sheet cavity algorithm once the solution potentials are known on the initial guess of the tip vortex cavity kinematic boundary condition is applied to adjust the tip vortex radii different from the cavity on the blade an additional boundary condition named the potential jump condition needs to be satisfied this condition requires the potential difference between the panels connected to the upper and lower surface of the wake to be equal to the potential jump across the wake surface the initial cavity geometry is a cylindrical shape at the first revolution and the rest revolutions take the adjusted geometry from the previous revolutions based on the time step locations of the key blade boundary integral equation is resolved using the updated cavity shapes and the boundary conditions are reapplied to find new cavity radii this process continues until the completion of total revolutions and normally 3 or 4 revolutions are sufficient to produce the converged forces for mild unsteady problems some portions on the tip vortex might be cavitating while some others might not have enough vortex core strength that leads to the collapse of the tip vortex cavity in such event viscous core reappears and that cannot be considered in the current inviscid panel method no tip vortex cavity zone is introduced to go around this issue by neglecting the collapsed sections in the boundary integral equation size of the bem matrix thus varies dynamically in time and space depending on the local vortex strength along the tip vortex strand more details on the concept of no tip vortex cavity zone can be found in kim and kinnas 2020a 2 4 pressure bem representation of the hull in the presence of a propeller and its wake in the pressure bem instead of solving for oscillating pressures velocity potential φ n h is solved on the hull boundary at different blade passing frequencies n n 1 n m a x n m a x total number of harmonics considered the potential field φ n h is governed by the helmholtz equation in the frequency domain as follows 18 2 φ n h k 2 φ n h 0 19 k ω c 0 2 π l where k is the wave number ω the angular speed c 0 the speed of sound and l the wave length for the near field underwater noise wavelength of acoustic sound is much longer than the dimension of the domain of interest thus infinite speed of sound c 0 can be assumed so that the helmholtz equation can be reduced to the laplace s equation which can be solved by a pressure bem solver 2 2 we call this pressure bem because the diffraction potential is proportional to pressure as shown by equation 31 20 2 φ n h 0 from green s 3rd identity for points on the surface of boundary we have 21 φ n h 2 s h g φ n h n φ n h g n d s s p g φ n p n φ n p g n d s s w δ φ n w p g n d s 22 g 1 4 π r where the integrals will be performed on two separate boundaries one on the hull surface s h including its image beyond the free surface or tunnel wall and the other on the surfaces s p s w conforming a propeller and its trailing wake the nth velocity potential φ n h is the diffraction potential on the hull due to the presence of the propeller for a rigid hull boundary φ n h n 0 holds on s h where the noise due to the hull vibration caused by the propeller will be ignored once the singularity strengths on the propeller boundary are known through the hydrodynamic bem the second and third terms on the right hand side of equation 21 can be reduced to the unbounded potential φ n p h induced on the hull by the propeller φ n p h is calculated by superposition of φ n p and φ n p n over the propeller s p and the wake strength δ φ n w p on s w thus equation 21 can be written as equation 23 and will be solved for φ n h at different harmonic frequencies by the pressure bem 23 φ n h 2 s h g φ n h n φ n h g n d s φ n p h in our problem since the hull does not vibrate kinematic boundary condition of zero normal velocity φ n h n 0 eliminates the source term in equation 23 representing the diffraction potential as a function of φ n p h and dipole distributions over the hull in an unbounded flow changes in cavity volume if any cavity is detected does not require additional boundary conditions to satisfy the continuity of the flow however in the case of a bounded flow such as the flow inside the tunnel boundary conditions on the inlet and outlet should be modified to account for the changes in the cavity volume kinnas et al 1998 in addition to the fluctuating pressures on the hull it is of practical interest to calculate the solid body factor sbf which varies significantly over the curved hull surface the sbf is the ratio of the potential on the wall φ n h to the potential of the unbounded flow φ n p h the sbf near the propeller is practically close to 2 0 due to the image effect and this fact will be checked in discussions equation 23 finally becomes 24 φ n h 2 s h φ n h g n d s φ n p h equation 24 will be solved for the harmonic amplitudes at different frequencies n 1 n m a x after performing harmonic analysis on the unsteady potentials φ n p h radiated as evenly spaced data by the time step δ t real and imaginary parts of the harmonics are evaluated on the hull control points up to the n m a x blade passing frequency discretized green s formula of equation 24 can be written as 25 h d i j φ n h j φ n p h i 26 d i j δ i j 2 s h i j n 1 4 π r i j d s where d i j is the induced potential at i due to the dipole singularity over the panel j the discretized formula is solved iteratively on the hull s h as well as its image s i iterative scheme solves for the potentials on each half of the double hull hull image with the effect of the other half being considered in the right hand side of equation 25 as the known values thus dimension of a bem matrix becomes the total number of panels on each half of the double hull 3 3 potential could be solved for the double hull hull image simultaneously but the authors opted for the iterative method without significant burden of computing time 27 d h i j φ n h h j φ n h p h i d i i j φ n i h j 28 d h i j φ n i h j φ n i p h i d i i j φ n h h j where d h i j and d i i j are the influence coefficient matrices from the hull panel j to the hull panel i and from the hull panel j to the image hull panel i respectively φ n h h j and φ n i h j are the solution vectors of the panels on the hull and its image convergence history of the iterative solution method shows the solution vectors converge in general after 10 to 15 iterations with one iteration including a set of solving equations 27 and 28 convergence criterion is set in terms of the potential difference terminating the method if the difference between the new and old solutions falls below a certain tolerance the present method endorses double hull model with positive image in the case of solid wall equation 29 and negative image in the case of the free surface under the assumption of very large froude number equation 30 29 φ n h φ n h h φ n i h 30 φ n h φ n h h φ n i h once the diffraction potential φ n h is known time history of the pressure fluctuations on the hull p t is finally obtained by 31 p t ρ φ h t ρ n 1 n m a x i n z ω φ n h e i n z ω t where z is the blade number ω is the shaft rate frequency unbounded flow does not require additional iterative process between the propeller and the hull as the uniformity of the inflow is secured however in the case of tunnel problems propeller problem and the tunnel problem are solved separately with the effect of one on the other being considered in an iterative manner until the total flow converges 3 results 3 1 numerical model p2504 tip loaded propeller in this section a numerical model for p2504 tip loaded propeller tlp is presented fig 2 shows p2504 tlp with positive hydrorake designed at nswccd brown et al 2014 and manufactured in 1 26 t h scale at cehipar for the assessment of open water and cavitation performance blade sections assume a naca 66 thickness profile and a customized chordwise loading distribution which produces more loading toward the trailing edge than the traditional naca a 0 8 mean line basic parameters for this propeller are shown in table 1 and fig 3 shows the predicted circulation distributions over the blade span at three different advance ratios in the figure the non dimensional circulation g r is defined as 32 g r γ 2 π r u r where γ is the predicted circulation and u r v s 2 0 7 n π d 2 is the reference velocity with v s and d being the ship speed and propeller diameter respectively p2504 tlp is designed to produce the maximum loading near the r r 0 8 spanwise location as shown in fig 3 where the bem also predicts the maximum circulation close to r r 0 8 as designed 71 32 chordwise spanwise panels are used for blade discretization with a full cosine and a half cosine spacing respectively as shown in fig 4 since the actual profiles are not given on the hub geometry in the experiment report hub is modeled as a cylindrical shape that has different radii at the mid and downstream parts upstream part is closed with quadratic hub as close to the benchmark model fully aligned trailing wake is also shown in fig 4 at the design loading j s 0 911 it is worth noting the crosses of streamlines downstream due to the pitch difference between the sides of the tip plate fig 5 shows open water performance of the model tlp predicted by the present method in comparison with the experimental measurement over a range of advance ratios the thrust coefficient k t and the torque coefficient k q in the figure are defined following the equations 33 k t t ρ n 2 d 4 34 k q q ρ n 2 d 5 where t and q are the predicted propeller thrust and torque overall the comparisons show very good agreement especially around the design condition j s 0 911 and even down to very high loading j s 0 4 maintaining less than 6 error in this study inflow is assumed to be a uniform inflow therefore the bem results are time independent in the open water condition in other words both the steady and unsteady runs with without consideration of spatial variations in the inflow practically produce the same results similarly the predicted hull pressures are not much affected by the different wake alignment schemes even though the propeller induced hull pressures are unsteady vibrations hence this article will adopt the full wake alignment fwa scheme tian and kinnas 2012 kim et al 2018 due to its reasonable accuracy in a steady axisymmetric flow and fast calculations over the unsteady wake alignment uwa scheme kim and kinnas 2020a lee 2002 the uwa is normally slower than the fwa in computing speed but adequate for time dependent problems under the non axisymmetric effective inflow 3 2 propeller induced hull pressures in the experiment three different loading conditions are tested by changing the advance ratio in the cavitation tunnel tests are made at the design loading increasing or decreasing 20 of the design j s with the fixed cavitaion number σ n 4 092 and the froude number f n 5 734 throughout the tests fig 6 shows a flat plate used as the model hull where the fluctuating hull pressures are measured at 11 different transducer locations panels on the plate are dense close to the propeller plane and become coarse away from the propeller in the experiment a horizontal flat plate is positioned on the ceiling of the cavitation tunnel with holes to place the pressure transducers the location of the flat plate is fixed so that the flow in the tunnel does not perturb its initial position the arrangement of the transducers is shown in fig 7 where the layout is viewed from the top transducer 5 t 5 is located on the vertical position of the generator line of the key blade when it is on the 0 blade angle 3 2 1 case 1 increasing j s by 20 j s 1 0932 in the first case with a relatively mild loading neither back nor face cavitation were detected in both the experiment and present method a hand drawing of the cavitation patterns observed in the experiment is compared to the bem predictions in fig 8 given the fully wetted results from both approaches 3d unsteady rans simulations can be conducted with a single phase flow for comparisons with the bem results loading conditions used in rans are summarized in table 2 in rans 4 4 in all rans calculations ansys fluent version 18 2 is used unstructured meshing model is used for the fluid zone where a 5 bladed propeller wall rotates with meshing motion in a constant r p s n k ω sst turbulent model is adopted and q u i c k scheme and s i m p l e c schemes are used for the spatial discretization and the pressure correction respectively over 0 86 milion polyhedral meshes are used to discretize the fluid zone second order implicit scheme is used for the time stepping in a transient model to record the pressure pulses on the top wall non slip boundary condition is applied on the top wall propeller and the hub inlet boundary condition is set at the upstream boundary with 1 0 m s inlet velocity zero pressure gradient is imposed at the outlet boundary it took about 2 h for rans to reach the converged blade forces with 192 intel xeon platinum 8160 2 1 ghz cores time step size in this case is fixed to δ t 0 005 fig 9 shows the predicted propeller induced hull pressures the present method first calculates the propeller induced pressures at the panel centroids and then interpolates the scattered data to the exact transducer locations loading in this case is lower than the design so the overall predictions seem to follow the measurements on most transducers the magnitude of pressure pulse amplitudes agree well with each other except for the transducers t 1 and t 3 at the upstream of the propeller plane in rans however the pressure pulses at the same locations are closer to the bem indicating environmental aspects in the experiment might have caused some differences given the high gradient in the pressure contours at the upstream region in fig 10 small changes in the transducer locations might cause big differences in the pressure peak value except those overall predictions are in good agreement among rans bem and the experiment the predicted pressure pulses are sinusoidal functions in time due to the strong low order harmonics high order harmonics are relatively very minor about one tenth at the most and vanish quickly as the harmonic order increases considering that the cavitation is one of the major excitation sources associated with the high order harmonics the low order dominant predictions without any cavitation look reasonable to investigate the influence of the cavity on the high order frequency kim and kinnas 2020a applied the current pressure bem to a 1 20 scaled model ship hallander and lindell 2013 with a 4 bladed propeller in a ship behind condition under the effective wake for the sake of instant comparisons representative results from kim and kinnas 2020a are presented in figs 11 and 12 it is shown that the predicted hull pressures are close to sinusoidal functions in the fully wetted condition similar as to the presented tlp case but the high frequency starts to appear and at some transducer locations downstream dominates the pressure pulses in case both the sheet cavity and tip vortex cavity are present as the propeller induced noise highly depends on the inflow condition especially under the non uniform effective wake high order frequencies can be captured even in the wetted condition as shown little in the wake peak region transducer d and more in the downstream transducers a and b in the present tlp case however pressure fluctuations are most likely limited to the low order harmonics even in the cavitating condition this is because of the uniformity in the inflow in which the noise associated with cavity volume variations is relatively minor gravity effects can cause some changes in the cavity volumes as the vertical elevation of the blade is periodic but these effects are too minor to overcome the distance from the cavity sources on the blade to the hull compared to the influence of propeller loading more details on the effective wake calculation and the effects of geometry such as the rudder or front part of the hull which are missing in fig 11 on the hull pressure fluctuations can be found in kim and kinnas 2020a su and kinnas 2017 grid independence study has been performed by changing panel density as shown in fig 13 for this study five different mesh qualities are selected as summarized in table 3 from the coarsest super coarse to densest super dense mesh grid densities are doubled except from super coarse to coarse the integrated pressure forces in the free surface direction seem to converge from the dense option in which the difference is within 2 solid body factor is practically 2 0 at the nearest hull panel from the propeller tip for all cases as expected it is worth noting the computing efficiency in the table showing that the present method takes only a few minutes even with a high panel resolution which renders the present method flexible to various testing conditions in a time efficient way fig 14 shows the convergence history of the pressure amplitudes up to the third order blade passing frequency n 1 3 among the panel densities present mesh is used and the convergence is checked on the panel with the minimum clearance off the propeller tip as shown the predictions show solid convergence after the 9 t h iteration of solving equations 27 and 28 fig 15 shows the predicted first and second pressure harmonic amplitudes p ρ n 2 d 2 with different grid densities at all transducer locations similar to the integrated pressure forces on the hull the pressure amplitudes seem to converge from the present mesh quality some fluctuations are detected in coarse and super coarse but soon stabilized as the panel number increases 3 2 2 case 2 the design j s j s 0 9110 in the experiment under the design loading no face cavitation has been detected same as the previous case on the back side however two strands of the developed tip vortex cavities are observed throughout propeller revolution one detached from the outer edge of the tip plate in unstable condition and the other from the bent junction of the tip plate in stable condition no other types of cavitation are detected in the experiment the present method also captures developed tip vortex cavitation evolving from the tip leading edge and a very small amount of sheet cavities on the blade surface fig 16 in this case trajectory of the tip vortex cavity follows the outermost wake panels wake tip in the downstream although a stable tip vortex strand developing and flowing over the bent region is observed in the experiment it is neglected in the present method rans simulations done by brown et al 2014 also show surface streamlines at the blade winglet where the flow is split as is going over the blade tip region and eventually developed into two separate tip vortices in order to capture the missing tip vortex cavity established around the bent region the current method needs to be modified such that the trailing wake can detach from the leading edge of the bent junction as well as the square tip of the tlp it might require dense panels on the wake close to the tip to sufficiently represent the rollup within small vortex radii which in some cases could cause singularity issues due to the entangled panels or panel intersections fig 17 shows comparisons of the propeller induced hull pressures between the pressure bem results and the measurements similar as to the previous case the predicted pressure pulses are still sinusoidal in time because of the minute high order frequency as the unsteady propeller loading is highly affected by the inflow condition its induced hull pressure could become a low order dominant signal even with the cavitation under the uniform inflow overall the magnitude of pressure pulse is increased compared to the lower loading case and good agreement is achieved between the two approaches at most transducers except for the transducers t 2 and t 3 a possible explanation for the high pressure predictions from the bem might be found in the absence of the tip vortex cavity at the bent junction smaller cavity volumes than the experiment due to the missing tip vortex cavity most likely increase the blade loading and consequently predicts the high pressures on the hull at t 2 and t 3 near the blade tip 3 2 3 case 3 decreasing j s by 20 j s 0 7288 in this case a higher loading than the design condition is imposed on the blade figs 18 and 19 show cavity patterns observed during the experiment compared with the bem predictions sheet cavitation is in stable condition throughout propeller revolution and it becomes cloud cavitation close to leaving the trailing edge in addition two tip vortex cavities are observed at the end plate with different pitches in fig 20 trajectories of the predicted tip vortex cavity are shown at two different loading conditions the higher loading condition contracts radial expansions of the tip vortex cavity near the trailing edge and expands it downstream more than the lower loading condition cavity volumes are also increased with larger cavity radii at the high loading as the vortex core inside gets stronger fig 21 shows the hull pressures with both the sheet cavity and tip vortex cavity considered the bem predictions are still close to sinusoidal fluctuations and cavitation does not significantly contribute to the high order frequency in both the bem and measurements the bem predictions on the transducers t 2 and t 3 show distinct deviations from the measurement which is mainly due to the under predicted cavity volume although the overall cavity volumes are increased compared to the design condition as expected the bem predictions are less than the observation which will lead to higher loading on the blade and consequently higher pressures on the hull in particular given the vortex evolving before the trailing edge lowers the local pressures when it comes close to or touches the blade surface the absence of the inner tip vortex flowing over the bent corner could increase the local pressures in the bem if the local pressures are high around the region the present method predicts two major cavity detachment points on the same station where the surface pressure p exceeds the vapor pressure as shown in fig 22 one near the leading edge successfully captures the sheet cavity that evolves from the leading edge to 0 4 chord but the rear one on the bent corner does not allow cavity inception which consequently makes the cavitating pressures in c p p 0 p ρ 2 n 2 d 2 after the mid chord close to the wetted results in such case where more than two cavity bubbles are detected on the same station the current algorithm cannot capture the cavities on multiple locations but rather searches for the biggest cavity planform in the presented case however the algorithm is forced to favor the front detachment point at the leading edge in our case to avoid cavity discontinuity across the below and above the bent leading edge if the missing cavity is modeled as sheet cavitation it is shown to be tip vortex together with cloud cavitation in observations as indicated with blue arrows in fig 18 it might be merging with the other cavity bubble or most likely develop into a super cavity either case could possibly lower the pressure on the blade and subsequently the hull pressures induced by the propeller this numerical issue affects the transducer t 1 less but more t 2 and t 3 the most although they sit on the same axial position this is because of the trajectory of the cavitation as observed in the tunnel fig 18 as the propeller rotates cavities approach to the tunnel ceiling and the distance becomes minimum when the blade passes before and after the 0 angular position the transducers t 2 and t 3 thus could monitor the absence more than other transducer locations especially when the cavities arise on the suction side of the blade quantitative comparisons are presented in fig 23 that shows the first order harmonics of the pressure pulse amplitude y axis for three different advance ratios x axis those advance ratios are the tested values in case 1 to 3 predictions from the present method are overall in reasonable agreement with the measurements at most transducers and show a consistent trend of increased harmonics magnitude as the advance ratio decreases exceptions happen at the transducers t 2 and t 3 where the measurements show an evident drop at the highest loading as discussed 4 conclusions and future work in this article a bem for the hydrodynamic analysis of a propeller and a bem for the prediction of propeller induced hull pressure fluctuations are described and then applied to predict the performance of a tip loaded propeller tlp and its induced hull pressures on a tunnel wall in uniform flow in fully wetted and cavitating conditions the relatively short distance between the propeller and the hull allows for the infinite sound speed assumption thus simplifying the acoustic equation for the hull pressures the numerical models are described for cases where sheet cavitation and developed tip vortex cavitation are both present the present methods are then applied to several operating conditions by changing the advance ratio as reported in the referenced experiment the hydrodynamic performance of the model tlp is first predicted by the bem and the results are found to be in satisfactory agreement with the experimental measurements over a range of advance ratios besides the predicted sheet cavity patterns on the blade and the trajectories of the developed tip vortex cavity are in reasonable agreement with those observed in the cavitation tunnel for the tested loading conditions moreover the predicted hull pressures agree well with both those measured and those from unsteady rans at design and moderately loaded conditions and for a wide range of transducer locations for the highest loading condition the predicted hull pressures deviate at the transducers near the blade tip because of the under predicted cavity volume and the missing tip vortex cavity from the bent corner of the tip plate which the present method cannot model currently future work includes studying the effects of finite speed of sound to predict far field underwater propeller noise in this case the flow field around the propeller can still be solved for by the present method and the predicted time dependent variables will be taken as the known noise sources in solving the ffowcs williams hawkings acoustic equation in the time domain this approach is expected to be more accurate in case the characteristic lengths of the ship or upstream obstacles are longer than the acoustic wave length induced by the propeller the present method might not work in such a case because it neglects the time travel of the acoustic waves extending the current cavity model to allow for more than one cavity on the same side of a blade section will allow for better predictions at conditions where a partial cavity is followed by a super cavity on the same side of a propeller blade credit authorship contribution statement seungnam kim conceptualization methodology software data

20806,large floating structures such as platforms breakwaters and piers have been constructed in many countries in coastal areas in a bid to increase land space due to construction ease and operational flexibility these facilities are commonly consisted of relatively small floating units that are subsequently connected on sea this paper first describes box like structural systems for concrete floating structures finite element fe analyses are then performed to assess the structural performance of concrete floating structures when subjected to self weight imposed live load hydrostatic pressure and buoyancy force the effects of geometrical shapes cell numbers and slab thickness on the structural performance of box like floating modules are investigated results indicate the need to provide prestressing steels so as to prevent cracking in the concrete modules besides material requirements for different configurations were compared to provide the most economical solution for box like concrete floating units furthermore global responses of modular multi purpose floating structures with different geometrical shapes were investigated via hydroelastic analyses using self developed hybrid boundary element be fe code global flexural stresses are found to be quite high for rigidly interconnected large floating structures due to regular wave loadings especially when the geometrical aspect ratio becomes large the use of hinge joints is effective in reducing bending moments but it relatively increases the vertical deflections a trade off should be considered between internal loads and structural motions in the conceptual design of large floating structure system keywords box like structure finite element analysis hydroelastic analysis modular multi purpose floating structures 1 introduction for many large urban cities there is a constant demand for more useable space to meet the developmental and economic needs of an ever increasing population in this respect the use of coastal sea space where available is a viable solution to address the issue of land scarcity the use of floating structures is preferable to the convetional land reclamation that involves dumping sands rocks into the sea this is because it is more environmentally friendly and less time consuming in construction jiang et al 2018 wang and wang 2015 moreover the self weight of floating structures is automatically balanced by the buoyancy force thus eliminating the need for massive and expensive foundations which in turn results in savings in material and construction costs in the past decades large floating structures such as platforms breakwaters piers and others have been constructed in many countries dai et al 2018 jiang et al 2017 2019 wan et al 2020 these facilities are commonly composed of relatively small floating modular units due to construction ease and operational flexibility it is of interest to determine viable and economical structural solutions for floating modules the floating modular unit generally acquires sufficient upward buoyancy force by means of voided compartments currently the applications of structural solutions and construction materials for floating modules vary from region to region back in 1980s yee developed the concrete honeycomb structural system as shown in fig 1 a and it has been applied in some engineering practices such as the rofomex floating dock and densit floating barge fernandez and pardo 2013 yee 2009 this system employs a honeycomb sandwich design consisting of vertical cylindrical cells aligned in rows and connected to each other by thin concrete walls the integration of precast concrete cylindrical components in combination with exterior side walls top slab and bottom slab provides exceptional structural stiffness and strength with less amount of concrete steel reinforcement and prestressing steels however the complex configuration of honeycomb structures generally makes the construction procedure time consuming and costly for military purposes the mobile offshore base mob was developed to accommodate take off and landing long rang cargo aircraft as shown in fig 2 lamas pardo et al 2015 mcallister 1997 ramsamooj and shugar 2002 rognaas et al 2001 several mob conceptual designs were proposed with using different materials such as steel concrete or a combination thereof fig 2b shows a semi submersible design of mob which consists of the concrete hull and steel topside rognaas et al 2001 performed a comprehensive finite element fe anlsyis on the invidual mob structure where shell elements were utilized and the wave loads were generated by the commercial software wadam and applied to the fe model however rognaas et al 2001 mentioned that the moment effects were not included in the fe analysis which may influence the evalution of concrete portions wong et al 2013 and dai et al 2020 studied the use of high density polyethylene hdpe for constructing the floating wetlands and the floating modular photovoltaic panel system respectively as shown in fig 3 local stresses of the floating module is analyzed with fe method where hdpe is treated as an isotropic material by simplifying the entire floating structure as an equivalent mindlin plate hydroelastic analyses were performed to examine the moment and shear strength capcities besides aforementioned structural solution alternatives floating modules can also be made as boxes with different geometries and cell numbers fig 4 a shows a rectangular box like floating modular unit in which the internal walls are used to increase the structural stiffness and reduce the flexural stresses in the top and bottom slabs the marina bay floating platform in singapore measures 120 m in length 83 m in width and 1 2 m in depth and was built by assembling steel rectangular box like modules wang and tay 2011a b focused on the hydroelastic analysis of the entire floating platform with assuming all the modules are connected rigidly but no detailed analysis of the individual floating module was reported koh and lim 2009 morris 1996 has filed a patent to show the conceptual design of an artificial prestressed concrete pc floating structure formed by a plurality of hexagonal and triangular cells as shown in fig 4b the hexagonal shape structure has been adopted by architects as a basic unit for conceptual designs of floating cities seasteading institute 2019 however no analysis work has been conducted to evaluate the structural performance of the pc hexagonal modules and the entire floating structutres engineering practices indicate that floating structures can be made of various materials however when properly designed and constructed under strict quality control concrete would be a preferred material for modular floating structures in the seawater environment because of some key advantages fernandez and pardo 2013 priedeman and anderson 1985 1 the use of concrete material generally results in a lower initial construction cost 2 concrete shows superior durability in the seawater environment which shall reduce the costs for maintenance inspection and repair 3 concrete structures have larger local and global stiffness and show better performances in withstanding accidental impact loads 4 large floating concrete structures can be assembled with precast components integrated by post tensioning p t tendons leading to an easier construction the concrete itself is a brittle material that is strong in compression but very weak in tension thus the analysis and design of concrete structures differ from structures made of isotropic materials additionally prestressing steels are commonly used to achieve reliable structural concrete designs and the degree of prestressings is often determined by counteracting the load effect of dominant actions such that no tensile stresses exist in the critical section up to present most scholars focused on hydroelastic response analysis of large floating structures to determine the global deflection and stresses considering the modular structure as a rigid unit fu et al 2007 loukogeorgaki et al 2012 limit research work on the structural behavior of the floating module itself was reported especially for the prestressed concrete modular floating structures in this paper the structural behaviour of concrete box like floating modules are evaluated using the fe analysis and the effects of geometrical shapes cell numbers and slab thickness are investigated besides material requirements for different configurations of box like structures are compared to determine the most economical solution for concrete floating modular units moreover global responses of large floating structures composed of selected modular structures with different geometrical shapes are investigated by performing hydroelastic analysis using a self developed hybrid boundary element be fe code last suggestions and recommendations on the design of modular floating structures are provided for the engineering practice 2 design alternatives for concrete floating modules considering the ease of construction and installation relatively small sizes of floating modules are selected in the conceptual designs for the rectangular module the length width and height are set as 30 m 15 m and 5 m respectively as a benchmark table 1 lists the plan dimensions of different geometrical shapes that have the same plan area as the benchmark rectangular shape it can be seen that the hexagonal shape has the smallest perimeter which indicates that it requires the least volume of concrete for the same wall thickness and height it should be mentioned that the listed possible shapes and sizes were chosen in the conceptual development based on a set of selection criteria which include the construability ease of connection preliminary structural and hydrodynamic performance and cost effectiveness ang et al 2020 ren et al 2019 nus and nus sintef 2019 in this study rectangular and hexagonal shapes will be selected for further structural evaluations table 2 lists all box like floating modules investigated in this study the variable parameters include geometrical shape cell numbers and wall slab thickness for the rectangular modules 1 cell 2 cell and 4 cell structures are considered for the hexagonal modules 1 cell 6 cell 7 cell and 24 cell structures are considered for each case the wall thickness and the top and bottom slab thickness are kept the same and varied as 150 mm 225 mm and 300 mm 3 structural analysis and prestressing design 3 1 finite element modelling in this study fe models are developed for different types of floating modules using the commercial software abaqus fig 5 shows fe models of representative box like floating modular structures solid element c3d8r was used in the analysis to model concrete structural components and the c3d8r element is a general purpose linear eight node solid element with three degrees of freedom at each node compared to the shell element the solid element can represent the structural geometries more realistically and allow reinforcing and non reinforcing steel elements to be easily embedded in the structure model at a later stage the mesh of each model was generated with evenly spaced nodes in plane and at least three nodes were uniformly distributed in the direction of slab thickness for the purpose of finding the optimum mesh size several models with different mesh sizes 100 mm 200 mm and 500 mm were investigated in one specific load case for the critical transverse path along the top slab in the 2 cell rectangular module fig 6 presents the flexural stress distributions along path 1 2 with different mesh sizes as the figure illustrates the computational results converged as the mesh size became smaller although the analyses demonstrated satisfactory outcomes could be achieved with the 200 mm mesh the finer 100 mm mesh was adopted as the additional modeling and computational effort was not significant both reinforcing and prestressing steels were modelled as truss elements t3d2 and embedded into the concrete section which assumes full bond interaction between two materials the floating modules are designed to remain in the linear elastic range of behavior at the serviceability limit state sls by using prestressed concrete as such a linear elastic model can be defined also the density of lightweight concrete was taken as 2000 kg m3 the floating modular structures are subjected to various actions under service conditions for example self weight hydrostatic pressures wave load current load wind load and others previous experience indicates that hydrostatic pressure generally contributes a major proportion of the action effects compared to the other actions therefore only the self weight imposed live load 5 kn m2 and hydrostatic pressures are taken into consideration in the fe analysis to evaluate the structural performance of different floating modules fig 7 depicts the load patterns applied on the floating module the hydrostatic pressures due to seawater are determined using p w ρ w g h w where the density of seawater ρ w is taken as 1025 kg m3 and h w is the seawater draft the hydrostatic pressure around the floating modular structure is automatically balanced because of the geometric asymmetry linear springs are attached beneath the base slab to simulate the upward buoyancy effects and also act as the boundary conditions which can automatically account for the varying pressure due to bottom slab deflections the spring constant for unit area of the bottom slab is taken as k s ρ g 10055 n m3 draft values for each floating module are determined by balancing the upward buoyancy force with downward load effects as shown in fig 7 it is observed from table 3 that draft values are slightly different for various floating modules which results from different magnitude due to self weight for each floating module stress distributions are extracted to check the allowable stress limits at sls and the necessity for prestressing steels is evaluated 3 2 analysis results flexural stress distributions are taken along different paths of box like structures to identify the critical stress values and evaluate the requirement for prestressing steels fig 8 shows the three paths 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 9 10 11 12 taken in the longitudinal transverse and vertical directions respectively for rectangular box like modular units paths are purposely selected at the middle section between two adjacent supports where the maximum stresses are expected fig 9 presents paths for stress evaluation in hexagonal box like modular units the paths 1 2 3 4 and 5 6 7 8 are taken along the short and long side of both the top and bottom slabs while path 9 10 is taken along a side wall 3 2 1 rectangular modular units fig 10 shows typical flexural stress distributions for a 2 cell module the red blue and grey lines are for modular units with slab and wall thickness of 150 mm 225 mm and 300 mm respectively the positive values indicate tensile stresses while the negative values indicate compressive stresses it can be seen that the top and bottom slabs of all modules deflect inwards while side walls bulge outwards which can be attributed to the large intensity of downward imposed live load and upward buoyancy effects the flexural stresses reduce with the increase in slab wall thickness and cell numbers which attributes to the larger plate flexural rigidity and shorter span length between adjacent internal walls for different modular structures the maximum stress in the top and bottom slabs always occurs along paths 1 2 and 3 4 between two adjacent supports which is due to one way action of the slabs having a length width ratio more than 2 fig 11 presents the maximum tensile and compressive stresses for different cell numbers and slab wall thicknesses the compressive stresses are generally within the allowable compressive stress f cd 30 mpa for c45 55 however the tensile stresses at critical locations exceed the allowable tensile stress f ctd 1 80 mpa for c45 55 which necessitates the provision of prestressing steels to reduce the tensile stresses note that the design compressive and tensile stress limits are determined by f c d α c c f c k γ c and f c t d α c t f c k 0 05 γ c based on eurocode en 1992 1 1 where α c c and γ c are taken as 1 0 and 1 5 respectively it is worth mentioning that negative moments exist at locations of end and interior wall supports resulting in high tensile stresses but these can be mitigated by chamfering technique at the joints 3 2 2 hexagonal modular units fig 12 shows the flexural stress distributions along various paths for a 6 cell module representative of hexagonal modular units the legend for the colored lines and stress sign convention are the same with fig 10 similar to rectangular modules the top and bottom slabs are found to deflect inwards while side walls bulge outwards smaller stress magnitudes are observed with increased slab wall thicknesses and relatively shorter spans between adjacent vertical wall supports fig 13 presents the maximum tensile and compressive stress values in different hexagonal floating modules with different cell numbers and slab wall thicknesses an interesting phenomenon is that the stress magnitude of the 7 cell module is larger than that of 6 cell module which can be attributed to a relatively larger span in the inner hexagon compressive stresses are generally within the allowable compressive stress f cd 30 mpa for c45 55 maximum tensile stresses of only four cases that is 6 cell 300 mm and 24 cell 150 225 300 mm satisfy the design tensile stress limit f ctd 1 80 mpa for c45 55 it is concluded that the prestressing steels are generally needed for most hexagonal floating modules specifically no necessity for prestressing steels in the 24 cell module is attributed to a much shorter span in the inner hexagon but its complex configuration makes the construction procedure time consuming and costly 3 3 preliminary design of prestressing steels in order to counteract the tensile stresses prestressing steels are applied in the box like floating modules to keep the concrete at an uncracked state when the prestressing steels are embedded inside the modular structures the generated compression effect is considered to be uniform across the thickness of thin slabs and walls the amounts of prestressing steels can be simply designed to counteract the tensile stresses according to the equation σ t t h a p s f p s where σ t is the tensile stress that needs to be eliminated t is the slab wall thickness h is the unit slab wall width taken as 1000 mm a p s is the required areas of prestressing steels per metre width f p s is the effective stress after considering prestressing losses taken as 1100 mpa design parameters for prestressed concrete floating modules are based on the standard practice the concrete grade is specified to be c45 55 and the allowable compressive stress f cd and the allowable compressive stress f ctd are 30 mpa and 1 80 mpa respectively the standard prestressing steels used herein is 12 7 mm diameter low relaxation strands with the ultimate strength f pu of 1860 mpa in order to achieve an economical design the amounts of prestressing steels are designed differently for side walls top slab and bottom slab according to the tensile stress magnitudes fe analysis was also performed on the modular structures after prestressing steels are incorporated in the abaqus program prestressing steels were modelled as truss elements and embedded in concrete solid elements figs 14 and 15 show the stress distribution of 2 cell rectangular and 6 cell hexagonal box like modules after applying the prestressing steels it is observed that the stress curves shift towards the compression side and all tensile stresses have been balanced by the prestressing forces 3 4 evaluation of various design alternatives based on the preliminary prestressing designs material costs for various design alternatives are determined in the calculation the cost of concrete is taken as sgd 135 per m3 while the cost of steel is taken as sgd 900 per tonne fig 16 shows the cost comparisons of floating modules with or without prestressing steels it is observed that total material costs generally decrease with smaller slab wall thickness values the prestressing steel amount is reduced to the extent that the 24 cell hexagonal module does not require any prestressing steel to satisfy the stress check however the 24 cell hexagonal module becomes too complex for construction on the other hand for the rectangular modules the cost for the 4 cell rectangular module is slightly higher than that of the 2 cell rectangular module for the optimal solution to be achieved similar slab and wall thicknesses are adopted for both models which results in more reinforced concrete being used for the 4 cell rectangular module in summary the 2 cell rectangular module and the 6 cell hexagonal module give the most economical solution hence the prestressed concrete 2 cell rectangular module and prestressed concrete 6 cell hexagonal module both with 150 mm thick walls and slabs are preferable structural solutions as they satisfy the allowable stress check and are the most economical design these two modular structures will be selected to compose large floating structures and further analysis the hydroelastic responses which will be described in the next section 4 hydroelastic response of interconnected floating structures when the entire floating structure is assembled with modular units load situations will become more complex than those shown in fig 7 particularly for floating structures with larger horizontal dimensions compared to the depth and the ocean wavelength the hydroelastic responses are of concern because the flexural rigidity is relatively small and the elastic deformations are more important than the rigid body motions wang and tay 2011a b fig 17 presents a conceptual design for large floating structures the mooring dolphin system is constructed to restrain horizontal movement of the structure but allow the vlfs to move up and down freely in this section hydroelastic responses of modular floating structures under regular waves in singapore coastal water with water depth h 20 m are discussed 4 1 methodology of hydroelastic analysis fig 18 depicts the box like vlfs with the length of l the width of b and the height of h the structure is subject to an incident wave with velocity potential φ i a circular frequency ω wavelength λ wave height 2a and wave angle θ with respect to x axis for simplicity and considering only global responses of the structure the detailed vlfs model is usually replaced with an equivalent solid mindlin plate by keeping the geometric dimensions the same as the actual structure but the density ρ and young s modulus e of the equivalent plate are tweaked to match the vibration modes and natural frequencies of the actual structure the equivalent plate is assumed to be flat with free edges which is restrained by the station keeping system in the x y plane the simplification of equivalent mindlin plate have been validated by comparing hydroelastic responses with experimental test results tay et al 2009 utsunomiya et al 1998 wang and tay 2011a b moveover this approach has been successfully implemented in the analysis and design of marina bay floating performance stage in singapore wang and wang 2015 the hybrid be fe numerical approach is used to perform hydroelastic analyses in the frequency domain where the finite element method is used to handle the equation of motion of the floating plate while the boundary element method is to solve the laplace equation and the boundary conditions for the fluid part the use of line connection is located at x c from the fore of the vlfs as shown in fig 18 which are indicated by cyan shaded strips the governing equations of motion for the mindlin plate after omitting the time factor e i ω t are as follows 1 κ 2 g h 2 w x 2 2 w y 2 ψ x x ψ y y ω 2 ρ p h w p x y 2 d 1 ν 2 2 ψ x x 2 2 ψ x y 2 1 ν 2 2 ψ x x 2 2 ψ y x y κ

rotation ψ x x y about the y axis and the rotation ψ y x y about the x axis κ 2 is the shear correction factor taken as 5 6 g e 2 1 ν is the shear modulus d eh 3 12 1 ν 2 is the flexural rigidity ω is the circular frequency of the incident wave and p x y is the water pressure comprising the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic pressure expressed as p x y i ω ρ w φ x y 0 ρ w g w ρ w is the mass density of water g is the gravitational acceleration and φ x y 0 is the velocity potential of water the boundary conditions of the mindlin plate with free edges require that the bending moments twisting moments and shear forces must vanish at the edges which are expressed as follows 4 bending moment m n n d ψ n n ν ψ s s 0 5 t w i s t i n g m o m e n t m n s d 1 ν 2 ψ n s ψ s n 0 6 s h e a r f o r c e q n κ

the bending moment about y axis is zero k r 0 for a rigid connection k r the continuity requirements given in eqs 7 11 are implemented into plate elements at the connection locations using the penalty method gao et al 2011 according to the penalty method if two points along the x direction in the fe discretized model are connected to each other via a linear spring with rotational stiffness k r the global stiffness k needs to be modified as follows 12 k l 3 l 3 new k l 3 l 3 k r 13 k k 3 k 3 new k k 3 k 3 k r 14 k k 3 l 3 new k k 3 l 3 k r 15 k l 3 k 3 new k l 3 k 3 k r where the stiffness matrix k is obtained by following the standard finite element procedure the subscript new indicates the stiffness matrix that accounts for the connections between the lth node and the kth node l 3 and k 3 indicate the degrees of fredoom corresponding to the rotations about y axis at the lth node and the kth node for other degrees of fredoom at the two nodes a similar modification of the stiffness matrix is made but for k r the seawater is assumed to be an ideal fluid that is inviscid and incompressible and the flow is irrotational so that the water motion can be modelled by a velocity potential with these assumptions the linear wave theory can be adopted for modelling fluid motions according to this theory the velocity potential φ must satisfy the following laplace s equation and boundary conditions 16 2 φ x y z 0 i n w a t e r d o m a i n 17 φ z x y 0 i ω w x y o n w e t t e d s u r f a c e 18 φ z x y 0 ω 2 g φ x y 0 o n f r e e s u r f a c e 19 φ z x y h 0 o n s e a b e d 20

the second kind and r is the horizontal distance between x and ξ in the computation of the coupled plate water motion the governing equation for the equivalent mindlin plate is solved using the standard fe method the floating plate is discretized into a finite number of 8 node mindlin plate elements as shown in fig 19 a note that 8 node mindlin plate elements are able to provide more accurate results as compared to the 4 node elements as their shape functions are of higher order tay et al 2007 for the fluid domain only the wetted surface s hb needs to be discritized into elements according to the boundary element method procedure the hydroelastic responses computed from the hybrid fe be method were found to be in very good agreement with experimental test results details of numerical implementation and validation of the numerical results are given in nguyen et al and wang et al s work nguyen et al 2018 nguyen and wang 2020 wang and tay 2011a b and are not presented again in this paper for brevity 4 2 response of large floating structures composed of rectangular modules fig 20 shows the dimensions of floating structures to be analyzed selected floating structures are composed of rectangular modules 30 m 15 m 5 m with aspect ratios ranging from 1 0 to 4 0 the regular incoming wave periods vary from 2 s to 20 s and three incident wave directions of 0 45 and 90 are considered in the analysis fig 21 presents hydroelastic responses of the large floating structure 120 m 60 m in plan dimensions rigidly interconnected with rectangular floating modules in regular wave conditions with incident wave period of 8 s and wave angle of 0 symbol a in the y axis indicates the wave amplitude which is half of the wave height it is seen that the critical vertical deflections occur at the fore and aft while the maximum bending moment occurs in the mid span of the entire structure by capturing peak points of each case critical deflections and flexural stresses corresponding to different wave periods are inferred for rectangular and square floating structures as shown in figs 22 and 23 note that the flexural stress σ n is computed from σ n m n y i where m n is the bending moment y is the distance of the top bottom slab from the neutral axis and i is the area moment of inertia red blue and grey solid lines represent the hydroelastic responses when exposed to incident wave angles of 0 45 and 90 respectively it is evident that critical vertical deflections and flexural stresses vary with respect to the incident wave period and direction for rectangular floating structures 120 240 m 60 m maximum deflection occurs at a lower wave period in the beam sea condition as compared to head sea and oblique wave conditions while this phenomenon is not clearly observed in the square floating structure 120 m 120 m as for flexural stresses regular wave loads generally induce higher stress in the longitudinal direction than in the transverse direction for rectangular floating structures the maximum stress value usually increases with the aspect ratio and it can reach up to around 15 mpa when the aspect ratio is 4 0 which needs to be handled with caution in design also a longish floating structure may sustain larger bending loads as compared to a floating structure with a smaller length to width ratio in addition wave obliqueness may result in different stress distribution at corresponding critical incident wave period specifically maximum stresses occur at a lower wave period in the oblique wave condition than those in the head sea condition past research work showed that a large scale monolithic structure is subjected to enormous wave induced bending loads which may result in structural failure due to insufficient strength gao et al 2011 riggs and ertekin 1993 watanabe et al 2004 under such circumstances multi module floating structures with internal hinge connections may be used to reduce flexural stresses teng et al 2014 yoon et al 2014 zhao et al 2015 herein the hybrid be fe analyses with the consideration of hinge joints are also performed on the large floating structure composed of rectangular floating modules fig 24 shows vertical deflection and bending moment profiles of rectangular floating modules connected with hinge joints the dimensions of the entire structure and wave characteristics are identical to the case presented in fig 21 as compared to the rigid interconnected floating structure system the use of hinge joints can significantly reduce the moment magnitude and the maximum values occur at mid points between two hinges meanwhile the critical deflections take place at both free ends and hinge location and the critical values increase from 0 6 m to 1 5 m which might be not acceptable in practice therefore a trade off needs to be considered between internal loads and structure motions in the conceptual design of a floating structure system fig 25 and fig 26 compare the hydroelastic responses of hinge interconnected dash lines and rigid interconnected solid lines floating structures with different aspect ratios in general the existence of hinge joints significantly reduces the flexural stresses in both directions but increases the vertical deflections to some extent particularly maximum deflections of hinge connected structures occur at lower incident wave periods compared to those of rigid connected structures the variation of maximum deflection with the wave periods is quite similar among hinge connected structures with different aspect ratios which attributes to the same dimensions of individual modules for multi modular floating structures connected with hinges flexural stresses are quite small but deflections become significant in such a condition flexible connections with certain rotational stiffness values may be viable to balance the load and motion response of large floating structures 4 3 response of large floating structures composed of hexagonal modules fig 27 shows dimensions of three floating structures with hexagonal modular units in the hydroealstic analysis the same incident wave periods and obliqueness as described in section 4 2 are considered fig 28 presents the hydroelastic response of a specific floating structure 137 4 m 66 m rigidly interconnected with hexagonal modules in a head sea t 8s the deflection profile and magnitude are quite similar to those of rectangular floating structures 120 m 60 m as shown in fig 21 however moment concentration is observed at two longitudinal jagged edges formed by hexagonal modules resulting in much larger flexural stresses figs 29 and 30 compare the critical vertical deflection and bending moment between various floating structures composed of hexagonal modules dash lines and rectangular modules solid lines while deflection curves are similar to each other flexural stress magnitudes are much larger for hexagonal modular floating structures due to the concentration of moment at the jagged edges however the wave periods corresponding to the critical flexural stress values are almost the same for floating structures composed of rectangular and hexagonal shape modules the use of hinge joints is more complicated in hexagonal modular floating structures due to various layout of connecting lines and it will be discussed in future studies 5 conclusions and recommendations a variety of box like structural solutions are considered as alternatives for floating modules fe analysis approach was utilized to investigate the structural performance of various design alternatives and the effects of geometrical shapes cell numbers and slab thickness were investigated preliminary prestressing designs were further explored on the basis of the analysis results in addition material requirements for different configurations are compared to determine the most economical solution for concrete floating modular units also the global response of large floating structures comprising the recommended modular structures with different geometrical shapes was investigated by performing hydroelastic analysis with self developed hybrid be fe code based on the analysis results the following conclusions may be drawn 1 for box like structures the tensile stresses reduce with an increase in slab wall thickness and decrease of span length between two wall supports the existence of interior walls is beneficial in increasing the flexural rigidity and can therefore significantly reduce the tensile stresses except for 300 mm thick wall slab 6 cell hexagonal and 24 cell hexagonal module all box like modular structures calls for the provision of prestressing steels 2 based on close evaluations it is preferable to choose 150 mm thick wall slab 2 cell pc rectangular module and 150 mm thick wall slab 6 cell pc hexagonal module as preferable structural solutions although the material costs of 24 cell hexagonal module is the lowest among all box like structures its complex configuration makes the construction procedure time consuming and costly 3 the global hydroelastic response of floating structures comprising modular units varies with the aspect ratio and incident wave characteristics regular wave loads generally induce more significant flexural stresses in the longitudinal direction than those in the transverse direction and this should be handled with caution when the aspect ratio of the structure is large 4 the use of hinge joints can significantly reduce the bending moments but relatively increase the critical vertical deflections a trade off needs to be considered between internal loads and structure motions in the conceptual design of a floating structure system further studies on the exploration of optimal flexible connection stiffness values needs to be conducted to achieve economical large floating structure solutions with acceptable deflection and stress responses 5 moment concentration is observed at longitudinal jagged edges formed by hexagonal modules resulting in much larger flexural stresses it is suggested to adopt smooth shaped sides for the application of large floating structure systems credit authorship contribution statement d jiang

20806,large floating structures such as platforms breakwaters and piers have been constructed in many countries in coastal areas in a bid to increase land space due to construction ease and operational flexibility these facilities are commonly consisted of relatively small floating units that are subsequently connected on sea this paper first describes box like structural systems for concrete floating structures finite element fe analyses are then performed to assess the structural performance of concrete floating structures when subjected to self weight imposed live load hydrostatic pressure and buoyancy force the effects of geometrical shapes cell numbers and slab thickness on the structural performance of box like floating modules are investigated results indicate the need to provide prestressing steels so as to prevent cracking in the concrete modules besides material requirements for different configurations were compared to provide the most economical solution for box like concrete floating units furthermore global responses of modular multi purpose floating structures with different geometrical shapes were investigated via hydroelastic analyses using self developed hybrid boundary element be fe code global flexural stresses are found to be quite high for rigidly interconnected large floating structures due to regular wave loadings especially when the geometrical aspect ratio becomes large the use of hinge joints is effective in reducing bending moments but it relatively increases the vertical deflections a trade off should be considered between internal loads and structural motions in the conceptual design of large floating structure system keywords box like structure finite element analysis hydroelastic analysis modular multi purpose floating structures 1 introduction for many large urban cities there is a constant demand for more useable space to meet the developmental and economic needs of an ever increasing population in this respect the use of coastal sea space where available is a viable solution to address the issue of land scarcity the use of floating structures is preferable to the convetional land reclamation that involves dumping sands rocks into the sea this is because it is more environmentally friendly and less time consuming in construction jiang et al 2018 wang and wang 2015 moreover the self weight of floating structures is automatically balanced by the buoyancy force thus eliminating the need for massive and expensive foundations which in turn results in savings in material and construction costs in the past decades large floating structures such as platforms breakwaters piers and others have been constructed in many countries dai et al 2018 jiang et al 2017 2019 wan et al 2020 these facilities are commonly composed of relatively small floating modular units due to construction ease and operational flexibility it is of interest to determine viable and economical structural solutions for floating modules the floating modular unit generally acquires sufficient upward buoyancy force by means of voided compartments currently the applications of structural solutions and construction materials for floating modules vary from region to region back in 1980s yee developed the concrete honeycomb structural system as shown in fig 1 a and it has been applied in some engineering practices such as the rofomex floating dock and densit floating barge fernandez and pardo 2013 yee 2009 this system employs a honeycomb sandwich design consisting of vertical cylindrical cells aligned in rows and connected to each other by thin concrete walls the integration of precast concrete cylindrical components in combination with exterior side walls top slab and bottom slab provides exceptional structural stiffness and strength with less amount of concrete steel reinforcement and prestressing steels however the complex configuration of honeycomb structures generally makes the construction procedure time consuming and costly for military purposes the mobile offshore base mob was developed to accommodate take off and landing long rang cargo aircraft as shown in fig 2 lamas pardo et al 2015 mcallister 1997 ramsamooj and shugar 2002 rognaas et al 2001 several mob conceptual designs were proposed with using different materials such as steel concrete or a combination thereof fig 2b shows a semi submersible design of mob which consists of the concrete hull and steel topside rognaas et al 2001 performed a comprehensive finite element fe anlsyis on the invidual mob structure where shell elements were utilized and the wave loads were generated by the commercial software wadam and applied to the fe model however rognaas et al 2001 mentioned that the moment effects were not included in the fe analysis which may influence the evalution of concrete portions wong et al 2013 and dai et al 2020 studied the use of high density polyethylene hdpe for constructing the floating wetlands and the floating modular photovoltaic panel system respectively as shown in fig 3 local stresses of the floating module is analyzed with fe method where hdpe is treated as an isotropic material by simplifying the entire floating structure as an equivalent mindlin plate hydroelastic analyses were performed to examine the moment and shear strength capcities besides aforementioned structural solution alternatives floating modules can also be made as boxes with different geometries and cell numbers fig 4 a shows a rectangular box like floating modular unit in which the internal walls are used to increase the structural stiffness and reduce the flexural stresses in the top and bottom slabs the marina bay floating platform in singapore measures 120 m in length 83 m in width and 1 2 m in depth and was built by assembling steel rectangular box like modules wang and tay 2011a b focused on the hydroelastic analysis of the entire floating platform with assuming all the modules are connected rigidly but no detailed analysis of the individual floating module was reported koh and lim 2009 morris 1996 has filed a patent to show the conceptual design of an artificial prestressed concrete pc floating structure formed by a plurality of hexagonal and triangular cells as shown in fig 4b the hexagonal shape structure has been adopted by architects as a basic unit for conceptual designs of floating cities seasteading institute 2019 however no analysis work has been conducted to evaluate the structural performance of the pc hexagonal modules and the entire floating structutres engineering practices indicate that floating structures can be made of various materials however when properly designed and constructed under strict quality control concrete would be a preferred material for modular floating structures in the seawater environment because of some key advantages fernandez and pardo 2013 priedeman and anderson 1985 1 the use of concrete material generally results in a lower initial construction cost 2 concrete shows superior durability in the seawater environment which shall reduce the costs for maintenance inspection and repair 3 concrete structures have larger local and global stiffness and show better performances in withstanding accidental impact loads 4 large floating concrete structures can be assembled with precast components integrated by post tensioning p t tendons leading to an easier construction the concrete itself is a brittle material that is strong in compression but very weak in tension thus the analysis and design of concrete structures differ from structures made of isotropic materials additionally prestressing steels are commonly used to achieve reliable structural concrete designs and the degree of prestressings is often determined by counteracting the load effect of dominant actions such that no tensile stresses exist in the critical section up to present most scholars focused on hydroelastic response analysis of large floating structures to determine the global deflection and stresses considering the modular structure as a rigid unit fu et al 2007 loukogeorgaki et al 2012 limit research work on the structural behavior of the floating module itself was reported especially for the prestressed concrete modular floating structures in this paper the structural behaviour of concrete box like floating modules are evaluated using the fe analysis and the effects of geometrical shapes cell numbers and slab thickness are investigated besides material requirements for different configurations of box like structures are compared to determine the most economical solution for concrete floating modular units moreover global responses of large floating structures composed of selected modular structures with different geometrical shapes are investigated by performing hydroelastic analysis using a self developed hybrid boundary element be fe code last suggestions and recommendations on the design of modular floating structures are provided for the engineering practice 2 design alternatives for concrete floating modules considering the ease of construction and installation relatively small sizes of floating modules are selected in the conceptual designs for the rectangular module the length width and height are set as 30 m 15 m and 5 m respectively as a benchmark table 1 lists the plan dimensions of different geometrical shapes that have the same plan area as the benchmark rectangular shape it can be seen that the hexagonal shape has the smallest perimeter which indicates that it requires the least volume of concrete for the same wall thickness and height it should be mentioned that the listed possible shapes and sizes were chosen in the conceptual development based on a set of selection criteria which include the construability ease of connection preliminary structural and hydrodynamic performance and cost effectiveness ang et al 2020 ren et al 2019 nus and nus sintef 2019 in this study rectangular and hexagonal shapes will be selected for further structural evaluations table 2 lists all box like floating modules investigated in this study the variable parameters include geometrical shape cell numbers and wall slab thickness for the rectangular modules 1 cell 2 cell and 4 cell structures are considered for the hexagonal modules 1 cell 6 cell 7 cell and 24 cell structures are considered for each case the wall thickness and the top and bottom slab thickness are kept the same and varied as 150 mm 225 mm and 300 mm 3 structural analysis and prestressing design 3 1 finite element modelling in this study fe models are developed for different types of floating modules using the commercial software abaqus fig 5 shows fe models of representative box like floating modular structures solid element c3d8r was used in the analysis to model concrete structural components and the c3d8r element is a general purpose linear eight node solid element with three degrees of freedom at each node compared to the shell element the solid element can represent the structural geometries more realistically and allow reinforcing and non reinforcing steel elements to be easily embedded in the structure model at a later stage the mesh of each model was generated with evenly spaced nodes in plane and at least three nodes were uniformly distributed in the direction of slab thickness for the purpose of finding the optimum mesh size several models with different mesh sizes 100 mm 200 mm and 500 mm were investigated in one specific load case for the critical transverse path along the top slab in the 2 cell rectangular module fig 6 presents the flexural stress distributions along path 1 2 with different mesh sizes as the figure illustrates the computational results converged as the mesh size became smaller although the analyses demonstrated satisfactory outcomes could be achieved with the 200 mm mesh the finer 100 mm mesh was adopted as the additional modeling and computational effort was not significant both reinforcing and prestressing steels were modelled as truss elements t3d2 and embedded into the concrete section which assumes full bond interaction between two materials the floating modules are designed to remain in the linear elastic range of behavior at the serviceability limit state sls by using prestressed concrete as such a linear elastic model can be defined also the density of lightweight concrete was taken as 2000 kg m3 the floating modular structures are subjected to various actions under service conditions for example self weight hydrostatic pressures wave load current load wind load and others previous experience indicates that hydrostatic pressure generally contributes a major proportion of the action effects compared to the other actions therefore only the self weight imposed live load 5 kn m2 and hydrostatic pressures are taken into consideration in the fe analysis to evaluate the structural performance of different floating modules fig 7 depicts the load patterns applied on the floating module the hydrostatic pressures due to seawater are determined using p w ρ w g h w where the density of seawater ρ w is taken as 1025 kg m3 and h w is the seawater draft the hydrostatic pressure around the floating modular structure is automatically balanced because of the geometric asymmetry linear springs are attached beneath the base slab to simulate the upward buoyancy effects and also act as the boundary conditions which can automatically account for the varying pressure due to bottom slab deflections the spring constant for unit area of the bottom slab is taken as k s ρ g 10055 n m3 draft values for each floating module are determined by balancing the upward buoyancy force with downward load effects as shown in fig 7 it is observed from table 3 that draft values are slightly different for various floating modules which results from different magnitude due to self weight for each floating module stress distributions are extracted to check the allowable stress limits at sls and the necessity for prestressing steels is evaluated 3 2 analysis results flexural stress distributions are taken along different paths of box like structures to identify the critical stress values and evaluate the requirement for prestressing steels fig 8 shows the three paths 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 9 10 11 12 taken in the longitudinal transverse and vertical directions respectively for rectangular box like modular units paths are purposely selected at the middle section between two adjacent supports where the maximum stresses are expected fig 9 presents paths for stress evaluation in hexagonal box like modular units the paths 1 2 3 4 and 5 6 7 8 are taken along the short and long side of both the top and bottom slabs while path 9 10 is taken along a side wall 3 2 1 rectangular modular units fig 10 shows typical flexural stress distributions for a 2 cell module the red blue and grey lines are for modular units with slab and wall thickness of 150 mm 225 mm and 300 mm respectively the positive values indicate tensile stresses while the negative values indicate compressive stresses it can be seen that the top and bottom slabs of all modules deflect inwards while side walls bulge outwards which can be attributed to the large intensity of downward imposed live load and upward buoyancy effects the flexural stresses reduce with the increase in slab wall thickness and cell numbers which attributes to the larger plate flexural rigidity and shorter span length between adjacent internal walls for different modular structures the maximum stress in the top and bottom slabs always occurs along paths 1 2 and 3 4 between two adjacent supports which is due to one way action of the slabs having a length width ratio more than 2 fig 11 presents the maximum tensile and compressive stresses for different cell numbers and slab wall thicknesses the compressive stresses are generally within the allowable compressive stress f cd 30 mpa for c45 55 however the tensile stresses at critical locations exceed the allowable tensile stress f ctd 1 80 mpa for c45 55 which necessitates the provision of prestressing steels to reduce the tensile stresses note that the design compressive and tensile stress limits are determined by f c d α c c f c k γ c and f c t d α c t f c k 0 05 γ c based on eurocode en 1992 1 1 where α c c and γ c are taken as 1 0 and 1 5 respectively it is worth mentioning that negative moments exist at locations of end and interior wall supports resulting in high tensile stresses but these can be mitigated by chamfering technique at the joints 3 2 2 hexagonal modular units fig 12 shows the flexural stress distributions along various paths for a 6 cell module representative of hexagonal modular units the legend for the colored lines and stress sign convention are the same with fig 10 similar to rectangular modules the top and bottom slabs are found to deflect inwards while side walls bulge outwards smaller stress magnitudes are observed with increased slab wall thicknesses and relatively shorter spans between adjacent vertical wall supports fig 13 presents the maximum tensile and compressive stress values in different hexagonal floating modules with different cell numbers and slab wall thicknesses an interesting phenomenon is that the stress magnitude of the 7 cell module is larger than that of 6 cell module which can be attributed to a relatively larger span in the inner hexagon compressive stresses are generally within the allowable compressive stress f cd 30 mpa for c45 55 maximum tensile stresses of only four cases that is 6 cell 300 mm and 24 cell 150 225 300 mm satisfy the design tensile stress limit f ctd 1 80 mpa for c45 55 it is concluded that the prestressing steels are generally needed for most hexagonal floating modules specifically no necessity for prestressing steels in the 24 cell module is attributed to a much shorter span in the inner hexagon but its complex configuration makes the construction procedure time consuming and costly 3 3 preliminary design of prestressing steels in order to counteract the tensile stresses prestressing steels are applied in the box like floating modules to keep the concrete at an uncracked state when the prestressing steels are embedded inside the modular structures the generated compression effect is considered to be uniform across the thickness of thin slabs and walls the amounts of prestressing steels can be simply designed to counteract the tensile stresses according to the equation σ t t h a p s f p s where σ t is the tensile stress that needs to be eliminated t is the slab wall thickness h is the unit slab wall width taken as 1000 mm a p s is the required areas of prestressing steels per metre width f p s is the effective stress after considering prestressing losses taken as 1100 mpa design parameters for prestressed concrete floating modules are based on the standard practice the concrete grade is specified to be c45 55 and the allowable compressive stress f cd and the allowable compressive stress f ctd are 30 mpa and 1 80 mpa respectively the standard prestressing steels used herein is 12 7 mm diameter low relaxation strands with the ultimate strength f pu of 1860 mpa in order to achieve an economical design the amounts of prestressing steels are designed differently for side walls top slab and bottom slab according to the tensile stress magnitudes fe analysis was also performed on the modular structures after prestressing steels are incorporated in the abaqus program prestressing steels were modelled as truss elements and embedded in concrete solid elements figs 14 and 15 show the stress distribution of 2 cell rectangular and 6 cell hexagonal box like modules after applying the prestressing steels it is observed that the stress curves shift towards the compression side and all tensile stresses have been balanced by the prestressing forces 3 4 evaluation of various design alternatives based on the preliminary prestressing designs material costs for various design alternatives are determined in the calculation the cost of concrete is taken as sgd 135 per m3 while the cost of steel is taken as sgd 900 per tonne fig 16 shows the cost comparisons of floating modules with or without prestressing steels it is observed that total material costs generally decrease with smaller slab wall thickness values the prestressing steel amount is reduced to the extent that the 24 cell hexagonal module does not require any prestressing steel to satisfy the stress check however the 24 cell hexagonal module becomes too complex for construction on the other hand for the rectangular modules the cost for the 4 cell rectangular module is slightly higher than that of the 2 cell rectangular module for the optimal solution to be achieved similar slab and wall thicknesses are adopted for both models which results in more reinforced concrete being used for the 4 cell rectangular module in summary the 2 cell rectangular module and the 6 cell hexagonal module give the most economical solution hence the prestressed concrete 2 cell rectangular module and prestressed concrete 6 cell hexagonal module both with 150 mm thick walls and slabs are preferable structural solutions as they satisfy the allowable stress check and are the most economical design these two modular structures will be selected to compose large floating structures and further analysis the hydroelastic responses which will be described in the next section 4 hydroelastic response of interconnected floating structures when the entire floating structure is assembled with modular units load situations will become more complex than those shown in fig 7 particularly for floating structures with larger horizontal dimensions compared to the depth and the ocean wavelength the hydroelastic responses are of concern because the flexural rigidity is relatively small and the elastic deformations are more important than the rigid body motions wang and tay 2011a b fig 17 presents a conceptual design for large floating structures the mooring dolphin system is constructed to restrain horizontal movement of the structure but allow the vlfs to move up and down freely in this section hydroelastic responses of modular floating structures under regular waves in singapore coastal water with water depth h 20 m are discussed 4 1 methodology of hydroelastic analysis fig 18 depicts the box like vlfs with the length of l the width of b and the height of h the structure is subject to an incident wave with velocity potential φ i a circular frequency ω wavelength λ wave height 2a and wave angle θ with respect to x axis for simplicity and considering only global responses of the structure the detailed vlfs model is usually replaced with an equivalent solid mindlin plate by keeping the geometric dimensions the same as the actual structure but the density ρ and young s modulus e of the equivalent plate are tweaked to match the vibration modes and natural frequencies of the actual structure the equivalent plate is assumed to be flat with free edges which is restrained by the station keeping system in the x y plane the simplification of equivalent mindlin plate have been validated by comparing hydroelastic responses with experimental test results tay et al 2009 utsunomiya et al 1998 wang and tay 2011a b moveover this approach has been successfully implemented in the analysis and design of marina bay floating performance stage in singapore wang and wang 2015 the hybrid be fe numerical approach is used to perform hydroelastic analyses in the frequency domain where the finite element method is used to handle the equation of motion of the floating plate while the boundary element method is to solve the laplace equation and the boundary conditions for the fluid part the use of line connection is located at x c from the fore of the vlfs as shown in fig 18 which are indicated by cyan shaded strips the governing equations of motion for the mindlin plate after omitting the time factor e i ω t are as follows 1 κ 2 g h 2 w x 2 2 w y 2 ψ x x ψ y y ω 2 ρ p h w p x y 2 d 1 ν 2 2 ψ x x 2 2 ψ x y 2 1 ν 2 2 ψ x x 2 2 ψ y x y κ

rotation ψ x x y about the y axis and the rotation ψ y x y about the x axis κ 2 is the shear correction factor taken as 5 6 g e 2 1 ν is the shear modulus d eh 3 12 1 ν 2 is the flexural rigidity ω is the circular frequency of the incident wave and p x y is the water pressure comprising the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic pressure expressed as p x y i ω ρ w φ x y 0 ρ w g w ρ w is the mass density of water g is the gravitational acceleration and φ x y 0 is the velocity potential of water the boundary conditions of the mindlin plate with free edges require that the bending moments twisting moments and shear forces must vanish at the edges which are expressed as follows 4 bending moment m n n d ψ n n ν ψ s s 0 5 t w i s t i n g m o m e n t m n s d 1 ν 2 ψ n s ψ s n 0 6 s h e a r f o r c e q n κ

the bending moment about y axis is zero k r 0 for a rigid connection k r the continuity requirements given in eqs 7 11 are implemented into plate elements at the connection locations using the penalty method gao et al 2011 according to the penalty method if two points along the x direction in the fe discretized model are connected to each other via a linear spring with rotational stiffness k r the global stiffness k needs to be modified as follows 12 k l 3 l 3 new k l 3 l 3 k r 13 k k 3 k 3 new k k 3 k 3 k r 14 k k 3 l 3 new k k 3 l 3 k r 15 k l 3 k 3 new k l 3 k 3 k r where the stiffness matrix k is obtained by following the standard finite element procedure the subscript new indicates the stiffness matrix that accounts for the connections between the lth node and the kth node l 3 and k 3 indicate the degrees of fredoom corresponding to the rotations about y axis at the lth node and the kth node for other degrees of fredoom at the two nodes a similar modification of the stiffness matrix is made but for k r the seawater is assumed to be an ideal fluid that is inviscid and incompressible and the flow is irrotational so that the water motion can be modelled by a velocity potential with these assumptions the linear wave theory can be adopted for modelling fluid motions according to this theory the velocity potential φ must satisfy the following laplace s equation and boundary conditions 16 2 φ x y z 0 i n w a t e r d o m a i n 17 φ z x y 0 i ω w x y o n w e t t e d s u r f a c e 18 φ z x y 0 ω 2 g φ x y 0 o n f r e e s u r f a c e 19 φ z x y h 0 o n s e a b e d 20

dispersion equation ktanh kh ω 2 g and the wavelength λ can be obtained by λ 2π k by applying the green s second identity to the laplace s equation and the boundary conditions we obtain the following boundary integral equation nguyen et al 2018 21 φ x φ i x s h b g x ξ ω 2 g φ ξ i ω w ξ d ξ where x and ξ are the source point and the field point for water of finite depth g x ξ is the free surface

the second kind and r is the horizontal distance between x and ξ in the computation of the coupled plate water motion the governing equation for the equivalent mindlin plate is solved using the standard fe method the floating plate is discretized into a finite number of 8 node mindlin plate elements as shown in fig 19 a note that 8 node mindlin plate elements are able to provide more accurate results as compared to the 4 node elements as their shape functions are of higher order tay et al 2007 for the fluid domain only the wetted surface s hb needs to be discritized into elements according to the boundary element method procedure the hydroelastic responses computed from the hybrid fe be method were found to be in very good agreement with experimental test results details of numerical implementation and validation of the numerical results are given in nguyen et al and wang et al s work nguyen et al 2018 nguyen and wang 2020 wang and tay 2011a b and are not presented again in this paper for brevity 4 2 response of large floating structures composed of rectangular modules fig 20 shows the dimensions of floating structures to be analyzed selected floating structures are composed of rectangular modules 30 m 15 m 5 m with aspect ratios ranging from 1 0 to 4 0 the regular incoming wave periods vary from 2 s to 20 s and three incident wave directions of 0 45 and 90 are considered in the analysis fig 21 presents hydroelastic responses of the large floating structure 120 m 60 m in plan dimensions rigidly interconnected with rectangular floating modules in regular wave conditions with incident wave period of 8 s and wave angle of 0 symbol a in the y axis indicates the wave amplitude which is half of the wave height it is seen that the critical vertical deflections occur at the fore and aft while the maximum bending moment occurs in the mid span of the entire structure by capturing peak points of each case critical deflections and flexural stresses corresponding to different wave periods are inferred for rectangular and square floating structures as shown in figs 22 and 23 note that the flexural stress σ n is computed from σ n m n y i where m n is the bending moment y is the distance of the top bottom slab from the neutral axis and i is the area moment of inertia red blue and grey solid lines represent the hydroelastic responses when exposed to incident wave angles of 0 45 and 90 respectively it is evident that critical vertical deflections and flexural stresses vary with respect to the incident wave period and direction for rectangular floating structures 120 240 m 60 m maximum deflection occurs at a lower wave period in the beam sea condition as compared to head sea and oblique wave conditions while this phenomenon is not clearly observed in the square floating structure 120 m 120 m as for flexural stresses regular wave loads generally induce higher stress in the longitudinal direction than in the transverse direction for rectangular floating structures the maximum stress value usually increases with the aspect ratio and it can reach up to around 15 mpa when the aspect ratio is 4 0 which needs to be handled with caution in design also a longish floating structure may sustain larger bending loads as compared to a floating structure with a smaller length to width ratio in addition wave obliqueness may result in different stress distribution at corresponding critical incident wave period specifically maximum stresses occur at a lower wave period in the oblique wave condition than those in the head sea condition past research work showed that a large scale monolithic structure is subjected to enormous wave induced bending loads which may result in structural failure due to insufficient strength gao et al 2011 riggs and ertekin 1993 watanabe et al 2004 under such circumstances multi module floating structures with internal hinge connections may be used to reduce flexural stresses teng et al 2014 yoon et al 2014 zhao et al 2015 herein the hybrid be fe analyses with the consideration of hinge joints are also performed on the large floating structure composed of rectangular floating modules fig 24 shows vertical deflection and bending moment profiles of rectangular floating modules connected with hinge joints the dimensions of the entire structure and wave characteristics are identical to the case presented in fig 21 as compared to the rigid interconnected floating structure system the use of hinge joints can significantly reduce the moment magnitude and the maximum values occur at mid points between two hinges meanwhile the critical deflections take place at both free ends and hinge location and the critical values increase from 0 6 m to 1 5 m which might be not acceptable in practice therefore a trade off needs to be considered between internal loads and structure motions in the conceptual design of a floating structure system fig 25 and fig 26 compare the hydroelastic responses of hinge interconnected dash lines and rigid interconnected solid lines floating structures with different aspect ratios in general the existence of hinge joints significantly reduces the flexural stresses in both directions but increases the vertical deflections to some extent particularly maximum deflections of hinge connected structures occur at lower incident wave periods compared to those of rigid connected structures the variation of maximum deflection with the wave periods is quite similar among hinge connected structures with different aspect ratios which attributes to the same dimensions of individual modules for multi modular floating structures connected with hinges flexural stresses are quite small but deflections become significant in such a condition flexible connections with certain rotational stiffness values may be viable to balance the load and motion response of large floating structures 4 3 response of large floating structures composed of hexagonal modules fig 27 shows dimensions of three floating structures with hexagonal modular units in the hydroealstic analysis the same incident wave periods and obliqueness as described in section 4 2 are considered fig 28 presents the hydroelastic response of a specific floating structure 137 4 m 66 m rigidly interconnected with hexagonal modules in a head sea t 8s the deflection profile and magnitude are quite similar to those of rectangular floating structures 120 m 60 m as shown in fig 21 however moment concentration is observed at two longitudinal jagged edges formed by hexagonal modules resulting in much larger flexural stresses figs 29 and 30 compare the critical vertical deflection and bending moment between various floating structures composed of hexagonal modules dash lines and rectangular modules solid lines while deflection curves are similar to each other flexural stress magnitudes are much larger for hexagonal modular floating structures due to the concentration of moment at the jagged edges however the wave periods corresponding to the critical flexural stress values are almost the same for floating structures composed of rectangular and hexagonal shape modules the use of hinge joints is more complicated in hexagonal modular floating structures due to various layout of connecting lines and it will be discussed in future studies 5 conclusions and recommendations a variety of box like structural solutions are considered as alternatives for floating modules fe analysis approach was utilized to investigate the structural performance of various design alternatives and the effects of geometrical shapes cell numbers and slab thickness were investigated preliminary prestressing designs were further explored on the basis of the analysis results in addition material requirements for different configurations are compared to determine the most economical solution for concrete floating modular units also the global response of large floating structures comprising the recommended modular structures with different geometrical shapes was investigated by performing hydroelastic analysis with self developed hybrid be fe code based on the analysis results the following conclusions may be drawn 1 for box like structures the tensile stresses reduce with an increase in slab wall thickness and decrease of span length between two wall supports the existence of interior walls is beneficial in increasing the flexural rigidity and can therefore significantly reduce the tensile stresses except for 300 mm thick wall slab 6 cell hexagonal and 24 cell hexagonal module all box like modular structures calls for the provision of prestressing steels 2 based on close evaluations it is preferable to choose 150 mm thick wall slab 2 cell pc rectangular module and 150 mm thick wall slab 6 cell pc hexagonal module as preferable structural solutions although the material costs of 24 cell hexagonal module is the lowest among all box like structures its complex configuration makes the construction procedure time consuming and costly 3 the global hydroelastic response of floating structures comprising modular units varies with the aspect ratio and incident wave characteristics regular wave loads generally induce more significant flexural stresses in the longitudinal direction than those in the transverse direction and this should be handled with caution when the aspect ratio of the structure is large 4 the use of hinge joints can significantly reduce the bending moments but relatively increase the critical vertical deflections a trade off needs to be considered between internal loads and structure motions in the conceptual design of a floating structure system further studies on the exploration of optimal flexible connection stiffness values needs to be conducted to achieve economical large floating structure solutions with acceptable deflection and stress responses 5 moment concentration is observed at longitudinal jagged edges formed by hexagonal modules resulting in much larger flexural stresses it is suggested to adopt smooth shaped sides for the application of large floating structure systems credit authorship contribution statement d jiang

process 1 introduction the electric submersible pump esp is of great importance in the oil and gas industry due to its ability to pump high volumes of fluids over long distances takacs 2018 the system used in onshore and offshore units is installed inside or near oil wells so that any type of maintenance has a very high cost in terms of time financial resources and lost profit therefore interventions are performed only when the system fails taking in consideration the high investments that are made in this type of equipment including design assembly costs construction intervention and outage production loss when it fails it is crucial that the system remains in operation as long as possible minette et al 2016 therefore it is very important to know with greater reliability the dynamic behavior of esp therefore the integration tests are the last chance to verify the performance and integrity of the esp set before carrying out a deepwater installation operation that costs thousands of dollars a day due to the possibility of mechanical failure in the esp sets during the integration tests vibration analysis and fault identification methodologies are being proposed to identify the most common faults prematurely before they lead to catastrophic damage the methodology presented in this work is included within this effort the esp set is completely assembled installed and tested in a test well to assess its performance and reliability these tests comprise a series of operating conditions as close as possible to the real operating conditions in the production wells but considering only single phase flow and with water as a working fluid during these integration tests vibration signals are recorded with a limited number of accelerometers installed in the esp s housing but following the recommendations of the standards related to the vibration analysis of this type of equipment api 2012 1997 foresti et al 2016 minette et al 2016 vibration monitoring of these systems is important because they provide relevant information regarding possible failures that are happening during its operation however continuous monitoring throughout the esp housing can be difficult if not impossible due to the limited number of available accelerometers and in addition to having little or no accessibility to the places most at risk of failure mendonça et al 2019 qu 2004 for example in the esp s bearings regions one of the ways to know the dynamic behavior of the esp set is to estimate the modal parameters natural frequencies damping ratios and mode shapes through the operational modal analysis however the limited number of available accelerometers leads to lack of spatial resolution to represent all modal shapes in the frequency range of interest in this sense an alternative is the use of reduced finite element fe models appropriately adjusted or calibrated through experimental data friswell and mottershead 1996 qu 2004 to estimate the esp s modal parameters castillo et al 2019 and huamani et al 2017 used vibration data from impact tests and time and frequency domain techniques those authors developed an fe model of the esp to compare numerical with experimental modal parameters in the frequency range from 0 to 100 hz and they noted that there are several mode shapes within the esp s operating region from 30 to 62 hz the main reason for optimizing or adjust the modal model of an fe model is because it does not always represent the actual structure properly since it does not consider manufacturing and assembly errors chen et al 2018 qu 2004 however the optimization process which allows to minimize the differences between the experimental and the numerical models cannot be carried out directly due to the great difference in the number of degrees of freedom dofs friswell and mottershead 1996 so to assure dofs compatibility methods of model reduction must be used which can be done in the modal domains friswell and mottershead 1996 qu 2004 after the optimization or adjustment or smoothing of the reduced numerical model modal expansion of the experimental modes can be carried out to other dofs of interest especially for those close to locations with greater probability of failure this methodology has been widely used in a diverse range of mechanical and civil structures both in scale models and in real structures brincker et al 2015 iliopoulos et al 2016 tarpø et al 2020 in addition expanded modal shapes can be used to predict vibration levels in non instrumented locations without the need to use natural frequencies and damping ratios maes et al 2016 mayes et al 2020 rim et al 2014 in this context aiming to contribute to the vibration analysis of the esp set vibration measurements obtained during the integration tests are used to build an calibrated modal model that can be used i for optimal placement of virtual accelerometers for each test condition since it is almost impossible to relocate the actual accelerometers installed in the esp set due to the high costs involved in the integration tests ii to predict vibration responses anywhere in the esp s housing in this work it will be only presented the methodology for the construction of the calibrated esp s modal model to this end a fe model of an esp set model p 18 62stg was reduced using the equivalent reduction and expansion process serep o callahan and li 1996 besides the enhanced frequency domain decomposition efdd technique was used to estimate the modal parameters huamani et al 2017 from impact test data and used to build up the experimental modal model then the experimental modes were smoothed using the proposed local correspondence principle of modes and modal coordinates lcmc which is an extension of the local correspondence principle brincker et al 2014 and allows a better choice for the serep reduced modes and experimental degrees of freedom which corresponds to the accelerometers position in the esp s housing to assess the level of correlation between the smoothed experimental modal matrix and the original experimental modal matrix the modal assurance criteria mac was used ewins 2000 mendonça et al 2019 qu 2004 finally using the smoothed experimental modal matrix a modal expansion from 56 dofs not measured along the esp s casing were carried out 2 theoretical background the use of experimental data to calibrate fe model brings the challenge of dealing with the large difference between the experimental degrees of freedom dofs that is the accelerometers used in the measurement and the fe numerical dofs to overcome this difficulty model reduction techniques are used in order to make the number of degrees of freedom compatible without losing the dynamic characteristics of the system being studied the following are the theoretical foundations used in the process of smoothing and expanding the esp s experimental modal matrix 2 1 system equivalent reduction and expansion process serep this method was developed in the modal domain o callahan and li 1996 and allows the reduction of the fe model to a few degrees of freedom without changing its dynamic characteristics therefore from the general equation of motion we have 2 1 m x t k x t f t where m and k are the mass and stiffness matrices respectively f t is the load vector acting on the system x t and x t are the displacement and acceleration response vectors the solution of eq 2 1 can be performed using the modal truncation technique and considering p modes in the modal superposition o callahan and li 1996 paultre 2011 qu 2004 therefore 2 2 x t φ p q p t where φ p and q p t are the modal matrix and the modal coordinates for the p modes considered respectively for the reduction the total degrees of freedom of the complete model can be divided into two groups active a and deleted d therefore eq 2 2 can be rewritten as follows 2 3 x t x a t x d t φ a p t φ d p t q p t eq 2 3 shows that the responses to the active degrees of freedom x a t can be calculated considering only the degrees of freedom in the modal matrix φ a p t it is also noted that φ a p t it is generally not a square matrix depends on the number of degrees of freedom and modes considered however the serep method considers that the number of active degrees of freedom m is greater than the number of modes considered in the modal superposition p qu 2004 therefore eq 2 3 can be placed in normal form projecting this equation as 2 4 y p t φ a p t x a t replacing eq 2 3 in eq 2 4 2 5 y p t φ a p t φ a p q p t where q p t is an approximate solution of q p t and can be calculated by manipulating the eq 2 5 2 6 q p t φ a p t φ a p 1 y p t replacing eq 2 4 in eq 2 6 yields 2 7 x d t r x a t r φ d p φ a p where r is the condensation matrix of the serep and φ a p is the pseudo inverse of the modal matrix in the active degrees of freedom in addition the transformation matrix t can be calculated by replacing the eq 2 4 in eq 2 3 2 8 t φ p φ a p φ a p φ a p φ d p φ a p therefore the reduced stiffness k r and mass m r matrices can be calculated using the eq 2 9 2 9 k r t t k t m r t t m t equations 2 1 2 9 were included because they represent the theoretical formulation required in the process of reducing the esp s fe modal model from 21838 dofs to 64 dofs strictly speaking the reduced modal matrix contains 64 modes and 64 dofs 2 2 principle of local correspondence of modes and modal coordinates lcmc the smoothing of the experimental mode shapes can be interpreted as a fitting process since the numerical model is adjusted to the characteristics of the real structure reducing the uncertainty between the numerical and the experimental models the lcmc method proposed by the authors is an extension of the lc method brincker et al 2014 which is derived from the sensitivity equations of the mode shapes and is based on the consideration that a variation in a given mode shape is mainly due to a linear combination of the nearby modes tarpø et al 2020 the subset of numeric modes b φ used in smoothing is defined according to the lc whose criterion for selecting modes considers a ranking in frequency between the mode to be calibrated and the closest modes the subset b φ it is assembled by including modes one at a time from this ranking with each new iteration the optimal number of modes in b φ is obtained by maximizing the mac value in relation to the degrees of freedom chosen for this purpose brincker et al 2014 considering that each mode shape φ obtained experimentally can be expressed as a linear combination of a subset of numeric modes b φ yields 2 10 φ b φ z where z is the vector of adjustment coefficients for each numerical mode present in b φ this linear combination vector can be calculated according to eq 2 11 2 11 z ˆ b φ n φ where b φ is the pseudo inverse of b φ finally the smoothed experimental mode φ ˆ is defined through the following eq 2 12 2 12 φ ˆ b φ z ˆ in order to complement the lc aiming at avoiding overfitting the experimental modes the lcmc allows in addition to choose the optimal set of measured degrees of freedom to be used in the smoothing process looking at mac maximization the selection of degrees of freedom at each iteration during the smoothing process is done by using a combinatorial analysis according to eq 2 13 2 13 n c i m r m r i m r i where r 2 in eq 2 13 n m r e i represent the number of possible combinations the number of measured degrees of freedom used in the fitting process fitting dofs the number of measured degrees of freedom used to verify the fit observation dofs and the number of iterations respectively in this way the choice of degrees of freedom that have greater relevance in smoothing a given mode allow to maximize the mac and avoiding overfitting fig 1 presents a flowchart of the optimization process used by the lcmc 2 3 modal assurance criteria mac it is a simple way of correlating two mode shapes when examining their linear dependencies and verifying the modal similarity between them it is calculated as 2 14 m a c φ a φ b φ a t φ b 2 φ a t φ a φ b t φ b where φ a and φ b are the a and b mode shapes respectively mac value close to 1 indicates that the two modes are well correlated that is the modes are equal and values close to 0 suggest that the modes are not correlated that is they are orthogonal qu 2004 3 experimental setup the vibration tests were performed during the integration tests which are carried out to assess the performance and reliability of the esp before being installed in a real production well the integration tests comprise in short the following conditions foresti et al 2016 the esp set is completely assembled and installed in a test well including the bottom sensor the variable speed drive vsd and its respective power cable which can vary from 5 to 20 km the esp set model p 18 62stg was installed in a test well as shown in fig 2 a vsd tests must comply with iec 61800 4 and flow and pressure tests must comply with api rp 11s2 api 1997 the purpose of integration tests is to evaluate the performance of esp under simulated conditions analogous to the real operating conditions the tests are carried out in two stages 1 with vsd speed variation from 40 to 60 hz and in various operating conditions minimum flow best efficient point and maximum flow 2 72 hours endurance test operating with vsd at 60 hz although the real operation of esp is with two phase oil and water or three phase oil water and gas flow integration tests are carried out only with water in all tested cases the vibration signals are used for fault detection and comparison with the limits established by api 11s8 api 2012 the esp set was instrumented with 8 accelerometers in the y direction distributed among the pump casing the protecting seal and the electric motor identified from s1 to s8 according to fig 2b finally impact tests were performed and the vibration responses were recorded for further analysis castillo et al 2019 huamani et al 2017 minette et al 2016 fig 3 shows the accelerometer mounting process the esp set installation in the test well and the impact point the instrumentation used for vibration measurement of was as follows 8 icp accelerometers manufacturer pcb imi model 624b11 sensitivity of 100 mv g and operating range from 2 hz to 10 khz 1 impact hammer with rubber tip pcb 086d50 model data acquisition system manufacturer national instruments model ni 9233 and 1 rack ni 9178 4 numerical analysis the fe model used in this work was developed in a previous work castillo et al 2019 and took into account the following considerations complies with the structural characteristics of the project there are connections between the pump shaft and the housing at the bearing positions there is 1 bearing at every 5 stages the 62 stages were represented as lumped mass and distributed along the pump s shaft the esp set is filled with water and this mass has been distributed among the appropriate components the boundary condition considered was simply supported on the wellhead the interaction between the water and the esp in the well represented by the additional hydrodynamic mass was distributed throughout the esp s housing the fe model was developed in the ansys 18 2 software using the beam element with 2 node beam188 the complete fe model has 10919 nodes with 2 degrees of freedom each 1 translation and 1 rotation leading to 21838 dofs as explained in section 2 1 the serep method was used to reduce the fe model from 10919 nodes 21838 dofs to 64 nodes with 1 dof each then the 8 dofs coinciding with those considered experimentally were chosen in the process of smoothing the experimental modes 5 methodology fig 4 describes the methodology proposed to smooth and expand the esp s experimental mode shapes 6 results and discussions results will be presented in the following order i modal parameters estimation ii fe model reduction process and iii smoothing and expansion processes 6 1 modal parameter estimation as the impact signals were not registered only the vibration responses were available fig 5 and the enhanced frequency domain decomposition efdd algorithm were used huamani et al 2017 table 1 presents the results in the frequency range of 0 100 hz table 1 shows the 14 mode shapes identified in the frequency range of interest up to 100 hz it is also noted that the estimated damping ratios have high values which was already expected since the measurement noise is concentrated in this parameter and its subsequent use must be done with caution similarly mode shapes can also suffer from measurement noise effects to a minor extent fortunately this problem can be solved in the smoothing process the mode shapes amplitudes were estimated for each measured degree of freedom equivalent to the accelerometer s positions in the esp s housing resulting in an experimental modal matrix as can also be seen in table 1 there are 3 vibration modes 9 10 and 11 within the esp s operating range and operation near those natural frequencies can put the system in a resonance condition 6 2 fe model reduction process fig 6 shows the first 14 vibration modes of the full fe model with 21838 dofs and the corresponding natural frequencies are shown in table 1 when comparing the 14 experimental natural frequencies with those obtained by the complete fe model it was found that there is an average difference rms of 8 1 this result shows that the complete fe model mass and stiffness matrices should be updated before used for any purpose in this work the focus was on the correlation process between the numerical and the experimental modal model then serep was applied to reduce the complete fe model with 21838 dofs to 64 dofs strictly speaking the reduced modal matrix contains 64 modes and 64 dofs without losing the esp s dynamic characteristics as can be seen in table 2 the average rms difference in natural frequencies estimation using the complete fe model and the serep reduced model is 4 3 for the majority of natural frequencies the differences are close to zero only for the 1st natural frequency the difference was of 16 table 3 shows the comparison between the serep reduced and the experimental natural frequencies as can be seen there are only small differences solely in the 2nd vibration mode there was a difference greater than 10 which can be attributed to the simplifications adopted in the fe model development the average rms difference in natural frequencies was 6 9 and therefore it was concluded that there is a good agreement in addition by making a visual comparison between the mode shapes obtained with the complete fe model shown in fig 6 and those obtained by the reduced fe model shown in fig 7 it appears that there is a good coherence so it was concluded that the reduction process was satisfactory and results of the serep reduced model can be used to smooth and expand the experimental modal matrix 6 3 smoothing and expansion processes the principle of local correspondence of modes and modal coordinates lcmc is an extension of the local correspondence principle lc originally proposed by brincker et al 2014 the lc considers that each experimental mode shape can be smoothed by a linear combination of a set of fe mode shapes the goal is to select an optimum set of fe mode shapes that leads to a smoothed version noiseless of the original experimental mode and maximize the modal assurance criteria mac the lcmc proposed in this paper extends the lc method by optimizing not only the set of fe modes but also the set of degrees of freedom dofs of the experimental mode shape that should be used to maximize the mac for each experimental mode being adjusted only a few fe modes that are close in frequency to the mode being smoothed are used thus it is not necessary to carry out an exhaustive search across the entire fe modal base therefore this methodology is simple to implement fast and combinatorial analysis can be used to search for optimal sets of fe mode shapes and dofs furthermore it is not necessary to further reduce the fe model to 8 dofs in this case a subset of the reduced numerical modal matrix with only 14 modes and 8 dofs is extracted from the reduced modal matrix with 64 modes and 64 dofs and used in the lcmc s optimization thus the smoothing was performed using numerical 8 dofs coinciding with the accelerometers positions fig 8 shows a graphical comparison between the 14 experimental modes and the 14 serep reduced ones before the smoothing process it can be seen that there is a considerable difference between the modal amplitudes of the reduced and the experimental mode shapes as can be seen in fig 8 the maximum modal amplitude of the serep reduced model is 0 29 mm for the 12th mode while the maximum modal amplitude of the experimental modes is equal to 0 18 mm for the 1st mode furthermore the 8th 10th 12th and 14th modes have inverted phases with respect to the experimental modes in addition fig 9 presents the mac matrix between the serep reduced and the experimental modes with 8 dofs before optimization showing low main diagonal values which means poor correlation therefore to use the modal matrix of the reduced numerical model the modal amplitudes must be adjusted so that errors in relation to the experimental modal amplitudes are minimized the lcmc technique presented in section 2 2 was used and the result is the set of serep reduced mode shapes and the set of experimental dofs which allow the best adjustment or smoothing of each experimental modal shape aiming to maximize the mac table 4 presents the optimal sets of serep reduced modes shapes and experimental dofs selected in the smoothing process table 4 also shows that different sets of modes shapes were used to create a linear combination capable of adjusting a given experimental mode shape for example the 10th adjusted experimental mode shape used the smallest subsets of serep reduced mode shapes and only 1 experimental dof the 6th dof corresponding to accelerometer position s6 see fig 5 and 3 modes 9th 10th and 11th on the other hand the smoothing of the 6th experimental mode shape used the largest sets 4 experimental dofs and all the 14 reduced mode shapes in addition fig 10 shows a considerable reduction in the modal amplitudes of the smoothed mode shapes that approaches the modal amplitudes of the original experimental modes besides fig 11 shows that the mac values on the main diagonal were greater than 0 9 reaffirming the success of the optimization process finally the modal expansion of the smoothed experimental mode shapes to the 56 dofs of the serep reduced model not used in the optimization leads to the smoothed and expanded modes shapes presented in fig 12 7 conclusions in this work experimental modal shapes of an esp installed in a test well were smoothed using the lcmc methodology and expanded to 56 dofs not measured for this esp s modal parameters were obtained experimentally using the efdd technique and a complete fe model was also developed and reduced to 64 dofs through serep technique the lcmc method proposed by the authors to perform the smoothing of the experimental modes is easy to implement and of rapid convergence because the space of possible solutions is known a priori the serep reduced modal shapes and the experimental degrees of freedom the use of the proposed method lcmc for selecting the optimal set of numerical modes and experimental degrees of freedom to perform the smoothing proved to be successful and avoided overfitting the experimental modes this was demonstrated by the improvement in mac values after the optimization the proposed lcmc method tests all possible combinations of the measured degrees of freedom which can be a disadvantage when having a large number of sensors as is the case of larger esp sets in this work the esp was only 8 accelerometers or experimental dofs attached to the housing and the lcmc performed well on the other hand clustering the numerical mode shapes proved to be essential in reducing computational time because there is no need to test all modes combinations during the smoothing process so in this regard the next step of this research is to evaluate artificial intelligence and optimization methods that allow to automatically discard combinations of experimental dofs corresponding to the accelerometers positions in the esp casing and serep reduced mode shapes that have no relevant influence on the mode shape that is being smoothed finally another step of this research will be using the optimized and expanded experimental mode shapes matrix to estimate vibration levels at bearing positions in the esp s housing that have not been measured credit authorship contribution statement r h r gutiérrez methodology formal analysis

thousands of dollars a day due to the possibility of mechanical failure in the esp sets during the integration tests vibration analysis and fault identification methodologies are being proposed to identify the most common faults prematurely before they lead to catastrophic damage the methodology presented in this work is included within this effort the esp set is completely assembled installed and tested in a test well to assess its performance and reliability these tests comprise a series of operating conditions as close as possible to the real operating conditions in the production wells but considering only single phase flow and with water as a working fluid during these integration tests vibration signals are recorded with a limited number of accelerometers installed in the esp s housing but following the recommendations of the standards related to the vibration analysis of this type of equipment api 2012 1997 foresti et al 2016 minette et al 2016 vibration monitoring of these systems is important because they provide relevant information regarding possible failures that are happening during its operation however continuous monitoring throughout the esp housing can be difficult if not impossible due to the limited number of available accelerometers and in addition to having little or no accessibility to the places most at risk of failure mendonça et al 2019 qu 2004 for example in the esp s bearings regions one of the ways to know the dynamic behavior of the esp set is to estimate the modal parameters natural frequencies damping ratios and mode shapes through the operational modal analysis however the limited number of available accelerometers leads to lack of spatial resolution to represent all modal shapes in the frequency range of interest in this sense an alternative is the use of reduced finite element fe models appropriately adjusted or calibrated through experimental data friswell and mottershead 1996 qu 2004 to estimate the esp s modal parameters castillo et al 2019 and huamani et al 2017 used vibration data from impact tests and time and frequency domain techniques those authors developed an fe model of the esp to compare numerical with experimental modal parameters in the frequency range from 0 to 100 hz and they noted that there are several mode shapes within the esp s operating region from 30 to 62 hz the main reason for optimizing or adjust the modal model of an fe model is because it does not always represent the actual structure properly since it does not consider manufacturing and assembly errors chen et al 2018 qu 2004 however the optimization process which allows to minimize the differences between the experimental and the numerical models cannot be carried out directly due to the great difference in the number of degrees of freedom dofs friswell and mottershead 1996 so to assure dofs compatibility methods of model reduction must be used which can be done in the modal domains friswell and mottershead 1996 qu 2004 after the optimization or adjustment or smoothing of the reduced numerical model modal expansion of the experimental modes can be carried out to other dofs of interest especially for those close to locations with greater probability of failure this methodology has been widely used in a diverse range of mechanical and civil structures both in scale models and in real structures brincker et al 2015 iliopoulos et al 2016 tarpø et al 2020 in addition expanded modal shapes can be used to predict vibration levels in non instrumented locations without the need to use natural frequencies and damping ratios maes et al 2016 mayes et al 2020 rim et al 2014 in this context aiming to contribute to the vibration analysis of the esp set vibration measurements obtained during the integration tests are used to build an calibrated modal model that can be used i for optimal placement of virtual accelerometers for each test condition since it is almost impossible to relocate the actual accelerometers installed in the esp set due to the high costs involved in the integration tests ii to predict vibration responses anywhere in the esp s housing in this work it will be only presented the methodology for the construction of the calibrated esp s modal model to this end a fe model of an esp set model p 18 62stg was reduced using the equivalent reduction and expansion process serep o callahan and li 1996 besides the enhanced frequency domain decomposition efdd technique was used to estimate the modal parameters huamani et al 2017 from impact test data and used to build up the experimental modal model then the experimental modes were smoothed using the proposed local correspondence principle of modes and modal coordinates lcmc which is an extension of the local correspondence principle brincker et al 2014 and allows a better choice for the serep reduced modes and experimental degrees of freedom which corresponds to the accelerometers position in the esp s housing to assess the level of correlation between the smoothed experimental modal matrix and the original experimental modal matrix the modal assurance criteria mac was used ewins 2000 mendonça et al 2019 qu 2004 finally using the smoothed experimental modal matrix a modal expansion from 56 dofs not measured along the esp s casing were carried out 2 theoretical background the use of experimental data to calibrate fe model brings the challenge of dealing with the large difference between the experimental degrees of freedom dofs that is the accelerometers used in the measurement and the fe numerical dofs to overcome this difficulty model reduction techniques are used in order to make the number of degrees of freedom compatible without losing the dynamic characteristics of the system being studied the following are the theoretical foundations used in the process of smoothing and expanding the esp s experimental modal matrix 2 1 system equivalent reduction and expansion process serep this method was developed in the modal domain o callahan and li 1996 and allows the reduction of the fe model to a few degrees of freedom without changing its dynamic characteristics therefore from the general equation of motion we have 2 1 m x t k x t f t where m and k are the mass and stiffness matrices respectively f t is the load vector acting on the system x t and x t are the displacement and acceleration response vectors the solution of eq 2 1 can be performed using the modal truncation technique and considering p modes in the modal superposition o callahan and li 1996 paultre 2011 qu 2004 therefore 2 2 x t φ p q p t where φ p and q p t are the modal matrix and the modal coordinates for the p modes considered respectively for the reduction the total degrees of freedom of the complete model can be divided into two groups active a and deleted d therefore eq 2 2 can be rewritten as follows 2 3 x t x a t x d t φ a p t φ d p t q p t eq 2 3 shows that the responses to the active degrees of freedom x a t can be calculated considering only the degrees of freedom in the modal matrix φ a p t it is also noted that φ a p t it is generally not a square matrix depends on the number of degrees of freedom and modes considered however the serep method considers that the number of active degrees of freedom m is greater than the number of modes considered in the modal superposition p qu 2004 therefore eq 2 3 can be placed in normal form projecting this equation as 2 4 y p t φ a p t x a t replacing eq 2 3 in eq 2 4 2 5 y p t φ a p t φ a p q p t where q p t is an approximate solution of q p t and can be calculated by manipulating the eq 2 5 2 6 q p t φ a p t φ a p 1 y p t replacing eq 2 4 in eq 2 6 yields 2 7 x d t r x a t r φ d p φ a p where r is the condensation matrix of the serep and φ a p is the pseudo inverse of the modal matrix in the active degrees of freedom in addition the transformation matrix t can be calculated by replacing the eq 2 4 in eq 2 3 2 8 t φ p φ a p φ a p φ a p φ d p φ a p therefore the reduced stiffness k r and mass m r matrices can be calculated using the eq 2 9 2 9 k r t t k t m r t t m t equations 2 1 2 9 were included because they represent the theoretical formulation required in the process of reducing the esp s fe modal model from 21838 dofs to 64 dofs strictly speaking the reduced modal matrix contains 64 modes and 64 dofs 2 2 principle of local correspondence of modes and modal coordinates lcmc the smoothing of the experimental mode shapes can be interpreted as a fitting process since the numerical model is adjusted to the characteristics of the real structure reducing the uncertainty between the numerical and the experimental models the lcmc method proposed by the authors is an extension of the lc method brincker et al 2014 which is derived from the sensitivity equations of the mode shapes and is based on the consideration that a variation in a given mode shape is mainly due to a linear combination of the nearby modes tarpø et al 2020 the subset of numeric modes b φ used in smoothing is defined according to the lc whose criterion for selecting modes considers a ranking in frequency between the mode to be calibrated and the closest modes the subset b φ it is assembled by including modes one at a time from this ranking with each new iteration the optimal number of modes in b φ is obtained by maximizing the mac value in relation to the degrees of freedom chosen for this purpose brincker et al 2014 considering that each mode shape φ obtained experimentally can be expressed as a linear combination of a subset of numeric modes b φ yields 2 10 φ b φ z where z is the vector of adjustment coefficients for each numerical mode present in b φ this linear combination vector can be calculated according to eq 2 11 2 11 z ˆ b φ n φ where b φ is the pseudo inverse of b φ finally the smoothed experimental mode φ ˆ is defined through the following eq 2 12 2 12 φ ˆ b φ z ˆ in order to complement the lc aiming at avoiding overfitting the experimental modes the lcmc allows in addition to choose the optimal set of measured degrees of freedom to be used in the smoothing process looking at mac maximization the selection of degrees of freedom at each iteration during the smoothing process is done by using a combinatorial analysis according to eq 2 13 2 13 n c i m r m r i m r i where r 2 in eq 2 13 n m r e i represent the number of possible combinations the number of measured degrees of freedom used in the fitting process fitting dofs the number of measured degrees of freedom used to verify the fit observation dofs and the number of iterations respectively in this way the choice of degrees of freedom that have greater relevance in smoothing a given mode allow to maximize the mac and avoiding overfitting fig 1 presents a flowchart of the optimization process used by the lcmc 2 3 modal assurance criteria mac it is a simple way of correlating two mode shapes when examining their linear dependencies and verifying the modal similarity between them it is calculated as 2 14 m a c φ a φ b φ a t φ b 2 φ a t φ a φ b t φ b where φ a and φ b are the a and b mode shapes respectively mac value close to 1 indicates that the two modes are well correlated that is the modes are equal and values close to 0 suggest that the modes are not correlated that is they are orthogonal qu 2004 3 experimental setup the vibration tests were performed during the integration tests which are carried out to assess the performance and reliability of the esp before being installed in a real production well the integration tests comprise in short the following conditions foresti et al 2016 the esp set is completely assembled and installed in a test well including the bottom sensor the variable speed drive vsd and its respective power cable which can vary from 5 to 20 km the esp set model p 18 62stg was installed in a test well as shown in fig 2 a vsd tests must comply with iec 61800 4 and flow and pressure tests must comply with api rp 11s2 api 1997 the purpose of integration tests is to evaluate the performance of esp under simulated conditions analogous to the real operating conditions the tests are carried out in two stages 1 with vsd speed variation from 40 to 60 hz and in various operating conditions minimum flow best efficient point and maximum flow 2 72 hours endurance test operating with vsd at 60 hz although the real operation of esp is with two phase oil and water or three phase oil water and gas flow integration tests are carried out only with water in all tested cases the vibration signals are used for fault detection and comparison with the limits established by api 11s8 api 2012 the esp set was instrumented with 8 accelerometers in the y direction distributed among the pump casing the protecting seal and the electric motor identified from s1 to s8 according to fig 2b finally impact tests were performed and the vibration responses were recorded for further analysis castillo et al 2019 huamani et al 2017 minette et al 2016 fig 3 shows the accelerometer mounting process the esp set installation in the test well and the impact point the instrumentation used for vibration measurement of was as follows 8 icp accelerometers manufacturer pcb imi model 624b11 sensitivity of 100 mv g and operating range from 2 hz to 10 khz 1 impact hammer with rubber tip pcb 086d50 model data acquisition system manufacturer national instruments model ni 9233 and 1 rack ni 9178 4 numerical analysis the fe model used in this work was developed in a previous work castillo et al 2019 and took into account the following considerations complies with the structural characteristics of the project there are connections between the pump shaft and the housing at the bearing positions there is 1 bearing at every 5 stages the 62 stages were represented as lumped mass and distributed along the pump s shaft the esp set is filled with water and this mass has been distributed among the appropriate components the boundary condition considered was simply supported on the wellhead the interaction between the water and the esp in the well represented by the additional hydrodynamic mass was distributed throughout the esp s housing the fe model was developed in the ansys 18 2 software using the beam element with 2 node beam188 the complete fe model has 10919 nodes with 2 degrees of freedom each 1 translation and 1 rotation leading to 21838 dofs as explained in section 2 1 the serep method was used to reduce the fe model from 10919 nodes 21838 dofs to 64 nodes with 1 dof each then the 8 dofs coinciding with those considered experimentally were chosen in the process of smoothing the experimental modes 5 methodology fig 4 describes the methodology proposed to smooth and expand the esp s experimental mode shapes 6 results and discussions results will be presented in the following order i modal parameters estimation ii fe model reduction process and iii smoothing and expansion processes 6 1 modal parameter estimation as the impact signals were not registered only the vibration responses were available fig 5 and the enhanced frequency domain decomposition efdd algorithm were used huamani et al 2017 table 1 presents the results in the frequency range of 0 100 hz table 1 shows the 14 mode shapes identified in the frequency range of interest up to 100 hz it is also noted that the estimated damping ratios have high values which was already expected since the measurement noise is concentrated in this parameter and its subsequent use must be done with caution similarly mode shapes can also suffer from measurement noise effects to a minor extent fortunately this problem can be solved in the smoothing process the mode shapes amplitudes were estimated for each measured degree of freedom equivalent to the accelerometer s positions in the esp s housing resulting in an experimental modal matrix as can also be seen in table 1 there are 3 vibration modes 9 10 and 11 within the esp s operating range and operation near those natural frequencies can put the system in a resonance condition 6 2 fe model reduction process fig 6 shows the first 14 vibration modes of the full fe model with 21838 dofs and the corresponding natural frequencies are shown in table 1 when comparing the 14 experimental natural frequencies with those obtained by the complete fe model it was found that there is an average difference rms of 8 1 this result shows that the complete fe model mass and stiffness matrices should be updated before used for any purpose in this work the focus was on the correlation process between the numerical and the experimental modal model then serep was applied to reduce the complete fe model with 21838 dofs to 64 dofs strictly speaking the reduced modal matrix contains 64 modes and 64 dofs without losing the esp s dynamic characteristics as can be seen in table 2 the average rms difference in natural frequencies estimation using the complete fe model and the serep reduced model is 4 3 for the majority of natural frequencies the differences are close to zero only for the 1st natural frequency the difference was of 16 table 3 shows the comparison between the serep reduced and the experimental natural frequencies as can be seen there are only small differences solely in the 2nd vibration mode there was a difference greater than 10 which can be attributed to the simplifications adopted in the fe model development the average rms difference in natural frequencies was 6 9 and therefore it was concluded that there is a good agreement in addition by making a visual comparison between the mode shapes obtained with the complete fe model shown in fig 6 and those obtained by the reduced fe model shown in fig 7 it appears that there is a good coherence so it was concluded that the reduction process was satisfactory and results of the serep reduced model can be used to smooth and expand the experimental modal matrix 6 3 smoothing and expansion processes the principle of local correspondence of modes and modal coordinates lcmc is an extension of the local correspondence principle lc originally proposed by brincker et al 2014 the lc considers that each experimental mode shape can be smoothed by a linear combination of a set of fe mode shapes the goal is to select an optimum set of fe mode shapes that leads to a smoothed version noiseless of the original experimental mode and maximize the modal assurance criteria mac the lcmc proposed in this paper extends the lc method by optimizing not only the set of fe modes but also the set of degrees of freedom dofs of the experimental mode shape that should be used to maximize the mac for each experimental mode being adjusted only a few fe modes that are close in frequency to the mode being smoothed are used thus it is not necessary to carry out an exhaustive search across the entire fe modal base therefore this methodology is simple to implement fast and combinatorial analysis can be used to search for optimal sets of fe mode shapes and dofs furthermore it is not necessary to further reduce the fe model to 8 dofs in this case a subset of the reduced numerical modal matrix with only 14 modes and 8 dofs is extracted from the reduced modal matrix with 64 modes and 64 dofs and used in the lcmc s optimization thus the smoothing was performed using numerical 8 dofs coinciding with the accelerometers positions fig 8 shows a graphical comparison between the 14 experimental modes and the 14 serep reduced ones before the smoothing process it can be seen that there is a considerable difference between the modal amplitudes of the reduced and the experimental mode shapes as can be seen in fig 8 the maximum modal amplitude of the serep reduced model is 0 29 mm for the 12th mode while the maximum modal amplitude of the experimental modes is equal to 0 18 mm for the 1st mode furthermore the 8th 10th 12th and 14th modes have inverted phases with respect to the experimental modes in addition fig 9 presents the mac matrix between the serep reduced and the experimental modes with 8 dofs before optimization showing low main diagonal values which means poor correlation therefore to use the modal matrix of the reduced numerical model the modal amplitudes must be adjusted so that errors in relation to the experimental modal amplitudes are minimized the lcmc technique presented in section 2 2 was used and the result is the set of serep reduced mode shapes and the set of experimental dofs which allow the best adjustment or smoothing of each experimental modal shape aiming to maximize the mac table 4 presents the optimal sets of serep reduced modes shapes and experimental dofs selected in the smoothing process table 4 also shows that different sets of modes shapes were used to create a linear combination capable of adjusting a given experimental mode shape for example the 10th adjusted experimental mode shape used the smallest subsets of serep reduced mode shapes and only 1 experimental dof the 6th dof corresponding to accelerometer position s6 see fig 5 and 3 modes 9th 10th and 11th on the other hand the smoothing of the 6th experimental mode shape used the largest sets 4 experimental dofs and all the 14 reduced mode shapes in addition fig 10 shows a considerable reduction in the modal amplitudes of the smoothed mode shapes that approaches the modal amplitudes of the original experimental modes besides fig 11 shows that the mac values on the main diagonal were greater than 0 9 reaffirming the success of the optimization process finally the modal expansion of the smoothed experimental mode shapes to the 56 dofs of the serep reduced model not used in the optimization leads to the smoothed and expanded modes shapes presented in fig 12 7 conclusions in this work experimental modal shapes of an esp installed in a test well were smoothed using the lcmc methodology and expanded to 56 dofs not measured for this esp s modal parameters were obtained experimentally using the efdd technique and a complete fe model was also developed and reduced to 64 dofs through serep technique the lcmc method proposed by the authors to perform the smoothing of the experimental modes is easy to implement and of rapid convergence because the space of possible solutions is known a priori the serep reduced modal shapes and the experimental degrees of freedom the use of the proposed method lcmc for selecting the optimal set of numerical modes and experimental degrees of freedom to perform the smoothing proved to be successful and avoided overfitting the experimental modes this was demonstrated by the improvement in mac values after the optimization the proposed lcmc method tests all possible combinations of the measured degrees of freedom which can be a disadvantage when having a large number of sensors as is the case of larger esp sets in this work the esp was only 8 accelerometers or experimental dofs attached to the housing and the lcmc performed well on the other hand clustering the numerical mode shapes proved to be essential in reducing computational time because there is no need to test all modes combinations during the smoothing process so in this regard the next step of this research is to evaluate artificial intelligence and optimization methods that allow to automatically discard combinations of experimental dofs corresponding to the accelerometers positions in the esp casing and serep reduced mode shapes that have no relevant influence on the mode shape that is being smoothed finally another step of this research will be using the optimized and expanded experimental mode shapes matrix to estimate vibration levels at bearing positions in the esp s housing that have not been measured credit authorship contribution statement r h r gutiérrez methodology formal analysis

20808,frequent water traffic accidents pose severe threats to human life and property safety the water environment and adverse effects on social stability understanding historical accidents is essential for accident prevention and risk mitigation however at present research on the comprehensive statistical analysis of characteristics and causes of ship accidents that occurred in the inland water areas of the yangtze river especially in the fluctuating backwater area fba of three gorges reservoir tgr region is still scanty even less a hierarchical and systematic analysis framework therefore this paper proposes a comprehensive ship accident characteristics and causes analysis framework and summarizes and visualizes the characteristics of ship accidents through the statistical and comparative analysis of historical data in terms of categories and severity of accidents ship types involved in accidents spatial and temporal distribution characteristics ship accident losses and root causes and lessons learned from the related accidents in order to demonstrate the value of the proposed framework based on the official sources ten years of ship accident data from 2009 to 2018 in the fba of tgr region are collected and analyzed in detail on the basis of the results this paper summarizes accident prevention and supervision guidelines to provide decision support for maritime safety this research is of significance to the water traffic accident precaution and risk mitigation in this region and can be useful for other similar specific scenarios worldwide keywords ship accidents marine traffic safety three gorges reservoir fluctuating backwater area statistical and comparative analysis data visualization 1 introduction with the continuous development of the trade and economy worldwide water transportation is becoming increasingly busy ships are being designed or build bigger and more specialized ships speed is increasing as well xue et al 2019a coupled with the increase in the density of water traffic the navigation environment of ships is gradually deteriorating resulting in frequent water traffic accidents which causes the stakeholders to pay more attention to the risk of maritime shipping akyuz and celik 2014 goerlandt and montewka 2015 thus water transportation is recognized as a high risk industry meanwhile maritime transportation is crucial for the integrated transportation system in addition various accidents e g ship collisions and groundings frequently result in substantial environmental pollution economic losses and casualties mou et al 2010 yip 2008 therefore maritime safety becomes one of the most critical research areas for water transportation and academia and managers have been focusing on specific high risk regions nowadays as an essential supplement to the global maritime transportation framework inland waterway transportation has played a significant role between the domestic and international shipping markets transporting mass cargo to inland cities at relatively economic costs recently inland shipping s rapid development has highlighted the significant vital strategic position of inland waterways e g the yangtze river shi et al 2019 the yangtze river is the third longest river globally after the amazon and the nile its mainstream has a total length of more than 6300 km it is also the first longest and most developed inland water transportation system in china simultaneously it is a vital transportation artery that connects the coast with southwest china and central china the three gorges hydroelectric power station also named three gorges project dam spans the yangtze river in yichang hubei province china shown as fig 2 it is also the largest engineering project ever built in china and enhanced the yangtze river s shipping capacity the three gorges reservoir will go through four stages each year water storage period high water level period recession period and flood control period during the four stages the water level changes accordingly each year thus the fluctuating backwater area fba will be formed bao et al 2015 shown as fig 3 from the boundary of the reservoir to the end of the perennial backwater area when the water level of the reservoir is between 145 m minimum water level and 175 m maximum water level it presents the dual characteristics of natural river channels and artificial reservoirs zhang et al 2019 in other words the fba is a reservoir after the flooding season and the waterway s annual water level during the flooding season changes between 0 m and 30 m additionally the navigation conditions of the main channel and branch channels have significantly changed after the three gorges project has stored water to a maximum water level of 175 m in general the navigation conditions of the fba of the tgr region are worse than those of the reservoir area as the water level changes at different stages of the operation of the tgr water transportation in different water levels shows different characteristics thus the navigation conditions in the fba are relatively complicated which has a significant impact on ships navigation safety and brings maritime management challenges for the stakeholders water traffic accidents are generally characterized by difficulties in search and rescue and it is likely to cause severe economic losses and social impacts for example the particularly significant catastrophic in water transportation history ship capsizing accident of eastern star also named dongfang zhi xing this accident occurred at 21 32 on june 1 2015 in the yangtze river damazhou waterway in jianli county hubei province china all the persons fell into the water and only 12 survived the accident resulted in 442 deaths in the end it is the most severe inland shipping capsizing incident since the founding of the people s republic of china in 1949 wang et al 2018 therefore the analysis of water traffic accidents and maritime safety risks has become an important and hot topic and attracted widespread attention from researchers in various countries altan 2019 aziz et al 2019 balmat et al 2009 2011 banda et al 2015 du et al

prone region zhang et al 2013 utilized the fsa concept to establish a risk model by considering both probability and consequences of accidents regarding a risk matrix method to estimate the yangtze river s navigational risk martins and maturana 2010 applied the fta as preliminary trees and compared them with the chaining of dangerous collision events and grounding accidents to give a qualitative analysis of human reliability sahin and senol 2014 established the generic fuzzy ahp approach to compare both the regular judgment and results of field experts with the outputs of the proposed model thus to evaluate marine accidents in a stepwise way that is inaccurately judged by the experts wu et al 2017 developed an evidential reasoning based cream to estimate the human error probability and conduct human reliability analysis of a maritime accident chauvin et al 2013 presented a modified hfacs to analyze human and organizational factors in collisions the study indicated that decision errors resulting in most collisions and bridge resource management is significant for navigation in restricted waters fu et al 2018 recommended a frank copula based fuzzy eta approach along with the associated uncertainties to quantitatively assess the potential risks of ship accidents in arctic waters moreover to provide comprehensive assessments of ship accidents characteristics and causes the statistical analysis and investigation of historical marine accidents is another efficient analysis method it is one of the fundamental techniques for the aforementioned approaches typical studies of risk analysis for marine accidents utilized statistical analysis and investigation method as follows wang et al 2005 collected the accidents on fishing vessels from the marine accident investigation branch to analyze and determine the most common causes and real safety problems of these accidents antão et al 2008 applied statistical analysis to identify the main organizational and systemic causes of accidents at work within the fishing sector bye and aalberg 2018 introduced the statistical analyses of maritime accident data and ais data from norwegian waters to identify conditions associated

statistics in the gulf of finland in march 2011 and january 2012 mazaheri et al 2015 presented an evidence based risk modeling through the usability of accidents or incident reports from finland and the uk ronza et al 2003 developed the event tree analysis based on the selected 828 accidents of port areas to predict the accident frequency and determine the probability of various accident scenarios however until the present research on comprehensive statistical analysis for the characteristics and causes of ship accidents that occurred in the inland water areas of the yangtze river especially in the fba of tgr region is still scanty even less a hierarchical and systematic investigation framework for characteristics and causes analysis of ship accidents therefore the present study attempts to propose a comprehensive ship accident characteristics and causes analysis framework and conduct a case study to demonstrate the value of the framework by characterizing the ship accidents in the fba of tgr region under the scope of jurisdiction of the chongqing maritime safety administration msa from 2009 to 2018 from these analyses of the historical data we summarize and

the application procedures for the proposed hierarchical investigation framework are detailed and the specific implementation for phase i data collection and processing phase ii scenario identification and data analysis and phase iii causes recognition and classification is introduced in the sub sections 3 1 data collection and processing the data sources of ship accidents used in this study including accidents and incidents investigation reports were collected from chongqing maritime safety administration msa where accidents occurred and reported to the maritime safety administration of the people s republic of china cmsa chongqing msa is an administrative law enforcement government agency set up by the changjiang msa which is one of the 15 regional msas under the ministry of transport of the people s republic of china on the yangtze river its functions are to administer all matters related to maritime and shipping safety of chongqing including supervising maritime traffic safety and security preventing pollution from ships implementing water search and rescue performing marine accident investigation etc the chongqing msa staff regularly summarizes the detailed accident data within the jurisdiction to form an accident database then submits the data to the cmsa each record of the accident incident including information of the time seasonality ship type accident type accident location loading condition and a description of the accidents and incidents process etc in this study the accident and incident reports were sorted out and analyzed in detail and the useful information concerning ship accident was extracted e g the casualties economic losses and then combine with the historical statistics record from chongqing msa thus the original data set were settled in addition the missing data were completed and the statistical error information e g segment calibration error the accident that belongs to fba perennial backwater area or natural water area is incorrectly classified was deleted by utilizing data cleaning technique moreover the same type of data was standardized e g unified units and formats the specific information was extracted and mining based on the purpose of the analysis procedure by the computer coding through python finally the complete data set concerning 173 ship accidents that occurred and reported to the cmsa in the fba of tgr region from 2009 to 2018 were collected and reorganized 3 2 scenario identification 3 2 1 three gorges reservoir region three gorges dam has been the largest power generation facility globally in terms of installed capacity 22 50 mw since 2012 bao et al 2015 cleveland and morris 2013 ehrlich and geller 2017 it is also the largest engineering project ever built in china and the most critical water control project along the yangtze river nilsson et al 2005 xu et al 2013 in addition to producing electricity the dam also has the function of increasing the yangtze river s shipping capacity by giving flood storage space the dam diminishes the potential of flooding downstream as shown in fig 2 the upper yangtze river basin is located in the southwest of china the region covering the reach of the yangtze river from three gorges dam yichang to jiangjin lies in the upper yangtze river basin commonly known as three gorges reservoir tgr the mainstream of the yangtze river in chongqing district is located in the southwest mountainous area of china the waters under the chongqing msa jurisdiction include 680 7 km of the mainstream and 41 5 km of intersection tributary waters of the yangtze river the chongqing msa mainly includes 12 maritime departments in yongchuan jiangjin banan chaotianmen changshou fuling fengdu zhongxian wanzhou yunyang fengjie and wushan respectively and one maritime bureau communication and information center moreover except for yongchuan the other 11 maritime departments are located in the tgr region fig 2 among them the statistic of chongqing msa shows that the region ship accidents occurred within the fluctuating backwater area fba are from banan chaotianmen changshou and fuling partly 3 2 2 fluctuating backwater area in this study the fba refers to the area along tgr banks bounded by 145 m minimum water level and 175 m maximum water level of the tgr it is a physical area undergoing an annually cyclic inundation and exposure due to the tgr operation the tgr will undergo an annually cyclic inundation and exposure through four stages high water level period water storage period recession period and flood control period during the four stages of water level change each year the fba will be formed thus fba is a dynamic river section that changes from part of the reservoir to natural water areas in different water levels liro 2019 in fluvial geomorphology a river section temporarily inundated by water from a downstream dam reservoir is typically called a fluctuating backwater or backwater zone lajczak 2006 liro 2014 2019 in our case the fba is a river section upstream of a reservoir that is inundated during reservoir stages higher than the minimal water level fig 3a in addition it may also be treated as a part of river dominated transitional and reservoir dominated transitional zones skalak et al 2013 table 1 describes the zones which are adjacent or situated to fba as shown in fig 3 the fba perennial backwater area and natural water area coexist in the waterway upon the tgr the fba is the dynamic area extended from the reservoir s boundary to the end of the perennial backwater area note that the dam reservoir and fba are dynamic when the water level changes the higher the water level rises the further the dam reservoir extends specifically when the water level is 145 m the dam reservoir boundary is also the waterline of the perennial backwater area when the water level is 175 m the dam reservoir will be extended upstream for a further distance and the extended waterway area is the fba jiang et al 2020 after the three gorges dam impounded to the maximum water level of 175 m high water level period the navigation conditions of the mainstream and tributaries of waterways changed significantly bringing new challenges for navigation safety during this period the ship s navigation conditions are relatively good the scale of the water waterway is increased and the water flow becomes stable however the increase of the wetland area may lead to foggy in fba worsen navigation visibility and bring new hidden dangers to navigation safety during the water storage period the water level in the tgr area gradually moved to the maximum water level of 175 m the waterways of fba present new characteristics the water depth increases the channel widens the flow rate slows and the narrow curved section decreases and the navigation conditions are improved when the water level of the reservoir between 145 m minimum water level and 175 m maximum water level it presents the dual characteristics of natural river channels and artificial reservoirs zhang et al 2019 the annual water level of the waterway during the flooding season changes between 0 m and 30 m in the recession period the water level gradually becomes lower to a minimum water level of 145 m the waterway of the fba is characterized by natural water areas with increased flow velocity turbulent flow patterns and increased obstructive reefs the waterways are curved narrow and shallow which significantly impacts shipping safety and the risk of ship accidents is increasing additionally some details for different operation periods in the fba including the water level changing characteristics and related hydrologic conditions are illustrated by jiang et al 2020 the navigation conditions of the fba are generally worse than the common perennial backwater area as the water level changes at different tgr operation stages resulting in the water traffic presents different characteristics the navigation conditions in the fba are more complicated which has a significant impact on navigation safety and poses challenges to maritime safety and management therefore it is a crucial water area for the water transportation safety management of china table a1 presents the number of accidents that occurred in different water areas of the tgr region and table a2 details the traffic volume statistics for different water areas then the frequency of ship accidents could be obtained by calculating the number of accidents and annual traffic volume e g the frequency of ship accident in fba of 2009 the number of accidents annual traffic volume 35 220 365 35 80 209 4 36e 04 note that the annual traffic volume average daily traffic volume 365 the detailed results for the frequency of ship accidents in fba are shown in table a7 similarly the frequency of ship accidents in the other two areas i e perennial backwater area and natural water area could be obtained as well as shown in fig 4 fba has the most significant number of accidents followed by perennial backwater area and natural water area moreover the overall tendency of fig 4 illustrates that the number of accidents in different water areas tends to decrease year by year there are small fluctuations in certain years e g the accidents occurred in 2016 and 2017 within fba as for the frequency of accidents the overall trends for the frequency of ship accident s occurrence in fba and perennial backwater area are in accordance with the changing trends of the number of accidents in corresponding water areas for the natural water area due to the number of statistical samples is relatively small and the annual traffic volume in this area is less than the other two areas thus the frequency is more sensitive small changes in the number of accidents can easily cause drastic changes in numerical results e g the frequencies in 2016 and 2017 and the changes and fluctuations for the related frequency of ship accidents are relatively large than the other two areas overall fig 4 indicates that the fba is the most high risk region compared to the other two areas in terms of the number of accidents or the frequency of accidents except for some specific years therefore we select the fba as the studied area to explore the characteristics and root causes of ship accidents thus to propose accident prevention and supervision suggestions to provide decision support for the stakeholders and managers 3 3 ship accident analysis 3 3 1 ship accident categories there are eight categories of ship accidents that occurred in fba they are grounding sink fire collision contact damage dragging wind and others note that the definitions are taken and adapted from emsa 2020 shown as table 2 among them grounding collision and sink accidents are the first three most significant categories of ship accidents that happened in the studied area accounting for 65 90 12 72 6 94 respectively shown as table a3 and fig 5 to further explore the characteristics of ship accident categories we specifically addressed the distribution of various ship types in each ship accident category as shown in fig 6 and table a4 there are 115 ships 58 08 of all number of ships involved in various accidents the reason has been investigated to be grounding followed by collision 44 ships 22 22 and accident of sink 13 ships 6 57 3 3 2 ship accident levels article 6 of the statistical measures on water traffic accidents implemented by the ministry of transport of the people s republic of china on january 1 2015 prc 2015 is divided into the following five categories i e minor ordinary major and hazardous and catastrophic according to factors e g casualties direct economic losses or environmental pollution of waters table 3 describes the classification criteria for different accident levels moreover approximately 87 28 of accidents are in the level of minor for the studied inland area as shown in table 4 in addition fig 7 indicates the trend of each level from a yearly perspective there were four and two hazardous accidents that occurred in 2011 and 2014 respectively with the same proportion of 16 67 moreover in 2017 and 2018 only minor accidents happened 3 3 3 ship types involved in accidents fig 8 indicates the distribution of the ship types involved in accidents of the studied area it is seen that cargo ships are the most frequently involved in ship accidents with 64 14 of total accidents in the database followed by passenger ship and container ship 11 11 and 7 07 respectively while the tug and working ship have the least number of accidents accounting for 1 01 fig 9 illustrates the statistics of ship types by ship accident categories in the fba note that the accident category involving fishing ships is all of the collision accident and the ships all sunk in addition all the accidents about the category tanker are grounding accidents 3 3 4 temporal distribution characteristics we utilize a stacked bar chart fig 10 to describe the basically decreasing trend for the frequency of accidents and each ship accident category and their proportion at a yearly level the frequency of different ship accident categories can be obtained based on the data of table a2 and table a3 and the calculation example is illustrated in section 3 2 2 and related results are shown in table a7 among them grounding accidents are the most common and need to be early warned and monitored because they have the highest percentage of various ship accident statistics note that 65 90 of ship accidents are grounding accidents accounting for more than half the number of all accidents fig 5 therefore the trend of grounding accidents has the most significant influence on the trend of total accidents in addition fig 10 indicates that the frequency of the overall ship accidents for different categories tends to decrease year by year there are small fluctuations in 2016 and 2017 however as for the trends of various accident categories specific analysis is needed for the categories of grounding collision and sink they reflect the same characteristics as the overall accident change trend but for other accident categories it is not easy to summarize the specific change trend because of the limited statistical samples fig 11 presents the distribution of ship accidents at a monthly level by utilizing the heat map fig 12 is a statistic using a stacked column chart for the ship accidents that occurred by month per accident category see the original data in table a5 the occurrence frequency indicates a downward trend from may after an upward movement from january to may except for november figs 11 and 12 indicate that according to the month in which the accident occurred most of the ship accidents had happened from may to august 40 25 20 and 18 respectively table a5 however december october and january are relatively few 2 5 and 6 respectively moreover grounding occurred mostly in may and june collision mainly in april and november this is congruent with the water level changes in the tgr region the specific explanation is given in section 4 1 4 table 5 demonstrates the daily variation of accidents fewer accidents occurred between 00 00 to 06 00 and 18 00 to 24 00 and more accidents occurred between 06 00 to 12 00 and 12 00 to 18 00 to further explore ship accidents characteristics we utilize a wind rose diagram to explain ship accidents time distribution characteristics at an hourly level see the original data in table a6 fig 13 described the accidents that mainly occurred and concentrated in 2009 to 2013 as shown in fig 14 the most prone periods of accidents occurred 07 00 to 08 00 09 00 to 10 00 and 18 00 to 19 00 respectively 3 3 5 spatial distribution characteristics according to the investigation of ship accident reports for chongqing msa 173 ship accidents occurred in the fba of tgr region among them 35 accidents occurred under the jurisdiction of the department of banan 104 in chaotianmen 10 in fuling and 24 in changshou respectively as known that the yangtze river is divided into three parts upstream yibin to yichang middle stream yichang to wuhan and downstream wuhan to changjiangkou the upstream channel mileage refers to the distance from zhongshui gate and the unit is km we normalize the data of fba within the scope of more detailed regional difference for various segments and explore the number of accidents that occurred per km thus to figure out the region where accidents occurred most common as shown in table 6 the average accident frequency for the fba is 0 98 the average accident frequency means the frequency of the total number of accidents occurred within the whole segment 173 721 544 0 98 there are 15 segments that have a higher accident frequency than the average level wangjiatan zaomenzi luoqi gaogankou jinjisanbe lengfanqi lengfanqi malingzi malingzi hongmiao feieqi guojiatuo guojiatuo kuzhubei mabutan zhuerqi zhuerqi shanhuba shanhuba sanjiaoqi sanjiaoqi huangjiaqi huangjiaqi huangcaoping xiejiaba fueryan shengbandui jinjiayan jixinshi zhanqizi among them the accident frequency for the segments of sanjiaoqi huangjiaqi jinjisanbei lengfanqi wangjiatan zaomenzi and huangjiaqi huangcaoping are as high as 3 14 2 80 2 33 and 2 14 respectively exceeded the average accident frequency 0 98 in addition the six segments where accidents occurred six years or more in 10 years are jinjisanbei lengfanqi malingzi hongmiao feieqi guojiatuo sanjiaoqi huangjiaqi huangjiaqi huangcaoping jixinshi zhanqizi respectively moreover from table 6 we could see that these six segments accident frequency also exceeds the average accident frequency 3 3 6 shipwrecks casualties and economic losses of ship accidents statistical trends can reflect the changing rules of accidents thus finding effective management strategies and core points that need to be analyzed and explored for accident causes as shown in table 7 there are a total of 173 accidents occurred in the fluctuating backwater from 2009 to 2018 resulting in 38 casualties dead missing 28 shipwrecks listing capsizing and direct economic losses of 21 10 million cny fig 15 a presents the ship accident loss by year interval which indicates that the number of ship accidents casualties and shipwrecks is declining however the economic losses sometimes fluctuate significantly in specific years ship accidents generally caused enormous losses to get further details and interpretation of the economic loss peaks in the years 2013 and 2015 table 7 we specifically analyze and explore two major accidents that occurred in 2013 and 2015 see the green point in the web version in fig 15 a respectively from table 8 we can see that the economic loss for accident id 204 is 2 00 million cny accounts for about 61 16 of the total economic loss of ship accidents in 2013 similarly for the case of accident id 236 the economic loss 2 80 million cny accounts for about 73 73 of the total economic loss that happened in 2015 table 7 and fig 15 b illustrate the ship accidents and casualties evolution at a yearly level the average ratio of casualties accidents within fba is 0 22 fig 15 b demonstrates that 2009 and 2013 have the highest ratio of 0 40 followed by 2016 0 33 2011 0 25 2012 0 24 2015 0 22 and 2014 0 17 respectively note that if the traffic has increased during the same period the increase of accidents may not be so visible rapid as the amount of traffic the frequency of the accidents or casualties may become lower which may mean a safety situation improvement however generally speaking the number of accidents or casualties will increase according to an increase in the amount of traffic nevertheless as shown in table a2 in our case the annual traffic volume in the studied area from 2009 to 2018 has stabilized basically not changing much ranging from 80 000 to 95 000 approximately therefore the annual traffic volume s influence is not so obvious when calculating the frequency of the accidents in fba see fig 4 moreover in the perspective of the specific period the traffic data could be ignored as a common denominator when calculating the ratio the annual traffic volume may influence the indications for casualties and accidents separately but the changes for the ratio casualties accidents will not be influenced separately by the number of accidents or casualties it still could reflect the safety situation in the specific year fig 15 c and table 9 illustrates the statistics of the losses by ship types there are 127 cargo ships most got involved in ship accidents and resulting in 30 casualties most 22 shipwrecks most and 13 88 million cny economic losses most ranked the first place followed by passenger ships 22 ships involved in casualties and 2 74 million cny economic losses container ships 14 ships involved in casualties and 1 84 million cny economic losses respectively note that though the total economic losses of fishing ship accidents are not as high as the cargo ships passenger ships etc and its ratio of economic losses per ship 0 10 million cny total economic losses divided by the number of fishing ships involved in accidents is also lower than the average ratio for all ship types 0 11 however it has the highest ratio of casualties per ship 1 67 the number of casualties divided by the number of fishing ships involved in accidents and the highest ratio of shipwrecks per ship 0 67 the number of shipwrecks divided by the number of fishing ships involved in accidents and both indicators are higher than the average level during the period under review average ratio of casualties is 0 19 and the average ratio of shipwrecks is 0 14 in addition as shown in fig 15 c the changing tendency of the casualties shipwrecks and economic losses caused by various ship types is basically congruent with the changing trend of the number of ships for each ship type fig 15 d and table 9 indicate the distribution of the losses by ship accident categories there are 114 accidents most of grounding resulting in 3 casualties 9 shipwrecks and 9 12 million cny economic losses most followed by 22 collision accidents lead to 14 casualties 5 shipwrecks and 2 17 million cny economic losses and 12 accidents involved in a sink including listing capsizing resulting in 20 casualties most 12 shipwrecks most and 6 21 million cny economic losses note that the highest ratio of casualties per accident is 1 67 sink the number of casualties divided by the number of accidents followed by 0 64 collision both higher than the average 0 22 in addition the economic losses and shipwrecks of accidents caused by the sink are all ranking the highest ratio in both categories 0 52 total economic losses divided by the number of accidents 1 00 the number of shipwrecks divided by the number of accidents and both exceed the average 0 12 0 16 respectively followed by the collision category s ratio 0 64 for casualties and 0 23 for shipwrecks both exceed the corresponding average in addition the economic losses caused by dragging ranked the second highest ratio 0 38 million cny per accident moreover as shown in fig 15 d the changing tendency of the economic losses caused by different ship accident categories is basically the same as the changing trend of the number of ship accidents for various ship accident categories moreover fig 16 and table 10 indicate that the number of ship accidents in chaotianmen is more extensive than in the other three places still fuling has the highest ratio of casualties accidents and the ratio of chaotianmen and fuling both exceed the average ratio in fba as well as fba and perennial backwater area only counts the data of fuling moreover similar to the aforementioned in terms of a specific studied area the influence of the annual traffic volume could be ignored as a common denominator when calculating the ratio i e once the number of accidents and casualties is certain the ratio of casualties accidents could be obtained and certain as well furthermore since fuling spans the fba and perennial backwater area the ratio for it is different in terms of the scope of fba and the overall the tgr region note that the ratio of fuling within fba is as high as 0 60 which indicates that the stakeholders and officers on watch oow should pay more attention to this area when maneuvering ships across it 3 4 accident causes recognition and classification the maritime transportation system is comprehensive and complex and mainly composed of the elements of human ship and environment in addition hazards identified from these elements are widely used to define the risk factors of ship accident causes fan et al 2020a he et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 wu et al 2020 therefore in this section the underlying causes of maritime accidents and the lessons learned from these accidents in terms of human errors ship conditions and traffic environment conditions are recognized and investigated show as blue in table 11 in order to analyze the causes of ship accidents in a more comprehensive and detailed manner a fishbone diagram was used fig 17 the fishbone diagram provides a qualitative approach for analyzing in more detail the causes of ship accidents in the fba and it allows scholars and stakeholders to check the causes of accidents in their research area quickly combined with table 11 it could be potentially applied for ship accident causes recognition and investigation in the fba and similar situations worldwide 3 4 1 human errors comprehensive analysis an overwhelming part of marine accidents is attributed to human errors chauvin et al 2013 eliopoulou et al 2016 hanzu pazara et al 2008 macrae 2009 rothblum 2000 weng et al 2019 xue et al 2019b zhang et al 2020 in addition human errors can be present at any stage of the lifecycle of the shipping industry nonetheless due to the universal existence behind most apparent marine accident factors and the oversimplified and improper classification statistics on human factors it is challenging to analyze human errors by utilizing mathematical methods chen et al 2019 wan and chen 2018 therefore we utilized the fishbone diagram to apply the qualitative analysis for human errors in our case human errors the first level category of ship accident causes shown as blue in table 11 are extracted and classified into further two level categories second level category of ship accident causes contains seven contexts of operation errors negligence management errors violate the rules fatigue bad health condition and pilot related incidents respectively belong to human errors show as green in table 11 and fig 17 and the third level contains the equipment operate failures decision failures and ship operation errors belong to operation errors shown as yellow in the web version in table 11 and fig 17 moreover fig 17 illustrates the distribution of different types of human errors based on the accident data investigation in this study these accidents were mainly attributed to negligence and operating errors and operating errors were mainly caused by the factors of lack of emergency operation unmaintained safety distance and over safety speed furthermore the 18 specific influencing factors are listed and explained in detail as shown in table 11 3 4 2 ship conditions qualitative analysis ship conditions failures shown as blue in the web version in table 11 and fig 17 were mainly caused by mechanical failures engine failure or steering gear failure the information provided failures and poor ship conditions shown as green in the web version in table 11 and fig 17 e g lack of maintenance and retirement time limit for old age ship etc it should be highlighted that when it comes to the information provided failures the influencing factors are different from human errors which caused the ship accidents the failures mainly resulting in the communication equipment failure and anti collision system failure for example the equipment e g vhf ecdis or arpa which is used for communication between ships does not work well 3 4 3 traffic environment conditions analysis traffic environment conditions failures are also critical causes for marine accidents shown as blue in the web version in table 11 and fig 17 it is mainly related to the natural environment traffic conditions and channel conditions shown as green in the web version in table 11 and fig 17 some accidents are caused by the natural environment s influencing factors e g bad weather conditions which results in an unsafe situation or poor visibility for oow radar furthermore bad sailing conditions in respect of falling rising tide current waves etc also may lead to ship accidents besides the noise environment may influence the rest of the crew or the decision making of oow which results in an unsafe collision situation traffic conditions for instance high traffic density or the sailing fishing vessel which crosses the waterway also contributing to a shipping accident in addition terrible channel condition is also a common cause for ship accidents e g lack of navigation aids or complex waterway condition etc 4 discussion in this section the phase iv systematic and comprehensive discussion of the proposed framework is conducted from the perspectives of ship accident distribution characteristics accident causes and water traffic safety management 4 1 the distribution characteristics of ship accidents according to the above statistical analysis of water traffic accidents in the fluctuating backwater area fba of the three gorges reservoir tgr from 2009 to 2018 the distribution characteristics of water traffic accidents are summarized as follows first in terms of the categories of accidents the main findings in section 3 3 1 are congruent with the investigated results of kujala et al 2009 there are 100 accident cases were reported to be grounding accounting for 47 60 of all cases the second largest group is ship ship collisions 42 cases 20 00 see fig 2 of kujala et al 2009 youssef and paik 2018 fig 1 in this study shows that 33 of the accidents of oil spills more than 700 tonnes are grounding accidents and agcs 2014 the results indicate that grounding accidents account for 50 of all marine insurance claims more than one million euro in addition the trends in figs 4 and 10 indicated that the total number of accidents and the frequency of the overall ship accidents for different categories both basically had significantly decreased year by year in the fba however as for specific analysis of the trends for various accident categories grounding and collision categories reflect the same characteristics as the overall accident change trend however for other accident categories it is not easy to summarize the specific changing trend due to the limited statistical sample when looking at annual frequencies from the years 2009 2018 2 2 collisions and 11 4 groundings per year table a3 to the frequencies from kujala et al 2009 2 7 for collisions and 11 7 for groundings per year it can be seen that numbers have the same magnitude of order and collisions and groundings are happening more regularly in the gulf of finland during the period under review therefore the management department shall strengthen the management and timely report the information such as bad weather condition or sailing condition reduce the occurrence of accidents especially the grounding and collision accidents and ensure the safety of passing ships second in respect of accident levels there are a total of 173 water traffic accidents of various levels of which there are 15 hazardous and catastrophic accidents 8 67 and 151 minor accidents 87 28 occurred during the ten years under review similarly 92 4 of ship accidents were reported as minor accidents in the gulf of finland kujala et al 2009 and most of the accidents occurred in western shenzhen port were also recognized as minor negligible accidents mou et al 2019 which are also noteworthy overall the number of accidents and casualties decreased by years fig 15 a and there were only minor accidents that happened in 2017 and 2018 table 4 and fig 7 this may be due to the continuous improvement of regulations and the strengthening of relevant maritime regulatory departments management third from the perspective of ship types as shown in fig 8 cargo ship accidents are the most this is congruent with the results shown in fig 2 of chen et al 2019 and table 1 of eliopoulou et al 2016 which indicates that the type of cargo ship counts for the most of the types of marine accidents in the studied scenarios more than half of all accidents 64 14 followed by passenger ship 11 11 and container ship accidents 7 07 this phenomenon is in line with the actual situation in the fba of tgr region of the yangtze river the msa should pay more attention to the cargo ships under its jurisdiction in the fba in addition according to the statistics of ship types by ship accident categories in fig 9 it could be seen that the accident category involving fishing ships is all of the collision accident and the ships all sunk resulting in deaths and economic losses this is maybe caused by poor ship conditions of the fishing ship such as too old age of the ship or lack of maintenance etc therefore stakeholders should focus on the managing the accident caused by fishing ships and conducting targeted inspections and supervisions fourth when it comes to the time which accidents occurred the results of section 3 3 4 are congruent with the changes in the water level in the tgr region each year the annual flooding season of the yangtze river is approximately concentrated in summer and autumn before flooding season i e around april and may the tgr region will discharge the water level to 145 m to ensure there will be enough space to accommodate peak flow in the flooding season in addition after the flooding season the tgr region will impound waters to the high level of 175 m to guarantee electricity generation i e the water level changes quickly in the period of storage and recession it is not easy for the crew to adapt to this change and navigate at a low water level resulting in ship accidents august is within the flooding season when the reservoir runs at a low water level there is abundant precipitation in the yangtze river s upper reaches which leads to turbulent water flow and a challenging waterway environment which is prone to accidents in addition during the high water level operation period i e around november and december the flow speed is slow the navigation conditions are better so fewer accidents occurred though the ship s navigation conditions are relatively good the increase of the wetland area may lead to foggy in fba it still has risks in this period e g 11 accidents occurred in november however groundings had happened mostly in late autumn and in early winter ship ship collisions mostly in february and march shown as fig 3 of kujala et al 2009 therefore for the temporal distribution different regions have different distribution characteristics due to different navigation environments in addition the distribution characteristics of marine and inland ship accidents are also different moreover the main causes of the daily variation of accidents in table 5 may be that there are more ships on the river during the day and the traffic situation is more complicated than the night generally speaking the occurrence of accidents during the period is relatively average and the changing pattern is not obvious in addition the causes of the most prone periods of accidents that occurred in fig 14 may be due to handovers e g the chief and third officer take over at 8 00 and fatigue maneuvering fifth as for the accidents location as shown in fig 16 the distribution of accidents is mainly concentrated in the areas of chaotianmen 104 chaotianmen is located at the yangtze river s junction and the jialing river one of the nine major tributaries of the yangtze river chaotianmen is the hub of the two rivers and the largest waterway ferry terminal in chongqing thus there has a heavy traffic flow and it is also hard to maneuver ships for the crew in this region and need good seamanship it is consistent with the ship accident prone areas of tgr see fig 5 of jiang et al 2016 in addition the maritime supervision department should take measures to monitor and strengthen safety management in the mentioned accidents frequently occurred areas segments in section 3 3 5 and passing ships should also pay attention to enhancing safety awareness and the sailing condition when navigating in these areas with the continuous construction and development of the economy in the yangtze river s upper reaches it is foreseeable that the water traffic density may increase and the risk of water traffic accidents in this area will increase accordingly the stakeholders and managers should pay attention to the development trend of water traffic accidents in this water area last as far as the losses of ship accidents basically the overall number of accidents casualties and shipwrecks has shown a decreasing tendency this situation may be due to the help of advanced navigation technology and gradually improved management rules and the number of accidents has gradually decreased the overall economic loss has shown a decreasing tendency but this is susceptible to hazardous major accidental losses so they sometimes fluctuate significantly in different years in addition the findings of the cargo ships total losses in section 3 3 6 are in line with the results of agcs 2018 cargo vessels account for 471 1129 41 72 of the total losses by type of vessel from 2008 to 2017 and eliopoulou et al 2016 which indicates that the general cargo ships exhibit the highest percentage of total ship losses moreover in our case the annual traffic volume s influence is not so obvious when calculating the frequency of the accidents in fba but to draw robust conclusions the scholars and stakeholders should adjust to specific traffic data when applying the proposed framework and employing a similar analysis in the present paper especially when the data samples are small and distributed along the studied years or separated by different accident ship type categories furthermore it needs to be noted that in table a3 sink represents the shipwreck that directly happened in specific ship accidents however in other ship accident categories shipwreck still possible happens for instance the case of accident id 210 from the investigation report of chongqing msa at 03 25 on may 20 2014 the cargo ship gangchang qingji no 1 dry cargo ship of chongqing yuanbeier shipping co ltd grounded when it sailed across the waters of fanchangwan later it got free and was about to save itself at mingyuetu finally it capsized and wrecked in the area of jigongzui ten people fell into the water nine people were rescued and one person was missing this case is classified into the category of grounding but it still has a shipwreck that occurred therefore for section 3 3 6 table 7 it is stated that there were 28 shipwrecks however in table a3 only 12 sunk ships are recorded 4 2 the causes of ship accidents the elements of human errors ship conditions and traffic environment are the main elements for systematic accident causes analysis of the maritime transportation system and the elements may interact with each other jiang et al 2020 moreover investigation reports contain the detailed process of ship accident and the identified accident causes by the investigation authority e g fatigue of the crew difficult operating conditions loss of watchkeeping inappropriate regulations mechanical failure decision failures and poor manning of a vessel etc chauvin et al 2013 wang et al 2005 such information can be utilized to identify the influencing factors on the collision as well as provide guidelines for cause consequence analysis martins and maturana 2013 in respect of human errors as is well known are one of the significant contributors to marine accidents chauvin et al 2013 macrae 2009 weng et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 human reliability which is to identify and analyze the cause consequences of human errors systematically groth and swiler 2013 the direct causes of ship accidents are shown in fig 17 it is obvious that human errors were the leading cause of these accidents as shown in fig 17 and table 11 on the whole 21 causes involve human errors far more than the other two elements 6 causes and 7 causes respectively likely due to low safety awareness of the officers on watch oow sailing in the fba of tgr region specifically some crew members have a low level of education insufficient knowledge of water traffic regulations sailing based on experience and intuition unauthorized maneuvering foggy sailing illegal night sailing overload etc occur from time to time in addition the crew s safety awareness is weak and non compliance with duty and improper operation often happens for example during the recession period the navigable conditions in the fba gradually deteriorate some oow eased their vigilance and safety awareness while on duty resulting in ship accidents table 4 from wang et al 2005 indicates that the crew s negligence accounts for a high proportion of fishing ship accidents this is congruent with the findings from section 3 4 1 moreover in terms of management errors insufficient supervision and inadequate handling of ship violations by the msa it is easy to ignore the management of the accident prone segments and periods the problem may be more severe in some similar water areas due to insufficient safety investments and lack of safety supervision thus the managers should strengthen the management of crew and ships to reduce accidents caused by human factors e g the crew s negligence on duty and inopportune operation etc as well as pay more attention to build new regulations and guidelines improve crew training schemes and safety education when it comes to ships conditions overall the three gorges project dam has improved the navigation conditions in the fba which mainly benefits from the dam s function of increasing the yangtze river s shipping capacity however the increased frequency of ship traffic increases the rate of crossings and the potential for collisions in addition the category of sink ship accidents ranks third place among all types of accidents figs 5 and 6 to some extent it reflects the characteristics of severe aging of some ships in the fba moreover the ship s inspection and repair organization failed to overhaul the mechanical equipment failure in time and maintain the ships regularly and properly which may lead to hidden dangers for the ship s accident without regular maintenance the ship is seriously corroded and it is easy to cause damage to the cabin in accidents of grounding or collision e g the fishing ships illustrated in fig 9 were all sunk poor ship conditions of lacking maintenance may cause this regarding traffic environment conditions when the natural environment changes the channel conditions and traffic conditions often change accordingly the water level in the fba changes significantly and the oow is not easy to adapt in time when the water level of the tgr rises or falls the water level changes by nearly 30 m and the riverbank topography continues to change especially during the recession and storage periods among them may which is in the recession period is the most obvious which is also a period of frequent ship accidents occurred figs 11 and 12 during the recession period specific segments that are originally navigable are no longer available some reefs that were initially submerged in the high water level and did not pose a hazard become obstacles which always results in grounding accidents furthermore in the flood control period fba restores the characteristics of the natural water area the water level drops and the flow velocity increases the cause is significantly affected by the flood increasing ship maneuvering difficulty and ship accident possibility moreover in the water storage period or high water level period it may cause river channels siltation increasing ship grounding possibility besides the impoundment of tgr may widen the river slow the flow rate and increase the probability of the fogging phenomenon which also increases the risk of navigation in addition during the water storage period or recession period the water level rises or falls every day the setting for navigation aids lags behind the time of water level change which also may make it difficult for the ship to look out and adapt timely note that due to the research on statistical analysis for the characteristics and causes of ship accidents that occurred in the inland water areas especially in the fba of tgr region and other similar areas it is still scanty so the comparative cases in section 4 1 and section 4 2 are mainly from the ocean s ship accidents however even though the sensoria and the specific environment may differ for the inland and ocean ships some common characteristics for the ship accidents can still be analyzed and summarized for offering suggestions for ship safety management 4 3 water traffic safety management except for human errors ship conditions traffic environment management is another prominent influence element for the maritime transportation system he et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 wu et al 2020 the prevention and supervision of water traffic accidents is the core of organization and management in addition water traffic safety management is a systematic problem which involves many government departments for instance the ship inspection department is mainly responsible for the ship s technical status the msa is mostly accountable for the management of ship registration penalties for violations assessment and examination for the ship crew the waterway department is primarily responsible for the maintenance of the waterway etc any supervision and management process is an integral part of the entire system bye and aalberg 2018 yıldırım et al 2019 the causes of water traffic accidents are multi faceted in addition to strengthening the management of the different departments coordination between them is also essential the investigation handling and statistics of water traffic accidents are the ex post management of the msa in accordance with relevant laws during the investigation and handling of ship accidents maritime management authorities often focus on identifying the accident causes and the determination of the accident responsibilities nonetheless they often ignore the summary of accident lessons wan and chen 2018 which is the core of the investigation and handling of water traffic accidents accident types number of accidents number of casualties direct economic loss and other statistical indicators reflect not only the safety status of the specific waters but also the basis of decision making for water traffic safety management therefore through the statistical analysis of the ten years ship accidents in the fba area this study provides an excellent significant reference basis for the msa and other stakeholders to summarize the ship accidents characteristics and causes 5 conclusions frequent water traffic accidents pose severe threats to human life and property safety and the prevention and supervision of water traffic accidents is the core of management this study proposes a comprehensive hierarchical and systematic ship accident characteristics and causes analysis framework and demonstrates its value by summarizing and visualizing the characteristics as well as investigating and exploring the losses of these ship accidents through the statistical and comparative analysis of the historical data from 2009 to 2018 in the fluctuating backwater area fba of the three gorges reservoir tgr region meanwhile this paper presents some potential countermeasures and suggestions for accident prevention and supervision as well as provides decision making support for ship navigation safety management in the fba of tgr region for chongqing msa the main findings in the study area could be addressed in two aspects as follows i in respect of statistical analysis of the characteristics for ship accidents a grounding accident is the most common ship accident compared with other ship accident categories accounting for 65 90 and there are 115 ships the reason has been investigated to be grounding accounting for 58 08 of all number of ships involved in various accidents b approximately 87 28 of the investigated accidents are minor accidents and there were only minor accidents that happened in 2017 and 2018 c cargo ships are the most frequently involved in ship accidents compared with different accident ship types and the accident category involving fishing ships is all of the collision accident and the ships all sunk in addition all the accidents about the category tanker are grounding accidents d concerning spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of ship accidents there are 104 ship accidents which occurred in chaotianmen accounting for 60 12 of the total number of accidents in 10 years more ship accidents occurred in may and mainly happened during the daytime the total number of accidents and the frequency of the overall ship accidents for different categories both tend to decrease year by year except small fluctuations in specific years e ship accidents can threaten the safety of human life and property and cause substantial economic losses the overall number of accidents casualties and shipwrecks has shown a decreasing tendency and the overall economic loss has shown a decreasing tendency but this is susceptible to hazardous major accidental losses ii furthermore in terms of the causes of ship accidents human errors unsafe ship conditions and harsh traffic environment conditions are identified and classified as the main risk categories leading to the investigated water traffic accidents among them human errors were the main cause of these accidents and were mainly attributed to crew negligence and operating errors therefore faced with the specific situation of marine safety the maritime authorities need to pay more attention to ship accidents above characteristics giving an early warning and monitoring for the inland ship under the scope of their jurisdiction meanwhile strengthen safety training for the maritime practitioners to enhance their professional operation skills and sense of responsibility the potential contributions and impacts of this paper are threefold i the proposed comprehensive hierarchical and systematic framework consists of the following steps of data collection and processing scenario identification data analysis causes recognition and classification and systematic and comprehensive discussion could be potentially applied for ship accident characteristics analysis and influential factors recognition and investigation in the tgr region for chongqing msa and other stakeholders who are responsible for similar situations worldwide e g the region of the river of caroni in venezuela and paraná spans brazil and paraguay etc as long as the area with a water conservancy project such as a hydropower station forms an fba however it should be adjusted according to the specific scenario due to the various weather conditions and navigation environment ii the research findings could help the relevant maritime practitioners and authorities strengthen the safety management of ships crew and traffic environments to eliminate potential safety risks and hazards and avoid or reduce the occurrence of water traffic accidents iii this paper could provide support for the scholars and stakeholders to explore navigation safety improvement measures from the perspective of determining insurance liability through the identified specific risk factors of accident causes under the categories of human errors unsafe ship conditions and harsh traffic environment conditions as for the limitation of this paper although the water traffic accident analysis can reflect its core characteristics and causes in many cases especially with limited statistical samples it is impossible to summarize and reveal the specific accident characteristics and find the corresponding connections between related characteristics and causes moreover it is also hard to propose targeted accident prevention guidelines and safety recommendations for various types of ships according to different navigation conditions additionally although once the accident analysis has been completed the guidelines obtained from analysis results based on the proposed framework could comprehensively and directly help relevant authorities strengthen the related safety management somehow to achieve the goal of accident precaution and risk mitigation however the present framework mainly focuses on the post accident characteristics and causal analysis in the future we will further analyze the causes of accidents in specific geographical areas of the fba conduct the quantitative analysis of specific accident causations and utilize data mining clustering techniques risk assessment etc methods to carry out the comprehensive pre accident prediction analysis and post accident characteristics and causal analysis to explore more detailed safety management strategies for ship accidents under various scenarios credit authorship contribution statement jie xue conceptualization methodology software formal

20808,frequent water traffic accidents pose severe threats to human life and property safety the water environment and adverse effects on social stability understanding historical accidents is essential for accident prevention and risk mitigation however at present research on the comprehensive statistical analysis of characteristics and causes of ship accidents that occurred in the inland water areas of the yangtze river especially in the fluctuating backwater area fba of three gorges reservoir tgr region is still scanty even less a hierarchical and systematic analysis framework therefore this paper proposes a comprehensive ship accident characteristics and causes analysis framework and summarizes and visualizes the characteristics of ship accidents through the statistical and comparative analysis of historical data in terms of categories and severity of accidents ship types involved in accidents spatial and temporal distribution characteristics ship accident losses and root causes and lessons learned from the related accidents in order to demonstrate the value of the proposed framework based on the official sources ten years of ship accident data from 2009 to 2018 in the fba of tgr region are collected and analyzed in detail on the basis of the results this paper summarizes accident prevention and supervision guidelines to provide decision support for maritime safety this research is of significance to the water traffic accident precaution and risk mitigation in this region and can be useful for other similar specific scenarios worldwide keywords ship accidents marine traffic safety three gorges reservoir fluctuating backwater area statistical and comparative analysis data visualization 1 introduction with the continuous development of the trade and economy worldwide water transportation is becoming increasingly busy ships are being designed or build bigger and more specialized ships speed is increasing as well xue et al 2019a coupled with the increase in the density of water traffic the navigation environment of ships is gradually deteriorating resulting in frequent water traffic accidents which causes the stakeholders to pay more attention to the risk of maritime shipping akyuz and celik 2014 goerlandt and montewka 2015 thus water transportation is recognized as a high risk industry meanwhile maritime transportation is crucial for the integrated transportation system in addition various accidents e g ship collisions and groundings frequently result in substantial environmental pollution economic losses and casualties mou et al 2010 yip 2008 therefore maritime safety becomes one of the most critical research areas for water transportation and academia and managers have been focusing on specific high risk regions nowadays as an essential supplement to the global maritime transportation framework inland waterway transportation has played a significant role between the domestic and international shipping markets transporting mass cargo to inland cities at relatively economic costs recently inland shipping s rapid development has highlighted the significant vital strategic position of inland waterways e g the yangtze river shi et al 2019 the yangtze river is the third longest river globally after the amazon and the nile its mainstream has a total length of more than 6300 km it is also the first longest and most developed inland water transportation system in china simultaneously it is a vital transportation artery that connects the coast with southwest china and central china the three gorges hydroelectric power station also named three gorges project dam spans the yangtze river in yichang hubei province china shown as fig 2 it is also the largest engineering project ever built in china and enhanced the yangtze river s shipping capacity the three gorges reservoir will go through four stages each year water storage period high water level period recession period and flood control period during the four stages the water level changes accordingly each year thus the fluctuating backwater area fba will be formed bao et al 2015 shown as fig 3 from the boundary of the reservoir to the end of the perennial backwater area when the water level of the reservoir is between 145 m minimum water level and 175 m maximum water level it presents the dual characteristics of natural river channels and artificial reservoirs zhang et al 2019 in other words the fba is a reservoir after the flooding season and the waterway s annual water level during the flooding season changes between 0 m and 30 m additionally the navigation conditions of the main channel and branch channels have significantly changed after the three gorges project has stored water to a maximum water level of 175 m in general the navigation conditions of the fba of the tgr region are worse than those of the reservoir area as the water level changes at different stages of the operation of the tgr water transportation in different water levels shows different characteristics thus the navigation conditions in the fba are relatively complicated which has a significant impact on ships navigation safety and brings maritime management challenges for the stakeholders water traffic accidents are generally characterized by difficulties in search and rescue and it is likely to cause severe economic losses and social impacts for example the particularly significant catastrophic in water transportation history ship capsizing accident of eastern star also named dongfang zhi xing this accident occurred at 21 32 on june 1 2015 in the yangtze river damazhou waterway in jianli county hubei province china all the persons fell into the water and only 12 survived the accident resulted in 442 deaths in the end it is the most severe inland shipping capsizing incident since the founding of the people s republic of china in 1949 wang et al 2018 therefore the analysis of water traffic accidents and maritime safety risks has become an important and hot topic and attracted widespread attention from researchers in various countries altan 2019 aziz et al 2019 balmat et al 2009 2011 banda et al 2015 du et al

prone region zhang et al 2013 utilized the fsa concept to establish a risk model by considering both probability and consequences of accidents regarding a risk matrix method to estimate the yangtze river s navigational risk martins and maturana 2010 applied the fta as preliminary trees and compared them with the chaining of dangerous collision events and grounding accidents to give a qualitative

thus to evaluate marine accidents in a stepwise way that is inaccurately judged by the experts wu et al 2017 developed an evidential reasoning based cream to estimate the human error probability and conduct human reliability analysis of a maritime accident chauvin et al 2013 presented a modified hfacs to analyze human and organizational factors in collisions the study indicated that decision errors resulting in most collisions and bridge resource management is significant for navigation in restricted waters fu et al 2018 recommended a frank copula based fuzzy eta approach along with the associated uncertainties to quantitatively assess the potential risks of ship accidents in arctic waters moreover to provide comprehensive assessments of ship accidents characteristics and causes the statistical analysis and investigation of historical marine accidents is another efficient analysis method it is one of the fundamental techniques for the aforementioned approaches typical studies of risk analysis for marine accidents utilized statistical analysis and investigation method as follows wang et al 2005 collected the accidents on fishing vessels from the marine accident investigation branch to analyze and determine the most common causes and real safety problems of these accidents antão et al 2008 applied statistical analysis to identify the main organizational and systemic causes

the uk ronza et al 2003 developed the event tree analysis based on the selected 828 accidents of port areas to predict the accident frequency and determine the probability of various accident scenarios however until the present research on comprehensive statistical analysis for the characteristics and causes of ship accidents that occurred in the inland water areas of the yangtze river especially in the fba of tgr region is still scanty even less a hierarchical and systematic investigation framework for characteristics and causes analysis of ship accidents therefore the present study attempts to propose a comprehensive ship accident characteristics and causes analysis framework and conduct a case study to demonstrate the value of the framework by characterizing the ship accidents in the fba of tgr region under the scope of jurisdiction of the chongqing maritime safety administration msa from 2009 to 2018 from these analyses of the historical data we summarize and

identification and data analysis and phase iii causes recognition and classification is introduced in the sub sections 3 1 data collection and processing the data sources of ship accidents used in this study including accidents and incidents investigation reports were collected from chongqing maritime safety administration msa where accidents occurred and reported to the maritime safety administration of the people s republic of china cmsa chongqing msa is an administrative law enforcement government agency set up by the changjiang msa which is one of the 15 regional msas under the ministry of transport of the people s republic of china on the yangtze river its functions are to administer all matters related to maritime and shipping safety of chongqing including supervising maritime traffic safety and security preventing pollution from ships implementing water search and rescue performing marine accident investigation etc the chongqing msa staff regularly summarizes the detailed accident data within the jurisdiction to form an accident database then submits the data to the cmsa each record of the accident incident including information of the time seasonality ship type accident type accident location loading condition and a description of the accidents and incidents process etc in this study the accident and incident reports were sorted out and analyzed in detail and the useful information concerning ship accident was extracted e g the casualties economic losses and then combine with the historical statistics record from chongqing msa thus the original data set were settled in addition the missing data were completed and the statistical error information e g segment calibration error the accident that belongs to fba perennial backwater area or natural water area is incorrectly classified was deleted by utilizing data cleaning technique moreover the same type of data was standardized e g unified units and formats the specific information was extracted and mining based on the purpose of the analysis procedure by the computer coding through python finally the complete data set concerning 173 ship accidents that occurred and reported to the cmsa in the fba of tgr region from 2009 to 2018 were collected and reorganized 3 2 scenario identification 3 2 1 three gorges reservoir region three gorges dam has been the largest power generation facility globally in terms of installed capacity 22 50 mw since 2012 bao et al 2015 cleveland and morris 2013 ehrlich and geller 2017 it is also the largest engineering project ever built in china and the most critical water control project along the yangtze river nilsson et al 2005 xu et al 2013 in addition to producing electricity the dam also has the function of increasing the yangtze river s shipping capacity by giving flood storage space the dam diminishes the potential of flooding downstream as shown in fig 2 the upper yangtze river basin is located in the southwest of china the region covering the reach of the yangtze river from three gorges dam yichang to jiangjin lies in the upper yangtze river basin commonly known as three gorges reservoir tgr the mainstream of the yangtze river in chongqing district is located in the southwest mountainous area of china the waters under the chongqing msa jurisdiction include 680 7 km of the mainstream and 41 5 km of intersection tributary waters of the yangtze river the chongqing msa mainly includes 12 maritime departments in yongchuan jiangjin banan chaotianmen changshou fuling fengdu zhongxian wanzhou yunyang fengjie and wushan respectively and one maritime bureau communication and information center moreover except for yongchuan the other 11 maritime departments are located in the tgr region fig 2 among them the statistic of chongqing msa shows that the region ship accidents occurred within the fluctuating backwater area fba are from banan chaotianmen changshou and fuling partly 3 2 2 fluctuating backwater area in this study the fba refers to the area along tgr banks bounded by 145 m minimum water level and 175 m maximum water level of the tgr it is a physical area undergoing an annually cyclic inundation and exposure due to the tgr operation the tgr will undergo an annually cyclic inundation and exposure through four stages high water level period water storage period recession period and flood control period during the four stages of water level change each year the fba will be formed thus fba is a dynamic river section that changes from part of the reservoir to natural water areas in different water levels liro 2019 in fluvial geomorphology a river section temporarily inundated by water from a downstream dam reservoir is typically called a fluctuating backwater or backwater zone lajczak 2006 liro 2014 2019 in our case the fba is a river section upstream of a reservoir that is inundated during reservoir stages higher than the minimal water level fig 3a in addition it may also be treated as a part of river dominated transitional and reservoir dominated transitional zones skalak et al 2013 table 1 describes the zones which are adjacent or situated to fba as shown in fig 3 the fba perennial backwater area and natural water area coexist in the waterway upon the tgr the fba is the dynamic area extended from the reservoir s boundary to the end of the perennial backwater area note that the dam reservoir and fba are dynamic when the water level changes the higher the water level rises the further the dam reservoir extends specifically when the water level is 145 m the dam reservoir boundary is also the waterline of the perennial backwater area when the water level is 175 m the dam reservoir will be extended upstream for a further distance and the extended waterway area is the fba jiang et al 2020 after the three gorges dam impounded to the maximum water level of 175 m high water level period the navigation conditions of the mainstream and tributaries of waterways changed significantly bringing new challenges for navigation safety during this period the ship s navigation conditions are relatively good the scale of the water waterway is increased and the water flow becomes stable however the increase of the wetland area may lead to foggy in fba worsen navigation visibility and bring new hidden dangers to navigation safety during the water storage period the water level in the tgr area gradually moved to the maximum water level of 175 m the waterways of fba present new characteristics the water depth increases the channel widens the flow rate slows and the narrow curved section decreases and the navigation conditions are improved when the water level of the reservoir between 145 m minimum water level and 175 m maximum water level it presents the dual characteristics of natural river channels and artificial reservoirs zhang et al 2019 the annual water level of the waterway during the flooding season changes between 0 m and 30 m in the recession period the water level gradually becomes lower to a minimum water level of 145 m the waterway of the fba is characterized by natural water areas with increased flow velocity turbulent flow patterns and increased obstructive reefs the waterways are curved narrow and shallow which significantly impacts shipping safety and the risk of ship accidents is increasing additionally some details for different operation periods in the fba including the water level changing characteristics and related hydrologic conditions are illustrated by jiang et al 2020 the navigation conditions of the fba are generally worse than the common perennial backwater area as the water level changes at different tgr operation stages resulting in the water traffic presents different characteristics the navigation conditions in the fba are more complicated which has a significant impact on navigation safety and poses challenges to maritime safety and management therefore it is a crucial water area for the water transportation safety management of china table a1 presents the number of accidents that occurred in different water areas of the tgr region and table a2 details the traffic volume statistics for different water areas then the frequency of ship accidents could be obtained by calculating the number of accidents and annual traffic volume e g the frequency of ship accident in fba of 2009 the number of accidents annual traffic volume 35 220 365 35 80 209 4 36e 04 note that the annual traffic volume average daily traffic volume 365 the detailed results for the frequency of ship accidents in fba are shown in table a7 similarly the frequency of ship accidents in the other two areas i e perennial backwater area and natural water area could be obtained as well as shown in fig 4 fba has the most significant number of accidents followed by perennial backwater area and natural water area moreover the overall tendency of fig 4 illustrates that the number of accidents in different water areas tends to decrease year by year there are small fluctuations in certain years e g the accidents occurred in 2016 and 2017 within fba as for the frequency of accidents the overall trends for the frequency of ship accident s occurrence in fba and perennial backwater area are in accordance with the changing trends of the number of accidents in corresponding water areas for the natural water area due to the number of statistical samples is relatively small and the annual traffic volume in this area is less than the other two areas thus the frequency is more sensitive small changes in the number of accidents can easily cause drastic changes in numerical results e g the frequencies in 2016 and 2017 and the changes and fluctuations for the related frequency of ship accidents are relatively large than the other two areas overall fig 4 indicates that the fba is the most high risk region compared to the other two areas in terms of the number of accidents or the frequency of accidents except for some specific years therefore we select the fba as the studied area to explore the characteristics and root causes of ship accidents thus to propose accident prevention and supervision suggestions to provide decision support for the stakeholders and managers 3 3 ship accident analysis 3 3 1 ship accident categories there are eight categories of ship accidents that occurred in fba they are grounding sink fire collision contact damage dragging wind and others note that the definitions are taken and adapted from emsa 2020 shown as table 2 among them grounding collision and sink accidents are the first three most significant categories of ship accidents that happened in the studied area accounting for 65 90 12 72 6 94 respectively shown as table a3 and fig 5 to further explore the characteristics of ship accident categories we specifically addressed the distribution of various ship types in each ship accident category as shown in fig 6 and table a4 there are 115 ships 58 08 of all number of ships involved in various accidents the reason has been investigated to be grounding followed by collision 44 ships 22 22 and accident of sink 13

2015 is divided into the following five categories i e minor ordinary major and hazardous and catastrophic according to factors e g casualties direct economic losses or environmental pollution of waters table 3 describes the classification criteria for different accident levels moreover approximately 87 28 of accidents are in the level of minor for the studied inland area as shown in table 4 in addition fig 7 indicates the trend of each level from a yearly perspective there were four and two hazardous accidents that occurred in 2011 and 2014 respectively with the same proportion of 16 67 moreover in 2017 and 2018 only minor accidents happened 3 3 3 ship types involved in accidents fig 8 indicates the distribution of the ship types involved in accidents of the studied area it is seen that cargo ships are the most frequently involved in ship accidents with 64 14 of total accidents in the database followed by passenger ship and container ship 11 11 and 7 07 respectively while the tug and working ship have the least number of accidents accounting for 1 01 fig 9 illustrates the statistics of ship types by ship accident categories in the fba note that the accident category involving fishing ships is all of the collision accident and the ships all sunk in addition all the accidents about the category tanker are grounding accidents 3 3 4 temporal distribution characteristics we utilize a stacked bar chart fig 10 to describe the basically decreasing trend for the frequency of accidents and each ship accident category and their proportion at a yearly level the frequency of different ship accident categories can be obtained based on the data of table a2 and table a3 and the calculation example is illustrated in section 3 2 2 and related results are shown in table a7 among them grounding accidents are the most common and need to be early warned and monitored because they have the highest percentage of various ship accident statistics note that 65 90 of ship accidents are grounding accidents accounting for more than half the number of all accidents fig 5 therefore the trend of grounding accidents has the most significant influence on the trend of total accidents in addition fig 10 indicates that the frequency of the overall ship accidents for different categories tends to decrease year by year there are small fluctuations in 2016 and 2017 however as for the trends of various accident categories specific analysis is needed for the categories of grounding collision and sink they reflect the same characteristics as the overall accident change trend but for other accident categories it is not easy to summarize the specific change trend because of the limited statistical samples fig 11 presents the distribution of ship accidents at a monthly level by utilizing the heat map fig 12 is a statistic using a stacked column chart for the ship accidents that occurred by month per accident category see the original data in table a5 the occurrence frequency indicates a downward trend from may after an upward movement from january to may except for november figs 11 and 12 indicate that according to the month in which the accident occurred most of the ship accidents had happened from may to august 40 25 20 and 18 respectively table a5 however december october and january are relatively few 2 5 and 6 respectively moreover grounding occurred mostly in may and june collision mainly in april and november this is congruent with the water level changes in the tgr region the specific explanation is given in section 4 1 4 table 5 demonstrates the daily variation of accidents fewer accidents occurred between 00 00 to 06 00 and 18 00 to 24 00 and more accidents occurred between 06 00 to 12 00 and 12 00 to 18 00 to further explore ship accidents characteristics we utilize a wind rose diagram to explain ship accidents time distribution characteristics at an hourly level see the original data in table a6 fig 13 described the accidents that mainly occurred and concentrated in 2009 to 2013 as shown in fig 14 the most prone periods of accidents occurred 07 00 to 08 00 09 00 to 10 00 and 18 00 to 19 00 respectively 3 3 5 spatial distribution characteristics according to the investigation of ship accident reports for chongqing msa 173 ship accidents occurred in the fba of tgr region among them 35 accidents occurred under the jurisdiction of the department of banan 104 in chaotianmen 10 in fuling and 24 in changshou respectively as known that the yangtze river is divided into three parts upstream yibin to yichang middle stream yichang to wuhan and downstream wuhan to changjiangkou the upstream channel mileage refers to the distance from zhongshui gate and the unit is km we normalize the data of fba within the scope of more detailed regional difference for various segments and explore the number of accidents that occurred per km thus to figure out the region where accidents occurred most common as shown in table 6 the average accident frequency for the fba is 0 98 the average accident frequency means the frequency of the total number of accidents occurred within the whole segment 173 721 544 0 98 there are 15 segments that have a higher accident frequency than the average level wangjiatan zaomenzi luoqi gaogankou jinjisanbe lengfanqi lengfanqi malingzi malingzi hongmiao feieqi guojiatuo guojiatuo kuzhubei mabutan zhuerqi zhuerqi shanhuba shanhuba sanjiaoqi sanjiaoqi huangjiaqi huangjiaqi huangcaoping xiejiaba fueryan shengbandui jinjiayan jixinshi zhanqizi among them the accident frequency for the segments of sanjiaoqi huangjiaqi jinjisanbei lengfanqi wangjiatan zaomenzi and huangjiaqi huangcaoping are as high as 3 14 2 80 2 33 and 2 14 respectively exceeded the average accident frequency 0 98 in addition the six segments where accidents occurred six years or more in 10 years are jinjisanbei lengfanqi malingzi hongmiao feieqi guojiatuo sanjiaoqi huangjiaqi huangjiaqi huangcaoping jixinshi zhanqizi respectively moreover from table 6 we could see that these six segments accident frequency also exceeds the average accident frequency 3 3 6 shipwrecks casualties and economic losses of ship accidents statistical trends can reflect the changing rules of accidents thus finding effective management strategies and core points that need to be analyzed and explored for accident causes as shown in table 7 there are a total of 173 accidents occurred in the fluctuating backwater from 2009 to 2018 resulting in 38 casualties dead missing 28 shipwrecks listing capsizing and direct economic losses of 21 10 million cny fig 15 a presents the ship accident loss by year interval which indicates that the number of ship accidents casualties and shipwrecks is declining however the economic losses sometimes fluctuate significantly in specific years ship accidents generally caused enormous losses to get further details and interpretation of the economic loss peaks in the years 2013 and 2015 table 7 we specifically analyze and explore two major accidents that occurred in 2013 and 2015 see the green point in the web version in fig 15 a respectively from table 8 we can see that the economic loss for accident id 204 is 2 00 million cny accounts for about 61 16 of the total economic loss of ship accidents in 2013 similarly for the case of accident id 236 the economic loss 2 80 million cny accounts for about 73 73 of the total economic loss that happened in 2015 table 7 and fig 15 b illustrate the ship accidents and casualties evolution at a yearly level the average ratio of casualties accidents within fba is 0 22 fig 15 b demonstrates that 2009 and 2013 have the highest ratio of 0 40 followed by 2016 0 33 2011 0 25 2012 0 24 2015 0 22 and 2014 0 17 respectively note that if the traffic has increased during the same period the increase of accidents may not be so visible rapid as the amount of traffic the frequency of the accidents or casualties may become lower which may mean a safety situation improvement however generally speaking the number of accidents or casualties will increase according to an increase in the amount of traffic nevertheless as shown in table a2 in our case the annual traffic volume in the studied area from 2009 to 2018 has stabilized basically not changing much ranging from 80 000 to 95 000 approximately therefore the annual traffic volume s influence is not so obvious when calculating the frequency of the accidents in fba see fig 4 moreover in the perspective of the specific period the traffic data could be ignored as a common denominator when calculating the ratio the annual traffic volume may influence the indications for casualties and accidents separately but the changes for the ratio casualties accidents will not be influenced separately by the number of accidents or casualties it still could reflect the safety situation in the specific year fig 15 c and table 9 illustrates the statistics of the losses by ship types there are 127 cargo ships most got involved in ship accidents and resulting in 30 casualties most 22 shipwrecks most and 13 88 million cny economic losses most ranked the first place followed by passenger ships 22 ships involved in casualties and 2 74 million cny economic losses container ships 14 ships involved in casualties and 1 84 million cny economic losses respectively note that though the total economic losses of fishing ship accidents are not as high as the cargo ships passenger ships etc and its ratio of economic losses per ship 0 10 million cny total economic losses divided by the number of fishing ships involved in accidents is also lower than the average ratio for all ship types 0 11 however it has the highest ratio of casualties per ship 1 67 the number of casualties divided by the number of fishing ships involved in accidents and the highest ratio of shipwrecks per ship 0 67 the number of shipwrecks divided by the number of fishing ships involved in accidents and both indicators are higher than the average level during the period under review average ratio of casualties is 0 19 and the average ratio of shipwrecks is 0 14 in addition as shown in fig 15 c the changing tendency of the casualties shipwrecks and economic losses caused by various ship types is basically congruent with the changing trend of the number of ships for each ship type fig 15 d and table 9 indicate the distribution of the losses by ship accident categories there are 114 accidents most of grounding resulting in 3 casualties 9 shipwrecks and 9 12 million cny economic losses most followed by 22 collision accidents lead to 14 casualties 5 shipwrecks and 2 17 million cny economic losses and 12 accidents involved in a sink including listing capsizing resulting in 20 casualties most 12 shipwrecks most and 6 21 million cny economic losses note that the highest ratio of casualties per accident is 1 67 sink the number of casualties divided by the number of accidents followed by 0 64 collision both higher than the average 0 22 in addition the economic losses and shipwrecks of accidents caused by the sink are all ranking the highest ratio in both categories 0 52 total economic losses divided by the number of accidents 1 00 the number of shipwrecks divided by the number of accidents and both exceed the average 0 12 0 16 respectively followed by the collision category s ratio 0 64 for casualties and 0 23 for shipwrecks both exceed the corresponding average in addition the economic losses caused by dragging ranked the second highest ratio 0 38 million cny per accident moreover as shown in fig 15 d the changing tendency of the economic losses caused by different ship accident categories is basically the same as the changing trend of the number of ship accidents for various ship accident categories moreover fig 16 and table 10 indicate that the number of ship accidents in chaotianmen is more extensive than in the other three places still fuling has the highest ratio of casualties accidents and the ratio of chaotianmen and fuling both exceed the average ratio in fba as well as fba and perennial backwater area only counts the data of fuling moreover similar to the aforementioned in terms of a specific studied area the influence of the annual traffic volume could be ignored as a common denominator when calculating the ratio i e once the number of accidents and casualties is certain the ratio of casualties accidents could be obtained and certain as well furthermore since fuling spans the fba and perennial backwater area the ratio for it is different in terms of the scope of fba and the overall the tgr region note that the ratio of fuling within fba is as high as 0 60 which indicates that the stakeholders and officers on watch oow should pay more attention to this area when maneuvering ships across it 3 4 accident causes recognition and classification the maritime transportation system is comprehensive and complex and mainly composed of the elements of human ship and environment in addition hazards identified from these elements are widely used to define the risk factors of ship accident causes fan et al 2020a he et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 wu et al 2020 therefore in this section the underlying causes of maritime accidents and the lessons learned from these accidents in terms of human errors ship conditions and traffic environment conditions are recognized and investigated show as blue in table 11 in order to analyze the causes of ship accidents in a more comprehensive and detailed manner a fishbone diagram was used fig 17 the fishbone diagram provides a qualitative approach for analyzing in more detail the causes of ship accidents in the fba and it allows scholars and stakeholders to check the causes of accidents in their research area quickly combined with table 11 it could be potentially applied for ship accident causes recognition and investigation in the fba and similar situations worldwide 3 4 1 human errors comprehensive analysis an overwhelming part of marine accidents is attributed to human errors chauvin et al 2013 eliopoulou et al 2016 hanzu pazara et al 2008 macrae 2009 rothblum 2000 weng et al 2019 xue et al 2019b zhang et al 2020 in addition human errors can be present at any stage of the lifecycle of the shipping industry nonetheless due to the universal existence behind most apparent marine accident factors and the oversimplified and improper classification statistics on human factors it is challenging to analyze human errors by utilizing mathematical methods chen et al 2019 wan and chen 2018 therefore we utilized the fishbone diagram to apply the qualitative analysis for human errors in our case human errors the first level category of ship accident causes shown as blue in table 11 are extracted and classified into further two level categories second level category of ship accident causes contains seven contexts of operation errors negligence management errors violate the rules fatigue bad health condition and pilot related incidents respectively belong to human errors show as green in table 11 and fig 17 and the third level contains the equipment operate failures decision failures and ship operation errors belong to operation errors shown as yellow in the web version in table 11 and fig 17 moreover fig 17 illustrates the distribution of different types of human errors based on the accident data investigation in this study these accidents were mainly attributed to negligence and operating errors and operating errors were mainly caused by the factors of lack of emergency operation unmaintained safety distance and over safety speed furthermore the 18 specific influencing factors are listed and explained in detail as shown in table 11 3 4 2 ship conditions qualitative analysis ship conditions failures shown as blue in the web version in table 11 and fig 17 were mainly caused by mechanical failures engine failure or steering gear failure the information provided failures and poor ship conditions shown as green in the web version in table 11 and fig 17 e g lack of maintenance and retirement time limit for old age ship etc it should be highlighted that when it comes to the information provided failures the influencing factors are different from human errors which caused the ship accidents the failures mainly resulting in the communication equipment failure and anti collision system failure for example the equipment e g vhf ecdis or arpa which is used for communication between ships does not work well 3 4 3 traffic environment conditions analysis traffic environment conditions failures are also critical causes for marine accidents shown as blue in the web version in table 11 and fig 17 it is mainly related to the natural environment traffic conditions and channel conditions shown as green in the web version in table 11 and fig 17 some accidents are caused by the natural environment s influencing factors e g bad weather conditions which results in an unsafe situation or poor visibility for oow radar furthermore bad sailing conditions in respect of falling rising tide current waves etc also may lead to ship accidents besides the noise environment may influence the rest of the crew or the decision making of oow which results in an unsafe collision situation traffic conditions for instance high traffic density or the sailing fishing vessel which crosses the waterway also contributing to a shipping accident in addition terrible channel condition is also a common cause for ship accidents e g lack of navigation aids or complex waterway condition etc 4 discussion in this section the phase iv systematic and comprehensive discussion of the proposed framework is conducted from the perspectives of ship accident distribution characteristics accident causes and water traffic safety management 4 1 the distribution characteristics of ship accidents according to the above statistical analysis of water traffic accidents in the fluctuating backwater area fba of the three gorges reservoir tgr from 2009 to 2018 the distribution characteristics of water traffic accidents are summarized as follows first in terms of the categories of accidents the main findings in section 3 3 1 are congruent with the investigated results of kujala et al 2009 there are 100 accident cases were reported to be grounding accounting for 47 60 of all cases the second largest group is ship ship collisions 42 cases 20 00 see fig 2 of kujala et al 2009 youssef and paik 2018 fig 1 in this study shows that 33 of the accidents of oil spills more than 700 tonnes are grounding accidents and agcs 2014 the results indicate that grounding accidents account for 50 of all marine insurance claims more than one million euro in addition the trends in figs 4 and 10 indicated that the total number of accidents and the frequency of the overall ship accidents for different categories both basically had significantly decreased year by year in the fba however as for specific analysis of the trends for various accident categories grounding and collision categories reflect the same characteristics as the overall accident change trend however for other accident categories it is not easy to summarize the specific changing trend due to the limited statistical sample when looking at annual frequencies from the years 2009 2018 2 2 collisions and 11 4 groundings per year table a3 to the frequencies from kujala et al 2009 2 7 for collisions and 11 7 for groundings per year it can be seen that numbers have the same magnitude of order and collisions and groundings are happening more regularly in the gulf of finland during the period under review therefore the management department shall strengthen the management and timely report the information such as bad weather condition or sailing condition reduce the occurrence of accidents especially the grounding and collision accidents and ensure the safety of passing ships second in respect of accident levels there are a total of 173 water traffic accidents of various levels of which there are 15 hazardous and catastrophic accidents 8 67 and 151 minor accidents 87 28 occurred during the ten years under review similarly 92 4 of ship accidents were reported as minor accidents in the gulf of finland kujala et al 2009 and most of the accidents occurred in western shenzhen port were also recognized as minor negligible accidents mou et al 2019 which are also noteworthy overall the number of accidents and casualties decreased by years fig 15 a and there were only minor accidents that happened in 2017 and 2018 table 4 and fig 7 this may be due to the continuous improvement of regulations and the strengthening of relevant maritime regulatory departments management third from the perspective of ship types as shown in fig 8 cargo ship accidents are the most this is congruent with the results shown in fig 2 of chen et al 2019 and table 1 of eliopoulou et al 2016 which indicates that the type of cargo ship counts for the most of the types of marine accidents in the studied scenarios more than half of all accidents 64 14 followed by passenger ship 11 11 and container ship accidents 7 07 this phenomenon is in line with the actual situation in the fba of tgr region of the yangtze river the msa should pay more attention to the cargo ships under its jurisdiction in the fba in addition according to the statistics of ship types by ship accident categories in fig 9 it could be seen that the accident category involving fishing ships is all of the collision accident and the ships all sunk resulting in deaths and economic losses this is maybe caused by poor ship conditions of the fishing ship such as too old age of the ship or lack of maintenance etc therefore stakeholders should focus on the managing the accident caused by fishing ships and conducting targeted inspections and supervisions fourth when it comes to the time which accidents occurred the results of section 3 3 4 are congruent with the changes in the water level in the tgr region each year the annual flooding season of the yangtze river is approximately concentrated in summer and autumn before flooding season i e around april and may the tgr region will discharge the water level to 145 m to ensure there will be enough space to accommodate peak flow in the flooding season in addition after the flooding season the tgr region will impound waters to the high level of 175 m to guarantee electricity generation i e the water level changes quickly in the period of storage and recession it is not easy for the crew to adapt to this change and navigate at a low water level resulting in ship accidents august is within the flooding season when the reservoir runs at a low water level there is abundant precipitation in the yangtze river s upper reaches which leads to turbulent water flow and a challenging waterway environment which is prone to accidents in addition during the high water level operation period i e around november and december the flow speed is slow the navigation conditions are better so fewer accidents occurred though the ship s navigation conditions are relatively good the increase of the wetland area may lead to foggy in fba it still has risks in this period e g 11 accidents occurred in november however groundings had happened mostly in late autumn and in early winter ship ship collisions mostly in february and march shown as fig 3 of kujala et al 2009 therefore for the temporal distribution different regions have different distribution characteristics due to different navigation environments in addition the distribution characteristics of marine and inland ship accidents are also different moreover the main causes of the daily variation of accidents in table 5 may be that there are more ships on the river during the day and the traffic situation is more complicated than the night generally speaking the occurrence of accidents during the period is relatively average and the changing pattern is not obvious in addition the causes of the most prone periods of accidents that occurred in fig 14 may be due to handovers e g the chief and third officer take over at 8 00 and fatigue maneuvering fifth as for the accidents location as shown in fig 16 the distribution of accidents is mainly concentrated in the areas of chaotianmen 104 chaotianmen is located at the yangtze river s junction and the jialing river one of the nine major tributaries of the yangtze river chaotianmen is the hub of the two rivers and the largest waterway ferry terminal in chongqing thus there has a heavy traffic flow and it is also hard to maneuver ships for the crew in this region and need good seamanship it is consistent with the ship accident prone areas of tgr see fig 5 of jiang et al 2016 in addition the maritime supervision department should take measures to monitor and strengthen safety management in the mentioned accidents frequently occurred areas segments in section 3 3 5 and passing ships should also pay attention to enhancing safety awareness and the sailing condition when navigating in these areas with the continuous construction and development of the economy in the yangtze river s upper reaches it is foreseeable that the water traffic density may increase and the risk of water traffic accidents in this area will increase accordingly the stakeholders and managers should pay attention to the development trend of water traffic accidents in this water area last as far as the losses of ship accidents basically the overall number of accidents casualties and shipwrecks has shown a decreasing tendency this situation may be due to the help of advanced navigation technology and gradually improved management rules and the number of accidents has gradually decreased the overall economic loss has shown a decreasing tendency but this is susceptible to hazardous major accidental losses so they sometimes fluctuate significantly in different years in addition the findings of the cargo ships total losses in section 3 3 6 are in line with the results of agcs 2018 cargo vessels account for 471 1129 41 72 of the total losses by type of vessel from 2008 to 2017 and eliopoulou et al 2016 which indicates that the general cargo ships exhibit the highest percentage of total ship losses moreover in our case the annual traffic volume s influence is not so obvious when calculating the frequency of the accidents in fba but to draw robust conclusions the scholars and stakeholders should adjust to specific traffic data when applying the proposed framework and employing a similar analysis in the present paper especially when the data samples are small and distributed along the studied years or separated by different accident ship type categories furthermore it needs to be noted that in table a3 sink represents the shipwreck that directly happened in specific ship accidents however in other ship accident categories shipwreck still possible happens for instance the case of accident id 210 from the investigation report of chongqing msa at 03 25 on may 20 2014 the cargo ship gangchang qingji no 1 dry cargo ship of chongqing yuanbeier shipping co ltd grounded when it sailed across the waters of fanchangwan later it got free and was about to save itself at mingyuetu finally it capsized and wrecked in the area of jigongzui ten people fell into the water nine people were rescued and one person was missing this case is classified into the category of grounding but it still has a shipwreck that occurred therefore for section 3 3 6 table 7 it is stated that there were 28 shipwrecks however in table a3 only 12 sunk ships are recorded 4 2 the causes of ship accidents the elements of human errors ship conditions and traffic environment are the main elements for systematic accident causes analysis of the maritime transportation system and the elements may interact with each other jiang et al 2020 moreover investigation reports contain the detailed process of ship accident and the identified accident causes by the investigation authority e g fatigue of the crew difficult operating conditions loss of watchkeeping inappropriate regulations mechanical failure decision failures and poor manning of a vessel etc chauvin et al 2013 wang et al 2005 such information can be utilized to identify the influencing factors on the collision as well as provide guidelines for cause consequence analysis martins and maturana 2013 in respect of human errors as is well known are one of the significant contributors to marine accidents chauvin et al 2013 macrae 2009 weng et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 human reliability which is to identify and analyze the cause consequences of human errors systematically groth and swiler 2013 the direct causes of ship accidents are shown in fig 17 it is obvious that human errors were the leading cause of these accidents as shown in fig 17 and table 11 on the whole 21 causes involve human errors far more than the other two elements 6 causes and 7 causes respectively likely due to low safety awareness of the officers on watch oow sailing in the fba of tgr region specifically some crew members have a low level of education insufficient knowledge of water traffic regulations sailing based on experience and intuition unauthorized maneuvering foggy sailing illegal night sailing overload etc occur from time to time in addition the crew s safety awareness is weak and non compliance with duty and improper operation often happens for example during the recession period the navigable conditions in the fba gradually deteriorate some oow eased their vigilance and safety awareness while on duty resulting in ship accidents table 4 from wang et al 2005 indicates that the crew s negligence accounts for a high proportion of fishing ship accidents this is congruent with the findings from section 3 4 1 moreover in terms of management errors insufficient supervision and inadequate handling of ship violations by the msa it is easy to ignore the management of the accident prone segments and periods the problem may be more severe in some similar water areas due to insufficient safety investments and lack of safety supervision thus the managers should strengthen the management of crew and ships to reduce accidents caused by human factors e g the crew s negligence on duty and inopportune operation etc as well as pay more attention to build new regulations and guidelines improve crew training schemes and safety education when it comes to ships conditions overall the three gorges project dam has improved the navigation conditions in the fba which mainly benefits from the dam s function of increasing the yangtze river s shipping capacity however the increased frequency of ship traffic increases the rate of crossings and the potential for collisions in addition the category of sink ship accidents ranks third place among all types of accidents figs 5 and 6 to some extent it reflects the characteristics of severe aging of some ships in the fba moreover the ship s inspection and repair organization failed to overhaul the mechanical equipment failure in time and maintain the ships regularly and properly which may lead to hidden dangers for the ship s accident without regular maintenance the ship is seriously corroded and it is easy to cause damage to the cabin in accidents of grounding or collision e g the fishing ships illustrated in fig 9 were all sunk poor ship conditions of lacking maintenance may cause this regarding traffic environment conditions when the natural environment changes the channel conditions and traffic conditions often change accordingly the water level in the fba changes significantly and the oow is not easy to adapt in time when the water level of the tgr rises or falls the water level changes by nearly 30 m and the riverbank topography continues to change especially during the recession and storage periods among them may which is in the recession period is the most obvious which is also a period of frequent ship accidents occurred figs 11 and 12 during the recession period specific segments that are originally navigable are no longer available some reefs that were initially submerged in the high water level and did not pose a hazard become obstacles which always results in grounding accidents furthermore in the flood control period fba restores the characteristics of the natural water area the water level drops and the flow velocity increases the cause is significantly affected by the flood increasing ship maneuvering difficulty and ship accident possibility moreover in the water storage period or high water level period it may cause river channels siltation increasing ship grounding possibility besides the impoundment of tgr may widen the river slow the flow rate and increase the probability of the fogging phenomenon which also increases the risk of navigation in addition during the water storage period or recession period the water level rises or falls every day the setting for navigation aids lags behind the time of water level change which also may make it difficult for the ship to look out and adapt timely note that due to the research on statistical analysis for the characteristics and causes of ship accidents that occurred in the inland water areas especially in the fba of tgr region and other similar areas it is still scanty so the comparative cases in section 4 1 and section 4 2 are mainly from the ocean s ship accidents however even though the sensoria and the specific environment may differ for the inland and ocean ships some common characteristics for the ship accidents can still be analyzed and summarized for offering suggestions for ship safety management 4 3 water traffic safety management except for human errors ship conditions traffic environment management is another prominent influence element for the maritime transportation system he et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 wu et al 2020 the prevention and supervision of water traffic accidents is the core of organization and management in addition water traffic safety management is a systematic problem which involves many government departments for instance the ship inspection department is mainly responsible for the ship s technical status the msa is mostly accountable for the management of ship registration penalties for violations assessment and examination for the ship crew the waterway department is primarily responsible for the maintenance of the waterway etc any supervision and management process is an integral part of the entire system bye and aalberg 2018 yıldırım et al 2019 the causes of water traffic accidents are multi faceted in addition to strengthening the management of the different departments coordination between them is also essential the investigation handling and statistics of water traffic accidents are the ex post management of the msa in accordance with relevant laws during the investigation and handling of ship accidents maritime management authorities often focus on identifying the accident causes and the determination of the accident responsibilities nonetheless they often ignore the summary of accident lessons wan and chen 2018 which is the core of the investigation and handling of water traffic accidents accident types number of accidents number of casualties direct economic loss and other statistical indicators reflect not only the safety status of the specific waters but also the basis of decision making for water traffic safety management therefore through the statistical analysis of the ten years ship accidents in the fba area this study provides an excellent significant reference basis for the msa and other stakeholders to summarize the ship accidents characteristics and causes 5 conclusions frequent water traffic accidents pose severe threats to human life and property safety and the prevention and supervision of water traffic accidents is the core of management this study proposes a comprehensive hierarchical and systematic ship accident characteristics and causes analysis framework and demonstrates its value by summarizing and visualizing the characteristics as well as investigating and exploring the losses of these ship accidents through the statistical and comparative analysis of the historical data from 2009 to 2018 in the fluctuating backwater area fba of the three gorges reservoir tgr region meanwhile this paper presents some potential countermeasures and suggestions for accident prevention and supervision as well as provides decision making support for ship navigation safety management in the fba of tgr region for chongqing msa the main findings in the study area could be addressed in two aspects as follows i in respect of statistical analysis of the characteristics for ship accidents a grounding accident is the most common ship accident compared with other ship accident categories accounting for 65 90 and there are 115 ships the reason has been investigated to be grounding accounting for 58 08 of all number of ships involved in various accidents b approximately 87 28 of the investigated accidents are minor accidents and there were only minor accidents that happened in 2017 and 2018 c cargo ships are the most frequently involved in ship accidents compared with different accident ship types and the accident category involving fishing ships is all of the collision accident and the ships all sunk in addition all the accidents about the category tanker are grounding accidents d concerning spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of ship accidents there are 104 ship accidents which occurred in chaotianmen accounting for 60 12 of the total number of accidents in 10 years more ship accidents occurred in may and mainly happened during the daytime the total number of accidents and the frequency of the overall ship accidents for different categories both tend to decrease year by year except small fluctuations in specific years e ship accidents can threaten the safety of human life and property and cause substantial economic losses the overall number of accidents casualties and shipwrecks has shown a decreasing tendency and the overall economic loss has shown a decreasing tendency but this is susceptible to hazardous major accidental losses ii furthermore in terms of the causes of ship accidents human errors unsafe ship conditions and harsh traffic environment conditions are identified and classified as the main risk categories leading to the investigated water traffic accidents among them human errors were the main cause of these accidents and were mainly attributed to crew negligence and operating errors therefore faced with the specific situation of marine safety the maritime authorities need to pay more attention to ship accidents above characteristics giving an early warning and monitoring for the inland ship under the scope of their jurisdiction meanwhile strengthen safety training for the maritime practitioners to enhance their professional operation skills and sense of responsibility the potential contributions and impacts of this paper are threefold i the proposed comprehensive hierarchical and systematic framework consists of the following steps of data collection and processing scenario identification data analysis causes recognition and classification and systematic and comprehensive discussion could be potentially applied for ship accident characteristics analysis and influential factors recognition and investigation in the tgr region for chongqing msa and other stakeholders who are responsible for similar situations worldwide e g the region of the river of caroni in venezuela and paraná spans brazil and paraguay etc as long as the area with a water conservancy project such as a hydropower station forms an fba however it should be adjusted according to the specific scenario due to the various weather conditions and navigation environment ii the research findings could help the relevant maritime practitioners and authorities strengthen the safety management of ships crew and traffic environments to eliminate potential safety risks and hazards and avoid or reduce the occurrence of water traffic accidents iii this paper could provide support for the scholars and stakeholders to explore navigation safety improvement measures from the perspective of determining insurance liability through the identified specific risk factors of accident causes under the categories of human errors unsafe ship conditions and harsh traffic environment conditions as for the limitation of this paper although the water traffic accident analysis can reflect its core characteristics and causes in many cases especially with limited statistical samples it is impossible to summarize and reveal the specific accident characteristics and find the corresponding connections between related characteristics and causes moreover it is also hard to propose targeted accident prevention guidelines and safety recommendations for various types of ships according to different navigation conditions additionally although once the accident analysis has been completed the guidelines obtained from analysis results based on the proposed framework could comprehensively and directly help relevant authorities strengthen the related safety management somehow to achieve the goal of accident precaution and risk mitigation however the present framework mainly focuses on the post accident characteristics and causal analysis in the future we will further analyze the causes of accidents in specific geographical areas of the fba conduct the quantitative analysis of specific accident causations and utilize data mining clustering techniques risk assessment etc methods to carry out the comprehensive pre accident prediction analysis and post accident characteristics and causal analysis to explore more detailed safety management strategies for ship accidents under various scenarios credit authorship contribution statement jie xue conceptualization methodology software formal

20809,the wave characteristics in the nearshore waters of sanmen bay are presented based on the awac measured data from october 2016 to september 2017 at the wave observation station with 7 5m water depth the wave parameters and the wave spectral variations are statistically analyzed and the wave height distribution the wave period distribution and the joint distribution of wave height and period are discussed the results indicate that the measured distribution of wave height agrees well with the weibull distribution when the spectral width is small the various theoretical distribution models of wave period have their own reference values for the study of the distribution of measured wave period the measured distribution of wave period has the best agreement with the weibull distribution when the spectral width is large the longuet higgins model 1983 and the sunfu model can be fitted to the joint distribution of wave height and period in this sea area but the fitting effect is poor the dominant wave direction and the strong wave direction are both e with a frequency value of 40 27 the maximum wave height h max of 2 71m was observed during the observation period due to the influence of typhoon talim keywords distribution characteristics wave height wave period wave spectra sanmen bay 1 introduction recently there are many researches and analyses on the measured wave data umesh et al 2017 shanas et al 2018 sanil kumar and anoop 2015 amrutha et al 2017 and anjali nair et al 2018 studied the waves in the waters off india and found that along the india coast about 60 of the waves are multi peaked waves sanil kumar et al 2003 meanwhile they also studied the wave characteristics in the arabian sea sanil kumar et al 2011 johnson et al 2015 glejin et al 2016 and the bay of bengal sanil kumar et al 2014 patra et al 2016 respectively including correlation analysis spectral analysis separation of wind seas and swells and etc yang et al 2017 observed single peaked wave spectra double peaked wave spectra and multi peaked wave spectra in the coastal waters of northeast zhoushan islands during typhoons and found that the wave spectra are significantly influenced by typhoon paths qi et al 2018 studied the wave characteristics in the middle of bohai bay and the correlation between wave height and wind speed was discussed as well as the correlation between wave direction and wind direction however the researches on the distribution characteristics of measured waves are relatively rare since the 1950s a variety of representatively theoretical distribution models of waves have been proposed including rayleigh distribution goda 2000 gluhovski distribution putz 1952 longuet higgins distribution longuet higgins 1952 and bretschneider distribution bretschneider 1959 and etc dong and kong 2005 hong 1978a 1978b yang et al 1986 and sun 1988 have also done plenty of research work in the aspect of distribution function of waves and proposed relevant empirical distribution functions in fact many of these above researches focus on the theory and empirical formulas and for the actual wave conditions in various regions the applicability of each distribution model may not be the same wu et al 2016 han et al 2019 shu et al 2012 studied the distribution characteristics of waves in the nearshore waters of yangxi guangdong and found that the distribution of wave height agrees well with the weibull distribution guo et al 2014 studied the distribution characteristics of waves in the nearshore waters of jiangsu and found that the distribution of wave height agrees well with the gluhovski distribution luo and lu 2006 studied the wave characteristic parameters in sanmen bay by numerical simulation and the results indicated that the study area is affected by the mixed waves relatively large hence it is necessary to figure out the distribution characteristics of waves in the study sea area based on the measured wave data in this paper the wave characteristics in sanmen bay are studied based on the awac measured data and the wave parameters and wave spectral variations are statistically analyzed moreover the wave height distribution the wave period distribution and the joint distribution of wave height and period are discussed the distribution models of waves suitable for this sea area have been found and it is of great significance for reference to the engineering construction and wave researches in this study area 2 wave data and methods 2 1 wave data sanmen bay generally presents nw se trend on the map the wave data measured from 1 october 2016 to 30 september 2017 at the temporary wave observation station in sanmen bay are used in this study the water depth at the wave observation station is around 7 5m geographic position 29 01 003 n 121 42 893 e as shown in fig 1 and the measuring point in the se direction is open to the east china sea the observation time is about 18min per hour and the sampling interval is 0 5s the wind data used for auxiliary analysis were obtained from the wind tower geographic position 29 01 074 n 121 42 777 e as shown in fig 1 at the front of the wharf about 200m to the west of the wave observation station which is synchronized with the wave data fig 2 shows the awac set up and wind tower on the site 2 2 data processing methods the acoustic wave and current meter awac with the function of acoustic wave surface scanning is used for wave filed observation which is manufactured by nortek of norway the sensor battery acoustic release transponder and steel frame together form the wave observation system the sensor battery and acoustic release transponder are all placed in the steel frame the battery is under the sensor and the acoustic release transponder placed vertically on the side can guarantee the steel frame is placed horizontally on the sea bed after several adjustments when launching the various wave parameters are obtained from the measured data by means of the storm software equipped with awac including the maximum wave height h max the one tenth wave height h 1 10 the significant wave height h 1 3 the mean wave height h mean the mean wave period t mean the spectral peak period t p and etc moreover the shallow water factor h the wave spectral moment m n and the spectral width parameter ν are also calculated as required the wave direction is calculated by the suv acoustic surface tracking and horizontal velocity u and v method in the storm software the wave spectra are obtained through fast fourier transform fft which are smoothed within the frequency domain with 64 degrees of freedom with a cutoff frequency of 1hz and a resolution of 0 01hz the awac instruments have been widely used in the wave filed observation with high data processing efficiency and the measured wave direction error is less than 2 and the measured wave height error is less than 0 15 which ensures the reliability and accuracy of the measured wave data 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of wave parameters 3 1 1 wave height and wave period the annual results of wave heights and wave periods at different levels in sanmen bay are presented in 16 directions as shown in fig 3 and the data integrity rate is 99 42 the results show that the dominant wave direction and the strong wave direction are both e and the frequency of occurrence in this direction is 40 27 with the annual average one tenth wave height h 1 10 of 0 43m the maximum wave height h max of 2 71m was observed at 11 00 on september 14 from ene direction due to the influence of typhoon talim the track is shown in fig 4 while the corresponding one tenth wave height h 1 10 was 2 14m and the wind direction was n the occurrence frequency of waves with the one tenth wave height h 1 10 less than 0 8m is 94 32 in the whole year thus the wave motion in this sea area is relatively not intense the waves with period 0 1 4s were observed for 75 02 of the time in this sea area while 16 39 of the wave periods were within 4 5s and only less than 10 of the wave periods were greater than 5s 3 1 2 wave spectra the study sea area are always influenced by typhoons and the duration of typhoon wave is about 3 days with mainly double peaked wave spectra as shown in fig 5 a the corresponding directional wave spectra during typhoon talim are also presented the waves are mainly low frequency waves with the frequency of about 0 08hz and a small amount of high frequency waves are around 0 3hz the directional wave spectrum can directly reflect the wave spectral energy density in wave frequency and direction fig 5 b e show a set of directional wave spectra at different times as marked in fig 5 a during typhoon talim and the corresponding time points are 11 00 on 13th 11 00 on 14th 11 00 on 15th and 11 00 on 16th respectively it can be seen that the directional wave spectrum at 11 00 on 13th is bidirectional obviously with both high and low frequencies while the spectral peak frequency of the low frequency part is around 0 08hz with a spectral peak direction of about 100 and the spectral peak frequency of the high frequency part is around 0 3hz with a spectral peak direction of about 0 the directional wave spectra at other times show a unidirectional situation with the low frequency of 0 08hz and the spectral peak direction of 100 the wind directions in this region are mainly n during typhoon talim hence it can be considered that the low frequency part are swells and the high frequency part are wind seas in the wave spectra besides the energy of wind seas is equivalent to that of swells during the early stage of typhoon wave the energy densities of wind seas and swells both increases with the development of typhoon wave but the energy density of swells increases more greatly so the whole process of typhoon wave is mainly dominated by the low frequency swells in e direction and accompanied by certain high frequency wind seas in n direction 3 2 distribution characteristics of wave 3 2 1 wave height distribution at present it is generally believed that the wave height distribution in deep water conforms to the rayleigh distribution but whether the wave height distribution in the actual waters satisfies this distribution law is still controversial a great number of studies have shown that the wave height distribution can comply with the rayleigh distribution only when the water depth is large and the spectral width is small in this paper the water depth d at the wave observation station is 7 5m the mean wave height h mean is 0 21m and the calculated shallow water factor defined as h h mean d is 0 028 less than 0 1 so the study sea area belongs to deep water in order to figure out the wave distribution characteristics in this area the wave height distribution based on the measured wave data is compared with theoretical distributions the zero up crossing method is adopted to conduct the statistical analysis of wave height based on the measured time history data of wave surface obtained from hourly awac observation forristal used the measured wave parameters during hurricane in the gulf of mexico to conduct the two parameter weibull distribution fitting and the rayleigh distribution fitting forristall 1978 and the study presented that the actual wave height distribution in this area is more in line with the two parameter weibull distribution the probability density distribution function of wave height of weibull distribution is 1 p h h mean α β h h mean α 1 exp β h h mean α where α and β are the coefficients determined by the measured data in this paper the probability density distribution graph of measured wave height and the curves of rayleigh distribution gluhovski distribution and two parameter weibull distribution fitting the actual measured data are given fig 6 shows part of the probability density distribution graph of wave height where k h h mean is the dimensionless wave height parameter it can be found that the measured wave height distribution is concentrated in 0 8 1 0 times the mean wave height and the total range is mainly between 0 and 3 times the mean wave height by comparing the fitting curve of rayleigh distribution with the histogram of measured distribution it can be seen that the fitting effect of rayleigh distribution is good in general but there is a certain deviation especially at the peak value of probability density the rayleigh distribution has its own limitation and its probability density distribution function determines that the peak value p k 0 76 of rayleigh distribution appeared around k 0 8 in all cases when the wave height is not large the fitting curve of gluhovski distribution is basically consistent with that of rayleigh distribution when the wave height is relatively large the fitting effect of gluhovski distribution is better than that of rayleigh distribution especially around the largest probability density of measured wave height the statistical analysis shows that the maximum value of shallow water factor measured in this sea area is 0 13 thus when the wave height is large the gluhovski distribution can be considered to fit the wave height distribution in general the fitting effect of two parameter weibull distribution is the best among the three kinds of curve fitting it can exactly reflect the distribution situation when the probability density is large and the fitting effect of k value corresponding to the maximum probability density is also the best thus the two parameter weibull distribution is the most suitable for the wave height distribution in this sea area 3 2 2 wave period distribution the longuet higgins distribution sunfu distribution bretschneider distribution gluhovski distribution and weibull distribution are applied to study the wave period distribution based on the measured wave data the longuet higgins distribution and sunfu distribution are derived based on linear acoustic theory and ray theory respectively which are purely theoretical period distribution models and both of the probability density distribution functions are related to the spectral width parameter ν both the bretschneider distribution and the gluhovski distribution are semi empirical period distribution models which have nothing to do with the spectral width parameter ν and they have the same trend of the probability density distribution functions just with different theoretical coefficients the weibull distribution is obtained from the curve fitting by the least squares method based on the measured wave period data which varies with the wave period data in each group because the weibull distribution function has two parameters the curve shape is more diverse than those of the other four theoretical distributions the spectral width parameter ν is calculated as follows 2 ν m 0 m 2 m 1 2 1 where m n is the nth order spectral moment and is calculated as follows 3 m n 0 f n s f d f n 0 1 2 where ƒ is the frequency hz s ƒ is the spectral energy density m2 hz fig 7 shows part of the probability density distribution graph of wave period where t t t mean is the dimensionless wave period parameter it can be seen that the dimensionless wave period parameter t of the measured wave period varies from 0 to 3 as the spectral width parameter ν increases the measured wave period distribution gradually diverges when the spectral width is small the wave period distributions of the five theories are basically consistent with the measured wave period distribution fig 7 a when the spectral width is large the five wave period distributions become different from the measured wave period distribution in varying degrees fig 7 b c the probability density predicted by the longuet higgins distribution is very low around the mean wave period when the spectral width is large and so it can be found that the longuet higgins distribution based on the assumption of a narrow spectrum is not applicable at this time the measured distribution can agree well with the sunfu distribution on the peak probability density and the peak period but the predicted value of the probability density at the both sides of the distribution curve is low because the distribution functions of the bretschneider distribution and the gluhovski distribution have nothing to do with the spectral width parameter their period distribution forms are fixed and their curves basically overlapped by comparison it can be found that the predicted probability density values of the bretschneider distribution and the gluhovski distribution around the mean wave period are too large when the spectral width is large the measured wave period distribution can agree well with the weibull distribution under different spectral width parameters and so the weibull distribution has more general applicability compared with the other four distribution models the t values corresponding to the peak probability density of the longuet higgins distribution bretschneider distribution and gluhovski distribution are all around 1 while the t values corresponding to the peak probability density of the sunfu distribution and weibull distribution are variable but are almost the same under different spectral width parameters in general when the spectral width is small the five kinds of theoretical wave period distributions have certain reference value when the spectral width is large the fitting effect of weibull distribution is the best and the fitting effect of sunfu distribution is the second best 3 2 3 joint distribution of wave height and period table 1 shows the joint distribution of the measured one tenth wave height h 1 10 and mean wave period t mean at different levels in the whole year the result indicates that the waves with h 1 10 0 0 6m and t mean 0 1 4s appear the most frequently accounting for 63 96 as the wave height increases and the wave period becomes longer the occurrence frequency of waves gradually decreases the mean wave periods t mean of the waves with h 1 10 0 6 1 5m are mainly less than 5s while the mean wave periods t mean of the waves with h 1 10 1 5m are mainly between 5 and 7s hence it can be seen that huge waves may have long periods fig 8 shows the joint probability density distributions of wave height and period with different sample sizes the sample sizes are 1 5 25 and 100 sets respectively and the number of the measured wave burst data in one time is about 200 by comparison it can be seen that the distribution graphs of the wave observation sequence in 1 and 5 sets have many edges and corners indicating that there is great randomness in these two cases the distribution graph in 25 sets begins to become smooth and when the sample size is 100 sets the distribution graph becomes very smooth and tends to be stable hence the wave data with enough sample size are selected to analyze the joint distribution of wave height and period in this paper fig 9 shows the joint distribution of wave height and period with the sample size of 720 sets in the continuous observation and the longuet higgins model 1975 the longuet higgins model 1983 and the sunfu model are presented for comparison in which the spectral width v used for the calculation of probability density is obtained from the measured data v 0 63 the joint distribution of wave height and period of the measured data in this paper has a certain difference with the theoretical distributions as shown in fig 9 the measured distribution can be approximately considered as an oblique triangle which is also close to the oblique ellipse but it does not have an obvious triangular shape like the theoretical distributions in the measured joint distribution of wave height and period the variation range of the dimensionless wave height is basically the same as that of the dimensionless period and the range bounded by the probability density value of 0 5 is t 0 3 1 3 and k 0 2 1 4 the analysis indicates that the correlation coefficient of wave height and period for the selected 720 sets of wave data is 0 64 compared with the joint distribution along japanese coast presented by goda when the correlation coefficient of wave height and period is 0 60 0 69 dong and kong 2005 the measured peak probability densities both appear around t 0 7 and k 0 7 the longuet higgins model 1975 is obviously inconsistent with the measured results and this theoretical distribution is an obvious equilateral triangle shape and is symmetrical with respect to t 1 the longuet higgins model 1983 and the sunfu model are very similar but they still have some differences with the measured distribution firstly it can be seen from the graph that the oblique triangle shape of the measured distribution is not as clear as those of the two theoretical distributions secondly from the probability density distribution the peak probability densities of both the longuet higgins model 1983 and the sunfu model appear around t 0 7 and k 1 0 besides these two theoretical distribution models cannot reflect the probability density well in the case of large wave period and large wave height and at this time the theoretical value is much smaller than the measured value this is mainly because sanmen bay is often subjected to long period swells in e direction and the mixed waves can be easily formed under the influence of the wind field resulting in a large spectral width therefore the theoretical distribution model based on the narrow spectrum assumption may have certain errors in this sea area but overall it is recommended to use the longuet huggins model 1983 or the sunfu model to study the joint distribution of wave height and period in the nearshore waters of sanmen bay if necessary 4 conclusions the wave characteristics in sanmen bay of zhejiang middle coast are studied based on the measured wave data from october 2016 to september 2017 and the wave height distribution the wave period distribution and the joint distribution of wave height and period are discussed the following conclusions can be drawn from this research 1 the two parameter weibull distribution is the most suitable for the wave height distribution in this sea area which can not only exactly reflect the distribution situation when the probability density is large but also has the best fitting effect for the k value corresponding to the maximum probability density the fitting effects of the gluhovski distribution and the rayleigh distribution are relatively poor and when the wave height is large the gluhovski distribution can also be used 2 the measured wave period distribution gradually diverges with the increase of the spectral width parameter v when the spectral width is small the fitting effects of the five kinds of theoretical wave period distributions are all good when the spectral width is large the fitting effect of the weibull distribution is the best followed by the sunfu distribution 3 sanmen bay is open to the east china sea and is often subjected to long period swells in e direction and the mixed waves are easily formed under the influence of the wind field resulting in a large spectral width hence the theoretical distribution model based on the narrow spectrum assumption may have certain errors in the study area the measured joint distribution of wave height and period shows that the measured distribution graph is between an oblique triangle and an oblique ellipse and does not have an obvious triangular shape like the theoretical distributions by contrast it is recommended to use the longuet huggins model 1983 or the sunfu model to study the joint distribution of wave height and period in this sea area 4 the dominant wave direction and strong wave direction in the nearshore waters of sanmen bay are both e which is closely related to the terrain opening to the east the one tenth wave height h 1 10 in the study sea area is less than 0 8m over 90 of the time and the maximum wave height h max during the observation period is 2 71m which means that the wave motion in this sea area is relatively weak the duration of typhoon wave is about 3 days with mainly double peaked wave spectra and the low frequency part are swells in e direction and the high frequency part are wind seas in n

20809,the wave characteristics in the nearshore waters of sanmen bay are presented based on the awac measured data from october 2016 to september 2017 at the wave observation station with 7 5m water depth the wave parameters and the wave spectral variations are statistically analyzed and the wave height distribution the wave period distribution and the joint distribution of wave height and period are discussed the results indicate that the measured distribution of wave height agrees well with the weibull distribution when the spectral width is small the various theoretical distribution models of wave period have their own reference values for the study of the distribution of measured wave period the measured distribution of wave period has the best agreement with the weibull distribution when the spectral width is large the longuet higgins model 1983 and the sunfu model can be fitted to the joint distribution of wave height and period in this sea area but the fitting effect is poor the dominant wave direction and the strong wave direction are both e with a frequency value of 40 27 the maximum wave height h max of 2 71m was observed during the observation period due to the influence of typhoon talim keywords distribution characteristics wave height wave period wave spectra sanmen bay 1 introduction recently there are many researches and analyses on the measured wave data umesh et al 2017 shanas et al 2018 sanil kumar and anoop 2015 amrutha et al 2017 and anjali nair et al 2018 studied the waves in the waters off india and found that along the india coast about 60 of the waves are multi peaked waves sanil kumar et al 2003 meanwhile they also studied the wave characteristics in the arabian sea sanil kumar et al 2011 johnson et al 2015 glejin et al 2016 and the bay of bengal sanil kumar et al 2014 patra et al 2016 respectively including correlation analysis spectral analysis separation of wind seas and swells and etc yang et al 2017 observed single peaked wave spectra double peaked wave spectra and multi peaked wave spectra in the coastal waters of northeast zhoushan islands during typhoons and found that the wave spectra are significantly influenced by typhoon paths qi et al 2018 studied the wave characteristics in the middle of bohai bay and the correlation between wave height and wind speed was discussed as well as the correlation between wave direction and wind direction however the researches on the distribution characteristics of measured waves are relatively rare since the 1950s a variety of representatively theoretical distribution models of waves have been proposed including rayleigh distribution goda 2000 gluhovski distribution putz 1952 longuet higgins distribution longuet higgins 1952 and bretschneider distribution bretschneider 1959 and etc dong and kong 2005 hong 1978a 1978b yang et al 1986 and sun 1988 have also done plenty of research work in the aspect of distribution function of waves and proposed relevant empirical distribution functions in fact many of these above researches focus on the theory and empirical formulas and for the actual wave conditions in various regions the applicability of each distribution model may not be the same wu et al 2016 han et al 2019 shu et al 2012 studied the distribution characteristics of waves in the nearshore waters of yangxi guangdong and found that the distribution of wave height agrees well with the weibull distribution guo et al 2014 studied the distribution characteristics of waves in the nearshore waters of jiangsu and found that the distribution of wave height agrees well with the gluhovski distribution luo and lu 2006 studied the wave characteristic parameters in sanmen bay by numerical simulation and the results indicated that the study area is affected by the mixed waves relatively large hence it is necessary to figure out the distribution characteristics of waves in the study sea area based on the measured wave data in this paper the wave characteristics in sanmen bay are studied based on the awac measured data and the wave parameters and wave spectral variations are statistically analyzed moreover the wave height distribution the wave period distribution and the joint distribution of wave height and period are discussed the distribution models of waves suitable for this sea area have been found and it is of great significance for reference to the engineering construction and wave researches in this study area 2 wave data and methods 2 1 wave data sanmen bay generally presents nw se trend on the map the wave data measured from 1 october 2016 to 30 september 2017 at the temporary wave observation station in sanmen bay are used in this study the water depth at the wave observation station is around 7 5m geographic position 29 01 003 n 121 42 893 e as shown in fig 1 and the measuring point in the se direction is open to the east china sea the observation time is about 18min per hour and the sampling interval is 0 5s the wind data used for auxiliary analysis were obtained from the wind tower geographic position 29 01 074 n 121 42 777 e as shown in fig 1 at the front of the wharf about 200m to the west of the wave observation station which is synchronized with the wave data fig 2 shows the awac set up and wind tower on the site 2 2 data processing methods the acoustic wave and current meter awac with the function of acoustic wave surface scanning is used for wave filed observation which is manufactured by nortek of norway the sensor battery acoustic release transponder and steel frame together form the wave observation system the sensor battery and acoustic release transponder are all placed in the steel frame the battery is under the sensor and the acoustic release transponder placed vertically on the side can guarantee the steel frame is placed horizontally on the sea bed after several adjustments when launching the various wave parameters are obtained from the measured data by means of the storm software equipped with awac including the maximum wave height h max the one tenth wave height h 1 10 the significant wave height h 1 3 the mean wave height h mean the mean wave period t mean the spectral peak period t p and etc moreover the shallow water factor h the wave spectral moment m n and the spectral width parameter ν are also calculated as required the wave direction is calculated by the suv acoustic surface tracking and horizontal velocity u and v method in the storm software the wave spectra are obtained through fast fourier transform fft which are smoothed within the frequency domain with 64 degrees of freedom with a cutoff frequency of 1hz and a resolution of 0 01hz the awac instruments have been widely used in the wave filed observation with high data processing efficiency and the measured wave direction error is less than 2 and the measured wave height error is less than 0 15 which ensures the reliability and accuracy of the measured wave data 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of wave parameters 3 1 1 wave height and wave period the annual results of wave heights and wave periods at different levels in sanmen bay are presented in 16 directions as shown in fig 3 and the data integrity rate is 99 42 the results show that the dominant wave direction and the strong wave direction are both e and the frequency of occurrence in this direction is 40 27 with the annual average one tenth wave height h 1 10 of 0 43m the maximum wave height h max of 2 71m was observed at 11 00 on september 14 from ene direction due to the influence of typhoon talim the track is shown in fig 4 while the corresponding one tenth wave height h 1 10 was 2 14m and the wind direction was n the occurrence frequency of waves with the one tenth wave height h 1 10 less than 0 8m is 94 32 in the whole year thus the wave motion in this sea area is relatively not intense the waves with period 0 1 4s were observed for 75 02 of the time in this sea area while 16 39 of the wave periods were within 4 5s and only less than 10 of the wave periods were greater than 5s 3 1 2 wave spectra the study sea area are always influenced by typhoons and the duration of typhoon wave is about 3 days with mainly double peaked wave spectra as shown in fig 5 a the corresponding directional wave spectra during typhoon talim are also presented the waves

while the spectral peak frequency of the low frequency part is around 0 08hz with a spectral peak direction of about 100 and the spectral peak frequency of the high frequency part is around 0 3hz with a spectral peak direction of about 0 the directional wave spectra at other times show a unidirectional situation with the low frequency of 0 08hz and the spectral peak direction of 100 the wind

two parameter weibull distribution is the most suitable for the wave height distribution in this sea area which can not only exactly reflect the distribution situation when the probability density is large but also has the best fitting effect for the k value corresponding to the maximum probability density the fitting effects of the gluhovski distribution and the rayleigh distribution are relatively poor and when the wave height is large the gluhovski distribution can also be used 2 the measured wave period distribution gradually diverges with the increase of the spectral width parameter v when the spectral width is small the fitting effects of the five kinds of theoretical wave period distributions are all good when the spectral width is large the fitting effect of the weibull distribution is the best followed by the sunfu distribution 3 sanmen bay is open to the east china sea and is often subjected to long period swells in e direction and the mixed waves are easily formed under the influence of the wind field resulting in a large spectral width hence the theoretical distribution model based on the narrow spectrum assumption may have certain errors in the study area the measured joint distribution of wave height and period shows that the measured distribution graph is between an oblique triangle and an oblique ellipse and does not have an obvious triangular shape like the theoretical distributions by contrast it is recommended to use the longuet huggins model 1983 or the sunfu model to study the joint distribution of wave height and period in this sea area 4 the dominant wave direction and strong wave direction in the nearshore waters of sanmen bay are both e which is closely related to the terrain opening to the east the one tenth wave height h 1 10 in the study sea area is less than 0 8m over 90 of the time and the maximum wave height h max during the observation period is 2 71m which means that the wave motion in this sea area is relatively weak the duration of typhoon wave is about 3 days with mainly double peaked wave spectra and the low frequency part are swells in e direction and the high frequency part are wind seas in n
