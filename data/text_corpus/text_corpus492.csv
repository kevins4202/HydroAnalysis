2460,discharge indices viz half load discharge q 1 2 and functional equivalent discharge qfed can be used to quantify the effectiveness of flow distribution in sediment transport through a river network q 1 2 represents the flow below and above which half of the total long term sediment load is transported while qfed indicates a uniform flow that replicates the total magnitude of the sediment load transported by the complete discharge distribution in magnitude frequency analysis mfa these indices are computed based on the estimate of mean sediment load μ s transported through a river network conventionally the analytical expression for μ s was derived by assuming the discharges to be lognormally ln or gamma g distributed however the assumption of discharge distribution is location specific and hence ln or g distributed discharge may not be valid for all catchments thus it is necessary to assess the uncertainty in the estimate of μ s and thereby the estimates of q 1 2 and qfed when the discharge data do not follow either ln or g distribution in this study a modified approach is proposed to determine μ s and related q 1 2 and qfed for the general distribution of discharge datasets the proposed approach pa includes the transformation of discharge data by applying the box cox transformation followed by the estimation of μ s q 1 2 and qfed furthermore an analytical expression is derived for the solution of μ s under the proposed framework a simulation experiment is performed to establish the effectiveness of pa over the conventional ln or g based approaches results indicated that pa provides reliable estimates of μ s q 1 2 and qfed the utility of the pa is demonstrated through its application to suspended sediment transport in four south indian rivers

been used 1 introduction a comprehensive understanding of the sediment transfer dynamics in river basins is crucial from the environmental and economical perspectives e g apitz 2012 fischer et al 2017 excessive sediment transport results in degradation of water quality reservoir siltation river navigation issues unstable course of river channels and aquatic ecosystem degradation e g bash et al 2001 taylor et al 2008 viers et al 2009 tananaev 2015 many geomorphic and eco hydrological studies in the past have aimed to investigate the complex dynamics of the sediment transfer pertaining to various discharges e g wolman and miller 1960 nash 1994 sichingabula 1999 doyle and shields 2008 ma et al 2010 the effectiveness of a discharge in transporting sediments through the river network can be assessed through the study of discharge indices wolman and miller 1960 proposed the theory of geomorphic work done by sediments as the product of the amount of sediment transferred by a given discharge and the frequency of that discharge the product is also widely referred to as transport effectiveness te of a given discharge e g nash 1994 vogel et al 2003 quader et al 2008 klonsky and vogel 2011 sholtes et al 2014 maheshwari and chavan 2019 maheshwari and chavan 2022 the te function was then used to compute various discharge indices viz effective discharge q e e g nash 1994 goodwin 2004 quader et al 2008 klonsky and vogel 2011 maheshwari and chavan 2022 half load discharge q 1 2 e g vogel et al 2003 guo et al 2016 maheshwari and chavan 2021 and functional equivalent discharge q fed e g doyle and shields 2008 basso et al 2015 maheshwari and chavan 2021 these indices represent the transfer of sediments through river networks caused by various discharges over the long term the q e represents a dominant discharge accountable for the transfer of most of the sediments through the river networks mathematically q e is considered as a flow at which the te function attains a maximum indicating the efficacy of a single flow rate in transferring long term sediment load q e is generally assumed to be a comparatively more frequent or common flood than other discharge indices and it predicts the bank full discharge q bf with mixed performance sholtes and bledsoe 2016 in the case of coarse bed rivers i e dominated by transport of bedload sediments q e predicts q bf reasonably well and sometimes much greater than q bf also while in the case of fine bed rivers i e dominated by transport of suspended sediments the estimate of q e is mostly much smaller than q bf e g pickup and warner 1976 soar and thorne 2011 bunte et al 2014 hassan et al 2014 contrary to q e vogel et al 2003 proposed a mean sediment load based discharge index q 1 2 which considers the role of entire flow distribution in the transfer of sediments through river networks mathematically q 1 2 is determined by integrating the te function such that the cumulative sediment load equals half of the total sediment load the q 1 2 is defined as the flow below and above which half of the total long term sediment load is transported vogel et al 2003 termed the concept of q 1 2 to be more interpretable than q e as it represents a more important quantity i e half of the total long term sediment load this is because q e is simply the maximum of te rather than its integral q 1 2 which describes the cumulative sum of sediment load transported for discharges up to some level vogel et al 2003 similar to q 1 2 fraction load discharge q f is defined as that discharge above which a fraction f of the long term sediment load is transported vogel et al 2003 guo et al 2016 maheshwari and chavan 2021 later doyle and shields 2008 developed an alternate based discharge index q fed it indicates a uniform flow that replicates the total magnitude of the sediment load transported by the complete discharge distribution that is q fed is the single flow transporting an equivalent of the at all times i e flow variability tends to 0 mathematically the computation of q fed also involves the integration of the te function over the entire range of discharges thereby providing a meaningful metric defining the transfer of cumulative sediment load over time doyle and shields 2008 termed the q fed as a more representative index of hydrologic variability than q e overall it can be inferred from the literature that q 1 2 and q fed are more appropriate indices for landscape evolution and long term sediment studies which consider cumulative sediment transport the estimates of q 1 2 and q fed are computed using the estimate of μ s transfer over a longer period a reliable estimation of is necessary to arrive at reliable estimates of these discharge indices the estimate of μ s is sensitive to the choice of the continuous probability distribution for fitting discharge data and the complex sediment transfer dynamics due to the hysteresis effect detailed discussion on these aspects is provided in subsequent subsections 1 1 discharge distributions considered to determine μ s and related q 1 2 and q fed it can be noted from past studies that the assumption of log normal ln distributed discharge data has been pivotal in the computation of discharge indices both q 1 2 as well as q fed e g vogel et al 2003 doyle and shields 2008 sholtes et al 2014 guo et al 2016 maheshwari and chavan 2019 maheshwari and chavan 2021 many studies inferred the invalidity of ln distribution for the representation of daily discharge data nash 1994 sholtes et al 2014 blum et al 2017 maheshwari and chavan 2019 guo et al 2016 maheshwari and chavan 2021 nash 1994 suggested the use of other frequency distributions than ln to define the frequency of discharge data goodwin 2004 used several continuous probability distributions viz normal n log normal ln gamma g pearson type iii p3 and log pearson type iii lp3 to estimate q e for red river and russian river in the united states us he showed that the discharge data mainly follow either ln distribution or g distribution sholtes et al 2014 mentioned the need to consider different probability distributions other than ln distribution to compute discharge indices further guo et al 2016 derived the analytical estimates of discharge indices viz q e q f and q fed using ln mixed log normal mln g and mixed gamma mg distributions for fitting the discharge data of 19 small intermittent streams in ontario canada they found that discharge indices determined analytically using mg distribution show a better match with the empirical estimates of these indices although the goodness of fit test could not provide evidence about the improvement in the fit using mg distribution over g ln and mln distributions recently maheshwari and chavan 2021 calculated various discharge indices viz q f and q fed using ln and g based magnitude frequency analysis mfa approach for south indian catchments they found that the g distribution based mfa approach provided consistent estimates of discharge indices although ln probability distribution fitted the discharge data more accurately the aforementioned discussion points to the fact that there is ambiguity about the selection of frequency distribution for daily discharge data that leads to uncertainty in the estimation of μ s and related discharge indices viz q 1 2 and q fed the aforementioned discussion highlights that the discharge distribution is location specific thus the estimates of μ s and related q 1 2 and q fed are sensitive to the selected probability distribution however there is a lack of effort to examine the uncertainty in the estimate of μ s as well as q 1 2 and q fed especially when the discharge data do not follow either ln or g distribution further there is a need to develop a strategy to estimate μ s and related q 1 2 and q fed for the general distribution of discharge datasets 1 2 impact of hysteresis phenomenon in sediment rating curve on the estimates of μ s q 1 2 and q fed seasonal and climatic variability within the catchments result in unsteady discharges and cause the hysteresis effect in the power law relationship between discharge and sediment transport rate e g goswami 1985 nordin 1985 hickin 1989 syvitski and alcott 1995 asselman 1999 syvitski et al 2000 singh et al 2005 tananaev 2015 thus the hysteresis effect might influence the estimate of μ s and related q 1 2 and q fed the hysteresis effect is generally observed due to the alterations in the sediment availability during a hydrological event when there is a time shift between the peaks of the discharges and corresponding suspended sediment transport rates i e peaks of hydrograph and corresponding sediment graph bača 2008 such hysteretic behavior results in a scatter cloud in the sediment rating curve asselman 1999 williams 1989 defined the classes of hysteresis effect based on sediment concentration and discharge data relationship as a class i single valued line b class ii clockwise loop c class iii anticlockwise loop d class iv clockwise or anticlockwise loop plus single valued line or vice and versa and e class v figure eight i e clockwise loop plus anticlockwise loop or vice and versa details regarding the classes of hysteresis effect can be observed in the literature e g williams 1989 asselman 1999 bača 2008 tananaev 2015 maheshwari and chavan 2022 from the past literature it was observed that the quality of sediment load estimation can be improved by constructing separate rating curves for discharges belonging to the rising stage and falling stage walling 1977 walling and webb 1982 aquino et al 2009 nash 1994 investigated the existence of the hysteresis effect in suspended sediment transport through 55 us rivers sichingabula 1999 inspected the hysteresis effect on the estimates of qe considering the stage tendency recently maheshwari and chavan 2022 examined the presence of the hysteresis effect in the suspended sediment transport through 14 catchments in south indian rivers it was inferred from their study that the sediment rating curves based on either stage tendency or seasonal variation with stage tendency can be used to reduce the impact of the hysteresis on the sediment transfer dynamics herein the estimates of q 1 2 and q fed indices are dependent on the reliable estimation of μ s it would be interesting to investigate the effect of the hysteresis phenomenon on the estimates of μ s and related q 1 2 and q fed indices due to stage tendency seasonal variation and seasonal variation with stage tendency in the sediment rating relationship 1 3 study goals in this paper a box cox transformation based approach is proposed to determine reliable estimates of μ s and related discharge indices viz q 1 2 and q fed for the general distribution of discharge datasets under the proposed framework the discharge data is transformed using power transform i e box cox transformation which tends to transform discharge distribution into normal like distribution e g box and cox 1964 in addition an analytical expression is derived for μ s under the proposed framework performance assessment of the proposed approach to yield reliable estimates of μ s and related discharge indices viz q 1 2 and q fed is done through a simulation study subsequently the utility of the approach is demonstrated through its application to 14 stream gauges in four south indian rivers cauvery godavari krishna and mahanadi finally the impact of the hysteresis on the estimation of μ s q 1 2 and q fed is examined the paper is organized in the following manner methodology to determine μ s and related q 1 2 and q fed based on conventional i e ln and g based approaches is provided in section 2 1 followed by section 2 2 which contains a write up and methodological steps based on the proposed approach subsequently a simulation experiment is given in section 3 to assess the performance of the proposed approach over the conventional approaches section 4 demonstrates the utility of the proposed approach in south indian rivers cauvery godavari krishna and mahanadi finally conclusions are provided in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 conventional approaches to determine μ s and related q 1 2 and q fed mathematically the transport effectiveness te proposed by wolman and miller 1960 is given by equation 1 1 te s x f q where s is the sediment transport rate and f q is the frequency distribution of discharge q here q represents the random variable for daily discharge and q denotes the values taken by q conventionally s is assumed to have a power law relationship with q e g nash 1994 vogel et al 2003 klonsky and vogel 2011 sholtes et al 2014 guo et al 2016 maheshwari and chavan 2022 2 s a x q b where a and b are the coefficient and the exponent respectively of the power law relationship between q and s in the past literature lognormal ln and gamma g distributions have been used and considered the most robust distribution for describing q in the determination of discharge indices e g nash 1994 goodwin 2004 doyle and shields 2008 sholtes et al 2014 basso et al 2015 guo et al 2016 maheshwari and chavan 2021 equations 3a and 3b denote the expressions for the frequency distribution of daily discharge considering ln and g distributions as f ln q and f g q respectively 3a f ln q 1 q β 2 π e ln q α 2 2 β 2 3b f g q λ η q η 1 e λ q γ η where α and β are the mean and the standard deviation respectively of the log transformed discharge ln q η and 1 λ are the shape parameter and the scale parameter respectively of g distribution using equations 2 and 3a the transport effectiveness t e ln function can be created based on ln distribution as 4a t e ln a q b q β 2 π e ln q α 2 2 β 2 similarly the transport effectiveness t e g function based on g distribution is specified by 4b t e g a λ η q b η 1 e λ q γ η following vogel et al 2003 doyle and shields 2008 basso et al 2015 guo et al 2016 and maheshwari and chavan 2021 the analytical expressions for mean sediment load i e μ s ln and μ s g can be derived by integrating equations 4a and 4b from 0 to 5a μ s ln 0 a q b q β 2 π e ln q α 2 2 β 2 d q μ s ln a exp b 2 β 2 2 b α 5b μ s g 0 a λ η q b η 1 e λ q γ η d q μ s g a λ b γ η b γ η subsequently the estimate of half load discharge q 1 2 which corresponds to half of the mean sediment load μ s 2 can be obtained by integrating equations 4a and 4b from 0 to q 1 2 6a 0 q 1 2 ln a q b q β 2 π e ln q α 2 2 β 2 d q μ s ln 2 6b 0 q 1 2 g a λ η q b η 1 e λ q γ η d q μ s g 2 by using the analytical expression of μ s as given in equations 5a and 5b and simplifying equations 6a and 6b the fraction load discharge q f can be estimated based on the assumptions of ln distributed and g distributed daily discharges refer to equations 7a and 7b 7a q f ln exp α β b β z f f 1 φ ln q f ln α b β 2 β where zf is the percentile of a standard normal variable with the exceedance probability f 7b f 1 γ b η λ q f g equation 7b represents a gamma function in terms of the fraction load discharge q f g thus the estimate q f g can be determined numerically from the inverse of the g function later doyle and shields 2008 and basso et al 2015 derived the analytical expressions for q fed for ln and g distributions i e q fed ln and q fed g as given below 8a q fed ln μ s ln a 1 b 8b q fed g μ s g a 1 b 2 2 proposed mathematical approach to determine μ s and related q 1 2 and q fed the assumption of ln distribution or g distribution to fit discharge data in the conventional mfa approach might not always be true e g nash 1994 sholtes et al 2014 guo et al 2016 maheshwari and chavan 2019 maheshwari and chavan 2022 the invalidity of distribution in fitting discharge data might result in unreliable or unauthentic estimates of μ s q 1 2 and q fed hence a modified approach is proposed to determine μ s and related discharge indices viz q 1 2 and q fed for the general distribution of discharge datasets the proposed approach pa utilizes power transformation viz one parameter box cox transformation to transform the daily discharge data making it normal like irrespective of the original discharge distribution e g box and cox 1964 this kind of strategy was found to be effective in several applications in the field of hydrology e g chander et al 1978 kuczera 1983 jain and singh 1986 bates and campbell 2001 thyer et al 2002 yang et al 2007 engeland et al 2010 wang et al 2012 recently maheshwari and chavan 2022 provided a box cox transformation based approach to derive an analytical expression for te based q e the steps involved in the proposed approach pa to determine μ s and related q 1 2 and q fed are as follows 1 define λmin and λ max respectively as the lower and the upper bound for a power function parameter λj for one parameter box cox transformation of raw discharge data where j ranges from 1 2 20 000 in this study λmin and λ max were chosen as 1 and 1 respectively 2 the transformed data vector pj corresponding to λj can be obtained using equation 9 9 p j q i λ j 1 λ j i f λ j 0 ln q i i f λ j 0 f o r i 1 n where the subscript i denotes ith discharge data qi and n represents the total length of data 3 construct a log likelihood function lj for each λj value based on equation 10 lj is generally used as a measure of how well a particular model fits the data 10 l j α p β p 2 λ j n 2 ln 2 π n 2 ln β p 2 1 2 i 1 n q λ j 1 λ j α p 2 β p 2 where αp and βp are the mean and standard deviation of pj the procedure to determine lj value corresponding to λj and parameters αp and βp is provided in maheshwari and chavan 2022 4 the optimal power function parameter λopt was determined from all λj for which lj attained a maximum value a step by step more detailed procedure to arrive at λopt is provided in maheshwari and chavan 2022 5 the discharge data is then transformed into normal n distribution based on one parameter box cox transformation strategy by using equation 11 11 p q i λ o p t 1 λ o p t i f λ o p t 0 l n q i i f λ o p t 0 f o r i 1 n the p denotes the discharge in transformed space which is obtained from the discharge q i in the original space 6 the transformed variable p was assumed to be n distributed as shown by equation 12 12 f p 1 β p 2 π exp p α p 2 2 β p 2 where αp and βp denote the mean and the standard deviation respectively of p 7 the sediment transport rate corresponding to p can be estimated from equation 13 in transformed space 13 s a p λ opt 1 b λ opt 8 the te function

by integrating equation 15 from to numerically 15 μ s a p λ opt 1 b λ opt β p 2 π exp p α p 2 2 β p 2 d p 10 in addition an analytical expression for μ s is also derived based on binomial expansion series as specified by equation 16 the derivation of the expression is given in appendix a 16 μ s a 1 b α p b b λ opt 2 β p 2 α p 2 b b λ opt b 2 λ opt 6 3 α p β p 2 α p 3 b b λ opt b 2 λ opt b 3 λ

considering binomial expansion which is an infinite series while computing the estimate of μ s we can consider the terms to have a considerable contribution the contribution from the remaining terms can be considered negligible 11 following vogel et al 2003 the q 1 2 in transformed space p 1 2 can be determined from equation 17a 17a p 1 2 a p λ opt 1 b λ opt β p 2 π exp p α p 2 2 β p 2 d p μ s 2 12 finally the q 1 2 can be obtained by equation 17b 17b q 1 2 p 1 2 λ opt 1 1 λ opt 13 the concept of q 1 2 can easily be generalized to the fraction load discharge q f by replacing 1 2 in equation

specific sediment transport relationship 19 q fed μ s a 1 b 3 performance assessment of the proposed approach pa this section presents a simulation based study that establishes the robustness of pa in determining μ s and related q 1 2 and q fed evaluation of pa was carried out through the monte carlo simulation experiment in which discharge data were generated by considering various probability distributions for the generation of daily discharge q and corresponding sediment transport rates s the parameters were taken from table s1 in the supplementary material provided by nash 1994 which gives details on 55 us rivers daily discharge data were generated by assuming probability distributions such as ln g and lp3 distributions these distributions were chosen based on the previous literature e g nash 1994 goodwin 2004 sholtes et al 2014 guo et al 2016 maheshwari and chavan 2022 sample sizes of 10000 15000 and 20 000 were considered for the generation of data the sample sizes represent the length of discharge data n in days following this s data were estimated corresponding to the generated q data by using coefficient a and exponent b of the power law relationship given in nash 1994 refer to table s1 in the supplementary material the details regarding the procedure to generate discharge data are adopted from maheshwari and chavan 2022 a preliminary quality check was needed to exclude some rivers from the analysis to avoid unreasonable values of data properties viz coefficient of variation of suspended sediment transport rates cvs and kurtosis of log transformed daily discharge data k d it was observed that cvs and k d influence the fitting of the probability density function pdf subscripts s and d were used for sediment data and discharge data respectively previously it was also done to maintain the standard river conditions for the simulation experiment e g syvitski et al 2000 sholtes et al 2014 maheshwari and chavan 2022 the threshold limit of cvs and k d was set as 10 and 6 respectively for the elimination of rivers used in the simulation experiment based on the past literature e g klonsky and vogel 2011 roy and sinha 2014 sholtes et al 2014 maheshwari and chavan 2022 in the present study we have considered 28 9 and 9 rivers from 55 us rivers for ln g and lp3 distributions based simulation experiment respectively refer to table 1 table 3 and table 4 performance assessment of pa to predict μ s q 1 2 and q fed concerning the conventional approaches ca i e ln and g based e g vogel et al 2003 doyle and shields 2008 basso et al 2015 guo et al 2016 maheshwari and chavan 2021 was carried out for the following three cases described in sub sections 3 1 3 2 and 3 3 3 1 discharge data follow ln distribution the ln and g based pdfs were fitted to the generated discharge data for each of the 28 us rivers for brevity fig 1 a shows the histogram of discharge data together with the fitted pdfs for river id 3 from nash 1994 histograms of discharge data together with the fitted pdfs for the remaining 27 us rivers from nash 1994 are given in figure s1 of supplementary material it can be observed from the figure that the discharge data fits well with ln distribution as compared to g distribution as it was generated by adopting ln distribution the fitted pdfs were compared with the histograms of daily discharge data using statistical error measures viz absolute relative bias ar bias in and root mean square error rmse the average values of percent ar bias and rmse for all 28 us rivers for n 15000 were estimated to be 11 07 29 27 and 136 51 329 10 for ln g based pdfs values of these statistical measures for all 28 us rivers considering n 10000 15000 and 20 000 are given in table s2 of supplementary material table 1 tabulates the estimates of μ s ln and μ s g while the estimates of q 1 2 ln q 1 2 g and q fed ln q fed g are provided in tables s3a and s3b respectively of supplementary material in the case of pa the discharge data were first transformed by using λopt for which lj gets a maximum value refer to section 2 2 fig 2 a displays the profile of lj versus λj for river id 3 profiles of lj verses λj for the remaining 27 rivers are displayed in figure s2 of supplementary material it can be observed from the figure that the parameter λopt tends to zero as the generated discharge data were log transformed which is a special case of box cox transformation refer to equation 11 subsequently the te function was created based on the frequency distribution of transformed discharge f p as given by equation 12 and the power law relationship between p and s as given by equation 13 refer to section 2 2 fig 1a shows that the pdf of pa resembles the ln based pdf subsequently μ s based on pa i e μ s pa was computed using derived analytical expression refer to equation 16 as well as numerically refer to equation 15 the product of λopt and p was found to lie within the range of 1 to 1 which is one of the necessary conditions for using the binomial series expansion refer to appendix a the number of terms in equation 16 required to estimate μ s pa was decided based on the convergence of the analytical solution which is based on the plot that shows the contribution of each of the terms see fig 3 a for river id 3 the remaining plots are presented in figure s3 of supplementary material finally q 1 2 and q fed based on pa i e q 1 2 pa and q fed pa were determined using equations 17a and 17b and equation 19 respectively table 1 presents the estimates of μ s pa while the estimates of q 1 2 pa and q fed pa are presented in tables s3a and s3b respectively of supplementary material following vogel et al 2003 the empirical estimate of q 1 2 i e q 1 2 obs was calculated by ordering all daily discharge data by the magnitude and adding up corresponding sediment transport rates in order and thereafter finding the discharge for which the cumulative sum of sediment transport rates reaches half the total sediment transport rates in addition empirical μ s i e μ s obs can be considered as the average of sediment transport rates observed over the entire length of generated data subsequently the empirical estimate of q fed i e q fed obs was calculated based on μ s obs for the given discharge specific sediment relationship empirical estimates of μ s obs are provided in table 1 while the estimates of q 1 2 obs and q fed obs are provided in tables s3a and s3b respectively of supplementary material performance assessment of pa with respect to ca was carried out by comparing the estimates of μ s q 1 2 and q fed with the corresponding empirical observed estimates through percent absolute relative bias ar bias as given by equation 20 20 ar b i a s μ s a μ s obs μ s a μ s obs 100 a r b i a s q 1 2 a q 1 2 obs q 1 2 a q 1 2 obs 100 a r b i a s q fed a q fed obs q fed a q fed obs 100 where ar b i a s μ s a ar b i a s q 1 2 a and ar b i a s q fed a represent absolute relative bias in in μ s q 1 2 and q fed respectively for an approach a a stands for ln or g based approach or pa table 1 shows the percent ar bias values for μ s while the ar bias values for q 1 2 and q fed are shown in tables s3a and s3b respectively of supplementary material the overall average of percent ar bias values for μ s q 1 2 and q fed determined from 28 rivers for different data lengths i e n 10000 15000 and 20000 were presented in table 2 for pa the average percent ar bias values in μ s q 1 2 and q fed matched very closely to the ln based approach and were better than the g based approach this can be credited to the better fitting of pdfs to the histogram of discharge data the average values of percent ar bias i e 11 12 and rmse i e 137 01 for the fitted pdf in the case of pa were close to ln distribution see fig 1a values of these statistical measures in the case of pa for all 28 us rivers are provided in table s2 of supplementary material to visualize the spread of percent ar bias for each of the approaches for all 28 rivers box plots were created for the percent ar bias in μ s q 1 2 and q fed as illustrated in fig 4 a corresponding to n 10000 15000 and 20000 the figure illustrates that spread of ar bias values for μ s and related q 1 2 and q fed is less and comparable for both pa and ln based approach when compared with the g based approach it can be seen that the medians of ar bias for pa are lower than ln and g based approaches overall the results show that the proposed approach yields reliable or authentic estimates of μ s and related q 1 2 and q fed when the discharge data were lognormally distributed 3 2 discharge data follow g distribution fig 1b displays the histogram of daily discharge data generated by adopting g distribution together with the fitted pdfs based on the ln g based approaches and pa for river id 3 from nash 1994 fig 1b clarifies that the histogram of discharge data possesses a better fit to the fitted pdfs of the g based approach and pa in comparison to the ln based approach histograms together with the fitted pdfs for the remaining eight us rivers from nash 1994 are presented in figure s4 of supplementary material the average values of percent ar bias and rmse for all nine us rivers for n 15000 were estimated to be 5 31 0 40 0 55 and 70 29 12 74 16 12 for ln g pa based fitted pdfs values of these statistical measures for all nine us rivers considering n 10000 15000 and 20 000 are provided in table s4 of supplementary material the lowest errors were observed using the g based approach which is obvious as the data were generated by adopting g distribution also it can be observed from the profile of lj shown in fig 2b for river id 3 that λopt was not close to zero as the discharge data were generated by adopting g distribution profiles of lj versus λj for the remaining eight rivers are given in figure s5 of supplementary material fig 3b denotes the number of terms considered to estimate μ s pa analytically plots of the number of terms contributing to μ s pa for the remaining eight rivers are shown in figure s6 of supplementary material it should be noted that for river id 22 the range of the product of λopt and p was found to be very high the analytical solution still converges except that some jagged behavior was observed around the solution the jagged behavior can be attributed to the assumption of binomial series expansion used for deriving the analytical expression for μ s pa it is to be noted that pa provides a similar solution when the te is integrated numerically table 3 provides the estimates of λ opt μ s ln μ s g and μ s pa while the estimates of q 1 2 ln q 1 2 g and q 1 2 pa and q fed ln q fed g and q fed pa are provided in tables s5a and s5b respectively in the supplementary material the overall average of percent ar bias values for μ s q 1 2 and q fed were determined from all nine us rivers refer to table 2 for the ln based approach higher ar bias estimates were observed due to the inadequate fit of pdf to the discharge data for pa the average ar bias values in μ s q 1 2 and q fed matched closely to the g based approach and were better than the ln based approach the better performance of pa can be attributed to the better fitting of pdf to discharge data generated by g distribution to visualize the better performance of pa over ca box plots for the percent ar bias values were prepared considering nine us rivers corresponding to n 10000 15000 and 20 000 as illustrated in fig 4b it can be seen from the figure that the spread of ar bias for μ s q 1 2 and q fed tends to be very high in the case of the ln based approach to summarize pa has undoubtedly yielded better estimates of μ s and related q 1 2 and q fed as compared to the ln based approach and was found to be comparable with the g based approach when discharge data were g distributed 3 3 discharge data follow lp3 distribution fig 1c displays the histogram of discharge data generated by adopting lp3 distribution together with fitted pdfs based on the ln g based approaches and pa for river id 3 the fitted pdf based on pa shows a better fit to the histogram of discharge data as compared to the g based approach see fig 1c ln distribution also provides a better fit to the generated discharge data adopting lp3 distribution because ln distribution can be approximated as lp3 distribution for low skewed discharge data histograms together with the fitted pdfs for the remaining eight us rivers from nash 1994 are presented in figure s7 of supplementary material the average values of percent ar bias and rmse for all nine us rivers for n 15000 were estimated to be 6 44 34 78 10 84 and 69 56 328 68 117 04 for ln g pa based pdfs values of these statistical measures for all nine rivers corresponding to n 10000 15000 and 20 000 are given in table s6 in the supplementary material also it can be observed from the profile of lj shown in fig 2c for river id 3 that λopt does not tend to zero as the discharge data was generated adopting the lp3 distribution profiles of lj versus λj for the remaining eight rivers are given in figure s 8 of supplementary material fig 3c denotes the number of terms considered to estimate μ s pa analytically plots of the number of terms contributing to μ s pa for the remaining eight rivers are shown in figure s9 of supplementary material it can be observed that the λopt estimates for all rivers were negative the negative λopt tends to provide a continuously increasing plot of the analytical solution when we kept adding the terms of binomial series expansion due to this the plots of analytical solution did not converge smoothly for a few rivers river ids 7 8 26 where high values of cvs were observed however it is to be noted that pa provides satisfactory results when the te function is integrated numerically this validates the robustness of the approach table 4 provides estimates of λ opt μ s ln μ s g and μ s pa while the estimates of q 1 2 ln q 1 2 g and q 1 2 pa and q fed ln q fed g and q fed pa are presented in table s7a and table s7b respectively of supplementary material the overall average of percent ar bias values for μs q 1 2 and q fed were determined from all nine us rivers corresponding to n 10000 15000 and 20000 and are provided in table 2 higher ar bias values in μ s g q 1 2 g and q fed g were due to the inadequate fit of pdf although the ln distribution provided a better fit to the discharge data the ar bias values in μ s ln q 1 2 ln and q fed ln was observed to be higher this is because the ln distribution being a heavy tail distribution assigns considerable frequencies to the higher magnitude of discharges which results in magnified values of μ s and related q 1 2 and q fed a similar finding was also noted by guo et al 2016 and maheshwari and chavan 2021 contrary to this the average of percent ar bias values in μ s pa q 1 2 pa and q fed pa were found to be lower as compared to ln and g based approaches the better performance of pa can be credited to the better fitting of pdf to the discharge data including the tail of the distribution generated by the lp3 distribution to visualize the better performance of pa over ca box plots for the percent ar bias values were prepared for nine us rivers corresponding to n 10000 15000 and 20000 refer to fig 4c it can be seen from the figure that the spread of the ar bias for μ s q 1 2 and q fed tend to be high in the case of the ln and g based approaches to summarize pa has undoubtedly yielded better estimates of μ s and related q 1 2 and q fed as compared to ca when discharge data were lp3 distributed in conclusion the simulation experiment establishes the effectiveness of pa over the conventional ln or g based approaches in determining the reliable estimates of μ s q 1 2 and q fed for the general distribution of discharge datasets 4 application to south india river basins in this analysis pa is utilized to determine the reliable estimates of μ s q 1 2 and q fed for 14 gauges in four south indian rivers cauvery godavari krishna and mahanadi by taking into account the impact of hysteresis phenomenon on μ s and related q 1 2 and q fed 4 1 details of the study area and data used in the analysis the locations of the south indian river basins and 14 stream gauges are presented in fig 5 the selection of gauges was done based on the availability of continuous daily discharge and corresponding sediment concentration data for over 20 years and their catchment area ranging from 3141 km2 to 67908 km2 see table 5 the discharge and corresponding suspended sediment concentration data were taken from the water resources information system wris portal of the government of india https indiawris gov in wris the bed load which is an integral part of the total sediment load i e bed load plus suspended sediment load is negligible in comparison to the suspended sediment load for the south indian rivers e g vaithiyanathan et al 1988 ghose and swain 2011 from the discharge and suspended sediment concentration data the suspended sediment transport rates were calculated in tons per day the catchment characteristics of these gauges such as drainage area mean elevation mean discharge mean sediment load coefficient of variation of sediment transport rates cvs and kurtosis of log transformed discharge data k d are presented in table 5 4 2 impact of hysteresis phenomenon on μ s and related q 1 2 and q fed maheshwari and chavan 2022 examined the impact of the hysteresis phenomenon in suspended sediment transport for all 14 south indian catchments they found the presence of class v hysteresis in the sediment rating curves of most of the catchments while some of the catchments also possessed class iv class ii and class i hysteresis they examined the impact of the hysteresis on the rating curve by considering four cases of fitting sediment rating curves for each catchment viz 1 a single rating curve 2 separate rating curves for seasonal variation 3 two rating curves for stage tendency and 4 separate rating curves for seasonal variation with stage tendency datasets they concluded that the rating curves using either stage tendency or seasonal variation with stage tendency can reduce the impact of the hysteresis on the sediment transfer dynamics in mfa in this paper we investigated how reliably the proposed approach determines μ s as the estimates of the discharge indices q 1 2 and q fed also depend on it we considered the pa to predict μ s from which the total suspended loads were determined for the above mentioned four cases of fitting sediment rating curves the sediment rating curves i e the power law relationship between the discharge data and suspended sediment transport rates are shown in figure s10 of supplementary material details on the intercept a slope b and r2 value for these log log plots are given in table 5 the ar bias in the predicted estimates of total suspended loads corresponding to the four cases were determined by comparing them with the observed estimates of total suspended loads refer to table 6 the average ar bias value for a single rating curve case 1 was found to be the highest 37 22 while it was minimum for two rating curves fitted according to stage tendency 31 07 i e case 3 trailed by rating curves fitted based on seasonal variation with stage tendency 31 83 i e case 4 for all the 14 gauges a significant improvement i e more than 10 in the determination of total suspended sediment load was observed for case 4 at six catchments ashti bamni huvinhedgi nowrangpur pathagudem and pauni and for case 3 at four catchments bamni bamnidhi nowrangpur and pauni in the case of bamnidhi basantpur and konta different classes of hysteresis were observed for different datasets i e cases in the case of bamnidhi class i single valued line for total dataset while class iv clockwise loop single line i e clockwise hysteresis for the low discharges and no effect of hysteresis for the high discharges for monsoon dataset were observed in the case of basantpur class v anticlockwise loop clockwise loop i e anticlockwise hysteresis for low discharges while clockwise hysteresis for high discharges for total dataset while class iv single line clockwise loop for monsoon dataset were observed in the case of konta class iv anticlockwise loop single line for the total dataset while class v anticlockwise loop clockwise loop for the monsoon dataset was observed for musiri class iv single line clockwise loop was observed for total as well as monsoon datasets hysteresis loops for the low and high magnitude of discharges show the variability of sediment transport rates in the scatter diagram of discharge versus sediment transport rates some of this variability results from seasonal effects nash 1994 higher ar bias estimates were observed at these four catchments e g bamnidhi basantpur konta and musiri for case 2 or case 3 or case 4 as compared to case 1 except in the case of bamnidhi where case 3 provided the lowest ar bias this might be due to the systematic divergence in suspended sediment transport rates at high discharges i e the ineffectiveness of extrapolating the fitted power law for suspended sediment load transport beyond certain threshold discharge which could be the impact of climatic and landscape factors on the sediment yield of a catchment e g walling 1977 nash 1994 further minor improvement was observed either using case 3 or case 4 for seven catchments i e basantpur bawapuram billigundulu kodumudi konta musiri and savandapur overall it can be concluded that the pa was able to provide a reliable estimate of total suspended sediment load based on predicted μ s which could then be useful to predict robust estimates of q 1 2 and q fed subsequently the estimates of q 1 2 and q fed based on ca as well as pa were determined by considering the above mentioned four cases of fitting sediment rating curves for each of the 14 catchments thus there were overall nine subcases considered in this study the subcases included the total dataset based estimates i e total μ s pa total q 1 2 pa and total q fed pa the total dataset with the stage viz rise and fall tendency based estimates i e rise μ s pa rise q 1 2 pa and rise q fed pa fall μ s pa fall q 1 2 pa and

histogram of discharge data together with the fitted probability density functions pdfs for ca and pa is presented in fig 1d for gauge id 14 in a south indian river histograms along with the corresponding fitted pdfs for the remaining 13 catchments in south indian rivers are provided in figure s11 of supplementary material the average values of percent ar bias and rmse for all 14 stream gauges in south indian rivers were found to be 30 87 59 90 33 98 and 307 72 501 00 319 53 for ln g pa based pdfs the average values of percent ar bias and rmse for the fitted pdf in the case of pa were close to ln distribution while in the case of g distribution these statistical measures were high subsequently μ s q 1 2 and q fed estimates were determined for all 14 catchments using pa and ca i e ln and g based fig 2d shows the profile of lj versus λj for gauge id 14 which was utilized to determine λopt in the case of pa profiles of lj versus λj for the remaining 13 gauges in south indian rivers are shown in figure s12 of supplementary material fig 3d denotes the number of terms considered to estimate μ s pa analytically for gauge id 14 it can be observed that the λopt estimates for five out of 14 catchments e g gauge ids 2 8 10 11 and 14 were positive where the analytical solution converged smoothly for remaining catchments negative λopt estimates were observed the negative λopt tends to provide a continuously increasing plot of the analytical solution when we kept adding the terms of binomial series expansion due to this the plots of the analytical solution did not converge smoothly for some catchments e g gauge ids 1 4 5 6 7 9 and 13 especially where high values of coefficient of variation of data were observed however it is to be noted that pa provides satisfactory results when the te function is integrated numerically this validates the robustness of the approach table 7 provides estimates of λ opt μ s ln μ s g and μ s pa while the estimates of q 1 2 ln q 1 2 g and q 1 2 pa and q fed ln q fed g and q fed pa are tabulated in tables s9a and s9b respectively of supplementary material to facilitate the comparison between ca and pa the percent ar bias estimates in μ s q 1 2 and q fed were calculated refer to table 7 and tables s9a and s9b of supplementary material a similar analysis was performed for the other three cases containing eight subcases the estimates of μ s are provided in table 7 while the estimates of q 1 2 and q fed are provided in tables s9a and s9b respectively of supplementary material the percent ar bias in the estimates of μ s and related q 1 2 and q fed was also calculated for these eight subcases fig 6 shows the box plots of percent ar bias values of μ s q 1 2 and q fed obtained based on ca ln and g based pertaining to pa these plots indicate that for most of the catchments estimates of μ s q 1 2 and q fed attained using the ln based approach were found to be in very poor agreement with those obtained using pa while for the g based approach estimates were found to be in close agreement with those obtained using pa hence it can be inferred from the analysis that the proposed box cox based approach seems to be applicable for the general distribution of discharge datasets and it alleviates the need for the choice of appropriate frequency distribution for discharge data further the analysis indicates that the selection of μ s estimates should be done based on the cases of fitting sediment rating curves which result in the least ar bias estimate in the determination of total suspended sediment load these estimates of μ s could be more reliable and authentic representatives of the suspended sediment transfer dynamics within the river basins 5 conclusions in this study a modified approach i e box cox transformation based is proposed to determine reliable estimates of mean sediment load and related discharge indices viz half load discharge and functional equivalent discharge the proposed approach addresses satisfactorily the limitations of the conventional approaches of assuming the location specific probability distribution of discharge data which might not always be true and results in unreliable estimates of mean sediment load and related discharge indices the impact of the hysteresis phenomenon was also examined on the estimates of mean sediment load and related discharge indices due to seasonal variation stage tendency and seasonal variation with stage tendency in the sediment rating relationship the major inferences deduced from this study are listed below 1 under the proposed box cox transformation based approach an analytical expression was derived for mean sediment load which was then used to estimate discharge indices i e half load discharge and functional equivalent discharge the analytical solution for mean sediment load tends to converge smoothly for datasets yielding positive or close to zero estimates of an optimal power function parameter it should be noted that the solution tends to diverge for some rivers catchments especially when the optimal power function parameter becomes negative and data possess a high coefficient of variation this limitation is due to the use of binomial series expansion considered while deriving the analytical solution however it is to be noted that the proposed approach yielded reliable estimates of mean sediment load as compared to conventional approaches when the transport effectiveness function is integrated numerically 2 performance assessment of the proposed approach to yield reliable estimates of mean sediment load and related discharge indices was carried out through a simulation experiment considering three cases that involve the generation of discharge data by adopting lognormal gamma and log pearson type iii distributions this establishes the robustness of the proposed approach for the estimation of discharge indices for the general distribution of discharge datasets 3 the impact of the hysteresis phenomenon was examined on the estimates of mean sediment load and related discharge indices for indian catchments by considering various cases of fitting sediment rating curves based on seasonal and stage tendency overall it was concluded that the fitting of the sediment rating curve should be accomplished by accounting for seasonal based and stage based variations in sediment transport within river basins in summary the proposed box cox based approach outperformed the conventional approaches to determine mean sediment load based discharge indices for the general distribution of discharge datasets alleviating the need for the choice of appropriate frequency distribution for the datasets the better performance of the box cox transformation based proposed approach over the conventional approaches can be credited to the better fitting of the probability density function to the discharge data similar analysis can easily be applied to other rivers across the globe to strengthen the findings further credit authorship contribution statement shobhit maheshwari conceptualization methodology formal analysis data curation writing original draft

2460,discharge indices viz half load discharge q 1 2 and functional equivalent discharge qfed can be used to quantify the effectiveness of flow distribution in sediment transport through a river network q 1 2 represents the flow below and above which half of the total long term sediment load is transported while qfed indicates a uniform flow that replicates the total magnitude of the sediment load transported by the complete discharge distribution in magnitude frequency analysis mfa these indices are computed based on the estimate of mean sediment load μ s transported through a river network conventionally the analytical expression for μ s was derived by assuming the discharges to be lognormally ln or gamma g distributed however the assumption of discharge distribution is location specific and hence ln or g distributed discharge may not be valid for all catchments thus it is necessary to assess the uncertainty in the estimate of μ s and thereby the estimates of q 1 2 and qfed when the discharge data do not follow either ln or g distribution in this study a modified approach is proposed to determine μ s and related q 1 2 and qfed for the general distribution of discharge datasets the proposed approach pa includes the transformation of discharge data by applying the box cox transformation followed by the estimation of μ s q 1 2 and qfed furthermore an analytical expression is derived for the solution of μ s under the proposed framework a simulation experiment is performed to establish the effectiveness of pa over the conventional ln or g based approaches results indicated that pa provides reliable estimates of μ s q 1 2 and qfed the utility of the pa is demonstrated through its application to suspended sediment transport in four south indian rivers

q e represents a dominant discharge accountable for the transfer of most of the sediments through the river networks mathematically q e is considered as a flow at which the te function attains a maximum indicating the efficacy of a single flow rate in transferring long term sediment load q e is generally assumed to be a comparatively more frequent or common flood than other discharge indices and it predicts the bank full discharge q bf with mixed performance sholtes and bledsoe 2016 in the case of coarse bed rivers i e dominated by transport of bedload sediments q e predicts q bf reasonably well and sometimes much greater than q bf also while in the case of fine bed rivers i e dominated by transport of suspended sediments the estimate of q e is mostly much smaller than q bf e g pickup and warner 1976 soar and thorne 2011 bunte et al 2014 hassan et al 2014 contrary to q e vogel et al 2003 proposed a mean sediment load based discharge index q 1 2 which considers the role of entire flow distribution in the transfer of sediments through river networks mathematically q 1 2 is determined by integrating the te function such that the cumulative sediment load equals half of the total sediment load the q 1 2 is defined as the flow below and above which half of the total long term sediment load is transported vogel et al 2003 termed the concept of q 1 2 to be more interpretable than q e as it represents a more important quantity i e half of the total long term sediment load this is because q e is simply the maximum of te rather than its integral q 1 2 which describes the cumulative sum of sediment load transported for discharges up to some level vogel et al 2003 similar to q 1 2 fraction load discharge q f is defined as that discharge above which a fraction f of the long term sediment load is transported vogel et al 2003 guo et al 2016 maheshwari and chavan 2021 later doyle and shields 2008 developed an alternate based discharge index q fed it indicates a uniform flow that replicates the total magnitude of the sediment load transported by the complete discharge distribution that is q fed is the single flow transporting an equivalent of the at all times i e flow variability tends to 0 mathematically the computation of q fed also involves the integration of the te function over the entire range of discharges thereby providing a meaningful metric defining the transfer of cumulative sediment load over time doyle and shields 2008 termed the q fed as a more representative index of hydrologic variability than q e overall it can be inferred from the literature that q 1 2 and q fed are more appropriate indices for landscape evolution and long term sediment studies which consider cumulative sediment transport the estimates of q 1 2 and q fed are computed using the estimate of μ s transfer over a longer period a reliable estimation of is necessary to arrive at reliable estimates of these discharge indices the estimate of μ s is sensitive to the choice of the continuous probability distribution for fitting discharge data and the complex sediment transfer dynamics due to the hysteresis effect detailed discussion on these aspects is provided in subsequent subsections 1 1 discharge distributions considered to determine μ s and related q 1 2 and q fed it can be noted from past studies that the assumption of log normal ln distributed discharge data has been pivotal in the computation of discharge indices both q 1 2 as well as q fed e g vogel et al 2003 doyle and shields 2008 sholtes et al 2014 guo et al 2016 maheshwari and chavan 2019 maheshwari and chavan 2021 many studies inferred the invalidity of ln distribution for the representation of daily discharge data nash 1994 sholtes et al 2014 blum et al 2017 maheshwari and chavan 2019 guo et al 2016 maheshwari and chavan 2021 nash 1994 suggested the use of other frequency distributions than ln to define the frequency of discharge data goodwin 2004 used several continuous probability distributions viz normal n log normal ln gamma g pearson type iii p3 and log pearson type iii lp3 to estimate q e for red river and russian river in the united states us he showed that the discharge data mainly follow either ln distribution or g distribution sholtes et al 2014 mentioned the need to consider different probability distributions other than ln distribution to compute discharge indices further guo et al 2016 derived the analytical estimates of discharge indices viz q e q f and q fed using ln mixed log normal mln g and mixed gamma mg distributions for fitting the discharge data of 19 small intermittent streams in ontario canada they found that discharge indices determined analytically using mg distribution show a better match with the empirical estimates of these indices although the goodness of fit test could not provide evidence about the improvement in the fit using mg distribution over g ln and mln distributions recently maheshwari and chavan 2021 calculated various discharge indices viz q f and q fed using ln and g based magnitude frequency analysis mfa approach for south indian catchments they found that the g distribution based mfa approach provided consistent estimates of discharge indices although ln probability distribution fitted the discharge data more accurately the aforementioned discussion points to the fact that there is ambiguity about the selection of frequency distribution for daily discharge data that leads to uncertainty in the estimation of μ s and related discharge indices viz q 1 2 and q fed the aforementioned discussion highlights that the discharge distribution is location specific thus the estimates of μ s and related q 1 2 and q fed are sensitive to the selected probability distribution however there is a lack of effort to examine the uncertainty in the estimate of μ s as well as q 1 2 and q fed especially when the discharge data do not follow either ln or g distribution further there is a need to develop a strategy to estimate μ s and related q 1 2 and q fed for the general distribution of discharge datasets 1 2 impact of hysteresis phenomenon in sediment rating curve on the estimates of μ s q 1 2 and q fed seasonal and climatic variability within the catchments result in unsteady discharges and cause the hysteresis effect in the power law relationship

effect might influence the estimate of μ s and related q 1 2 and q fed the hysteresis effect is generally observed due to the alterations in the sediment availability during a hydrological event when there is a time shift between the peaks of the discharges and corresponding suspended sediment transport rates i e peaks of hydrograph and corresponding sediment graph bača 2008 such hysteretic behavior results in a scatter cloud in the sediment rating curve asselman 1999 williams 1989 defined the classes of hysteresis effect based on sediment concentration and discharge data relationship as a class i single valued line b class ii clockwise loop c class iii anticlockwise loop d class iv clockwise or anticlockwise loop plus single valued line or vice and versa and e class v figure eight i e clockwise loop plus anticlockwise loop or vice and versa details regarding the classes of hysteresis effect can be observed in the literature e g williams 1989 asselman 1999 bača 2008 tananaev 2015 maheshwari and chavan 2022 from the past literature it was observed that the quality of sediment load estimation can be improved by constructing separate rating curves for discharges belonging to the rising stage and falling stage walling 1977 walling and webb 1982 aquino et al 2009 nash 1994 investigated the existence of the hysteresis effect in suspended sediment transport through 55 us rivers sichingabula 1999 inspected the hysteresis effect on the estimates of qe considering the stage tendency recently maheshwari and chavan 2022 examined the presence of the hysteresis effect in the suspended sediment transport through 14 catchments in south indian rivers it was inferred from their study that the sediment rating curves based on either stage tendency or seasonal variation with stage tendency can be used to reduce the impact of the hysteresis on the sediment transfer dynamics herein the estimates of q 1 2 and q fed indices are dependent on the reliable estimation of μ s it would be interesting to investigate the effect of the hysteresis phenomenon on the estimates of μ s and related q 1 2 and q fed indices due to stage tendency seasonal variation and seasonal variation with stage tendency in the sediment rating relationship 1 3 study goals in this paper a box cox transformation based approach is proposed to determine reliable estimates of μ s and related discharge indices viz q 1 2 and q fed for the general distribution of discharge datasets under the proposed framework the discharge data is transformed using power transform i e box cox transformation which tends to transform discharge distribution into normal like distribution e g box and cox 1964 in addition an analytical expression is derived for μ s under the proposed framework performance assessment of the proposed approach to yield reliable estimates of μ s and related discharge indices viz q 1 2 and q fed is done through a simulation study subsequently the utility of the approach is demonstrated through its application to 14 stream gauges in four south indian rivers cauvery godavari krishna and mahanadi finally the impact of the hysteresis on the estimation of μ s q 1 2 and q fed is examined the paper is organized in the following manner methodology to determine μ s and related q 1 2 and q fed based on conventional i e ln and g based approaches is provided in section 2 1 followed by section 2 2 which contains a write up and methodological steps based on the proposed approach subsequently a simulation experiment is given in section 3 to assess the performance of the proposed approach over the conventional approaches section 4 demonstrates the utility of the proposed approach in south indian rivers cauvery godavari krishna and mahanadi finally conclusions are provided in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 conventional approaches to determine μ s and related q 1 2 and q fed mathematically the transport effectiveness te proposed by wolman and miller 1960 is given by equation 1 1 te s x f q where s is the sediment transport rate and f q is the frequency distribution of discharge q here q represents the random variable for daily discharge and q denotes the values taken by q conventionally s is assumed to have a power law relationship with q e g nash 1994 vogel et al 2003 klonsky and vogel 2011 sholtes et al 2014 guo et al 2016 maheshwari and chavan 2022 2 s a x q b where a and b are the coefficient and the exponent respectively of the power law relationship between q and s in the past literature lognormal ln and gamma g distributions have been used and considered the most robust distribution for describing q in the determination of discharge indices e g nash 1994 goodwin 2004 doyle and shields 2008 sholtes et al 2014 basso et al 2015 guo et al

the scale parameter respectively of g distribution using equations 2 and 3a the transport effectiveness t e ln function can be created based on ln distribution as 4a t e ln a q b q β 2 π e ln q α 2 2 β 2 similarly the transport effectiveness t e g function based on g distribution is specified by 4b t e g a λ η q b η 1 e λ q γ η following vogel et al 2003 doyle and shields 2008 basso et al 2015 guo et al 2016 and maheshwari and chavan 2021 the analytical expressions for mean sediment load i e μ s ln and μ s g can be derived by integrating equations 4a and 4b from 0 to 5a μ s ln 0 a q b q β 2 π e ln q α 2 2 β 2 d q μ s ln a exp b 2 β 2 2 b α 5b μ s g 0 a λ η q b η 1 e λ q γ η d q μ s g a λ b γ η b γ η subsequently the estimate of half load discharge q 1 2 which corresponds to half of the mean sediment load μ s 2 can be obtained by integrating equations 4a and 4b from 0 to q 1 2 6a 0 q 1 2 ln a q b q β 2 π e ln q α 2 2 β 2 d q μ s ln 2 6b 0 q 1 2 g a λ η q b η 1 e λ q γ η d q μ s g 2 by using the analytical expression of μ s as given in equations 5a and 5b and simplifying equations 6a and 6b the fraction load discharge q f can be estimated based on the assumptions of ln distributed

probability f 7b f 1 γ b η λ q f g equation 7b represents a gamma function in terms of the fraction load discharge q f g thus the estimate q f g can be determined numerically from the inverse of the g function later doyle and shields 2008 and basso et al 2015 derived the analytical expressions for q fed for ln and g distributions i e q fed ln and q fed g as given below 8a q fed ln μ s ln a 1 b 8b q

approach might not always be true e g nash 1994 sholtes et al 2014 guo et al 2016 maheshwari and chavan 2019 maheshwari and chavan 2022 the invalidity of distribution in fitting discharge data might result in unreliable or unauthentic estimates of μ s q 1 2 and q fed hence a modified approach is proposed to determine μ s and related discharge indices viz q 1 2 and q fed for the general distribution of discharge datasets the proposed approach pa utilizes power transformation viz one parameter box cox transformation to transform the daily discharge data making it normal like irrespective of the original discharge distribution e g box and cox 1964 this kind of strategy was found to be effective in several applications in the field of hydrology e g chander et al 1978 kuczera 1983 jain and singh 1986 bates and campbell 2001 thyer et al 2002 yang et al 2007 engeland et al 2010 wang et al 2012 recently maheshwari and chavan 2022 provided a box cox transformation based approach to derive an analytical expression for te based q e the steps involved in the proposed approach pa to determine μ s and related q 1 2 and q fed are as follows 1 define λmin and λ max respectively as the lower and the upper bound for a power function parameter λj for one parameter box cox transformation of raw discharge data where j ranges from 1 2 20 000 in this study λmin and λ max were chosen as 1 and 1 respectively 2 the transformed data vector pj corresponding to λj can be obtained using equation 9 9 p j q i λ j 1 λ j i f λ j 0 ln q i i f λ j 0 f o r i 1 n where the subscript i denotes ith discharge data qi and n represents the total length of data 3 construct a log likelihood function lj for each λj value based on equation 10 lj is generally used as a measure of how well a particular model fits the data 10 l j α p β p 2 λ j n 2 ln 2 π n 2 ln β p 2 1 2 i 1 n q λ j 1 λ j α p 2 β p 2 where αp and βp are the mean and standard deviation of pj the procedure to determine lj value corresponding to λj and parameters αp and βp is provided in maheshwari and chavan 2022 4 the optimal power function parameter λopt was determined from all λj for which lj attained a maximum value a step by step more detailed procedure to arrive at λopt is provided in maheshwari and chavan 2022 5 the discharge data is then transformed into normal n distribution based on one parameter box cox transformation strategy by using equation 11 11 p q i λ o p t 1 λ o p t i f λ o p t 0 l n q i i f λ o p t 0 f o r i 1 n the p denotes the discharge in transformed space which is obtained from the discharge q i in the original space 6 the transformed variable p was assumed to be n distributed as shown by equation 12 12 f p 1 β p 2 π exp p α p 2 2 β p 2 where αp and βp denote the mean and the standard deviation respectively of p 7 the sediment transport rate corresponding to p can be estimated from equation 13 in transformed space 13 s a p λ opt 1 b λ opt 8 the te function

by integrating equation 15 from to numerically 15 μ s a p λ opt 1 b λ opt β p 2 π exp p α p 2 2 β p 2 d p 10 in addition an analytical expression for μ s is also derived based on binomial expansion

considering binomial expansion which is an infinite series while computing the estimate of μ s we can consider the terms to have a considerable contribution the contribution from the remaining terms

specific sediment transport relationship 19 q fed μ s a 1 b 3 performance assessment of the proposed approach pa this section presents a simulation based study that establishes the robustness of pa in determining μ s and related q 1 2 and q fed evaluation of pa was carried out through the monte carlo simulation experiment in which discharge data were generated by considering various probability distributions for the generation of daily discharge q and corresponding sediment transport rates s the parameters were taken from table s1 in the supplementary material provided by nash 1994 which gives details on 55 us rivers daily discharge data were generated by assuming probability distributions such as ln g and lp3 distributions these distributions were chosen based on the previous literature e g nash 1994 goodwin 2004 sholtes et al 2014 guo et al 2016 maheshwari and chavan 2022 sample sizes of 10000 15000 and 20 000 were considered for the generation of data the sample sizes represent the length of discharge data n in days following this s data were estimated corresponding to the generated q data by using coefficient a and exponent b of the power law relationship given in nash 1994 refer to table s1 in the supplementary material the details regarding the procedure to generate discharge data are adopted from maheshwari and chavan 2022 a preliminary quality check was needed to exclude some rivers from the analysis to avoid unreasonable values of data properties viz coefficient of variation of suspended sediment transport rates cvs and kurtosis of log transformed daily discharge data k d it was observed that cvs and k d influence the fitting of the probability density function pdf subscripts s and d were used for sediment data and discharge data respectively previously it was also done to maintain the standard river conditions for the simulation experiment e g syvitski et al 2000 sholtes et al 2014 maheshwari and chavan 2022 the threshold limit of cvs and k d was set as 10 and 6 respectively for the elimination of rivers used in the simulation experiment based on the past literature e g klonsky and vogel 2011 roy and sinha 2014 sholtes et al 2014 maheshwari and chavan 2022 in the present study we have considered 28 9 and 9 rivers from 55 us rivers for ln g and lp3 distributions based simulation experiment respectively refer to table 1 table 3 and table 4 performance assessment of pa to predict μ s q 1 2 and q fed concerning the conventional approaches ca i e ln and g based e g vogel et al 2003 doyle and shields 2008 basso et al 2015 guo et al 2016 maheshwari and chavan 2021 was carried out for the following three cases described in sub sections 3 1 3 2 and 3 3 3 1 discharge data follow ln distribution the ln and g based pdfs were fitted to the generated discharge data for each of the 28 us rivers for brevity fig 1 a shows the histogram of discharge data together with the fitted pdfs for river id 3 from nash 1994 histograms of discharge data together with the fitted pdfs for the remaining 27 us rivers from nash 1994 are given in figure s1 of supplementary material it can be observed from the figure that the discharge data fits well with ln distribution as compared to g distribution as it was generated by adopting ln distribution the fitted pdfs were compared with the histograms of daily discharge data using statistical error measures viz absolute relative bias ar bias in and root mean square error rmse the average values of percent ar bias and rmse for all 28 us rivers for n 15000 were estimated to be 11 07 29 27 and 136 51 329 10 for ln g based pdfs values of these statistical measures for all 28 us rivers considering n 10000 15000 and 20 000 are given in table s2 of supplementary material table 1 tabulates the estimates of μ s ln and μ s g while the estimates of q 1 2 ln q 1 2 g and q fed ln q fed g are provided in tables s3a and s3b respectively of supplementary material in the case of pa the discharge data were first transformed by using λopt for which lj gets a maximum value refer to section 2 2 fig 2 a displays the profile of lj versus λj for river id 3 profiles of lj verses λj for the remaining 27 rivers are displayed in figure s2 of supplementary material it can be observed from the figure that the parameter λopt tends to zero as the generated discharge data were log transformed which is a special case of box cox transformation refer to equation 11 subsequently the te function was created based on the frequency distribution of transformed discharge f p as given by equation 12 and the power law relationship between p and s as given by equation 13 refer to section 2 2 fig 1a shows that the pdf of pa resembles the ln based pdf subsequently μ s based on pa i e μ s pa was computed using derived analytical expression refer to equation 16 as well as numerically refer to equation 15 the product of λopt and p was found to lie within the range of 1 to 1 which is one of the necessary conditions for using the binomial series expansion refer to appendix a the number of terms in equation 16 required to estimate μ s pa was decided based on the convergence of the analytical solution which is based on the plot that shows the contribution of each of the terms see fig 3 a for river id 3 the remaining plots are presented in figure s3 of supplementary material finally q 1 2 and q fed based on pa i e q 1 2 pa and q fed pa were determined using equations 17a and 17b and equation 19 respectively table 1 presents the estimates of μ s pa while the estimates of q 1 2 pa and q fed pa are presented in tables s3a and s3b respectively of supplementary material following vogel et al 2003 the empirical estimate of q 1 2 i e q 1 2 obs was calculated by ordering all daily discharge data by the magnitude and adding up corresponding sediment transport rates in order and thereafter finding the discharge for which the cumulative sum of sediment transport rates reaches half the total sediment transport rates in addition empirical μ s i e μ s obs can be considered as the average of sediment transport rates observed over the entire length of generated data subsequently the empirical estimate of q fed i e q fed obs was calculated based on μ s obs for the given discharge specific sediment relationship empirical estimates of μ s obs are provided in table 1 while the estimates of q 1 2 obs and q fed obs are provided in tables s3a and s3b respectively of supplementary material performance assessment of pa with respect to ca was carried out by comparing the estimates of μ s q 1 2 and q fed with the corresponding empirical observed estimates through percent absolute relative bias ar bias as given by equation 20 20 ar b i a s μ s a μ s obs μ s a μ s obs 100 a r b i a s q 1 2 a q 1 2 obs q 1 2 a q 1 2 obs 100 a r b i a s q fed a q fed obs q fed a q fed obs 100 where ar b i a s μ s a ar b i a s q 1 2 a and ar b i a s q fed a represent absolute relative bias in in μ s q 1 2 and q fed respectively for an approach a a stands for ln or g based approach or pa table 1 shows the percent ar bias values for μ s while the ar bias values for q 1 2 and q fed are shown in tables s3a and s3b respectively of supplementary material the overall average of percent ar bias values for μ s q 1 2 and q fed determined from 28 rivers for different data lengths i e n 10000 15000 and 20000 were presented in table 2 for pa the average percent ar bias values in μ s q 1 2 and q fed matched very closely to the ln based approach and were better than the g based approach this can be credited to the better fitting of pdfs to the histogram of discharge data the average values of percent ar bias i e 11 12 and rmse i e 137 01 for the fitted pdf in the case of pa were close to ln distribution see fig 1a values of these statistical measures in the case of pa for all 28 us rivers are provided in table s2 of supplementary material to visualize the spread of percent ar bias for each of the approaches for all 28 rivers box plots were created for the percent ar bias in μ s q 1 2 and q fed as illustrated in fig 4 a corresponding to n 10000 15000 and 20000 the figure illustrates that spread of ar bias values for μ s and related q 1 2 and q fed is less and comparable for both pa and ln based approach when compared with the g based approach it can be seen that the medians of ar bias for pa are lower than ln and g based approaches overall the results show that the proposed approach yields reliable or authentic estimates of μ s and related q 1 2 and q fed when the discharge data were lognormally distributed 3 2 discharge data follow g distribution fig 1b displays the histogram of daily discharge data generated by adopting g distribution together with the fitted pdfs based on the ln g based approaches and pa for river id 3 from nash 1994 fig 1b clarifies that the histogram of discharge data possesses a better fit to the fitted pdfs of the g based approach and pa in comparison to the ln based approach histograms together with the fitted pdfs for the remaining eight us rivers from nash 1994 are presented in figure s4 of supplementary material the average values of percent ar bias and rmse for all nine us rivers for n 15000 were estimated to be 5 31 0 40 0 55 and 70 29 12 74 16 12 for ln g pa based fitted pdfs values of these statistical measures for all nine us rivers considering n 10000 15000 and 20 000 are provided in table s4 of supplementary material the lowest errors were observed using the g based approach which is obvious as the data were generated by adopting g distribution also it can be observed from the profile of lj shown in fig 2b for river id 3 that λopt was not close to zero as the discharge data were generated by adopting g distribution profiles of lj versus λj for the remaining eight rivers are given in figure s5 of supplementary material fig 3b denotes the number of terms considered to estimate μ s pa analytically plots of the number of terms contributing to μ s pa for the remaining eight rivers are shown in figure s6 of supplementary material it should be noted that for river id 22 the range of the product of λopt and p was found to be very high the analytical solution still converges except that some jagged behavior was observed around the solution the jagged behavior can be attributed to the assumption of binomial series expansion used for deriving the analytical expression for μ s pa it is to be noted that pa provides a similar solution when the te is integrated numerically table 3 provides the estimates of λ opt μ s ln μ s g and μ s pa while the estimates of q 1 2 ln q 1 2 g and q 1 2 pa and q fed ln q fed g and q fed pa are provided in tables s5a and s5b respectively in the supplementary material the overall average of percent ar bias values for μ s q 1 2 and q fed were determined from all nine us rivers refer to table 2 for the ln based approach higher ar bias estimates were observed due to the inadequate fit of pdf to the discharge data for pa the average ar bias values in μ s q 1 2 and q fed matched closely to the g based approach and were better than the ln based approach the better performance of pa can be attributed to the better fitting of pdf to discharge data generated by g distribution to visualize the better performance of pa over ca box plots for the percent ar bias values were prepared considering nine us rivers corresponding to n 10000 15000 and 20 000 as illustrated in fig 4b it can be seen from the figure that the spread of ar bias for μ s q 1 2 and q fed tends to be very high in the case of the ln based approach to summarize pa has undoubtedly yielded better estimates of μ s and related q 1 2 and q fed as compared to the ln based approach and was found to be comparable with the g based approach when discharge data were g distributed 3 3 discharge data follow lp3 distribution fig 1c displays the histogram of discharge data generated by adopting lp3 distribution together with fitted pdfs based on the ln g based approaches and pa for river id 3 the fitted pdf based on pa shows a better fit to the histogram of discharge data as compared to the g based approach see fig 1c ln distribution also provides a better fit to the generated discharge data adopting lp3 distribution because ln distribution can be approximated as lp3 distribution for low skewed discharge data histograms together with the fitted pdfs for the remaining eight us rivers from nash 1994 are presented in figure s7 of supplementary material the average values of percent ar bias and rmse for all nine us rivers for n 15000 were estimated to be 6 44 34 78 10 84 and 69 56 328 68 117 04 for ln g pa based pdfs values of these statistical measures for all nine rivers corresponding to n 10000 15000 and 20 000 are given in table s6 in the supplementary material also it can be observed from the profile of lj shown in fig 2c for river id 3 that λopt does not tend to zero as the discharge data was generated adopting the lp3 distribution profiles of lj versus λj for the remaining eight rivers are given in figure s 8 of supplementary material fig 3c denotes the number of terms considered to estimate μ s pa analytically plots of the number of terms contributing to μ s pa for the remaining eight rivers are shown in figure s9 of supplementary material it can be observed that the λopt estimates for all rivers were negative the negative λopt tends to provide a continuously increasing plot of the analytical solution when we kept adding the terms of binomial series expansion due to this the plots of analytical solution did not converge smoothly for a few rivers river ids 7 8 26 where high values of cvs were observed however it is to be noted that pa provides satisfactory results when the te function is integrated numerically this validates the robustness of the approach table 4 provides estimates of λ opt μ s ln μ s g and μ s pa while the estimates of q 1 2 ln q 1 2 g and q 1 2 pa and q fed ln q fed g and q fed pa are presented in table s7a and table s7b respectively of supplementary material the overall average of percent ar bias values for μs q 1 2 and q fed were determined from all nine us rivers corresponding to n 10000 15000 and 20000 and are provided in table 2 higher ar bias values in μ s g q 1 2 g and q fed g were due to the inadequate fit of pdf although the ln distribution provided a better fit to the discharge data the ar bias values in μ s ln q 1 2 ln and q fed ln was observed to be higher this is because the ln distribution being a heavy tail distribution assigns considerable frequencies to the higher magnitude of discharges which results in magnified values of μ s and related q 1 2 and q fed a similar finding was also noted by guo et al 2016 and maheshwari and chavan 2021 contrary to this the average of percent ar bias values in μ s pa q 1 2 pa and q fed pa were found to be lower as compared to ln and g based approaches the better performance of pa can be credited to the better fitting of pdf to the discharge data including the tail of the distribution generated by the lp3 distribution to visualize the better performance of pa over ca box plots for the percent ar bias values were prepared for nine us rivers corresponding to n 10000 15000 and 20000 refer to fig 4c it can be seen from the figure that the spread of the ar bias for μ s q 1 2 and q fed tend to be high in the case of the ln and g based approaches to summarize pa has undoubtedly yielded better estimates of μ s and related q 1 2 and q fed as compared to ca when discharge data were lp3 distributed in conclusion the simulation experiment establishes the effectiveness of pa over the conventional ln or g based approaches in determining the reliable estimates of μ s q 1 2 and q fed for the general distribution of discharge datasets 4 application to south india river basins in this analysis pa is utilized to determine the reliable estimates of μ s q 1 2 and q fed for 14 gauges in four south indian rivers cauvery godavari krishna and mahanadi by taking into account the impact of hysteresis phenomenon on μ s and related q 1 2 and q fed 4 1 details of the study area and data used in the analysis the locations of the south indian river basins and 14 stream gauges are presented in fig 5 the selection of gauges was done based on the availability of continuous daily discharge and corresponding sediment concentration data for over 20 years and their catchment area ranging from 3141 km2 to 67908 km2 see table 5 the discharge and corresponding suspended sediment concentration data were taken from the water resources information system wris portal of the government of india https indiawris gov in wris the bed load which is an integral part of the total sediment load i e bed load plus suspended sediment load is negligible in comparison to the suspended sediment load for the south indian rivers e g vaithiyanathan et al 1988 ghose and swain 2011 from the discharge and suspended sediment concentration data the suspended sediment transport rates were calculated in tons per day the catchment characteristics of these gauges such as drainage area mean elevation mean discharge mean sediment load coefficient of variation of sediment transport rates cvs and kurtosis of log transformed discharge data k d are presented in table 5 4 2 impact of hysteresis phenomenon on μ s and related q 1 2 and q fed maheshwari and chavan 2022 examined the impact of the hysteresis phenomenon in suspended sediment transport for all 14 south indian catchments they found the presence of class v hysteresis in the sediment rating curves of most of the catchments while some of the catchments also possessed class iv class ii and class i hysteresis they examined the impact of the hysteresis on the rating curve by considering four cases of fitting sediment rating curves for each catchment viz 1 a single rating curve 2 separate rating curves for seasonal variation 3 two rating curves for stage tendency and 4 separate rating curves for seasonal variation with stage tendency datasets they concluded that the rating curves using either stage tendency or seasonal variation with stage tendency can reduce the impact of the hysteresis on the sediment transfer dynamics in mfa in this paper we investigated how reliably the proposed approach determines μ s as the estimates of the discharge indices q 1 2 and q fed also depend on it we considered the pa to predict μ s from which the total suspended loads were determined for the above mentioned four cases of fitting sediment rating curves the sediment rating curves i e the power law relationship between the discharge data and suspended sediment transport rates are shown in figure s10 of supplementary material details on the intercept a slope b and r2 value for these log log plots are given in table 5 the ar bias in the predicted estimates of total suspended loads corresponding to the four cases were determined by comparing them with the observed estimates of total suspended loads refer to table 6 the average ar bias value for a single rating curve case 1 was found to be the highest 37 22 while it was minimum for two rating curves fitted according to stage tendency 31 07 i e case 3 trailed by rating curves fitted based on seasonal variation with stage tendency 31 83 i e case 4 for all the 14 gauges a significant improvement i e more than 10 in the determination of total suspended sediment load was observed for case 4 at six catchments ashti bamni huvinhedgi nowrangpur pathagudem and pauni and for case 3 at four catchments bamni bamnidhi nowrangpur and pauni in the case of bamnidhi basantpur and konta different classes of hysteresis were observed for different datasets i e cases in the case of bamnidhi class i single valued line for total dataset while class iv clockwise loop single line i e clockwise

was observed for total as well as monsoon datasets hysteresis loops for the low and high magnitude of discharges show the variability of sediment transport rates in the scatter diagram of discharge versus sediment transport rates some of this variability results from seasonal effects nash 1994 higher ar bias estimates were observed at these four catchments e g bamnidhi basantpur konta and musiri for case 2 or case 3 or case 4 as compared to case 1 except in the case of bamnidhi where case 3 provided the lowest ar bias this might be due to the systematic divergence in suspended sediment transport rates at high discharges i e the ineffectiveness of extrapolating the fitted power law for suspended sediment load transport beyond certain threshold discharge which could be the impact of climatic and landscape factors on the sediment yield of a catchment e g walling 1977 nash 1994 further minor improvement was observed either using case 3 or case 4 for seven catchments i e basantpur bawapuram billigundulu kodumudi konta musiri and savandapur overall it can be concluded that the pa was able to provide a reliable estimate of total suspended sediment load based on predicted μ s which could then be useful to predict robust estimates of q 1 2 and q fed subsequently the estimates of q 1 2 and q fed based on ca as well as pa were determined by considering the above mentioned four cases of fitting sediment rating curves for each of the 14 catchments thus there were overall nine subcases considered in this study the subcases included the total dataset based estimates i e total μ s pa total q 1 2 pa and total q fed pa the total dataset with the stage viz rise and fall tendency based estimates i e rise μ s pa rise q 1 2 pa and rise q fed pa fall μ s pa fall q 1 2 pa and

histogram of discharge data together with the fitted probability density functions pdfs for ca and pa is presented in fig 1d for gauge id 14 in a south indian river histograms along with the corresponding fitted pdfs for the remaining 13 catchments in south indian rivers are provided in figure s11 of supplementary material the average values of percent ar bias and rmse for all 14 stream gauges in south indian rivers were found to be 30 87 59 90 33 98 and 307 72 501 00 319 53 for ln g pa based pdfs the average values of percent ar bias and rmse for the fitted pdf in the case of pa were close to ln distribution while in the case of g distribution these statistical measures were high subsequently μ s q 1 2 and q fed estimates were determined for all 14 catchments using pa and ca i e ln and g based fig 2d shows the profile of lj versus λj for gauge id 14 which was utilized to determine λopt in the case of pa profiles of lj versus λj for the remaining 13 gauges in south indian rivers are shown in figure s12 of supplementary material fig 3d denotes the number of terms considered to estimate μ s pa analytically for gauge id 14 it can be observed that the λopt estimates for five out of 14 catchments e g gauge ids 2 8 10 11 and 14 were positive where the analytical solution converged smoothly for remaining catchments negative λopt estimates were observed the negative λopt tends to provide a continuously increasing plot of the analytical solution when we kept adding the terms of binomial series expansion due to this the plots of the analytical solution did not converge smoothly for some catchments e g gauge ids 1 4 5 6 7 9 and 13 especially where high values of coefficient of variation of data were observed however it is to be noted that pa provides satisfactory results when the te function is integrated numerically this validates the robustness of the approach table 7 provides estimates of λ opt μ s ln μ s g and μ s pa while the estimates of q 1 2 ln q 1 2 g and q 1 2 pa and q fed ln q fed g and q fed pa are tabulated in tables s9a and s9b respectively of supplementary material to facilitate the comparison between ca and pa the percent ar bias estimates in μ s q 1 2 and q fed were calculated refer to table 7 and tables s9a and s9b of supplementary material a similar analysis was performed for the other three cases containing eight subcases the estimates of μ s are provided in table 7 while the estimates of q 1 2 and q fed are provided in tables s9a and s9b respectively of supplementary material the percent ar bias in the estimates of μ s and related q 1 2 and q fed was also calculated for these eight subcases fig 6 shows the box plots of percent ar bias values of μ s q 1 2 and q fed obtained based on ca ln and g based pertaining to pa these plots indicate that for most of the catchments estimates of μ s q 1 2 and q fed attained using the ln based approach were found to be in very poor agreement with those obtained using pa while for the g based approach estimates were found to be in close agreement with those obtained using pa hence it can be inferred from the analysis that the proposed box cox based approach seems to be applicable for the general distribution of discharge datasets and it alleviates the need for the choice of appropriate frequency distribution for discharge data further the analysis indicates that the selection of μ s estimates should be done based on the cases of fitting sediment rating curves which result in the least ar bias estimate in the determination of total suspended sediment load these estimates of μ s could be more reliable and authentic representatives of the suspended sediment transfer dynamics within the river basins 5 conclusions in this study a modified approach i e box cox transformation based is proposed to determine reliable estimates of mean sediment load and related discharge indices viz half load discharge and functional equivalent discharge the proposed approach addresses satisfactorily the limitations of the conventional approaches of assuming the location specific probability distribution of discharge data which might not always be true and results in unreliable estimates of mean sediment load and related discharge indices the impact of the hysteresis phenomenon was also examined on the estimates of mean sediment load and related discharge indices due to seasonal variation stage tendency and seasonal variation with stage tendency in the sediment rating relationship the major inferences deduced from this study are listed below 1 under the proposed box cox transformation based approach an analytical expression was derived for mean sediment load which was then used to estimate discharge indices i e half load discharge and functional equivalent discharge the analytical solution for mean sediment load tends to converge smoothly for datasets yielding positive or close to zero estimates of an optimal power function parameter it should be noted that the solution tends to diverge for some rivers catchments especially when the optimal power function parameter becomes negative and data possess a high coefficient of variation this limitation is due to the use of binomial series expansion considered while deriving the analytical solution however it is to be noted that the proposed approach yielded reliable estimates of mean sediment load as compared to conventional approaches when the transport effectiveness function is integrated numerically 2 performance assessment of the proposed approach to yield reliable estimates of mean sediment load and related discharge indices was carried out through a simulation experiment considering three cases that involve the generation of discharge data by adopting lognormal gamma and log pearson type iii distributions this establishes the robustness of the proposed approach for the estimation of discharge indices for the general distribution of discharge datasets 3 the impact of the hysteresis phenomenon was examined on the estimates of mean sediment load and related discharge indices for indian catchments by considering various cases of fitting sediment rating curves based on seasonal and stage tendency overall it was concluded that the fitting of the sediment rating curve should be accomplished by accounting for seasonal based and stage based variations in sediment transport within river basins in summary the proposed box cox based approach outperformed the conventional approaches to determine mean sediment load based discharge indices for the general distribution of discharge datasets alleviating the need for the choice of appropriate frequency distribution for the datasets the better performance of the box cox transformation based proposed approach over the conventional approaches can be credited to the better fitting of the probability density function to the discharge data similar analysis can easily be applied to other rivers across the globe to strengthen the findings further credit authorship contribution statement shobhit maheshwari conceptualization methodology formal analysis data curation writing original draft

2461,the fracture matrix system in which water is stored and transported has a significant impact on the hydraulic behaviors of fractured geologic media fgm however it is very challenging to accurately simulate flow behavior in fgm due to the difficulty of characterizing dual permeability media including multiscale fractures with high permeability and porous matrix with low permeability in this study a multiscale fracture integrated equivalent porous medium mfepm method is proposed for simulating fluid flow and solute transport in a fracture matrix system the synthetic enhanced matrix sem is compounded by integrating small scale fractures into the porous medium and the medium and large scale fractures are mapped to refined grids of the mfepm to increase the characterization of the fracture geometry and orientation then the equivalent hydraulic properties are calculated according to the properties of the fractures finally a finite difference method fdm based on the mfepm is used to simulate flow and solute transport in coupled multiscale fractures and rock matrix the case study illustrates that compared with the traditional equivalent porous medium epm method the mfepm manifests an efficient effect in the characterization of preferential flow compared with the discrete fracture network dfn method the mfepm can characterize flow and solute transport in the sem and represent mass interactions between the fractures and matrix the results of the numerical case studies of flow and solute transport also show that the mfepm method has a high computational accuracy and good reliability while maintaining an appropriate computational burden keywords equivalent porous media fractured geologic media finite difference method multiscale fracture matrix system data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as common geological structures in fractured geologic media fgm fractures have a significant impact on the mechanical and hydraulic behaviors of fgm li and li 2019 pan et al 2010 ren et al 2015 zheng et al 2020 which is of great significance to underground resource exploitation wang et al 2020 geological waste disposal wang and cardenas 2018 and environmental remediation dai et al 2019 yan et al 2018 affected by diagenesis and geological tectonic activities in the process of fracture development fractures in rock masses have strong heterogeneity anisotropy randomness and multiscale characteristics azizmohammadi and matthäi 2017 guo et al 2019 rutqvist et al 2002 zhang et al 2018a accurate characterization of fractures at all scales would increase the computational burden during simulation which is unrealistic in addition the conceptual models of a fracture and rock matrix are different and their solving methods are also different thus it is difficult to simulate mass interaction between fractures and rock matrix therefore it is difficult to balance computational accuracy and efficiency with the existing simulation methods of water flow and solute transport in complex multiscale fracture matrix systems the difference in permeability between fractures and the rock matrix is clear and generally several orders of magnitude and the differences in the permeability among fractures of different scales are also significant fractures can be divided into three different scales according to their hydraulic function large scale fractures medium scale fractures and small scale fractures large scale fractures control global flow and act as channels in aquiferous media yao et al 2019 in contrast medium scale fractures have lower permeability but they still have a certain water storage capacity and locally connect affecting the distribution of hydraulic head in local areas the permeability of small scale fractures is the lowest among these scales contributing only slightly to water storage however a large number of small scale fractures can enhance the permeability of the rock mass compared with fractures the rock matrix in fgm has a considerably lower permeability if only the flow in fractures is considered the discrete fracture network dfn model can accurately characterize the geometry of fractures and their spatial connectivity and thus the flow behavior in the fractures berrone et al 2020 however a dfn model can simulate seepage in fractures but not in the rock matrix the mass exchange between fractures and the rock matrix is a significant process for the remediation of contamination and petroleum and gas extraction which requires flow simulation in a fracture matrix system consequently the finite element method fem has been conducted by many researchers to solve the governing equation describing flow in fracture matrix coupling models baca et al 1984 hoteit and firoozabadi 2008 karimi fard and firoozabadi 2003 kolditz 1995 additionally some numerical simulation methods such as the control volume method bogdanov et al 2003 karimi fard and durlofsky 2016 monteagudo and firoozabadi 2004 reichenberger et al 2006 and finite volume method chen et al 2015 huang et al 2015 odsæter et al 2019 yan et al 2016 can simulate flow in fractured porous media while involving complex mathematical solutions ma et al 2019a meanwhile the above simulation methods are often used to simulate flow in fractured porous media containing fracture with a single scale to simplify the simulation process of fluid flow in a fgm equivalent porous medium epm and equivalent piped network epn models are used the traditional epm method is often used for large scale groundwater simulation by generalizing a large range of heterogeneous fractured porous media into a kind of porous medium with a single permeability ignoring the structural and flow distribution details of the fractures the epn is a simplified model and treats fractures as pipes a pipe connects centers of a fracture and a cross section form by the intersection of two fractures cacas et al 1990 wang et al 2002 xu et al 2019 this approach simplifies the geometry of the model and reduces the computational cost of simulation however the flow pattern in the epn model is unrealistic in recent years some researchers have proposed a fractured continuum method that unifies the characterization of fractures and porous media ahmed et al 2019 botros et al 2008 jackson et al 2000 mejia et al 2021 reeves et al 2008 tsang et al 1996 this method generalizes fractures by mapping them onto finite difference meshes or finite element meshes and the properties of fractures are locally homogenized as porous grids dang et al 2019 fourno et al 2013 haagenson and rajaram 2021 hadgu et al 2017 reeves et al 2014 in this way the discontinuous problem can be converted to a continuous problem in which some geometric characteristics of the fracture network are preserved therefore this method is highly dependent on the resolution of the mesh and has a limited ability to address multiscale fracture problems analogously a unified pipe network method upm was proposed to simulate fluid flow in fracture networks and porous media ren et al 2016 2017b the upm considers porous media and fractures as virtually connected pipes in the spatial domain and the hydraulic properties of pipes are calculated from the geometrical and hydraulic properties of the fractures and rock matrix these two methods based on a single physical model with a unified concept still have limitations in the characterization of a multiscale fracture matrix system some researchers have coupled an epm model and a dfn to simulate fluid flow in a multiscale fracture matrix system guo et al 2019 joyce et al 2014 lee et al 2018 li and voskov 2021 li et al 2017 wang and cai 2019 zhang et al 2018b the conceptual model of the fractures is embedded into the conceptual model of the rock matrix and the interaction between the matrix and fractures is described by mathematical models this method needs to both implement sophisticated mathematical models to improve the simulation accuracy and establish the transport equation between the fracture model and the matrix model increasing the computational burden joyce et al 2014 provided a special simulation method first the epm method is used to simulate the head distribution in the whole region and then the simulation results are set as the boundary conditions of the dfn model simulation at the local site however it is easy to doubt that the errors generated by the simulation of the whole region may be transmitted to the simulation of the local site the objective of this study is to propose a novel and accurate method for simulating fluid flow and solute transport in fracture matrix systems containing multiscale fractures to achieve this objective a fgm is divided into the large scale fractures medium scale fractures small scale fractures and rock matrix according to their different impacts on fluid flow the small scale fractures and rock matrix are integrated into a synthetic enhanced matrix sem which is used to replace the rock matrix in the porous medium model the medium scale fractures and large scale fractures are mapped to the spatial grids to preserve their geometry as much as possible and the grids near the fractures are refined to enhance the characterization accuracy of the fracture geometry the discrete fracture model is transformed into a continuous medium model and the hydraulic property of multiscale fractures is embedded into the continuous medium model the mfepm method can simulate groundwater with the characterization of preferential flow by considering large main fractures and has a powerful ability to represent flow and mass exchange between the fractures and matrix by considering the sem numerical cases are presented to verify the feasibility and robustness of the mfepm 2 multiscale fracture integrated equivalent porous media method as shown in fig 1 in a multiscale fracture matrix system the aquiferous medium is divided into a rock matrix and multiscale fractures including small scale medium scale and large scale fractures according to their hydraulic function in the flow process it should be noted that the division of fracture mentioned here is an ideal and theoretical procedure among the four components the small scale fractures and rock matrix have low conductivity but they have a certain capacity for water storage and small scale fractures can enhance the permeability of the rock matrix therefore the permeability characteristics of small scale fractures and the rock matrix are integrated into the sem to accurately characterize the flow behavior in fractures large scale fractures and medium scale fractures are mapped to the locally refined spatial grids of the epm model retaining their geometric characteristics as much as possible then the equivalent permeability of the grids is calculated according to the geometric properties of these fractures finally the mfepm model can be constructed and then used to simulate fluid flow and solute transport in a multiscale fracture matrix system fig 1 2 1 multiscale fracture matrix coupling model 2 1 1 generation of the physical model 2 1 1 1 large and medium scale fracture model a dfn model is used to characterize the large and medium scale fractures each fracture is conceptualized as a disc and its geometry and orientation are characterized by the central point position radius fracture dip direction and fracture dip angle generally there are few large main fractures but hundreds to thousands of medium scale fractures in a study area the geometric parameters of large fractures are expected to be obtained with high precision by field investigations with technological advances in the near future such as investigations that adopt ultrahigh density resistivity methods qi et al 2020 tracer experiments kittilä et al 2019 li et al 2019 three dimensional laser scanners guerin et al 2021 the geometric parameters of medium scale fractures can be randomly generated by the monte carlo method according to their probability distribution and thus are statistical results based on fracture field investigation the medium scale and large scale fractures have a significant influence on the flow in the fgm and have high permeability to control the distribution of the head therefore unlike small scale fractures the spatial geometry of medium and large scale fractures needs to be preserved in the epm in this study these fractures are mapped to the regular hexahedron grid which preserves the spatial geometric characteristics of the fractures as much as possible and generalizes their hydraulic properties furthermore octree refined mesh is generated around the fracture distribution zone to characterize the strong heterogeneity of the epm ma et al 2019b sweeney et al 2019 the method of fracture mapping to nonuniformly refined grids fig 2 can be summarized as follows 1 first the three dimensional space is divided into regular hexahedral grids of equal size which are used to identify whether intersect the fracture surface when modeling the fracture surface a large number of scatter points are generated on it the density of these scattered points is much higher than that of the spatial mesh when the regular hexahedron grid contains scattered points of fracture it is judged that the fractures intersect the grid when multiple fractures intersect with the same grid the number of such fractures is stored in the grid 2 then the grids that intersect the fracture are refined all grids that intersect fractures are marked and the marked grids are further refined a grid is divided into eight grids of equal size and these eight grids will be determined whether intersect with the multiple fractures previously stored 3 in addition to the grids that intersect fractures the grids adjacent to grids intersecting fractures need to be further refined this ensures that when two grids are adjacent the size of the larger grid is at most twice the size of the smaller grid thus reducing the numerical errors fig 2 a shows the schematic diagram of fractures mapped to the two dimensional grid and fig 2 b shows fractures mapped to the regular hexahedral grids 2 1 1 2 small scale fracture model there is an extremely large number of small scale fractures in the fgm it is impossible to accurately characterize all small scale fractures because the computational burden will be too high compared with those of medium and large scale fractures the effect of small scale fractures on the heterogeneity of an fgm is weaker from a macroscale view so the representative elementary volume rev of the hydraulic conductivity is determined by integrating small scale fractures and the rock matrix the equivalent hydraulic conductivity of a rev is easier to calculate and representative small scale fractures with weak connectivity can be treated as an enhanced matrix with higher permeability guo et al 2019 this study integrates small scale fractures into the rock matrix to compose a sem therefore the equivalent sem has a higher permeability than the original rock matrix and the determination of the equivalent permeability of the sem is introduced in section 2 1 2 2 1 2 calculation of the equivalent permeability of mfepm the calculation of the equivalent permeability of mfepm is consist of two procedures firstly the equivalent permeability of sem is obtained by integrating the small scale fractures and rock matrix and the equivalent permeability of sem will replace the rock matrix secondly the large and medium scale fractures are transformed into porous media the equivalent hydraulic parameters are assigned to the grid blocks intersect fractures the new parameters replace the original parameters again the calculation of the equivalent parameters of mfepm is accomplished after the two procedures 2 1 2 1 equivalent permeability of the sem the sem is obtained by integrating the small scale fractures and rock matrix and its equivalent hydraulic conductivity is calculated by the finite element method fem when calculating the hydraulic conductivity of the sem in a certain direction a specified head is applied at both ends of the elementary volume to obtain the flow rate through the rock mass and then calculate the equivalent hydraulic conductivity of the elementary volume in this direction according to darcy s law in this study the sem is treated as a homogeneous anisotropic medium the equivalent hydraulic conductivity of an incrementally increasing elementary volume is iteratively calculated until a relatively stable value is obtained that is the equivalent hydraulic conductivity of the rev for the sem obviously the iterative calculation requires considerable computation as the simulation domain size increases the computation costs of seepage simulation in both fractures and matrix will increase significantly and this makes it hard to estimate the rev of a 3d fracture rock mass therefore researchers commonly simplify the analyses to 2d problem leung and zimmerman 2012 liu et al 2016 min et al 2004 yang et al 2014 however the quantitative prediction of 3d equivalent hydraulic conductivity still has no universally accepted method and needs further study some researchers have verified that the hydraulic conductivity of 2d fracture networks is different from that of 3d fracture networks huang et al 2017 lang et al 2014 huang et al 2017 emphasized the fluid flow in fracture networks and indicated that the connectivity of fracture networks is strong and continuous flow path occurs in both 3d fracture networks and 2d cut planes because of 3d fracture networks have better connectivity than 2d fracture networks equivalent hydraulic conductivity of 3d fracture networks may be larger than that of 2d fracture networks lang et al 2014 shows the comparison of the permeability of two dimensional cut planes and that of three dimensional fractured rock mass a similar conclusion is proposed in his paper two dimensional analysis cannot be directly used as an approximation of three dimensional equivalent permeability although an alternative expression of the trace map fracture density to an equivalent three dimensional fracture density is proposed the approximation of three dimensional equivalent permeability is not complete in this paper small scale fractures have little effect on fluid flow in fractured rock mass we assume the small scale fractures have a weak connectivity and it will make a less difference between 2d and 3d fractured rock mass consequently to balance the computational burden and accuracy we finally use the equivalent hydraulic conductivity of the two dimensional sem to represent that of the three dimensional sem in a specified direction in three dimensional space after coordinate system rotation according to the principal permeability direction only the main diagonal values of the permeability tensor are used for groundwater simulation therefore we need to calculate only the hydraulic conductivity kxx kyy and kzz along the x y and z axes as shown in fig 3 a the range of the computational domain of the fractured rock mass increases from 4 m 4 m 4 m in different simulation ranges the equivalent hydraulic conductivity in each principal direction is calculated when calculating the equivalent hydraulic conductivity in a direction many two dimensional sections are set to intercept the computational domain as shown in fig 3 b as shown in fig 3 c and fig 3 d two dimensional seepage simulations are conducted to obtain the equivalent hydraulic conductivity of each two dimensional fracture computational domain the average hydraulic conductivity is taken as the equivalent hydraulic conductivity of the three dimensional fractured rock mass in this specified direction wu et al 2014 each time the simulation range is increased the equivalent hydraulic conductivity can be calculated when the variation of equivalent hydraulic conductivity tends to be stable for example the relative error of two adjacent calculations is less than 5 the rev size can be statistically determined wang and cai 2019 in this study we statistically determine the rev size when the above condition is established three times consecutively for each of the three principal directions the flow exchange method is used to solve the two dimensional flow problem of the fractured matrix in the fem calculation the permeability matrices of the fracture and porous medium are established then based on the principles that the head at the shared nodes of the fractured and porous media are equal and mass conservation the permeability matrix of the whole seepage area is formed luo et al 2018 zhang et al 2012 first the matrix of conductivity coefficients between all nodes of the fracture network is established according to the local cubic flow law fang and zhu 2018 hyman et al 2016 ren et al 2017a the flow rate can be computed by the following expression 1 q ij ρ g b 3 12 μ h j h i l ij where qij is the volumetric flow rate per unit width of fracture perpendicular to the flow direction from i to j b is the aperture of the fracture ρ is fluid density g is the acceleration of gravity μ is the dynamic viscosity coefficient of the fluids lij is the distance between nodes i and j and hi and hj are the heads at nodes i and j in a fracture segment according to eq 1 the steady state flow equation without source and sink of the fracture network can be written in matrix form 2 ata t h 0 where a is the adjacency matrix reflecting the adjacency relationship between nodes t is the conductivity coefficient matrix h is the vector of water heads at nodes the calculation formula of the elements in the fracture conductivity coefficient matrix is as follows 3 t ij ρ g b 3 12 μ l ij then the flow equation between nodes in the porous medium is established to obtain the corresponding conductivity coefficient matrix the two dimensional steady flow model which also does not consider source and sink in the porous medium can be expressed as 4 x t x h x y t y h y 0 where the tx ty are the conductivity coefficients along x axis and y axis respectively the fem implemented with the galerkin method the appropriative equation under the condition that no flux on flux boundaries is as follows carey 1982 lynch 1984 5 e 1 n p e t n i x n j x n i y n j y d x d y h j 0 where e is the element integral region np is the number of elements ni and nj are shape functions and hj is the head of node j because the rock matrix is assumed isotropic in this paper the t is used to represent the conductivity coefficient of rock matrix and the thickness of aquifer is set as 1 m eq 5 can be written in matrix form 6 t e h 0 where te is the conductivity coefficient matrix of the porous medium the calculation formula of elements in the conductivity coefficient matrix can be written as follows 7 t ij e 1 n p e t n i x n j x n i y n j y d x d y from the above steps the conductivity coefficient matrices of the porous medium and fractures can be solved then these two matrices are superimposed if two nodes in the simulation area have conductivity coefficients for both a fracture and the porous medium the two values are added together to obtain the coupled conductivity coefficient matrix finally the head of each node can be calculated with eq 6 2 1 2 2 equivalent permeability and porosity of the fractures to transform fractures into an epm the hydraulic properties of the fractures are generalized and assigned to grids in the epm model the algorithm implemented in this study is proposed by chen et al 1999 the permeability and porosity of a grid are determined by the total volume of fractures in the grid and the anisotropy of the hydraulic conductivity is determined by the geometric characteristics of the fractures firstly the equivalent porosity of each grid block intersects fractures is calculated the total volume occupied by the fractures is equal to the sum of the volumes of the fractures that intersect the grid block the calculation equation is as follows 8 v f f 1 n v f f 1 n a f b f where n is the number of fractures that intersect the grid block af is the area where each fracture intersects the grid block and bf is the aperture of the fracture according to the total volume occupied by fractures the equivalent porosity of a grid block is calculated by the equation as follows 9 ϕ e v c ϕ m v f ϕ m v f v c where vc is the volume of the grid block vf is the total volume of n intersecting fractures in the grid block ϕe is the equivalent porosity of the grid block and ϕm is the porosity of the porous medium secondly the permeability tensor of the grid block is calculated by the following formula chen et al 1999 10 k f 1 12 f 1 n ϕ e f b f 2 ω ij f where ϕe f is the equivalent porosity of fracture f in grid block ω is the coordinate transformation tensor of fracture f and the calculation formula is as follows 11 ω ij f n 2 2 n 3 2 n 1 n 2 n 1 n 3 n 1 n 2 n 1 2 n 3 2 n 2 n 3 n 1 n 3 n 2 n 3 n 1 2 n 2 2 12 n 1 sin α π 180 sin ω π 180 13 n 2 sin α π 180 cos ω π 180 14 n 3 cos α π 180 where n 1 n 2 and n 3 are the unit normal vectors of the fracture plane α is the fracture dip angle and ω is the fracture dip direction the principal direction of the permeability tensor is assigned to the epm grid through the above calculation process an equivalent continuum model with hydraulic properties of fracture can be obtained when fractures are equivalently transformed into porous media the hydraulic properties of the fractures completely replace those of the sem in their original position chen et al 1999 2 2 mathematical model of flow and solute transport based on the mfepm method 2 2 1 water flow model the theoretical system of water flow and solute transport simulation based on the finite difference method is well developed and there are many commercial software programs for numerical simulation however to integrate multiscale fracture matrix coupling modeling equivalent permeability calculation and flow and transport simulation the implicit finite difference method based on the mfepm is adopted in matlab steady flow is used to simulate the epm model with ideal boundary conditions since the epm model is composed of nonuniformly refined grids it is impossible to discretize the three dimensional partial differential equation therefore this study establishes the water balance equation for each grid in the model 15 j 1 n q ij 0 where n is the total number of adjacent grids around grid i and qij is the flow rate from grid j to grid i the inflow of each grid block is equal to the outflow the head within each grid block is assumed to be uniform the flow between grid blocks is calculated according to darcy s law and qij is calculated as follows 16 q ij k ij a ij h j h i a i a j 2 where ai and aj are the side lengths of block i and block j respectively aij is the area of the flow cross section between two blocks which is the square of the side length of the smaller block fig 4 fig 4 shows the adjacency pattern between blocks with different sizes due to the difference in block size and hydraulic conductivity between blocks kij is taken as the harmonic mean value of the hydraulic conductivity of blocks i and j in this study the calculation formula is as follows 17 k ij a i a j a i k i a j k j the hydraulic conductivity ki is calculated from the permeability 18 k i k i ρ g μ after the mass conservation equation of each block is established the gauss seidel method is used to iteratively solve the head value of each block in the model 2 2 2 transport model based on flow simulation the solute transport simulation of continuous solute injection is carried out in this study the advection dispersion equation ade based on nonuniform grid is derived and the solute mass conservation equation is established for each grid block according to the partial differential form of the ade eq 19 kumar et al 2010 leij and dane 1990 tang et al 1981 woodbury et al 1990 we discretize it and list the mass conversation equation eq 20 19 n i x x i y y i z z v x c x v y c y v z c z δ x δ y δ z δ t n c t δ x δ y δ z δ t 20 j 1 n ϕ i i ij a ij δ t j 1 n v ij c ij a ij δ t v i ϕ i c i t 2 c i t 1 in the dispersion term ϕi is the porosity of grid block i iij is the hydrodynamic dispersion flux of block j to block i and δt is the time step the calculation method of hydrodynamic dispersion flux is as follows 21 i ij d ij c j c i a i a j 2 where ci and cj are the solute concentrations of blocks i and j respectively and dij is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient 22 d ij α l u ij d the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient reflects the mechanical diffusion and molecular diffusion αl is the longitudinal dispersivity and d is the molecular diffusion coefficient the actual flow velocity is calculated as follows 23 u ij q ij a ij ϕ ij where ϕi is the weight average porosity of grid block i and grid block j for the discretization of the advection term the value of cij depends on the direction of flow between grid blocks 24 c ij c i u ij 0 c j u ij 0 cij is the solute concentration value of the grid block as the source after the mass conservation equation of each grid block is established the solute concentration of each grid block in the model can be solved iteratively by the gauss seidel method 3 case study in this section a numerical case is set to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of mfepm for a multiscale fracture matrix system a synthetic fracture network is generated using a self developed fracture generator and the flow and solute transport in the fracture field are simulated for the epm mfepm and dfn the simulation results of the three methods are compared and studied 3 1 case 1 verifications of numerical solution the numerical solution approach of mfepm is verified in this case study in a range of 20 m 20 m 20 m there are three intersected fractures imbedded which are shown in fig 5 a the geometric parameters of fractures are shown in table 1 all the fracture apertures are 0 3 mm the permeability of the rock matrix is 1 10 14 m2 specified head boundaries are applied at surfaces of x 0 m and x 20 m with 20 2 m and 20 m the steady state flow and transient solute transport are performed by comsol and the numerical approach of mfepm respectively as shown in fig 5 b the flow simulation results of two approaches agree well according to the btc in fig 5 c in the early stage of the curves the solute transport of comsol is faster than that of epm but two curves have good consistency on the whole tendency this case demonstrates that the approach for solving fluid flow and solute transport problems is efficient in addition the sensitivity analysis of grid is conducted based on this case four epm models with different degrees of octree refined mesh are simulated and the hydraulic head distribution of the four epm models is compared with that of comsol the initial size of grid block is 4 m the octree refined block is conducted three times and the grid block size of 2 m 1 m and 0 5 m are obtained respectively as shown in fig 6 the head distribution of plane z 10 m of the four epm models is compared with that of comsol the difference between the results of comsol and epm is quantitively estimated by the root mean square error rmse of the hydraulic head distribution except the grid size of 4 m the rmse value decreases with decreasing grid size for 2 m 1 m and 0 5 m therefore the numerical solutions are affected by the refinement of grid it is suggested that the grid size should be determined by comprehensively considering the large and medium scale fracture size the range of the study area and the balance between the calculation accuracy and the computational burden 3 2 case 2 flow and solute simulation with the mfepm method a dfn model fig 7 a of a multiscale fracture network was established in a domain of 80 m 60 m 20 m using the parameters in table 2 the geometry and orientation characteristics of the fractures include the center position fracture dip direction fracture dip angle and radius the distribution of the center point of the fracture follows a uniform distribution the dip direction of the fracture follows a normal distribution and the radius follows a logarithmic normal distribution the parameters used to generate the dfn are shown in table 2 the porosity of the rock matrix in the case is set as 0 01 and the isotropic permeability is 9 17 10 16 m2 first the small scale fractures and rock matrix are equivalent to the sem as shown in fig 8 the hydraulic conductivities in the three principal directions vary with the simulation range each simulation range will realize 10 100 simulations according to the computation the black point kxx kyy kzz in the figure represents the hydraulic conductivity of each simulation realization and the red point kmxx kmyy and kmzz represents the mean value of the hydraulic conductivity of all simulation realizations of a simulation range the trend of the variation in the mean value of hydraulic conductivity with the simulation range shows that the fluctuation in kmzz is not obvious and that the judging condition is achieved when the simulation range is 10 m compared with that in kmzz the variations in kmxx and kmyy are stable when the simulation range exceeds 10 m and the judging condition is achieved when the simulation range is 16 m therefore the rev size of the sem is 16 m and the equivalent hydraulic conductivities in the three principal directions are 1 38 10 8 m s 1 37 10 8 m s and 1 24 10 8 m s meanwhile by the equivalent calculation the effect of small fractures to the order of magnitude of porosity is not significant the porosity of sem remains the same the dfn model is mapped on an epm model using the spatial grid identification method shown in section 2 1 1 the initial grid block size is 10 m and two refinements are carried out at the grid blocks with fractures the distributions of the epm porosity and permeabilities kxx kyy and kzz are shown in fig 7 b and c according to the calculation method in section 2 1 2 fig 7 shows that the porosity and permeability of grid blocks occupied by fractures are higher than those not occupied by fractures and the grid blocks occupied by the main fractures clearly have a higher porosity and permeability fig 7 c shows that the permeabilities in the x axis and y axis directions of the grid blocks occupied by medium scale fractures are greater than those in the z axis direction the anisotropy of permeability is controlled by the occurrence of fractures the flow along the x axis direction with a head difference of 0 5 m is applied to the simulated area the flow and solute transport simulation results are shown in figs 9 and 10 respectively fig 9 a b and c are the head distributions obtained by the traditional epm mfepm and dfn respectively in which fig 9 c is calculated with comsol software the hydraulic conductivity of the epm in the traditional epm method is inversely calculated according to the dfn simulation results and the equivalent hydraulic conductivity along the x axis direction is 0 0133 m s because the equivalent hydraulic conductivity in the epm is homogeneous the head of the epm has a linear gradient distribution along the x axis direction compared with the traditional epm the mfepm can depict the complexity of flow in the multiscale fracture matrix system affected by the main fractures the equivalent hydraulic conductivity of the epm is much greater than that of the rock matrix and the flow velocity along the x axis direction in the epm is faster although the solute transport in the epm is faster than that in the main fractures of the dfn the solute transport in the total domain is faster than that in mfepm and dfn the simulation results of the dfn show that the head distribution and solute concentration distribution are influenced by the connectivity of fractures figs 9 c and 10 the distribution trends of the head and solute concentration of the mfepm and dfn are similar and the mfepm can characterize the flow interaction between the fractures and matrix in extenso the solute transport simulation of dfn shows the preferential flow in the main fracture at the first time t 1000 s the main fracture is filled with solute in contrast the solute transport in medium scale fractures is slower there is a significant difference in flow velocity between the main channel and the locally connected network the flow exchange between the fractures and matrix leads to the flow velocity in the main fractures of the mfepm being slower than that of the dfn among the distributions of solute concentration simulated by the three methods the solute transport process of the mfepm is the most hysteretic whether in the main fractures or in other areas 3 3 case 3 the effect of sem on solute transport to further demonstrate the significance of the sem for the simulation of flow and solute transport a set of comparative simulation experiments is carried out in this section a new multiscale fracture network is established for simulation by the mfepm the dfn model of large scale and medium scale fractures in a multiscale fracture network is generated by the data in table 3 the fractures are shown in fig 11 and the number and occurrence of small scale fractures are the same as those in case 1 the model that does not consider the sem is called model i and the model that considers the sem is called model ii the flow and solute transport simulation results of the two models are shown in figs 12 and 13 the diagram of the head distributions shows that there is no significant difference between model i and model ii this means that the small scale fractures increase the permeability of the rock matrix but the response of the head distribution is not obvious therefore we compared the head values at the same position to obtain a quantitative comparison of the two models the distribution of scatter points and r 2 show that model i and model ii have good consistency in terms of the head results this means that the sem has no significant influence on the steady flow the simulation results of the solute concentration distributions at four different traveling times were compared fig 13 a and b shows that the transport of solute mainly occurs in fractures and the variation in solute concentration in fractures becomes more obvious with time there is no significant difference in the overall tendency of the concentration distribution between model i and model ii by comparing the solute concentrations at different positions it can be found that the solute concentrations at local locations are affected and the root mean square error rmse of the solute concentrations of the two models increases gradually with increasing traveling time fig 13 c the variation in the hydraulic conductivity of the matrix leads to the variation in the flow exchange between the fracture and matrix the flow velocity in a porous medium with a higher hydraulic conductivity is faster which leads to a faster variation in solute concentration hence the difference between the two models becomes more obvious with the passage of transport time 4 discussion 4 1 comparison between the mfepm and the epm methods the traditional epm regards the fgm as a homogenous porous medium generally characterized by the rev that is the rev has the same macroscopic hydraulic properties the rev theoretically represents the equivalent comprehensive hydraulic properties of fractures and the rock matrix nevertheless the traditional epm does not accurately characterize multiscale fractures which is critical for the preferential flow problem in the numerical case the epm has a large degree of generalization to the fgm compared with the traditional epm the mfepm proposed in this study can more accurately characterize the flow and solute transport in the fracture matrix system as shown in fig 14 the flow velocities in the principal fractures are the fastest which are higher than 2 5 10 6 m s fig 14 c the flow velocities in the fracture network mainly composed of medium scale fractures are between 1 10 6 m s and 2 5 10 6 m s fig 14 b the flow velocities in the sem are drastically slower than those in the fracture channels and are lower than 1 10 6 m s fig 14 a this shows that the mfepm can efficiently characterize the preferential flow with the improved epm in the fgm additionally due to being greatly affected by the principal fractures the equivalent hydraulic conductivity of equivalent porous medium of the traditional epm is larger therefore the simulation results of the solute concentration distribution show that the solute transport in the epm is faster than that in the mfepm the mfepm maps the large scale and medium scale fractures to refined spatial grids the geometric information and hydraulic properties of fractures can be characterized in the epm model and the hydraulic properties of the small scale fractures are also integrated into the rock matrix as in the sem therefore the mfepm is theoretically more useful for characterizing flow in an fgm according to the simulation results of the mfepm in figs 9 and 10 case 1 the influence of fractures of different scales on flow and solute transport can be observed clearly and the integration of fracture information effectively improves the simulation accuracy compared to that of the traditional epm the epm and mfepm simulation results of the head and solute concentrations at the same location are quantitatively compared as shown in fig 15 fig 15 a shows that there are certain errors in the distributions of the head simulated by the two methods and that the distribution trend of the head simulated by the traditional epm is similar to that simulated by the mfepm fig 15 b also shows that the difference in solute concentration distribution is obvious and that the solute concentration of the rmse increases with the passage of transport time this is because solute transport is greatly affected by preferential flow which can be better characterized by the mfepm 4 2 comparison between the mfepm and the dfn methods to compare the head distributions of the dfn method and the mfepm the relative errors of the head on the dfn between the two models in case 1 are calculated and the relative error of the head is mapped to the scatter points as shown in fig 16 the most significant difference exists fig 16 b in the isolated fractures circle a in fig 16 a and the dead end fractures circles b and c in fig 16 a in case 1 there are some isolated fractures in the fracture field and the flow simulation results of the dfn show that there is no flow in the isolated fractures fig 9 c in the actual situation of fractured rock masses the isolated fractures could still have a weak hydraulic connection with other fractures through the porous medium under higher hydraulic pressures and they also provide important storage space for groundwater in the simulation results of the mfepm the water storage capacity of isolated fractures is represented in the epm model fig 9 b according to the simulation results of solute transport with the dfn and mfepm the velocity of solute transport in the main fractures simulated by the dfn is faster than that simulated by the mfepm and all solute migrates in fractures for the dfn method while the flow and solute transport simulated by the mfepm method exist throughout the aquiferous media and the method simultaneously represents high velocity and solute migration in fractures and exchange between fractures and matrix fig 10 in the treatment of small scale fractures the mfepm integrates small scale fractures and the rock matrix into the sem to retain the hydraulic properties of the aquiferous medium so the mfepm better characterizes the permeability of the fractured rock matrix compared with the traditional dfn method the simulation results of flow and solute transport suggests that the dfn method can characterize the complexity of fracture networks but it cannot simulate the flow and mass exchanges between rock matrix and fractures and the exchanges between isolated fractures with connected fractures in fractured porous media and it also has to ignore the numerous small scale fractures because of the unmanageable computational burden the mfepm method can effectively simulate flow behavior in the complex multiscale fracture matrix system simultaneously taking into account the flow and mass exchange between the fractures and matrix additionally in the process of dfn simulation the complex fracture networks will lead to the generation of low quality triangulated irregular networks tins which further cause difficulty in convergence and thus inaccurate simulation results if the tin quality is improved by refining the triangular meshes this will greatly increase the computational burden the treatment of the finite difference method based on the mfepm is more flexible because the spatial grid has the integrated equivalent hydraulic property of the fractures and sem 4 3 effect of small scale fractures on flow and solute transport in case 2 the equivalent simulation method of small scale fractures is demonstrated the generalization of the permeability of small scale fractures can effectively reduce the computational burden caused by the large number of fractures in the dfn method thus the mfepm proposed in this study has more significant computational advantages in numerical case 2 the small scale fractures with weak connectivity have little effect on the permeability of the region and thus do not make the hydraulic conductivity of the rock matrix change significantly on the order of a magnitude but it still affects the anisotropy of the permeability characteristics of the fractured porous medium the comparison of the simulation results suggests that the sem affects local water flow and solute concentration weakly and the overall tendency of the head and solute concentration do not change significantly figs 12 and 13 from fig 13 c it can be found that the rmse increases with the passage of transport time which shows that the influence of the sem on the solute concentration distribution in the fgm gradually becomes significant this study only considers the situation in which the small scale fractures are uniformly spatially distributed for the complex development of fractures in the actual field the study area can be divided into subregions according to the distribution characteristics of the fractures for equivalent treatment to further improve the characterization capacity for complex fgm with the mfepm method additionally large medium and small scales fractures are relatively divided relative to the range of the study area according to the hydraulic function of different scales fracture on fluid flow such as fracture length and width in general application the number of large scale fractures is very small but it is very important for water flow they could be determined by high precision survey while the medium scale fractures has a relatively larger quantity which can be generated by staochastical method based on statistical data of field survey on medium fractures to simplify processing in some applications large and medium scales can be combined as large scale and the mfepm method can also simulate flow and solute transport with only large and small scales fractures 5 conclusion in this study a mfepm method is proposed for simulating fluid flow and solute transport in a fracture matrix system the mfepm method uniformly characterizes the multiscale fractures large scale medium scale small scale fractures and rock matrix with an epm model based on nonuniformly refined grids the small scale fractures and rock matrix are integrated into the sem to characterize their hydraulic properties in the fgm the medium scale and large scale fractures are mapped to locally refined grids to obtain the epm local grid refinement enhances the modeling accuracy by improving the characterization of the geometric morphology of the fracture network based on mass conservation the mathematical model of water flow and solute transport based on the finite difference method of nonuniformly refined grids is derived the mfepm method conceptually simplifies the simulation of flow in the fracture network and rock matrix and no extra exchange term is required between the rock matrix and fractures and the method not only consider the hydraulic properties of the multiscale fractures and rock matrix but also ensure the simulation efficiency and accuracy of the model the mfepm method carries out the generalization of multiscale fractures according to their hydraulic behavior to improve the simulation accuracy and computational efficiency the numerical cases show that the mfepm method has relative higher computational accuracy and good reliability in simulating water flow and solute transport with an appropriate computational burden compared with the traditional epm the mfepm assigns large scale and medium scale fracture attributions to spatially refined grids thus it can more accurately characterize preferential flow in fracture matrix systems compared with the dfn method the mfepm can characterize flow and solute transport in the sem and represent flow and mass exchange between fractures and matrix and the exchange between isolated fractures and connected fractures in fractured porous media and it also shows good computational efficiency without directly considering the large amount of small scale fracture information balancing computational accuracy and efficiency the mfepm method provides an effective alternative approach for conceptualizing fgms and simulating flow and solute transport in fracture matrix systems however there are some limitations of the method need to be improved in the future firstly a special case that originally unconnected fractures become connected because of intersecting the same grid block may appear in the process of modeling upscaling fractures to porous media method may increase the connectivity of fracture network however this case can not be avoided by refining grid because of the computational burden will increase significantly with the number of grids increasing in addition despite the equivalent hydraulic conductivity of three dimensional fractured rock mass is approximated by two dimensional cut plane the method of obtaining the hydraulic properties of enhanced matrix is not rigorous enough the efficient method of simulating seepage coupling fracture and matrix need to be further studied credit authorship contribution statement lei ma conceptualization funding

2461,the fracture matrix system in which water is stored and transported has a significant impact on the hydraulic behaviors of fractured geologic media fgm however it is very challenging to accurately simulate flow behavior in fgm due to the difficulty of characterizing dual permeability media including multiscale fractures with high permeability and porous matrix with low permeability in this study a multiscale fracture integrated equivalent porous medium mfepm method is proposed for simulating fluid flow and solute transport in a fracture matrix system the synthetic enhanced matrix sem is compounded by integrating small scale fractures into the porous medium and the medium and large scale fractures are mapped to refined grids of the mfepm to increase the characterization of the fracture geometry and orientation then the equivalent hydraulic properties are calculated according to the properties of the fractures finally a finite difference method fdm based on the mfepm is used to simulate flow and solute transport in coupled multiscale fractures and rock matrix the case study illustrates that compared with the traditional equivalent porous medium epm method the mfepm manifests an efficient effect in the characterization of preferential flow compared with the discrete fracture network dfn method the mfepm can characterize flow and solute transport in the sem and represent mass interactions between the fractures and matrix the results of the numerical case studies of flow and solute transport also show that the mfepm method has a high computational accuracy and good reliability while maintaining an appropriate computational burden keywords equivalent porous media fractured geologic media finite difference method multiscale fracture matrix system data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as common geological structures in fractured geologic media fgm fractures have a significant impact on the mechanical and hydraulic behaviors of fgm li and li 2019 pan et al 2010 ren et al 2015 zheng et al 2020 which is of great significance to underground resource exploitation wang et al 2020 geological waste disposal wang and cardenas 2018 and environmental remediation dai et al 2019 yan et al 2018 affected by diagenesis and geological tectonic activities in the process of fracture development fractures in rock masses have strong heterogeneity anisotropy randomness and multiscale characteristics azizmohammadi and matthäi 2017 guo et al 2019 rutqvist et al 2002 zhang et al 2018a accurate characterization of fractures at all scales would increase the computational burden during simulation which is unrealistic in addition the conceptual models of a fracture and rock matrix are different and their solving methods are also different thus it is difficult to simulate mass interaction between fractures and rock matrix therefore it is difficult to balance computational accuracy and efficiency with the existing simulation methods of water flow and solute transport in complex multiscale fracture matrix systems the difference in permeability between fractures and the rock matrix is clear and generally several orders of magnitude and the differences in the permeability among fractures of different scales are also significant fractures can be divided into three different scales according to their hydraulic function large scale fractures medium scale fractures and small scale fractures large scale fractures control global flow and act as channels in aquiferous media yao et al 2019 in contrast medium scale fractures have lower permeability but they still have a certain water storage capacity and locally connect affecting the distribution of hydraulic head in local areas the permeability of small scale fractures is the lowest among these scales contributing only slightly to water storage however a large number of small scale fractures can enhance the permeability of the rock mass compared with fractures the rock matrix in fgm has a considerably lower permeability if only the flow in fractures is considered the discrete fracture network dfn model can accurately characterize the geometry of fractures and their spatial connectivity and thus the flow behavior in the fractures berrone et al 2020 however a dfn model can simulate seepage in fractures but not in the rock matrix the mass exchange between fractures and the rock matrix is a significant process for the remediation of contamination and petroleum and gas extraction which requires flow simulation in a fracture matrix system consequently the finite element method fem has been conducted by many researchers to solve the governing equation describing flow in fracture matrix coupling models baca et al 1984 hoteit and firoozabadi 2008 karimi fard and firoozabadi 2003 kolditz 1995 additionally some numerical simulation methods such as the control volume method bogdanov et al 2003 karimi fard and durlofsky 2016 monteagudo and firoozabadi 2004 reichenberger et al 2006 and finite volume method chen et al 2015 huang et al 2015 odsæter et al 2019 yan et al 2016 can simulate flow in fractured porous media while involving complex mathematical solutions ma et al 2019a meanwhile the above simulation methods are often used to simulate flow in fractured porous media containing fracture with a single scale to simplify the simulation process of fluid flow in a fgm equivalent porous medium epm and equivalent piped network epn models are used the traditional epm method is often used for large scale groundwater simulation by generalizing a large range of heterogeneous fractured porous media into a kind of porous medium with a single permeability ignoring the structural and flow distribution details of the fractures the epn is a simplified model and treats fractures as pipes a pipe connects centers of a fracture and a cross section form by the intersection of two fractures cacas et al 1990 wang et al 2002 xu et al 2019 this approach simplifies the geometry of the model and reduces the computational cost of simulation however the flow pattern in the epn model is unrealistic in recent years some researchers have proposed a fractured continuum method that unifies the characterization of fractures and porous media ahmed et al 2019 botros et al 2008 jackson et al 2000 mejia et al 2021 reeves et al 2008 tsang et al 1996 this method generalizes fractures by mapping them onto finite difference meshes or finite element meshes and the properties of fractures are locally homogenized as porous grids dang et al 2019 fourno et al 2013 haagenson and rajaram 2021 hadgu et al 2017 reeves et al 2014 in this way the discontinuous problem can be converted to a continuous problem in which some geometric characteristics of the fracture network are preserved therefore this method is highly dependent on the resolution of the mesh and has a limited ability to address multiscale fracture problems analogously a unified pipe network method upm was proposed to simulate fluid flow in fracture networks and porous media ren et al 2016 2017b the upm considers porous media and fractures as virtually connected pipes in the spatial domain and the hydraulic properties of pipes are calculated from the geometrical and hydraulic properties of the fractures and rock matrix these two methods based on a single physical model with a unified concept still have limitations in the characterization of a multiscale fracture matrix system some researchers have coupled an epm model and a dfn to simulate fluid flow in a multiscale fracture matrix system guo et al 2019 joyce et al 2014 lee et al 2018 li and voskov 2021 li et al 2017 wang and cai 2019 zhang et al 2018b the conceptual model of the fractures is embedded into the conceptual model of the rock matrix and the interaction between the matrix and fractures is described by mathematical models this method needs to both implement sophisticated mathematical models to improve the simulation accuracy and establish the transport equation between the fracture model and the matrix model increasing the computational burden joyce et al 2014 provided a special simulation method first the epm method is used to simulate the head distribution in the whole region and then the simulation results are set as the boundary conditions of the dfn model simulation at the local site however it is easy to doubt that the errors generated by the simulation of the whole region may be transmitted to the simulation of the local site the objective of this study is to propose a novel and accurate method for simulating fluid flow and solute transport in fracture matrix systems containing multiscale fractures to achieve this objective a fgm is divided into the large scale fractures medium scale fractures small scale fractures and rock matrix according to their different impacts on fluid flow the small scale fractures and rock matrix are integrated into a synthetic enhanced matrix sem which is used to replace the rock matrix in the porous medium model the medium scale fractures and large scale fractures are mapped to the spatial grids to preserve their geometry as much as possible and the grids near the fractures are refined to enhance the characterization accuracy of the fracture geometry the discrete fracture model is transformed into a continuous medium model and the hydraulic property of multiscale fractures is embedded into the continuous medium model the mfepm method can simulate groundwater with the characterization of preferential flow by considering large main fractures and has a powerful ability to represent flow and mass exchange between the fractures and matrix by considering the sem numerical cases are presented to verify the feasibility and robustness of the mfepm 2 multiscale fracture integrated equivalent porous media method as shown in fig 1 in a multiscale fracture matrix system the aquiferous medium is divided into a rock matrix and multiscale fractures including small scale medium scale and large scale fractures according to their hydraulic function in the flow process it should be noted that the division of fracture mentioned here is an ideal and theoretical procedure among the four components the small scale fractures and rock matrix have low conductivity but they have a certain capacity for water storage and small scale fractures can enhance the permeability of the rock matrix therefore the permeability characteristics of small scale fractures and the rock matrix are integrated into the sem to accurately characterize the flow behavior in fractures large scale fractures and medium scale fractures are mapped to the locally refined spatial grids of the epm model retaining their geometric characteristics as much as possible then the equivalent permeability of the grids is calculated according to the geometric properties of these fractures finally the mfepm model can be constructed and then used to simulate fluid flow and solute transport in a multiscale fracture matrix system fig 1 2 1 multiscale fracture matrix coupling model 2 1 1 generation of the physical model 2 1 1 1 large and medium scale fracture model a dfn model is used to characterize the large and medium scale fractures each fracture is conceptualized as a disc and its geometry and orientation are characterized by the central point position radius fracture dip direction and fracture dip angle generally there are few large main fractures but hundreds to thousands of medium scale fractures in a study area the geometric parameters of large fractures are expected to be obtained with high precision by field investigations with technological advances in the near future such as investigations that adopt ultrahigh density resistivity methods qi et al 2020 tracer experiments kittilä et al 2019 li et al 2019 three dimensional laser scanners guerin et al 2021 the geometric parameters of medium scale fractures can be randomly generated by the monte carlo method according to their probability distribution and thus are statistical results based on fracture field investigation the medium scale and large scale fractures have a significant influence on the flow in the fgm and have high permeability to control the distribution of the head therefore unlike small scale fractures the spatial geometry of medium and large scale fractures needs to be preserved in the epm in this study these fractures are mapped to the regular hexahedron grid which preserves the spatial geometric characteristics of the fractures as much as possible and generalizes their hydraulic properties furthermore octree refined mesh is generated around the fracture distribution zone to characterize the strong heterogeneity of the epm ma et al 2019b sweeney et al 2019 the method of fracture mapping to nonuniformly refined grids fig 2 can be summarized as follows 1 first the three dimensional space is divided into regular hexahedral grids of equal size which are used to identify whether intersect the fracture surface when modeling the fracture surface a large number of scatter points are generated on it the density of these scattered points is much higher than that of the spatial mesh when the regular hexahedron grid contains scattered points of fracture it is judged that the fractures intersect the grid when multiple fractures intersect with the same grid the number of such fractures is stored in the grid 2 then the grids that intersect the fracture are refined all grids that intersect fractures are marked and the marked grids are further refined a grid is divided into eight grids of equal size and these eight grids will be determined whether intersect with the multiple fractures previously stored 3 in addition to the grids that intersect fractures the grids adjacent to grids intersecting fractures need to be further refined this ensures that when two grids are adjacent the size of the larger grid is at most twice the size of the smaller grid thus reducing the numerical errors fig 2 a shows the schematic diagram of fractures mapped to the two dimensional grid and fig 2 b shows fractures mapped to the regular hexahedral grids 2 1 1 2 small scale fracture model there is an extremely large number of small scale fractures in the fgm it is impossible to accurately characterize all small scale fractures because the computational burden will be too high compared with those of medium and large scale fractures the effect of small scale fractures on the heterogeneity of an fgm is weaker from a macroscale view so the representative elementary volume rev of the hydraulic conductivity is determined by integrating small scale fractures and the rock matrix the equivalent hydraulic conductivity of a rev is easier to calculate and representative small scale fractures with weak connectivity can be treated as an enhanced matrix with higher permeability guo et al 2019 this study integrates small scale fractures into the rock matrix to compose a sem therefore the equivalent sem has a higher permeability than the original rock matrix and the determination of the equivalent permeability of the sem is introduced in section 2 1 2 2 1 2 calculation of the equivalent permeability of mfepm the calculation of the equivalent permeability of mfepm is consist of two procedures firstly the equivalent permeability of sem is obtained by integrating the small scale fractures and rock matrix and the equivalent permeability of sem will replace the rock matrix secondly the large and medium scale fractures are transformed into porous media the equivalent hydraulic parameters are assigned to the grid blocks intersect fractures the new parameters replace the original parameters again the calculation of the equivalent parameters of mfepm is accomplished after the two procedures 2 1 2 1 equivalent permeability of the sem the sem is obtained by integrating the small scale fractures and rock matrix and its equivalent hydraulic conductivity is calculated by the finite element method fem when calculating the hydraulic conductivity of the sem in a certain direction a specified head is applied at both ends of the elementary volume to obtain the flow rate through the rock mass and then calculate the equivalent hydraulic conductivity of the elementary volume in this direction according to darcy s law in this study the sem is treated as a homogeneous anisotropic medium the equivalent hydraulic conductivity of an incrementally increasing elementary volume is iteratively calculated until a relatively stable value is obtained that is the equivalent hydraulic conductivity of the rev for the sem obviously the iterative calculation requires considerable computation as the simulation domain size increases the computation costs of seepage simulation in both fractures and matrix will increase significantly and this makes it hard to estimate the rev of a 3d fracture rock mass therefore researchers commonly simplify the analyses to 2d problem leung and zimmerman 2012 liu et al 2016 min et al 2004 yang et al 2014 however the quantitative prediction of 3d equivalent hydraulic conductivity still has no universally accepted method and needs further study some researchers have verified that the hydraulic conductivity of 2d fracture networks is different from that of 3d fracture networks huang et al 2017 lang et al 2014 huang et al 2017 emphasized the fluid flow in fracture networks and indicated that the connectivity of fracture networks is strong and continuous flow path occurs in both 3d fracture networks and 2d cut planes because of 3d fracture networks have better connectivity than 2d fracture networks equivalent hydraulic conductivity of 3d fracture networks may be larger than that of 2d fracture networks lang et al 2014 shows the comparison of the permeability of two dimensional cut planes and that of three dimensional fractured rock mass a similar conclusion is proposed in his paper two dimensional analysis cannot be directly used as an approximation of three dimensional equivalent permeability although an alternative expression of the trace map fracture density to an equivalent three dimensional fracture density is proposed the approximation of three dimensional equivalent permeability is not complete in this paper small scale fractures have little effect on fluid flow in fractured rock mass we assume the small scale fractures have a weak connectivity and it will make a less difference between 2d and 3d fractured rock mass consequently to balance the computational burden and accuracy we finally use the equivalent hydraulic conductivity of the two dimensional sem to represent that of the three dimensional sem in a specified direction in three dimensional space after coordinate system rotation according to the principal permeability direction only the main diagonal values of the permeability tensor are used for groundwater simulation therefore we need to calculate only the hydraulic conductivity kxx kyy and kzz along the x y and z axes as shown in fig 3 a the range of the computational domain of the fractured rock mass increases from 4 m 4 m 4 m in different simulation ranges the equivalent hydraulic conductivity in each principal direction is calculated when calculating the equivalent hydraulic conductivity in a direction many two dimensional sections are set to intercept the computational domain as shown in fig 3 b as shown in fig 3 c and fig 3 d two dimensional seepage simulations are conducted to obtain the equivalent hydraulic conductivity of each two dimensional fracture computational domain the average hydraulic conductivity is taken as the equivalent hydraulic conductivity of the three dimensional fractured rock mass in this specified direction wu et al 2014 each time the simulation range is increased the equivalent hydraulic conductivity can be calculated when the variation of equivalent hydraulic conductivity tends to be stable for example the relative error of two adjacent calculations is less than 5 the rev size can be statistically determined wang and cai 2019 in this study we statistically determine the rev size when the above condition is established three times consecutively for each of the three principal directions the flow exchange method is used to solve the two dimensional flow problem of the fractured matrix in the fem calculation the permeability matrices of the fracture and porous medium are established then based on the principles that the head at the shared nodes of the fractured and porous media are equal and mass conservation the permeability matrix of the whole seepage area is formed luo et al 2018 zhang et al 2012 first the matrix of conductivity coefficients between all nodes of the fracture network is established according to the local cubic flow law fang and zhu 2018 hyman et al 2016 ren et al 2017a the flow rate can be computed by the following expression 1 q ij ρ g b 3 12 μ h j h i l ij where qij is the volumetric flow rate per unit width of fracture perpendicular to the flow direction from i to j b is the aperture of the fracture ρ is fluid density g is the acceleration of gravity μ is the dynamic viscosity coefficient of the fluids lij is the distance between nodes i and j and hi and hj are the heads at nodes i and j in a fracture segment according to eq 1 the steady state flow equation without source and sink of the fracture network can be written in matrix form 2 ata t h 0 where a is the adjacency matrix reflecting the adjacency relationship between nodes t is the conductivity coefficient matrix h is the vector of water heads at nodes the calculation formula of the elements in the fracture conductivity coefficient matrix is as follows 3 t ij ρ g b 3 12 μ l ij then the flow equation between nodes in the porous medium is established to obtain the corresponding conductivity coefficient matrix the two dimensional steady flow model which also does not consider source and sink in the porous medium can be expressed as 4 x t x h x y t y h y 0 where the tx ty are the conductivity coefficients along x axis and y axis respectively the fem implemented with the galerkin method the appropriative equation under the condition that no flux on flux boundaries is as follows carey 1982 lynch 1984 5 e 1 n p e t n i x n j x n i y n j y d x d y h j 0 where e is the element integral region np is the number of elements ni and nj are shape functions and hj is the head of node j because the rock matrix is assumed isotropic in this paper the t is used to represent the conductivity coefficient of rock matrix and the thickness of aquifer is set as 1 m eq 5 can be written in matrix form 6 t e h 0 where te is the conductivity coefficient matrix of the porous medium the calculation formula of elements in the conductivity coefficient matrix can be written as follows 7 t ij e 1 n p e t n i x n j x n i y n j y d x d y from the above steps the conductivity coefficient matrices of the porous medium and fractures can be solved then these two matrices are superimposed if two nodes in the simulation area have conductivity coefficients for both a fracture and the porous medium the two values are added together to obtain the coupled conductivity coefficient matrix finally the head of each node can be calculated with eq 6 2 1 2 2 equivalent permeability and porosity of the fractures to transform fractures into an epm the hydraulic properties of the fractures are generalized and assigned to grids in the epm model the algorithm implemented in this study is proposed by chen et al 1999 the permeability and porosity of a grid are determined by the total volume of fractures in the grid and the anisotropy of the hydraulic conductivity is determined by the geometric characteristics of the fractures firstly the equivalent porosity of each grid block intersects fractures is calculated the total volume occupied by the fractures is equal to the sum of the volumes of the fractures that intersect the grid block the calculation equation is as follows 8 v f f 1 n v f f 1 n a f b f where n is the number of fractures that intersect the grid block af is the area where each fracture intersects the grid block and bf is the aperture of the fracture according to the total volume occupied by fractures the equivalent porosity of a grid block is calculated by the equation as follows 9 ϕ e v c ϕ m v f ϕ m v f v c where vc is the volume of the grid block vf is the total volume of n intersecting fractures in the grid block ϕe is the equivalent porosity of the grid block and ϕm is the porosity of the porous medium secondly the permeability tensor of the grid block is calculated by the following formula chen et al 1999 10 k f 1 12 f 1 n ϕ e f b f 2 ω ij f where ϕe f is the equivalent porosity of fracture f in grid block ω is the coordinate transformation tensor of fracture f and the calculation formula is as follows 11 ω ij f n 2 2 n 3 2 n 1 n 2 n 1 n 3 n 1 n 2 n 1 2 n 3 2 n 2 n 3 n 1 n 3 n 2 n 3 n 1 2 n 2 2 12 n 1 sin α π 180 sin ω π 180 13 n 2 sin α π 180 cos ω π 180 14 n 3 cos α π 180 where n 1 n 2 and n 3 are the unit normal vectors of the fracture plane α is the fracture dip angle and ω is the fracture dip direction the principal direction of the permeability tensor is assigned to the epm grid through the above calculation process an equivalent continuum model with hydraulic properties of fracture can be obtained when fractures are equivalently transformed into porous media the hydraulic properties of the fractures completely replace those of the sem in their original position chen et al 1999 2 2 mathematical model of flow and solute transport based on the mfepm method 2 2 1 water flow model the theoretical system of water flow and solute transport simulation based on the finite difference method is well developed and there are many commercial software programs for numerical simulation however to integrate multiscale fracture matrix coupling modeling equivalent permeability calculation and flow and transport simulation the implicit finite difference method based on the mfepm is adopted in matlab steady flow is used to simulate the epm model with ideal boundary conditions since the epm model is composed of nonuniformly refined grids it is impossible to discretize the three dimensional partial differential equation therefore this study establishes the water balance equation for each grid in the model 15 j 1 n q ij 0 where n is the total number of adjacent grids around grid i and qij is the flow rate from grid j to grid i the inflow of each grid block is equal to the outflow the head within each grid block is assumed to be uniform the flow between grid blocks is calculated according to darcy s law and qij is calculated as follows 16 q ij k ij a ij h j h i a i a j 2 where ai and aj are the side lengths of block i and block j respectively aij is the area of the flow cross section between two blocks which is the square of the side length of the smaller block fig 4 fig 4 shows the adjacency pattern between blocks with different sizes due to the difference in block size and hydraulic conductivity between blocks kij is taken as the harmonic mean value of the hydraulic conductivity of blocks i and j in this study the calculation formula is as follows 17 k ij a i a j a i k i a j k j the hydraulic conductivity ki is calculated from the permeability 18 k i k i ρ g μ after the mass conservation equation of each block is established the gauss seidel method is used to iteratively solve the head value of each block in the model 2 2 2 transport model based on flow simulation the solute transport simulation of continuous solute injection is carried out in this study the advection dispersion equation ade based on nonuniform grid is derived and the solute mass conservation equation is established for each grid block according to the partial differential form of the ade eq 19 kumar et al 2010 leij and dane 1990 tang et al 1981 woodbury et al 1990 we discretize it and list the mass conversation equation eq 20 19 n i x x i y y i z z v x c x v y c y v z c z δ x δ y δ z δ t n c t δ x δ y δ z δ t 20 j 1 n ϕ i i ij a ij δ t j 1 n v ij c ij a ij δ t v i ϕ i c i t 2 c i t 1 in the dispersion term ϕi is the porosity of grid block i iij is the hydrodynamic dispersion flux of block j to block i and δt is the time step the calculation method of hydrodynamic dispersion flux is as follows 21 i ij d ij c j c i a i a j 2 where ci and cj are the solute concentrations of blocks i and j respectively and dij is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient 22 d ij α l u ij d the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient reflects the mechanical diffusion and molecular diffusion αl is the longitudinal dispersivity and d is the molecular diffusion coefficient the actual flow velocity is calculated as follows 23 u ij q ij a ij ϕ ij where ϕi is the weight average porosity of grid block i and grid block j for the discretization of the advection term the value of cij depends on the direction of flow between grid blocks 24 c ij c i u ij 0 c j u ij 0 cij is the solute concentration value of the grid block as the source after the mass conservation equation of each grid block is established the solute concentration of each grid block in the model can be solved iteratively by the gauss seidel method 3 case study in this section a numerical case is set to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of mfepm for a multiscale fracture matrix system a synthetic fracture network is generated using a self developed fracture generator and the flow and solute transport in the fracture field are simulated for the epm mfepm and dfn the simulation results of the three methods are compared and studied 3 1 case 1 verifications of numerical solution the numerical solution approach of mfepm is verified in this case study in a range of 20 m 20 m 20 m there are three intersected fractures imbedded which are shown in fig 5 a the geometric parameters of fractures are shown in table 1 all the fracture apertures are 0 3 mm the permeability of the rock matrix is 1 10 14 m2 specified head boundaries are applied at surfaces of x 0 m and x 20 m with 20 2 m and 20 m the steady state flow and transient solute transport are performed by comsol and the numerical approach of mfepm respectively as shown in fig 5 b the flow simulation results of two approaches agree well according to the btc in fig 5 c in the early stage of the curves the solute transport of comsol is faster than that of epm but two curves have good consistency on the whole tendency this case demonstrates that the approach for solving fluid flow and solute transport problems is efficient in addition the sensitivity analysis of grid is conducted based on this case four epm models with different degrees of octree refined mesh are simulated and the hydraulic head distribution of the four epm models is compared with that of comsol the initial size of grid block is 4 m the octree refined block is conducted three times and the grid block size of 2 m 1 m and 0 5 m are obtained respectively as shown in fig 6 the head distribution of plane z 10 m of the four epm models is compared with that of comsol the difference between the results of comsol and epm is quantitively estimated by the root mean square error rmse of the hydraulic head distribution except the grid size of 4 m the rmse value decreases with decreasing grid size for 2 m 1 m and 0 5 m therefore the numerical solutions are affected by the refinement of grid it is suggested that the grid size should be determined by comprehensively considering the large and medium scale fracture size the range of the study area and the balance between the calculation accuracy and the computational burden 3 2 case 2 flow and solute simulation with the mfepm method a dfn model fig 7 a of a multiscale fracture network was established in a domain of 80 m 60 m 20 m using the parameters in table 2 the geometry and orientation characteristics of the fractures include the center position fracture dip direction fracture dip angle and radius the distribution of the center point of the fracture follows a uniform distribution the dip direction of the fracture follows a normal distribution and the radius follows a logarithmic normal distribution the parameters used to generate the dfn are shown in table 2 the porosity of the rock matrix in the case is set as 0 01 and the isotropic permeability is 9 17 10 16 m2 first the small scale fractures and rock matrix are equivalent to the sem as shown in fig 8 the hydraulic conductivities in the three principal directions vary with the simulation range each simulation range will realize 10 100 simulations according to the computation the black point kxx kyy kzz in the figure represents the hydraulic conductivity of each simulation realization and the red point kmxx kmyy and kmzz represents the mean value of the hydraulic conductivity of all simulation realizations of a simulation range the trend of the variation in the mean value of hydraulic conductivity with the simulation range shows that the fluctuation in kmzz is not obvious and that the judging condition is achieved when the simulation range is 10 m compared with that in kmzz the variations in kmxx and kmyy are stable when the simulation range exceeds 10 m and the judging condition is achieved when the simulation range is 16 m therefore the rev size of the sem is 16 m and the equivalent hydraulic conductivities in the three principal directions are 1 38 10 8 m s 1 37 10 8 m s and 1 24 10 8 m s meanwhile by the equivalent calculation the effect of small fractures to the order of magnitude of porosity is not significant the porosity of sem remains the same the dfn model is mapped on an epm model using the spatial grid identification method shown in section 2 1 1 the initial grid block size is 10 m and two refinements are carried out at the grid blocks with fractures the distributions of the epm porosity and permeabilities kxx kyy and kzz are shown in fig 7 b and c according to the calculation method in section 2 1 2 fig 7 shows that the porosity and permeability of grid blocks occupied by fractures are higher than those not occupied by fractures and the grid blocks occupied by the main fractures clearly have a higher porosity and permeability fig 7 c shows that the permeabilities in the x axis and y axis directions of the grid blocks occupied by medium scale fractures are greater than those in the z axis direction the anisotropy of permeability is controlled by the occurrence of fractures the flow along the x axis direction with a head difference of 0 5 m is applied to the simulated area the flow and solute transport simulation results are shown in figs 9 and 10 respectively fig 9 a b and c are the head distributions obtained by the traditional epm mfepm and dfn respectively in which fig 9 c is calculated with comsol software the hydraulic conductivity of the epm in the traditional epm method is inversely calculated according to the dfn simulation results and the equivalent hydraulic conductivity along the x axis direction is 0 0133 m s because the equivalent hydraulic conductivity in the epm is homogeneous the head of the epm has a linear gradient distribution along the x axis direction compared with the traditional epm the mfepm can depict the complexity of flow in the multiscale fracture matrix system affected by the main fractures the equivalent hydraulic conductivity of the epm is much greater than that of the rock matrix and the flow velocity along the x axis direction in the epm is faster although the solute transport in the epm is faster than that in the main fractures of the dfn the solute transport in the total domain is faster than that in mfepm and dfn the simulation results of the dfn show that the head distribution and solute concentration distribution are influenced by the connectivity of fractures figs 9 c and 10 the distribution trends of the head and solute concentration of the mfepm and dfn are similar and the mfepm can characterize the flow interaction between the fractures and matrix in extenso the solute transport simulation of dfn shows the preferential flow in the main fracture at the first time t 1000 s the main fracture is filled with solute in contrast the solute transport in medium scale fractures is slower there is a significant difference in flow velocity between the main channel and the locally connected network the flow exchange between the fractures and matrix leads to the flow velocity in the main fractures of the mfepm being slower than that of the dfn among the distributions of solute concentration simulated by the three methods the solute transport process of the mfepm is the most hysteretic whether in the main fractures or in other areas 3 3 case 3 the effect of sem on solute transport to further demonstrate the significance of the sem for the simulation of flow and solute transport a set of comparative simulation experiments is carried out in this section a new multiscale fracture network is established for simulation by the mfepm the dfn model of large scale and medium scale fractures in a multiscale fracture network is generated by the data in table 3 the fractures are shown in fig 11 and the number and occurrence of small scale fractures are the same as those in case 1 the model that does not consider the sem is called model i and the model that considers the sem is called model ii the flow and solute transport simulation results of the two models are shown in figs 12 and 13 the diagram of the head distributions shows that there is no significant difference between model i and model ii this means that the small scale fractures increase the permeability of the rock matrix but the response of the head distribution is not obvious therefore we compared the head values at the same position to obtain a quantitative comparison of the two models the distribution of scatter points and r 2 show that model i and model ii have good consistency in terms of the head results this means that the sem has no significant influence on the steady flow the simulation results of the solute concentration distributions at four different traveling times were compared fig 13 a and b shows that the transport of solute mainly occurs in fractures and the variation in solute concentration in fractures becomes more obvious with time there is no significant difference in the overall tendency of the concentration distribution between model i and model ii by comparing the solute concentrations at different positions it can be found that the solute concentrations at local locations are affected and the root mean square error rmse of the solute concentrations of the two models increases gradually with increasing traveling time fig 13 c the variation in the hydraulic conductivity of the matrix leads to the variation in the flow exchange between the fracture and matrix the flow velocity in a porous medium with a higher hydraulic conductivity is faster which leads to a faster variation in solute concentration hence the difference between the two models becomes more obvious with the passage of transport time 4 discussion 4 1 comparison between the mfepm and the epm methods the traditional epm regards the fgm as a homogenous porous medium generally characterized by the rev that is the rev has the same macroscopic hydraulic properties the rev theoretically represents the equivalent comprehensive hydraulic properties of fractures and the rock matrix nevertheless the traditional epm does not accurately characterize multiscale fractures which is critical for the preferential flow problem in the numerical case the epm has a large degree of generalization to the fgm compared with the traditional epm the mfepm proposed in this study can more accurately characterize the flow and solute transport in the fracture matrix system as shown in fig 14 the flow velocities in the principal fractures are the fastest which are higher than 2 5 10 6 m s fig 14 c the flow velocities in the fracture network mainly composed of medium scale fractures are between 1 10 6 m s and 2 5 10 6 m s fig 14 b the flow velocities in the sem are drastically slower than those in the fracture channels and are lower than 1 10 6 m s fig 14 a this shows that the mfepm can efficiently characterize the preferential flow with the improved epm in the fgm additionally due to being greatly affected by the principal fractures the equivalent hydraulic conductivity of equivalent porous medium of the traditional epm is larger therefore the simulation results of the solute concentration distribution show that the solute transport in the epm is faster than that in the mfepm the mfepm maps the large scale and medium scale fractures to refined spatial grids the geometric information and hydraulic properties of fractures can be characterized in the epm model and the hydraulic properties of the small scale fractures are also integrated into the rock matrix as in the sem therefore the mfepm is theoretically more useful for characterizing flow in an fgm according to the simulation results of the mfepm in figs 9 and 10 case 1 the influence of fractures of different scales on flow and solute transport can be observed clearly and the integration of fracture information effectively improves the simulation accuracy compared to that of the traditional epm the epm and mfepm simulation results of the head and solute concentrations at the same location are quantitatively compared as shown in fig 15 fig 15 a shows that there are certain errors in the distributions of the head simulated by the two methods and that the distribution trend of the head simulated by the traditional epm is similar to that simulated by the mfepm fig 15 b also shows that the difference in solute concentration distribution is obvious and that the solute concentration of the rmse increases with the passage of transport time this is because solute transport is greatly affected by preferential flow which can be better characterized by the mfepm 4 2 comparison between the mfepm and the dfn methods to compare the head distributions of the dfn method and the mfepm the relative errors of the head on the dfn between the two models in case 1 are calculated and the relative error of the head is mapped to the scatter points as shown in fig 16 the most significant difference exists fig 16 b in the isolated fractures circle a in fig 16 a and the dead end fractures circles b and c in fig 16 a in case 1 there are some isolated fractures in the fracture field and the flow simulation results of the dfn show that there is no flow in the isolated fractures fig 9 c in the actual situation of fractured rock masses the isolated fractures could still have a weak hydraulic connection with other fractures through the porous medium under higher hydraulic pressures and they also provide important storage space for groundwater in the simulation results of the mfepm the water storage capacity of isolated fractures is represented in the epm model fig 9 b according to the simulation results of solute transport with the dfn and mfepm the velocity of solute transport in the main fractures simulated by the dfn is faster than that simulated by the mfepm and all solute migrates in fractures for the dfn method while the flow and solute transport simulated by the mfepm method exist throughout the aquiferous media and the method simultaneously represents high velocity and solute migration in fractures and exchange between fractures and matrix fig 10 in the treatment of small scale fractures the mfepm integrates small scale fractures and the rock matrix into the sem to retain the hydraulic properties of the aquiferous medium so the mfepm better characterizes the permeability of the fractured rock matrix compared with the traditional dfn method the simulation results of flow and solute transport suggests that the dfn method can characterize the complexity of fracture networks but it cannot simulate the flow and mass exchanges between rock matrix and fractures and the exchanges between isolated fractures with connected fractures in fractured porous media and it also has to ignore the numerous small scale fractures because of the unmanageable computational burden the mfepm method can effectively simulate flow behavior in the complex multiscale fracture matrix system simultaneously taking into account the flow and mass exchange between the fractures and matrix additionally in the process of dfn simulation the complex fracture networks will lead to the generation of low quality triangulated irregular networks tins which further cause difficulty in convergence and thus inaccurate simulation results if the tin quality is improved by refining the triangular meshes this will greatly increase the computational burden the treatment of the finite difference method based on the mfepm is more flexible because the spatial grid has the integrated equivalent hydraulic property of the fractures and sem 4 3 effect of small scale fractures on flow and solute transport in case 2 the equivalent simulation method of small scale fractures is demonstrated the generalization of the permeability of small scale fractures can effectively reduce the computational burden caused by the large number of fractures in the dfn method thus the mfepm proposed in this study has more significant computational advantages in numerical case 2 the small scale fractures with weak connectivity have little effect on the permeability of the region and thus do not make the hydraulic conductivity of the rock matrix change significantly on the order of a magnitude but it still affects the anisotropy of the permeability characteristics of the fractured porous medium the comparison of the simulation results suggests that the sem affects local water flow and solute concentration weakly and the overall tendency of the head and solute concentration do not change significantly figs 12 and 13 from fig 13 c it can be found that the rmse increases with the passage of transport time which shows that the influence of the sem on the solute concentration distribution in the fgm gradually becomes significant this study only considers the situation in which the small scale fractures are uniformly spatially distributed for the complex development of fractures in the actual field the study area can be divided into subregions according to the distribution characteristics of the fractures for equivalent treatment to further improve the characterization capacity for complex fgm with the mfepm method additionally large medium and small scales fractures are relatively divided relative to the range of the study area according to the hydraulic function of different scales fracture on fluid flow such as fracture length and width in general application the number of large scale fractures is very small but it is very important for water flow they could be determined by high precision survey while the medium scale fractures has a relatively larger quantity which can be generated by staochastical method based on statistical data of field survey on medium fractures to simplify processing in some applications large and medium scales can be combined as large scale and the mfepm method can also simulate flow and solute transport with only large and small scales fractures 5 conclusion in this study a mfepm method is proposed for simulating fluid flow and solute transport in a fracture matrix system the mfepm method uniformly characterizes the multiscale fractures large scale medium scale small scale fractures and rock matrix with an epm model based on nonuniformly refined grids the small scale fractures and rock matrix are integrated into the sem to characterize their hydraulic properties in the fgm the medium scale and large scale fractures are mapped to locally refined grids to obtain the epm local grid refinement enhances the modeling accuracy by improving the characterization of the geometric morphology of the fracture network based on mass conservation the mathematical model of water flow and solute transport based on the finite difference method of nonuniformly refined grids is derived the mfepm method conceptually simplifies the simulation of flow in the fracture network and rock matrix and no extra exchange term is required between the rock matrix and fractures and the method not only consider the hydraulic properties of the multiscale fractures and rock matrix but also ensure the simulation efficiency and accuracy of the model the mfepm method carries out the generalization of multiscale fractures according to their hydraulic behavior to improve the simulation accuracy and computational efficiency the numerical cases show that the mfepm method has relative higher computational accuracy and good reliability in simulating water flow and solute transport with an appropriate computational burden compared with the traditional epm the mfepm assigns large scale and medium scale fracture attributions to spatially refined grids thus it can more accurately characterize preferential flow in fracture matrix systems compared with the dfn method the mfepm can characterize flow and solute transport in the sem and represent flow and mass exchange between fractures and matrix and the exchange between isolated fractures and connected fractures in fractured porous media and it also shows good computational efficiency without directly considering the large amount of small scale fracture information balancing computational accuracy and efficiency the mfepm method provides an effective alternative approach for conceptualizing fgms and simulating flow and solute transport in fracture matrix systems however there are some limitations of the method need to be improved in the future firstly a special case that originally unconnected fractures become connected because of intersecting the same grid block may appear in the process of modeling upscaling fractures to porous media method may increase the connectivity of fracture network however this case can not be avoided by refining grid because of the computational burden will increase significantly with the number of grids increasing in addition despite the equivalent hydraulic conductivity of three dimensional fractured rock mass is approximated by two dimensional cut plane the method of obtaining the hydraulic properties of enhanced matrix is not rigorous enough the efficient method of simulating seepage coupling fracture and matrix need to be further studied credit authorship contribution statement lei ma conceptualization funding

university nanjing 210098 china this manuscript was handled by a bardossy editor in chief with the assistance of fateh chebana associate editor graphical abstract markov chain monte carlo mcmc method has been increasingly popular in uncertainty analysis of hydrological simulation in mcmc approach deviations between model outputs and observations are commonly assumed to follow gaussian distribution with zero medium and constant standard deviation σ 2 however the estimation of σ 2 is a difficulty in terms of that it was assigned subjectively in previous studies hindering the improvement of performance for uncertainty assessment this work systemically investigates the statistical meaning of parameter σ 2 σ could be expressed as the product of data length and two standard deviations one of which is for observations i e σ obs and the other for nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nsce i e σ s a new label called confidence level of model clm is developed to interpret σ s the natural logarithm of the posterior probability distribution for nsce is a first order linear equation associated with clm the clm could be employed to guide the construction of σ s and then the estimation of σ 2 uncertainty analysis of a flow duration curve fdc model is conducted using the mcmc method based on clm and the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue method is employed for comparison results show that the clm affects the mcmc results by three kinds of trade offs and the mcmc method based on clm performs well in generating regular posterior distributions of model parameters and discharges the mcmc method also yields narrow and symmetrical confidence intervals findings of this paper could interpret typical uncertainty behaviors commonly existing in hydrological modeling and provide beneficial insights for the uncertainty analysis of other environmental modeling keywords uncertainty analysis markov chain monte carlo mcmc method parameter hydrological simulation flow duration curve fdc model 1 introduction a number of statistical methods have been proposed to quantify the uncertainty of hydrological simulation ren et al 2018 for examples the taylor expansion based methods naji et al 1998 the stochastic response surface srs method cryer and applequist 2003 and the rosenblueth s method rosenblueth 1975 nonetheless most approaches suffer from the typical difficulties commonly encountered in classical statistic inferences such as the determination of statistics for hypothesis testing and prior probability distribution for model outputs these difficulties are even severely deteriorated for a model whose parameter space features discontinuous derivate multimodality and curing multidimensional ridges vrugt et al 2003a thus an advanced uncertainty analysis method is urgently needed for assessing the uncertainty of hydrological simulation the bayesian approaches have been increasingly popular in uncertainty analysis of models including some complex distributed models kuczera et al 2010 marshall et al 2004 2005 thiemann et al 2001 ajami et al 2007 bayesian inference is theoretically more reasonable computationally much simpler and is demonstrated superior to classical statistics in many studies kuczera and parent 1998 vrugt et al 2009 it meanwhile provides the posterior distributions of model parameters and outputs bouda et al 2011 kavetski et al 2006 bayesian approaches provide a beneficial means to evaluate the uncertainty of hydrological models or simulation bayesian approaches could be classified into two classes the pseudo bayesian or informal method and standard or formal bayesian method the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimate glue methodology beven and binley 1992 is the most widely used pseudo bayesian method beven and freer 2001 hassan et al 2008 choi and beven 2007 whose target posterior distributions are commonly selected to be statistically informal distributions vrugt et al 2009 practical experiments show that the accuracy of glue method relies on the choice of likelihood functions and cut off threshold to a great degree especially for complex high dimension cases kuczera et al 2007 blasone et al 2008a the sampling direction and step is not well controlled and adjusted likely leading to poor sampling and convergence efficiency the markov chain monte carlo mcmc method is a typical standard bayesian approach kuczera and parent 1998 reis and stedinger 2005 in the case of hydrological simulation mcmc method assumes that the residuals between model outputs and observations follow independent identically distributed i i d distribution jin et al 2010 chung and kim 2013 the directional sampling strategy of mcmc e g metropolis hasting sampling gibbs sampling promises the convergence of samples to target posterior distribution kuczera and parent 1998 nevertheless poor choices of prior distribution proposal distribution and parameters in mcmc may lead to unsatisfying convergence efficiency engeland and gottschalk 2002 a lot of studies were carried out to increase the convergence efficiency ouarda and el adlouni 2011 lee and kim 2008 huang et al 2018 li et al 2018a and a number of revised mcmc approaches were developed for instance the shuffled complex evolution metropolis scem ua method vrugt et al 2003a 2003b sequence evolution metropolis emc method zhang et al 2009 and bayesian total error analysis batea approach kavetski et al 2006 the pre establishment of algorithmic parameters is vital to obtain the target posterior distribution in the above mcmc approaches efforts have been devoted to studying the algorithmic parameters the i i d distribution of residuals is normally assumed to be gaussian distribution with zero medium and constant variance σ 2 yang et al 2007 bouda et al 2011 ajami et al 2007 li et al 2018b li and babovic 2018 thiemann et al 2001 suggested a σ 2 ranging from 25 to 50 of the variance of the long term discharges it is however ambiguous to treat parameter σ 2 as constant some researchers removed σ 2 by assuming a non informative prior density p θ σ t β σ 1 vrugt et al 2003a other reports treated σ 2 as one of the unknown model parameters that needed to be sampled liang 2005 zhang et al 2009 limited studies try to interpret the statistical meaning of parameter σ 2 hindering the improvement of mcmc approaches consequently a proper interpretation and estimation of σ 2 in the case of gaussian type i i d distribution is of urgent needed this work aims to 1 build a new label called confidence level of model clm to interpret and estimate the parameter σ 2 2 present uncertainty analysis of hydrological simulation using mcmc approach and 3 reveal the effect of clm on the results of uncertainty analysis 2 methodology 2 1 bayesian approaches for uncertainty analysis given input output series x y model m and parameter set θ model outputs then could be expressed as follows 1 y m x θ bayesian statistics treats model parameters as probabilistic variables and aims at obtaining the real parameter distribution by incorporating prior information with the sample information a prior probability density π θ is used to reflect analysts knowledge about model parameters a likelihood function implies the sample information bayesian inference is formulated as follows 2 π θ x y y f y θ x y π θ f y θ x y π θ d θ where π θ x y y is the posterior probability of parameter set θ conditioned by input output series x y f y θ x y denotes the likelihood function which is commonly written in another form l θ x y y 3 π θ x y y l θ x y y π θ l θ x y y π θ d θ or 4 π θ x y y l θ x y y π θ the prior distribution is assumed a non informative distribution the likelihood function thus significantly affects the results of bayesian inference 2 1 1 markov chain monte carlo mcmc algorithm the residuals between observations and model outputs are expressed as 5 e i y i y i y i m x i θ i 1 2 n consider the residuals to be gaussian type i i d distribution with zero medium and constant variance σ t 2 6 p e i θ 1 2 π σ t exp e i 2 2 σ t 2 if the residuals do not follow gaussian distribution box cox transformation is applied before the metropolis hasting judgment thyer et al 2002 7 z y λ 1 λ λ 0 in y λ 0 the likelihood function l θ x is the multiple product of probabilities for all residuals vrugt et al 2003a

9 p θ x l θ x π θ exp i 1 n e i 2 2 σ t 2 eq 8 is the formal likelihood measure derived from robust statistical philosophy reflecting the statistical nature of residuals the general mcmc sampling is given as below vrugt et al 2003b step 1 randomly select a start point θ i in the feasible parameter space and calculate the posterior probability p θ i x step 2 generate a new candidate point θ i 1 according to a proposal distribution z θ i 1 θ i and calculate the posterior probability p θ i 1 x of θ i 1 step 3 metropolis hasting judgment 1 randomly sample a label z over the interval 0 1 2 compute ω min 1 p θ i 1 x p θ x 3 if z ω accept the candidate point θ i 1 otherwise retain at the current position θ i 1 θ i step 4 increments t if t is less than the pre identified population size n return to step 1 in this work we focus on the algorithmic parameter σ t in eq 8 which is an important parameter but always treated ambiguously in previous studies 2 2 interpretation of the algorithmic parameter the posterior probability eq 9 could be adapted as 10 p θ x exp i 1 n e i 2 2 σ t 2 exp i 1 n s i m i o b s i 2 i 1 n o b s i obs 2 2 σ t 2 i 1 n o b s i obs 2 the unbiased estimation of the standard deviation for observations is formulated as 11 σ obs 1 n 1 i 1 n o b s i obs 2 integrating eq 11 and the equation of nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nsce eq 27 into eq 10 obtains 12 p θ x exp n 1 σ obs 2 2 σ t 2 i 1 n si m i o b s i 2 i 1 n ob s i obs 2 exp 1 n s c e 2 σ t n 1 σ obs 2 exp s 2 2 σ s 2 where 13 s 1 n s c e 14 σ t n 1 σ obs σ s the original posterior probability is turned into normal distribution with the introduction of new variable s and σ s as a variable associated with nsce s could be regarded as the measure for the distance from the present model state to the ideal model state i e nsce 1 s 0 the algorithmic parameter σ t is expressed as the product of data length n 1 and two standard deviations σ obs and σ s therefore it could be concluded that σ t is statistically related not only to the observation but also to model calibration 2 2 1 posterior probability of s and nsce eq 12 is the formula for posterior probability of parameter set θ rather than variable s supposing that the sample population is generated by a mcmc approach fig 1 a it is possible that an s corresponds to a number of samples e g the samples in area ω s 1 and ω s 2 if we put all samples with the same s i e same nsce c into an interval ω s s 1 2 3 n the posterior probability of variable s could be written as 15 p s x ω s p θ x d θ a r e a s exp s 2 2 σ s 2 where area s is the ratio of the ω s space to the whole sample population space and 0 area s d s 1 exp s 2 2 σ s 2 is the right half of a normal distribution shown in fig 1 c if we expect p of the total mcmc samples to yield acceptable model outputs there is σ s s 2 φ 1 p where s denotes maximum s of acceptable sample and φ 1 is the inverse function of standard normal probability density the nsce corresponding to s eq 13 named confidence level of model clm in this paper is expressed as 16 clm 1 4 σ s φ 1 p 2 then we can obtain 17 σ t n 1 1 c l m σ obs 2 φ 1 p 2 to remove area s from eq 15 assume the prior distribution of area s as a uniform prior density 18 area s 1 hence we can get 19 p s x exp 2 φ 2 p s 2 1 c l m the posterior probability distribution of parameter θ eq 12 is transformed to that of s eq 19 as to nsce an s corresponds to only one nsce indicating that p s x p n s c e x here we take the natural logarithm of the posterior probability for nsce with p set as 95 20 in p n s c e x 5 4 n s c e 1 c l m i n π 1 c l m 1 64 5 4 1 c l m eq 20 is a first order linear equation of nsce with an intercept of i n π 1 c l m 1 64 5 4 1 c l m at the horizontal axis as well as a slope of 5 4 n s c e 1 c l m eqs 19 and 20 are demonstrated by practical experiment in the section 4 2 3 later 2 2 2 interpretation of clm clm could be interpreted as the manually decided minimum acceptable nsce according to the inferences above it seems that clm in mcmc method plays a similar role as the cut off threshold shorten as ct used in glue method actually these two labels are significantly different firstly clm is a procedure oriented label that has the function of controlling the shape of target distribution whereas ct is a result oriented label acting on the already generated sample population which aims at removing the non behavioral samples with nsce lower than ct in short clm acts as outlet of a funnel and ct acts as a sieve fig 1 b the parameter space out of clm could still be searched with small probabilities whereas this part is entirely cut off by ct besides clm can be deemed as a probabilistic variable or a constant which is however impossible for ct 2 2 3 clm acting as a constant or a probabilistic variable σ t is commonly assumed to be a constant or a probabilistic variable referring to the handlings in previous studies if σ t is a constant the clm is 21 clm 1 4 σ t φ 1 p σ obs 2 n 1 given a common setting σ t k σ obs 0 k 1 and p 95 eq 21 can be expressed as 22 clm 1 10 82 k 2 n 1 apparently clm approaches to 1 with the extension of time series if σ t is a probabilistic variable with density f σ t it is inferred as 23 f σ ct p σ t σ ct p c l m c l m c 1 f c l m c p c l m c where σ ct is a variance corresponding to a certain constant and cl m c is a clm value corresponding to σ ct the probability density g c l m is therefore expressed as 24 g c l m d 1 f σ t p c l m c dclm df σ t d σ t d σ t dclm n 1 σ obs 4 1 c l m φ 1 p f n 1 1 c l m c σ obs φ 1 p 1 1 c l m f σ t c l m consequently the probabilistic property of σ t from experts knowledge is interpreted by the changes of clm providing a jeffrey prior p σ σ 1 a common setting the corresponding prior of clm could be obtained 25 g c l m 1 1 c l m c l m 1 the prior clm evidently follows a similar distribution with the jeffrey σ t prior algorithmic parameter σ t is abstract whereas the concept of clm is concrete it is hence readily to identify the prior information of clm rather than that of algorithm parameter σ t 2 2 4 influence of clm on sampling results it is seen in fig 1 c the right part of normal distribution is the target posterior distribution all samples just fall into the right side of s which could be identified as the meaningful section fig 1 d shows the percentage of the meaningful section to target distribution versus the change of clm provided that the best fitting nsce of a hydrological model in a watershed is 0 9 it could be observed that the percentage decrease slightly in low clm section whereas sharply in middle and high clm section a very small ratio likely fails to generate sample population in consistence with target posterior distribution a relatively small clm corresponding to high percentage is therefore recommended to tackle this issue on the other hand the slope of probability density at s nsce 0 9 is shown in fig 1 d a proper slope ensures a promising occupation of the high probability space and a sufficient occupation over the low probability space too high slope makes heavily clustered sample population lack of sample diversity while too low slope loses the ability of locating at the high probability space and results in frequent exchange of samples between the low and high probability spaces the slope peaks at clm 0 9 and extremely declines when clm approaches to 1 details concerning the influence of clm to the sampling results will be presented in section 4 3 study area and hydrological simulation 3 1 study area and data the huangheyan region 20 930 km2 at an altitude of 4200 to 4800 m a s l is located at the head of the yellow river the region shows a typical continental climate with hot summer and dry winter since it is far away from oceans cui et al 2018 shi et al 2017 kumar et al 2019 lack of human activities makes it an ideal natural hydrological system the mean annual precipitation ranges from 200 to 400 mm 70 of which falls intensively from july to october and 62 of the whole precipitation is snowfall the mean annual temperature is ranged between 4 and 2 wang et al 2018 and the mean annual evapotranspiration is about 1322 mm denoted by 20 mm evaporating pan wang et al 2017 the data involved in this study is the observed daily discharge records at outlet of huangheyan region during the period 1996 2000 the data are collected from the local hydrology bureau and the national climate center besides five basins including dongwan luanchuan tantou xiquan and zijingguan are employed to further demonstrate the clm method eq 16 20 dongwan luanchuan and tantou are located in yellow river basin xiquan belongs to liao river basin and zijingguan is a part of hai river basin these three large rivers play the key role in sustaining the social and economy development of north china 3 2 four parameter flow duration curve fdc model flow duration curve fdc model can describe the statistical relationship between the ith discharge in descending order and the probabilities it is exceeded shao et al 2009 yang et al 2017 it is hence widely accepted as an informative method for displaying the complete range of river discharges from low flows to flood events guse et al 2016 fdcs commonly take on various shapes according to the climatic and geomorphic characteristics in the area of interest in this work a four parameter fdc model proposed by shao et al 2009 is employed for simulating the discharge 26 q p α β q τ θ q β α 1 b α 1 α β 1 1 p τ β β α 1 p τ θ τ q α γ α 1 log p

days α β and θ are scaling parameters associated with the physiographic factors and rainfall pattern which are used to control the shape of fdc domains and meanings of these notations are listed in table 1 it needs to be noticed that the upper bound of β is a variable restricted by the mathematical structure of beta function nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nsce is employed here to measure the distance between observations and model outputs 27 nsce 1 i 1 n o b s i s i m i 2 i 1 n o b s i obs 2 where ob s i and si m i are respectively the ith observation and model outputs ranked in descending order obs is the mean of observations and n is the length of discharge series 4 results and discussions 4 1 preparation for uncertainty analysis of fdc in this work the mcmc sampler derives 10 parallel markov chains each with a random starting point and a population of 5000 samples the first 500 of the 5000 samples is used for a burn in period before the convergence of markov chain to target distribution for a comparison glue is employed to conduct uncertainty analysis of fdc modeling glue sampler independently runs for 10 times each time for 10 000 samples nsce is selected as the likelihood function 4 2 posterior characteristics for parameter of fdc model 4 2 1 posterior probability of parameter α fig 2 graphically presents the posterior characteristics of parameter α generated respectively by glue and mcmc method at different labels ct 0 1 0 5 0 9 for glue and clm 0 1 0 5 0 9 for mcmc the best model efficiency of fdc i e nsce is 0 982 and the corresponding value of parameter α is 0 65 which is calibrated by a sce ua approach duan et al 1993 the parameter space around 0 65 is therefore characterized by a high probability fig 2 a and d are posterior probability distributions of parameter α by glue and mcmc respectively the two approaches at low ct or clm always perform poorly in finding the parameter space of high probability i e the parameter space around 0 65 while high labels effectively improve the performance of both approaches there are differences between mcmc results and glue results cumulative probability distributions of α by mcmc at all clm follow normal or gamma distribution fig 2 e whereas those by glue do not fig 2 b the scatters by mcmc are densely concentrated near the high nsce section fig 2 f whereas the scatters by glue distribute dispersedly over the whole space fig 2 c the differences could attribute to the strategies of these two approaches in selection of sampling algorithms and likelihood functions additionally clm of mcmc can be a value larger than the best nsce 0 982 whereas ct of glue cannot clm 0 99 0 997 and 0 999 are chosen as examples fig 3 the second one of which is a special case where σ t σ obs the posterior density shapes like gamma distribution with slight skewness at all clm and steepens hugely with the increase of clm the exploring parameter space narrows sharply in terms of that it changes from 0 1 clm 0 99 to 0 5 0 8 clm 0 999 4 2 2 posterior probability of other parameters posterior distributions of the remaining three model parameters shown as bar charts y axis denotes probability and x axis parameters values and the parameters values versus nsce shown as scatters y axis denotes nsce and x axis parameters values are presented in fig 4 parameter β follows exponential distribution q obeys gamma distribution and θ distributes uniformly however the features of distributions are changed when clm approaches to 1 clm 0 997 the distribution of parameter β at clm 0 997 becomes gamma type and θ follows an exponential distribution when clm 0 997 the scatters show peaks at the high nsce sections and the ranges of nsce are overly shrunk indicating that the mcmc search is restricted into a small parameter space in short the approaching of clm to 1 can amplify the microcosmic posterior characteristics of the parameter space with high probability at the cost of abandoning the macroscopicalsearch of remaining parameter space it could explain why the simulated posterior distributions reported before are always concentrated within very small ranges and why mcmc sampling is often trapped into local maximums marshall et al 2004 ajami et al 2007 kuczera et al 2007 blasone et al 2008b vrugt et al 2009 there are no standards for identifying the best value of clm the selection of clm could be regarded as a dynamical trade off between macroscopic versus microcosmic requirements clm should be selected and adjusted carefully based on practical requirements 4 2 3 posterior distributions of correlated parameters and nsce the correlation between parameter α and β generated by mcmc at different clm are presented in fig 5 rapid shrink of exploring parameter space and increase of maximum posterior probability is clearly observed with clm approaching to 1 samples are clustered in the case of clm 0 999 on the contrary the probability bars at clm 0 9 cover the whole parameter space leading to flat distributions low maximum probabilities and even the occurrence of local maximum probabilities it tends to be more obvious if clm is settled to a smaller value the nsce of fdc derived by mcmc sampler are shown in fig 6 to the best of our knowledge it has never been discussed previously as fig 6 indicates the natural logarithm of the posterior probability densities for nsce approximately accord with a first order linear equation at all clm it is worth noting that the coefficients of are approximately equivalent to 5 4 1 c l m and the intercepts at the vertical axis approximately equal to i n π 1 c l m 1 64 5 4 1 c l m the results over another 5 basins of north china support the relation as well fig s1 the findings above are the powerful evidence to support eq 20 and the subsequent inferences based on eq 20 the markov chain tends to convergence if the natural logarithm of nsce is first order linearly distributed which actually provides a simple way to test the convergence to the target distribution on the other hand an increasing clm does harm to convergence the nsce values at the very tails of both sides could not be sufficiently searched with their statistical probability it may attribute to the difference between real systems and the fdc modeling as well as the shortcomings of mcmc algorithm with an increase of clm the largest posterior probability moves to the largest nsce 0 982 at a cost that the density is biased from the first order linear distribution hence it is learned that the selection of clm is a trade off between accurate locating of maximum probability versus convergence to original target distribution 4 2 4 the effect of data length of observed daily discharge on σ obs as mentioned above the algorithmic parameter σ t is expressed as the product of data length n 1 and two standard deviations σ obs and σ s σ obs is estimated according to the observed data therefore it seems that the data length of observed daily discharge is related to the estimation of σ obs and then the estimation of σ t in this section the effect of data length of observed daily discharge on σ obs is investigated a comparison using different length of data was conducted fig 7 the values of σ obs are estimated based on 50 70 80 and 90 length of observed discharge data respectively the data was randomly sampled from the whole dataset for 1000 times the 1000 values of σ obs for each dataset i e the different length of discharge data are aggregated as box plots fig 7 the box plots in fig 7 a c show the σ obs values when clm equals 0 9 0 99 and 0 997 respectively the values vary largely for each sampling the range of values tends to shrink as the data length grows that is to say the value of σ obs is more stable when using more data besides the median values of σ obs are almost the same despite of data length indicating that a stable value of σ obs could be estimated via sampling even though the discharge data is not enough 1000 times sampling is recommended and the median of σ obs should be employed therefore it could be concluded that different length of data leads to varied values of σ obs which however is a more stable value through large amount of sampling increasing data length gains the stability of estimation of σ obs 4 3 posterior characteristics of discharge by glue and mcmc methods 4 3 1 posterior probability density of discharges to illustrate the posterior characteristics of discharges three discharge points are selected as examples namely the 100th 600th and 1300th discharges in descending order fig 8 it is a five year fdc 1825 days with 237 zero discharge days 100th 600th and 1300th discharges thus could be regarded as the representatives of high middle and low discharge schemes respectively all the posterior densities follow the type of gamma distributions fig 8 the posterior density steepens and narrows hugely with the increase of clm from 0 9 to 0 997 it needs to be pointed out that the algorithmic parameters r λ of the gamma distributions are calculated based on statistical meaning λ e x d x and r λ e x rather than through fitting it indicates that the sampling is statistically reasonable the skewness and kurtosis are plotted over the whole probability section in fig 9 skewness and kurtosis close to 0 indicates better agreement of the density distribution with normal distribution compared with normal distribution positive kurtosis implies steeper shape and positive skewness implies a right movement of the maximum probability the density distribution of discharges at clm 0 9 is steeper and positively biased compared to normal distribution which is more remarkable at the high and low probability tails on the contrary the skewness and kurtosis are always staying at small values throughout the probability section at large clm clm 0 99 indicating a high similarity with normal distribution actually a large clm clm 0 99 is consistent to the common settings for σ in previous studies this could explain why the simulated discharge are normally distributed ajami et al 2007 noh et al 2011 vrugt et al 2009 hu et al 2013 4 3 2 properties of 90 confidence intervals another important uncertainty measure for a hydrological simulation is the 90 confidence interval the deviation between the posterior means and observations i e residuals and the 90 confidence intervals for residuals at different clm are shown in fig 10 it is seen that the residuals are valued around 0 indicating that the posterior means of discharge generally match the actual discharge points compared to glue method at ct 0 9 mcmc method at clm 0 9 yields much thinner and more symmetrical intervals in the low discharge section i e the section with high probability whereas slightly larger intervals in the high discharge section i e the section with low probability the 90 confidence interval by glue method is evenly spaced but underestimated especially in the low discharge section the increase of clm leads to sharp shrink of the band width while does not change the shape of upper and lower bounds a very large clm 0 99 leads to less coverage ratio of interval for the observed points the selection of clm is a trade off between coverage ratio versus band width of intervals 5 conclusions and suggestions in mcmc approach for uncertainty analysis of hydrological modeling residuals between model outputs and observations are commonly assumed to follow gaussian distribution with zero medium and constant standard deviation σ 2 how to identify and estimate parameter σ 2 is a weak point in previous studies in this work the statistical meaning of parameter σ 2 of gaussian type posterior probability distribution in mcmc method are systemically investigated some statistical interpretation and inferences of the parameter are presented to improve the performance of mcmc approach a new label clm is developed to guide the estimation of σ 2 the uncertainty of the hydrological simulation by a four parameter fdc model is assessed by means of mcmc method based on clm and the glue method is employed for comparison uncertainty analysis here is conducted concerning the posterior characteristics of model parameters discharges and confidence intervals a series of derivative conclusions are therefore achieved and major findings are summarized as follows 1 parameter σ is statistically related not only to the observation but also to model calibration σ is expressed as the product of data length n 1 and two standard deviations one of which is for observations i e σ obs and the other for nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nsce i e σ s a new label called confidence level of model clm is developed to interpret σ s the natural logarithm of the posterior probability for nsce could be expressed as a first order linear equation associated with clm which is practically demonstrated by a series of case studies about the posterior density of nsce 2 clm is a label representing the manually decided minimum of acceptable nsce clm is more meaningful and dynamic than ct used in glue it is a procedure oriented label used for shaping the target distribution it can be set as a probabilistic variable or a constant case studies reveal that clm remarkably affects the value of σ and the mcmc results it is recommended to identify the algorithmic parameter σ according to clm 3 different length of data leads to varied values of σ obs which however could be a more stable value through large amount of sampling 1000 times sampling is recommended and the median of σ obs should be employed increasing data length gains the stability of estimation of σ obs 4 the mcmc method based on clm performs well in generating regular posterior distributions of model parameters and discharges and in yielding narrow and symmetrical confidence intervals the estimation of clm is related to three kinds of trade offs including the one between macroscopic versus microcosmic requirements the one between accurate locating of maximum probability versus convergence to original target distribution and the one between coverage ratio versus band width of intervals findings in this paper could well interpret the problems commonly encountered in traditional bayesian uncertainty assessments and provide insights for uncertainty analysis of other environmental modeling nevertheless strict mathematical proof of eq 18 as well as the application of clm in more complex models is necessary it will be further studied in our future work credit authorship contribution statement pengfei shi conceptualization formal analysis investigation methodology

university nanjing 210098 china this manuscript was handled by a bardossy editor in chief with the assistance of fateh chebana associate editor graphical abstract markov chain monte carlo mcmc method has been increasingly popular in uncertainty analysis of hydrological simulation in mcmc approach deviations between model outputs and observations are commonly assumed to follow gaussian distribution with zero medium and constant standard deviation σ 2 however the estimation of σ 2 is a difficulty in terms of that it was assigned subjectively in previous studies hindering the improvement of performance for uncertainty assessment this work systemically investigates the statistical meaning of parameter σ 2 σ could be expressed as the product of data length and two standard deviations one of which is for observations i e σ obs and the other for nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nsce i e σ s a new label called confidence level of model clm is developed to interpret σ s the natural logarithm of the posterior probability distribution for nsce is a first order linear equation associated with clm the clm could be employed to guide the construction of σ s and then the estimation of σ 2 uncertainty analysis of a flow duration curve fdc model is conducted using the mcmc method based on clm and the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue method is employed for comparison results show that the clm affects the mcmc results by three kinds of trade offs and the mcmc method based on clm performs well in generating regular posterior distributions of model parameters and discharges the mcmc method also yields narrow and symmetrical confidence intervals findings of this paper could interpret typical uncertainty behaviors commonly existing in hydrological modeling and provide beneficial insights for the uncertainty analysis of other environmental modeling keywords uncertainty analysis markov chain monte carlo mcmc method parameter hydrological simulation flow duration curve fdc model 1 introduction a number of statistical methods have been proposed to quantify the uncertainty of hydrological simulation ren et al 2018 for examples the taylor expansion based methods naji et al 1998 the stochastic response surface srs method cryer and applequist 2003 and the rosenblueth s method rosenblueth 1975 nonetheless most approaches suffer from the typical difficulties commonly encountered in classical statistic inferences such as the determination of statistics for hypothesis testing and prior probability distribution for model outputs these difficulties are even severely deteriorated for a model whose parameter space features discontinuous derivate multimodality and curing multidimensional ridges vrugt et al 2003a thus an advanced uncertainty analysis method is urgently needed for assessing the uncertainty of hydrological simulation the bayesian approaches have been increasingly popular in uncertainty analysis of models including some complex distributed models kuczera et al 2010 marshall et al 2004 2005 thiemann et al 2001 ajami et al 2007 bayesian inference is theoretically more reasonable computationally much simpler and is demonstrated superior to classical statistics in many studies kuczera and parent 1998 vrugt et al 2009 it meanwhile provides the posterior distributions of model parameters and outputs bouda et al 2011 kavetski et al 2006 bayesian approaches provide a beneficial means to evaluate the uncertainty of hydrological models or simulation bayesian approaches could be classified into two classes the pseudo bayesian or informal method and standard or formal bayesian method the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimate glue methodology beven and binley 1992 is the most widely used pseudo bayesian method beven and freer 2001 hassan et al 2008 choi and beven 2007 whose target posterior distributions are commonly selected to be statistically informal distributions vrugt et al 2009 practical experiments show that the accuracy of glue method relies on the choice of likelihood functions and cut off threshold to a great degree especially for complex high dimension cases kuczera et al 2007 blasone et al 2008a the sampling direction and step is not well controlled and adjusted likely leading to poor sampling and convergence efficiency the markov chain monte carlo mcmc method is a typical standard bayesian approach kuczera and parent 1998 reis and stedinger 2005 in the case of hydrological simulation mcmc method assumes that the residuals between model outputs and observations follow independent identically distributed i i d distribution jin et al 2010 chung and kim 2013 the directional sampling strategy of mcmc e g metropolis hasting sampling gibbs sampling promises the convergence of samples to target posterior distribution kuczera and parent 1998 nevertheless poor choices of prior distribution proposal distribution and parameters in mcmc may lead to unsatisfying convergence efficiency engeland and gottschalk 2002 a lot of studies were carried out to increase the convergence efficiency ouarda and el adlouni 2011 lee and kim 2008 huang et al 2018 li et al 2018a and a number of revised mcmc approaches were developed for instance the shuffled complex evolution metropolis scem ua method vrugt et al 2003a 2003b sequence evolution metropolis emc method zhang et al 2009 and bayesian total error analysis batea approach kavetski et al 2006 the pre establishment of algorithmic parameters is vital to obtain the target posterior distribution in the above mcmc approaches efforts have been devoted to studying the algorithmic parameters the i i d distribution of residuals is normally assumed to be gaussian distribution with zero medium and constant variance σ 2 yang et al 2007 bouda et al 2011 ajami et al 2007 li et al 2018b li and babovic 2018 thiemann et al 2001 suggested a σ 2 ranging from 25 to 50 of the variance of the long term discharges it is however ambiguous to treat parameter σ 2 as constant some researchers removed σ 2 by assuming a non informative prior density p θ σ t β σ 1 vrugt et al 2003a other reports treated σ 2 as one of the unknown model parameters that needed to be sampled liang 2005 zhang et al 2009 limited studies try to interpret the statistical meaning of parameter σ 2 hindering the improvement of mcmc approaches consequently a proper interpretation and estimation of σ 2 in the case of gaussian type i i d distribution is of urgent needed this work aims to 1 build a new label called confidence level of model clm to interpret and estimate the parameter σ 2 2 present uncertainty analysis of hydrological simulation using mcmc approach and 3 reveal the effect of clm on the results of uncertainty analysis 2 methodology 2 1 bayesian approaches for uncertainty analysis given input output series x y model m and parameter set θ model outputs then could be expressed as follows 1 y m x θ bayesian statistics treats model parameters as probabilistic variables and aims at obtaining the real parameter distribution by incorporating prior information with the sample information a prior probability density π θ is used to reflect analysts knowledge about model parameters a likelihood function implies the sample information bayesian inference is formulated as follows 2 π θ x y y f y θ x y π θ f y θ x y π θ d θ where π θ x y y is the posterior probability of parameter set θ conditioned by input output series x y f y θ x y denotes the likelihood function which is commonly written in another form l θ x y y 3 π θ x y y l θ x y y π θ l θ x y y π θ d θ or 4 π θ x y y l θ x y y π θ the prior distribution is assumed a non informative distribution the likelihood function thus significantly affects the results of bayesian inference 2 1 1 markov chain monte carlo mcmc algorithm the residuals between observations and model outputs are expressed as 5 e i y i y i y i m x i θ i 1 2 n consider the residuals to be gaussian type i i d distribution with zero medium and constant variance σ t 2 6 p e i θ 1 2 π σ t exp e i 2 2 σ t 2 if the residuals do not follow gaussian distribution box cox transformation is applied before the metropolis hasting judgment thyer et al 2002 7 z y λ 1 λ λ 0 in y λ 0 the likelihood function l θ x is the multiple product of probabilities for all residuals vrugt et al 2003a

9 p θ x l θ x π θ exp i 1 n e i 2 2 σ t 2 eq 8 is the formal likelihood measure derived from robust statistical philosophy reflecting the statistical nature of residuals the general mcmc sampling is given as below vrugt et al 2003b step 1 randomly select a start point θ i in the feasible parameter space and calculate the posterior probability p θ i x step 2 generate a new candidate point θ i 1 according to a proposal distribution z θ i 1 θ i and calculate the posterior probability p θ i 1 x of θ i 1 step 3 metropolis hasting judgment 1 randomly sample a label z over the interval 0 1 2 compute ω min 1 p θ i 1 x p θ x 3 if z ω accept the candidate point θ i 1 otherwise retain at the current position θ i 1 θ i step 4 increments t if t is less than the pre identified population size n return to step 1 in this work we focus on the algorithmic parameter σ t in eq 8 which is an important parameter but always treated ambiguously in previous studies 2 2 interpretation of the algorithmic parameter the posterior probability eq 9 could be adapted as 10 p θ x exp i 1 n e i 2 2 σ t 2 exp i 1 n s i m i o b s i 2 i 1 n o b s i obs 2 2 σ t 2 i 1 n o b s i obs 2 the unbiased estimation of the standard deviation for observations is formulated as 11 σ obs 1 n 1 i 1 n o b s i obs 2 integrating eq 11 and the equation of nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nsce eq 27 into eq 10 obtains 12 p θ x exp n 1 σ obs 2 2 σ t 2 i 1 n si m i o b s i 2 i 1 n ob s i obs 2 exp 1 n s c e 2 σ t n 1 σ obs 2 exp s 2 2 σ s 2 where 13 s 1 n s c e 14 σ t n 1 σ obs σ s the original posterior probability is turned into normal distribution with the introduction of new variable s and σ s as a variable associated with nsce s could be regarded as the measure for the distance from the present model state to the ideal model state i e nsce 1 s 0 the algorithmic parameter σ t is expressed as the product of data length n 1 and two standard deviations σ obs and σ s therefore it could be concluded that σ t is statistically related not only to the observation but also to model calibration 2 2 1 posterior probability of s and nsce eq 12 is the formula for posterior probability of parameter set θ rather than variable s supposing that the sample population is generated by a mcmc approach fig 1 a it is possible that an s corresponds to a number of samples e g the samples in area ω s 1 and ω s 2 if we put all samples with the same s i e same nsce c into an interval ω s s 1 2 3 n the posterior probability of variable s could be written as 15 p s x ω s p θ x d θ a r e a s exp s 2 2 σ s 2 where area s is the ratio of the ω s space to the whole sample population space and 0 area s d s 1 exp s 2 2 σ s 2 is the right half of a normal distribution shown in fig 1 c if we expect p of the total mcmc samples to yield acceptable model outputs there is σ s s 2 φ 1 p where s denotes maximum s of acceptable sample and φ 1 is the inverse function of standard normal probability density the nsce corresponding to s eq 13 named confidence level of model clm in this paper is expressed as 16 clm 1 4 σ s φ 1 p 2 then we can obtain 17 σ t n 1 1 c l m σ obs 2 φ 1 p 2 to remove area s from eq 15 assume the prior distribution of area s as a uniform prior density 18 area s 1 hence we can get 19 p s x exp 2 φ 2 p s 2 1 c l m the posterior probability distribution of parameter θ eq 12 is transformed to that of s eq 19 as to nsce an s corresponds to only one nsce indicating that p s x p n s c e x here we take the natural logarithm of the posterior probability for nsce with p set as 95 20 in p n s c e x 5 4 n s c e 1 c l m i n π 1 c l m 1 64 5 4 1 c l m eq 20 is a first order linear equation of nsce with an intercept of i n π 1 c l m 1 64 5 4 1 c l m at the horizontal axis as well as a slope of 5 4 n s c e 1 c l m eqs 19 and 20 are demonstrated by practical experiment in the section 4 2 3 later 2 2 2 interpretation of clm clm could be interpreted as the manually decided minimum acceptable nsce according to the inferences above it seems that clm in mcmc method plays a similar role as the cut off threshold shorten as ct used in glue method actually these two labels are significantly different firstly clm is a procedure oriented label that has the function of controlling the shape of target distribution whereas ct is a result oriented label acting on the already generated sample population which aims at removing the non behavioral samples with nsce lower than ct in short clm acts as outlet of a funnel and ct acts as a sieve fig 1 b the parameter space out of clm could still be searched with small probabilities whereas this part is entirely cut off by ct besides clm can be deemed as a probabilistic variable or a constant which is however impossible for ct 2 2 3 clm acting as a constant or a probabilistic variable σ t is commonly assumed to be a constant or a probabilistic variable referring to the handlings in previous studies if σ t is a constant the clm is 21 clm 1 4 σ t φ 1 p σ obs 2 n 1 given a common setting σ t k σ obs 0 k 1 and p 95 eq 21 can be expressed as 22 clm 1 10 82 k 2 n 1 apparently clm approaches to 1 with the extension of time series if σ t is a probabilistic variable with density f σ t it is inferred as 23 f σ ct p σ t σ ct p c l m c l m c 1 f c l m c p c l m c where σ ct is a variance corresponding to a certain constant and cl m c is a clm value corresponding to σ ct the probability density g c l m is therefore expressed as 24 g c l m d 1 f σ t p c l m c dclm df σ t d σ t d σ t dclm n 1 σ obs 4 1 c l m φ 1 p f n 1 1 c l m c σ obs φ 1 p 1 1 c l m f σ t c l m consequently the probabilistic property of σ t from experts knowledge is interpreted by the changes of clm providing a jeffrey prior p σ σ 1 a common setting the corresponding prior of clm could be obtained 25 g c l m 1 1 c l m c l m 1 the prior clm evidently follows a similar distribution with the jeffrey σ t prior algorithmic parameter σ t is abstract whereas the concept of clm is concrete it is hence readily to identify the prior information of clm rather than that of algorithm parameter σ t 2 2 4 influence of clm on sampling results it is seen in fig 1 c the right part of normal distribution is the target posterior distribution all samples just fall into the right side of s which could be identified as the meaningful section fig 1 d shows the percentage of the meaningful section to target distribution versus the change of clm provided that the best fitting nsce of a hydrological model in a watershed is 0 9 it could be observed that the percentage decrease slightly in low clm section whereas sharply in middle and high clm section a very small ratio likely fails to generate sample population in consistence with target posterior distribution a relatively small clm corresponding to high percentage is therefore recommended to tackle this issue on the other hand the slope of probability density at s nsce 0 9 is shown in fig 1 d a proper slope ensures a promising occupation of the high probability space and a sufficient occupation over the low probability space too high slope makes heavily clustered sample population lack of sample diversity while too low slope loses the ability of locating at the high probability space and results in frequent exchange of samples between the low and high probability spaces the slope peaks at clm 0 9 and extremely declines when clm approaches to 1 details concerning the influence of clm to the sampling results will be presented in section 4 3 study area and hydrological simulation 3 1 study area and data the huangheyan region 20 930 km2 at an altitude of 4200 to 4800 m a s l is located at the head of the yellow river the region shows a typical continental climate with hot summer and dry winter since it is far away from oceans cui et al 2018 shi et al 2017 kumar et al 2019 lack of human activities makes it an ideal natural hydrological system the mean annual precipitation ranges from 200 to 400 mm 70 of which falls intensively from july to october and 62 of the whole precipitation is snowfall the mean annual temperature is ranged between 4 and 2 wang et al 2018 and the mean annual evapotranspiration is about 1322 mm denoted by 20 mm evaporating pan wang et al 2017 the data involved in this study is the observed daily discharge records at outlet of huangheyan region during the period 1996 2000 the data are collected from the local hydrology bureau and the national climate center besides five basins including dongwan luanchuan tantou xiquan and zijingguan are employed to further demonstrate the clm method eq 16 20 dongwan luanchuan and tantou are located in yellow river basin xiquan belongs to liao river basin and zijingguan is a part of hai river basin these three large rivers play the key role in sustaining the social and economy development of north china 3 2 four parameter flow duration curve fdc model flow duration curve fdc model can describe the statistical relationship between the ith discharge in descending order and the probabilities it is exceeded shao et al 2009 yang et al 2017 it is hence widely accepted as an informative method for displaying the complete range of river discharges from low flows to flood events guse et al 2016 fdcs commonly take on various shapes according to the climatic and geomorphic characteristics in the area of interest in this work a four parameter fdc model proposed by shao et al 2009 is employed for simulating the discharge 26 q p α β q τ θ q β α 1 b α 1 α β 1 1 p τ β β α 1 p τ θ τ q α γ α 1 log p

days α β and θ are scaling parameters associated with the physiographic factors and rainfall pattern which are used to control the shape of fdc domains and meanings of these notations are listed in table 1 it needs to be noticed that the upper bound of β is a variable restricted by the mathematical structure of beta function nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nsce is employed here to measure the distance between observations and model outputs 27 nsce 1 i 1 n o b s i s i m i 2 i 1 n o b s i obs 2 where ob s i and si m i are respectively the ith observation and model outputs ranked in descending order obs is the mean of observations and n is the length of discharge series 4 results and discussions 4 1 preparation for uncertainty analysis of fdc in this work the mcmc sampler derives 10 parallel markov chains each with a random starting point and a population of 5000 samples the first 500 of the 5000 samples is used for a burn in period before the convergence of markov chain to target distribution for a comparison glue is employed to conduct uncertainty analysis of fdc modeling glue sampler independently runs for 10 times each time for 10 000 samples nsce is selected as the likelihood function 4 2 posterior characteristics for parameter of fdc model 4 2 1 posterior probability of parameter α fig 2 graphically presents the posterior characteristics of parameter α generated respectively by glue and mcmc method at different labels ct 0 1 0 5 0 9 for glue and clm 0 1 0 5 0 9 for mcmc the best model efficiency of fdc i e nsce is 0 982 and the corresponding value of parameter α is 0 65 which is calibrated by a sce ua approach duan et al 1993 the parameter space around 0 65 is therefore characterized by a high probability fig 2 a and d are posterior probability distributions of parameter α by glue and mcmc respectively the two approaches at low ct or clm always perform poorly in finding the parameter space of high probability i e the parameter space around 0 65 while high labels effectively improve the performance of both approaches there are differences between mcmc results and glue results cumulative probability distributions of α by mcmc at all clm follow normal or gamma distribution fig 2 e whereas those by glue do not fig 2 b the scatters by mcmc are densely concentrated near the high nsce section fig 2 f whereas the scatters by glue distribute dispersedly over the whole space fig 2 c the differences could attribute to the strategies of these two approaches in selection of sampling algorithms and likelihood functions additionally clm of mcmc can be a value larger than the best nsce 0 982 whereas ct of glue cannot clm 0 99 0 997 and 0 999 are chosen as examples fig 3 the second one of which is a special case where σ t σ obs the posterior density shapes like gamma distribution with slight skewness at all clm and steepens hugely with the increase of clm the exploring parameter space narrows sharply in terms of that it changes from 0 1 clm 0 99 to 0 5 0 8 clm 0 999 4 2 2 posterior probability of other parameters posterior distributions of the remaining three model parameters shown as bar charts y axis denotes probability and x axis parameters values and the parameters values versus nsce shown as scatters y axis denotes nsce and x axis parameters values are presented in fig 4 parameter β follows exponential distribution q obeys gamma distribution and θ distributes uniformly however the features of distributions are changed when clm approaches to 1 clm 0 997 the distribution of parameter β at clm 0 997 becomes gamma type and θ follows an exponential distribution when clm 0 997 the scatters show peaks at the high nsce sections and the ranges of nsce are overly shrunk indicating that the mcmc search is restricted into a small parameter space in short the approaching of clm to 1 can amplify the microcosmic posterior characteristics of the parameter space with high probability at the cost of abandoning the macroscopicalsearch of remaining parameter space it could explain why the simulated posterior distributions reported before are always concentrated within very small ranges and why mcmc sampling is often trapped into local maximums marshall et al 2004 ajami et al 2007 kuczera et al 2007 blasone et al 2008b vrugt et al 2009 there are no standards for identifying the best value of clm the selection of clm could be regarded as a dynamical trade off between macroscopic versus microcosmic requirements clm should be selected and adjusted carefully based on practical requirements 4 2 3 posterior distributions of correlated parameters and nsce the correlation between parameter α and β generated by mcmc at different clm are presented in fig 5 rapid shrink of exploring parameter space and increase of maximum posterior probability is clearly observed with clm approaching to 1 samples are clustered in the case of clm 0 999 on the contrary the probability bars at clm 0 9 cover the whole parameter space leading to flat distributions low maximum probabilities and even the occurrence of local maximum probabilities it tends to be more obvious if clm is settled to a smaller value the nsce of fdc derived by mcmc sampler are shown in fig 6 to the best of our knowledge it has never been discussed previously as fig 6 indicates the natural logarithm of the posterior probability densities for nsce approximately accord with a first order linear equation at all clm it is worth noting that the coefficients of are approximately equivalent to 5 4 1 c l m and the intercepts at the vertical axis approximately equal to i n π 1 c l m 1 64 5 4 1 c l m the results over another 5 basins of north china support the relation as well fig s1 the findings above are the powerful evidence to support eq 20 and the subsequent inferences based on eq 20 the markov chain tends to convergence if the natural logarithm of nsce is first order linearly distributed which actually provides a simple way to test the convergence to the target distribution on the other hand an increasing clm does harm to convergence the nsce values at the very tails of both sides could not be sufficiently searched with their statistical probability it may attribute to the difference between real systems and the fdc modeling as well as the shortcomings of mcmc algorithm with an increase of clm the largest posterior probability moves to the largest nsce 0 982 at a cost that the density is biased from the first order linear distribution hence it is learned that the selection of clm is a trade off between accurate locating of maximum probability versus convergence to original target distribution 4 2 4 the effect of data length of observed daily discharge on σ obs as mentioned above the algorithmic parameter σ t is expressed as the product of data length n 1 and two standard deviations σ obs and σ s σ obs is estimated according to the observed data therefore it seems that the data length of observed daily discharge is related to the estimation of σ obs and then the estimation of σ t in this section the effect of data length of observed daily discharge on σ obs is investigated a comparison using different length of data was conducted fig 7 the values of σ obs are estimated based on 50 70 80 and 90 length of observed discharge data respectively the data was randomly sampled from the whole dataset for 1000 times the 1000 values of σ obs for each dataset i e the different length of discharge data are aggregated as box plots fig 7 the box plots in fig 7 a c show the σ obs values when clm equals 0 9 0 99 and 0 997 respectively the values vary largely for each sampling the range of values tends to shrink as the data length grows that is to say the value of σ obs is more stable when using more data besides the median values of σ obs are almost the same despite of data length indicating that a stable value of σ obs could be estimated via sampling even though the discharge data is not enough 1000 times sampling is recommended and the median of σ obs should be employed therefore it could be concluded that different length of data leads to varied values of σ obs which however is a more stable value through large amount of sampling increasing data length gains the stability of estimation of σ obs 4 3 posterior characteristics of discharge by glue and mcmc methods 4 3 1 posterior probability density of discharges to illustrate the posterior characteristics of discharges three discharge points are selected as examples namely the 100th 600th and 1300th discharges in descending order fig 8 it is a five year fdc 1825 days with 237 zero discharge days 100th 600th and 1300th discharges thus could be regarded as the representatives of high middle and low discharge schemes respectively all the posterior densities follow the type of gamma distributions fig 8 the posterior density steepens and narrows hugely with the increase of clm from 0 9 to 0 997 it needs to be pointed out that the algorithmic parameters r λ of the gamma distributions are calculated based on statistical meaning λ e x d x and r λ e x rather than through fitting it indicates that the sampling is statistically reasonable the skewness and kurtosis are plotted over the whole probability section in fig 9 skewness and kurtosis close to 0 indicates better agreement of the density distribution with normal distribution compared with normal distribution positive kurtosis implies steeper shape and positive skewness implies a right movement of the maximum probability the density distribution of discharges at clm 0 9 is steeper and positively biased compared to normal distribution which is more remarkable at the high and low probability tails on the contrary the skewness and kurtosis are always staying at small values throughout the probability section at large clm clm 0 99 indicating a high similarity with normal distribution actually a large clm clm 0 99 is consistent to the common settings for σ in previous studies this could explain why the simulated discharge are normally distributed ajami et al 2007 noh et al 2011 vrugt et al 2009 hu et al 2013 4 3 2 properties of 90 confidence intervals another important uncertainty measure for a hydrological simulation is the 90 confidence interval the deviation between the posterior means and observations i e residuals and the 90 confidence intervals for residuals at different clm are shown in fig 10 it is seen that the residuals are valued around 0 indicating that the posterior means of discharge generally match the actual discharge points compared to glue method at ct 0 9 mcmc method at clm 0 9 yields much thinner and more symmetrical intervals in the low discharge section i e the section with high probability whereas slightly larger intervals in the high discharge section i e the section with low probability the 90 confidence interval by glue method is evenly spaced but underestimated especially in the low discharge section the increase of clm leads to sharp shrink of the band width while does not change the shape of upper and lower bounds a very large clm 0 99 leads to less coverage ratio of interval for the observed points the selection of clm is a trade off between coverage ratio versus band width of intervals 5 conclusions and suggestions in mcmc approach for uncertainty analysis of hydrological modeling residuals between model outputs and observations are commonly assumed to follow gaussian distribution with zero medium and constant standard deviation σ 2 how to identify and estimate parameter σ 2 is a weak point in previous studies in this work the statistical meaning of parameter σ 2 of gaussian type posterior probability distribution in mcmc method are systemically investigated some statistical interpretation and inferences of the parameter are presented to improve the performance of mcmc approach a new label clm is developed to guide the estimation of σ 2 the uncertainty of the hydrological simulation by a four parameter fdc model is assessed by means of mcmc method based on clm and the glue method is employed for comparison uncertainty analysis here is conducted concerning the posterior characteristics of model parameters discharges and confidence intervals a series of derivative conclusions are therefore achieved and major findings are summarized as follows 1 parameter σ is statistically related not only to the observation but also to model calibration σ is expressed as the product of data length n 1 and two standard deviations one of which is for observations i e σ obs and the other for nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nsce i e σ s a new label called confidence level of model clm is developed to interpret σ s the natural logarithm of the posterior probability for nsce could be expressed as a first order linear equation associated with clm which is practically demonstrated by a series of case studies about the posterior density of nsce 2 clm is a label representing the manually decided minimum of acceptable nsce clm is more meaningful and dynamic than ct used in glue it is a procedure oriented label used for shaping the target distribution it can be set as a probabilistic variable or a constant case studies reveal that clm remarkably affects the value of σ and the mcmc results it is recommended to identify the algorithmic parameter σ according to clm 3 different length of data leads to varied values of σ obs which however could be a more stable value through large amount of sampling 1000 times sampling is recommended and the median of σ obs should be employed increasing data length gains the stability of estimation of σ obs 4 the mcmc method based on clm performs well in generating regular posterior distributions of model parameters and discharges and in yielding narrow and symmetrical confidence intervals the estimation of clm is related to three kinds of trade offs including the one between macroscopic versus microcosmic requirements the one between accurate locating of maximum probability versus convergence to original target distribution and the one between coverage ratio versus band width of intervals findings in this paper could well interpret the problems commonly encountered in traditional bayesian uncertainty assessments and provide insights for uncertainty analysis of other environmental modeling nevertheless strict mathematical proof of eq 18 as well as the application of clm in more complex models is necessary it will be further studied in our future work credit authorship contribution statement pengfei shi conceptualization formal analysis investigation methodology

2463,water budgets and climate are related in many ways and at all scales therefore we expect climate change to trigger changes in all water budget components at any scale for central europe observed and projected climate change indicates higher variability of precipitation while evapotranspiration et should increase due to higher temperatures yielding lower and more variable infiltration and runoff however evidence in et records is limited as long term measurements of et are methodologically challenging and as factors other than climate are changing in parallel like vegetation and land use in this study we take advantage of long term hydro meteorological data from the small research catchment wernersbach 4 6 km2 dominated by norway spruce in operation since 1967 and from two eddy covariance ec flux towers all located in the tharandt forest germany the tower de tha is located a few kilometres east of the catchment is spruce dominated and in operation since 1996 after a wind break of a spruce stand situated inside the catchment and planting of deciduous oaks the tower de hzd was set up in 2009 for the first time we report systematically about observation correction methods and metadata of the long data series of the observatory represented by the wernersbach catchment and the ec flux towers climate change signals in the region are mirrored in the tharandt forest records they show rising air temperature with a breakpoint around 1988 and complex changes in solar radiation associated to a regional peak in air pollution around the same time the catchment and both towers did not show any systematic differences in climate or meteorological data allowing us to address observed changes in the water budget components as related to i climate change ii change in vegetation and iii different responses due to different soil and hydrogeological characteristics as well as methodological aspects the catchment term et plus storage derived from precipitation minus runoff showed the expected high variability with a significant increase over the more than 50 years of operation the flux tower de tha showed much lower inter annual variability in et with an average annual total of 486 mm 1997 to 2019 but no significant trend for the same period average catchment et was 734 mm yr the younger flux tower de hzd showed et values in between closer to catchment et at the very dry end of the ten year record 2010 to 2019 an analysis of decadal trends in a budyko framework at catchment level revealed the dominating response of et to land use or vegetation change until around 1990 the climate induced change of et increased in the last decades on the one hand directly due to an increased atmospheric demand on the other hand extreme weather events exerted harmful effects on vegetation especially triggered by two dry years at the end of the record furthermore we found that the mean annual tower et was about 250 mm lower than catchment et despite the careful correction for energy balance closure we attribute this difference to soil and to a lesser extend to vegetation characteristics but also to methodological uncertainties there is evidence from interception and transpiration measurements at the flux tower as well as from water budget modelling that a major contribution of this difference is related to an insufficient ec closure correction during interception events a careful consideration of rain events and evaporation from interception is recommended when addressing et of similar evergreen forests in a humid climate as ec records might be generally too low this illustrates the necessity of redundant and complementary measurements when dealing with large system complexity keywords catchment water budget eddy covariance forest evapotranspiration climate change land surface change icos data availability data are available under http www hydroshare org resource ca36686775a14c75bfe4ada5c51a98c5 1 introduction climate change and its possible effects on the water budget is of increasing concern among environmental scientists as well as among decision makers wwdr 2020 expected shifts towards higher temperatures higher evapotranspiration et and higher variability in precipitation ipcc 2014 would lead to lower and or more variable runoff and eventually lower groundwater recharge climate change thus threatens freshwater resources bates and kundzewicz 2008 however water and land management will often hide these effects especially for large catchments with many competing factors of influence bates and kundzewicz 2008 this adds to the general delay in catchment response to atmospheric drivers due to storage effects thus trends in discharge and et cannot be attributed to climate change alone as other effects influence the system response kundzewicz et al 2013 however for small catchments with an unchanged land cover and land management a warming climate should lead to an increase of et or at least a change of et we can understand from non climatic effects like forest management e g arbeitskreis kliwa et al 2018 therefore additional information on non climatic drivers of the water balance is crucial when we investigate catchment response to climate change the area of investigation is the tharandt forest a large 60 km2 managed forest dominated by spruce stands about 2 3 of the forest south west of dresden the capital of saxony germany the time period covered is 1968 to 2019 climate change is already remarkably evident in central europe a temperature increase of 1 5 k and a shift towards less frequent but more intense precipitation events are observed bates and kundzewicz 2008 ipcc 2014 increasing the risk of floods and droughts bernhofer et al 2006 in saxony this pattern is most pronounced in summer the start of the warming trend can be associated to a regional breakpoint around 1988 renner and bernhofer 2011 seasonally only fall contributed a bit less to this trend bernhofer et al 2015 regional and local changes in precipitation are always subject to uncertainty due to the large temporal and spatial variability of precipitation however a decrease of late spring precipitation apr may jun and an increase in late summer jul aug sep were observed consistently relative to 1961 1990 according to precipitation sums the occurrence and intensity of heavy precipitation decreased in late spring and increased in late summer a fact which might aggravate hydrological droughts in both seasons bernhofer et al 2015 at the end of the period under investigation a serious drought occurred 2018 19 20 with an accumulated deficit relative to normal conditions of around 400 mm throughout saxony this drought was driven by low precipitation and high air temperature leading to high vapour pressure deficit and high evaporative demand pluntke et al 2021 additionally the regional climate was affected by air pollution since the 1960 s large sulphur dioxide emissions from fossil fuel burning led to a high aerosol density in the upper troposphere reducing the global or solar radiation via scattering over most of europe and north america while this effect was reduced by filtering the emissions elsewhere in the early 1980 s leading to a global brightening philipona et al 2009 it continued in neighbouring parts of today s germany poland and czech republic the so called black triangle see e g kolář et al 2015 until the early 1990 please note that this regional brightening i shows a delay of about ten years relative to the global effect and ii was accelerated by the fast reductions of emissions at least in saxony in higher elevations of the black triangle a severe forest dieback occurred due to this heavy air pollution and the associated deposition this caused a reduction in forest cover and forest vitality between 1970 and 1990 with effects on the water budget discharge increased for most forested catchments in the area renner et al 2014 disentangled the typical land use land cover lulc changes from climate change to show these hydro climatological consequences for a large set of catchments in saxony after curbing the sulphur dioxide emissions in the early 1990 s and the following regrowth of the forest by 2010 forest conditions and catchment response had almost returned to conditions before 1960 other typical lulc changes in the area included water management of agricultural areas drainage of wet areas but also irrigation and changes in field size and cropping system due to the use of heavy machinery and the move to large agricultural units cooperatives even forested areas were often drained to improve growth after 1990 some of the monospecific spruce forests were managed towards a larger proportion of deciduous trees like beech or oak therefore we should expect complex responses of the hydrological system depending on the lulc and its management as well as depending on regional and global climate change this study focusses on the catchment wernersbach wb and two accompanying flux towers the wb catchment is a small forested research catchment dyck and peschke 1995 bernhofer 2002 2018 with a data record starting in 1967 this catchment was much less affected by the sulphur dioxide deposition than the forests close to the border of the czech republic this is due to the lower elevation lower wind speed and lower exposure to the emissions it is completely forested mostly by spruce since at least 100 years and no larger reservoirs or agricultural activities had been recorded such small experimental catchments with a single land use and long term monitoring climate hydrology management offer the chance to single out climate effects since 1996 an eddy covariance ec flux tower monitors energy water and carbon fluxes in the same area above an old managed forest dominated by spruce grünwald and bernhofer 2007 in the icos network alam et al 2019 the identifier is de tha which will be used also in this study 2009 10 additionally the flux tower hetzdorf de hzd went into operation this tower is within the catchment and collects flux data from a growing young oak forest after a wind break in 2007 ec based flux networks like fluxnet baldocchi et al 2001 icos or neon enlarged our understanding of the global carbon cycle fernández martínez et al 2017 petrescu et al 2015 but also provide insight into the terrestrial energy and water balance teuling et al 2010 yao et al 2016 including disturbances like droughts graf et al 2020 teuling et al 2013 only a few studies exist on co located catchments with appropriate measurements of precipitation and runoff and flux towers with ec based flux measurements of et like the pioneering comparison of catchment vs tower et by amiro and wuschke 1987 or the multi site study of teuling et al 2013 the only long term data set with some similarity we are aware of is the rietholzbach catchment seneviratne et al 2012 in the swiss alps however the rietholzbach catchment is grassed and a weighing lysimeter provides et comparisons for much shorter periods of three to five years were published graf et al 2014 kosugi and katsuyama 2007 and showed mostly good agreements of catchment and flux tower et for the catchment wb and the flux tower de tha frühauf et al 1999 found a good correspondence between both ets for the water budget year 1997 98 teuling et al 2013 deduced from the combination of wb and de tha and soil moisture estimates of the grace satellite that low precipitation and high et can occur simultaneously at catchment level as long as the storage component is sufficiently large the major research question of the study is whether a response of actual et to observed climate change can be identified to answer this question we have to test the data for consistency including a careful evaluation of the et monitoring techniques potential methodological bias of et and to sort out other factors like storage or land management this leads to the following objectives i to investigate the long term data of the catchment wb 52 years and the flux tower de tha 23 years for the dynamics in the water and energy budget components ii to analyse short term dynamics of et and storage and its contribution for the evolution of droughts iii to attribute et changes to land use and climate changes respectively and iv to check on the respective representativeness of the co located research sites wb and the ec flux towers de tha and de hzd 2 location measurements and methods 2 1 location 2 1 1 general information and geology the wb catchment is situated in the tharandt forest at the low elevations of the erzgebirge ore mountains in saxony germany fig 1 the small river or creek wb is a tributary of the river triebisch which itself drains into the river elbe in meissen the wb is about 3 km long and small tributaries are n bach etzenbach and triebenbach the catchment size is 4 6 km2 if not additionally specified information on the catchment refers to the complete wb watershed regardless of e g different runoff or infiltration characteristics within the catchment for a characterisation of the ec towers a reference area is assigned to each tower footprint according to mellmann et al 2003 kljun et al 2004 the footprint is not static but for simplicity we choose a typical daytime footprint according to ec measurement height and canopy structure as a result a fixed area is used within a 500 m radius around de tha and 130 m around de hzd tower geologically the catchment belongs to the ore mountains erzgebirge and consists of the volcanic rock palaeorhyolite which is strongly fissured in its upper zone palaeorhyolite weathers cohesively causing a cementation of the fissures cretaceous sandstones from the elbe valley deposited on top of the rhyolite but they can be found only in the peripheral areas of the catchment nowadays in the western part of wb these sandstones are tilted likely causing a groundwater flow to the adjacent catchment a reduction of the below surface catchment size by about 0 2 km2 is commonly assumed müller 1998 the topography is characterized by pronounced small scale heterogeneity with mainly gentle slopes 40 1 54 between 1 and 3 height above sea level ranges from 323 to 420 m mean 388 m 2 1 2 soil types spatial distribution of soil types is shown in fig 1 and some characteristics are summarized in table 1 information is based on the soil map 1 50 000 of the saxon state office for environment agriculture and geology crucial soil characteristics which determine the et dynamics are the skeletal fraction skv grain fraction 2 200 mm and the usable field capacity ufc of the soil profile at root level skv was averaged over the whole soil profile with a weighing according to layer depth dominant soil type in wb is norm brown earth which developed over rhyolite rocks according to world reference base for soil resources albeluvisols typically they have high infiltration rates the alluvial zones and some neighbouring areas are groundwater and backwater influenced there they changed to gley gleysols and pseudo gley soils stagnosols planosols gley soils are often saturated leading to fast direct runoff after precipitation events generally the soils in wb show a relative high water retention capacity mean ufc over all relevant soil types having at least a share of 10 is 210 mm see table 1 and low infiltration rates skv 21 vol at de tha the dominating soil types are norm brown earth and brown earth podsol which have high infiltration rates and norm pseudogley which is a backwater influenced soil with low infiltration rates overall infiltration is better but water retention capacity is worse than in wb which is reflected by a ufc of 127 mm and skv of 48 vol the dominant soil type in the footprint of the tower de hzd is slope pseudogley backwater influenced soil two soil types of de hzd are also common in wb the skv is slightly higher 26 vol and the ufc lower 169 mm than in wb 2 1 3 land cover and land use the main land cover in the wb catchment is coniferous forest according to data of the 1980 s norway spruce picea abies was dominating 35 in pure stands and 47 in mixed stands accompanied by 12 scots pine pinus sylvestris in mixed stands and a minor portion of deciduous and coniferous species forest management has changed throughout the period covered here three main clear cutting periods took place in 1965 1970 1978 1981 and 1985 1988 before clear cutting was practically abandoned in 2007 a larger area was subject to a severe wind storm damage after removing the spruce stems a deciduous stand was planted with two oak species quercus rubra quercus robur in 2008 as this offered the unique opportunity to study the effects of a disturbance a micrometeorological tower including ec was set up to monitor the dynamics at the regrowth site in 2010 de hzd the tree species distribution at wb and de tha has been very similar until today however the saxon forest management is slowly converting these forest stands from spruce dominated to mixed stands at this elevation the spruce forest at de tha was established by a special seeding technique called plätzesaat in 1887 that already uses seedlings instead of seeds further replanting took part in 1890 1891 and 1899 however a tree ring analysis of four spruce trees in september 2020 arrived at ages between 114 and 118 years which shows a small discrepancy to the official seeding date in the footprint of the ec tower the forest was composed of 87 coniferous and 13 deciduous trees in 1999 appendix a the understory consists mainly of fagus sylvatica 20 planted and deschampsia flexuosa 50 the young beeches had been introduced to mirror the typical forest management of saxony aiming at a more resilient species composition forest management at de tha also included thinning of the old stand 2002 2011 and 2016 recently white fir abies alba has been introduced as an additional species in the understorey appendix a gives an overview of the development of land cover over time of all three sites comparisons between inventories are hampered because only in 2013 non forested areas were quantified and understorey is not considered in each inventory the apparent increase in spruce in de tha from 2013 to 2019 and the decrease in deciduous trees originates from the latter issue in reality beech is growing as understorey here nevertheless trends towards more deciduous trees are recognizable at all three sites 2 1 4 climate and climate change in germany the climate is oceanic according to köppen geiger type cfb kottek et al 2006 cfb represents a warm temperate year round humid and summer warm climate the continental influence increases from nw to e saxony is consequently more continental at wb the mean temperature was 7 7 c grillenburg and the yearly precipitation sum corrected for wind loss was 921 mm yr 1968 2019 the driest month was april 2007 with 0 3 mm and the wettest month august 2002 with 397 mm the main part of the tharandt forest including wb is characterized by a gentle topography and a considerable variation in microclimate cold air pooling can lead to freezing temperatures close to the ground in any time of the year wind and precipitation are influenced as well by small scale orography there is a clear trend to higher temperatures in all seasons but no clear effect on annual precipitation however there is evidence for precipitation changes in saxony that differ between seasons hänsel et al 2009 the first part of the summer half year apr may jun shows reduced precipitation while the second part jul aug sep was slightly wetter this is in accordance with a positive trend of heavy precipitation schaller et al 2020 2 1 5 hydrologic characterisation the hydrological response of the wb catchment was associated to four hydrologically distinctive area types peschke et al 1999 i 16 are wet and saturated areas along the creeks which form direct flow ii 3 are areas with dominant hypodermic flow well connected to the creek which form direct and hypodermic flow iii 39 are backwater influenced areas with soils of low infiltration rates but high water retention barely connected to the creek and iv 42 are infiltration areas which form base flow a drainage system was created in the 1960 s to improve the site conditions for forest production the drainage system was serviced until 1990 only therefore over the past 30 years drainage should have slowly returned to smaller values decreasing runoff 2 2 measurements in december 1967 measurements started at the catchment wb while the flux towers were in full operation only by 1996 de tha and 2010 de hzd respectively all data meteorological hydrological and metadata are stored in an internal database of the chair of meteorology no initial harmonization was performed in case of instrumental changes overlapping observations are stored separately for this work daily data were prepared which includes checks on homogeneity homogenization and gap filling see below practically all time series consist of data with different equipment and site characteristics recent and historic instrumentation and further metadata are documented in appendix b as an example and as support in teaching a subset of the data is released in parallel to this paper see chapter 6 it consists of monthly hydro meteorological data of the period 1968 2019 and an exemplary daily dataset of the year 2017 of wb and the data of the two ec towers generally ec data are available via the european fluxes database cluster http www europe fluxdata eu the icos carbon portal https www icos cp eu and the global fluxnet initiative https fluxnet org e g the fluxnet2015 dataset was described in pastorello et al 2020 2 2 1 wernersbach catchment the wb catchment was established by hermann pleiβ first holder of the chair of meteorology at tu dresden for education and research within the former faculty of forestry between 1965 and 1967 the main outlet of the wb catchment is defined by a thompson weir with a 90 v notch and a width total height notch depth of 200 cm 90 cm 40 cm respectively bypass flow is blocked by a concrete wall across the valley floor perpendicular to the creek the weir defines the catchment size which was estimated to be 4 6 km2 discharge or runoff r is computed from water level mechanical recording and additionally with a pressure sensor since february 1992 at the weir using the rating curve water level discharge relationship as depicted in fig 2 observations were manually corrected in case of clogging or ice formation discharge measurements by a flow meter various propeller velocimeters ott or similar were performed regularly to establish the rating curve but thereafter additional measurements were done only on demand esp at high discharges later it was checked again on special occasions like after the summer floods in 1980 and in 2002 extreme floods transport considerable amounts of sediments in august 2002 the two upstream sections of the weir were filled with about 3 to 4 m3 of sediments along with the peak discharge in 2018 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the wb the complete weir including the concrete wall and the bypass channel were renovated an ultrasonic sensor to detect the water level and a second ultrasonic sensor for flow velocity were installed for a continuous recording of the water level discharge relationship by 2019 main power was available at the weir until 1990 it was re established in 2021 and allows a continuous sediment and water quality monitoring five hellmann precipitation p gauges 200 cm2 were installed in december 1967 in and close to wb see n1 through n6 in fig 1 in order to capture the spatial variation to reduce wind induced errors tretyakov shields were installed in 1974 recording rain gauges with higher temporal resolution were installed additionally in 1969 1972 siphoning recorders tipping bucket rain gauges in 1995 and a weighing gauge in 2003 daily values are collected from the hellmann gauges and temporally distributed according to the recorder values during post processing episodic re location of rain gauges became necessary due to growing trees in the vicinity to avoid shading effects typically parallel measurements at the old and the new site were performed for some period of time to check for consistency precipitation observations of hellmann gauges were corrected for the typical losses wetting and evaporation loss according to karbaum 1969 and wind induced loss according to richter 1995 as the types of rain gauges changed over time as well as site conditions and manual reading frequency were not always according to standards the corrections had to be adjusted these gauges were zinc coated until november 2002 and were replaced by stainless steel gauges later wetting loss for zinc coated hellmann rain gauges was corrected by adding 0 15 mm per precipitation event evaporation loss from the collecting vessel was corrected in spring and autumn 0 05 mm in winter 0 mm and in summer 0 1 mm per day for the period from the first precipitation event until the observation three times per week depending on the exact start of the rain event and the time of observation calculation is carried out with an accuracy of half a day if necessary half the surcharge is added before the installation of wind shields in february 1974 the tretyakov shields were tested against measurements at the forest clearing close to the ec tower de tha wa little need for additional correction was found therefore after the installation of wind shields no wind correction was applied for hellmann gauges from stainless steel in use since 2002 the total correction note here only wetting and evaporation loss is generally 5 5 this factor was determined from long term parallel observations at the chair of meteorology in tharandt in wintertime october through april between 1968 and 1988 and 1990 91 the hellmann gauges in wb were partly filled with brine to minimize losses due to evaporation and wetting snow detection improved as the concentrated solution melted the snow and the resulting water was less sensible to further wind loss a thin film of petroleum at the surface of the liquid reduced evaporation errors to arrive at precipitation the volume and density of the liquid were determined however results did not drastically improve despite the effort but gave a general picture of the associated bias areal precipitation for the whole catchment is calculated as the arithmetic mean of available reliable stations according to the careful judgement of trained personal from december 1967 until april 1990 stations n1 n5 were available until december 1992 n1 n6 until december 1999 n2 n3 n5 and n6 until october 2008 n1 n2 n3 n5 and n6 and since then n1 n5 temperature t observations are available for the complete period from the forest clearing wa part of de tha and from grillenburg gb both data series are complete gb is used for further analysis because it is very close to the catchment and almost standard conditions prevail wind speed ws is available from gb above grassland at wa from a 19 m tower until 1996 and at de tha at 33 m and 42 m both heights are above canopy none of the stations cover the complete period to get a consistent time series for wb is challenging because of different site characteristics and measuring heights the station with the most similar condition to the forested wb is de tha therefore the time series at 42 m was gap filled via a regression with the dwd station dresden klotzsche 1972 2019 remaining missing values were filled with mean daily values of a yearly cycle where a gaussian white noise was added relative humidity rh is observed at gb since 1968 but a gap of several years exists in the 1980 s and 1990 s the gap was filled using minimum temperature observations adapted magnus approach from murray 1967 the quality of this procedure is good as a cross validation shows with a coefficient of determination of r2 0 89 the sensor has a drift since 2010 i e 100 is never reached this typical error was corrected applying a de trending approach according to körner et al 2020 global radiation rg measurements at the top of the observation towers in de tha and at wa were used for consistency parallel measurements were performed with each new sensor or at the beginning of the operational measurements at the new tower when necessary observations were corrected and referenced to the current radiation sensor kipp zonen cnr1 cnr4 using linear regression models largest differences exist between first measurements at wa with an analogue recorder and manual analysis for daily and hourly values and the following digital records at de tha r2 0 95 at the flux tower de tha net radiation rn was measured by a schulze net radiometer dr lange germany short and longwave radiation were separated using a combination with a sonntag pyranometer lambrecht göttingen germany at de tha until 2007 since 2007 a four component net radiometer kipp zonen cnr1 cnr4 is used inconsistencies were found in a later analysis only to avoid misleading bias the record was adjusted to the recent data this procedure increased net radiation systematically before 2007 increasing the energy balance closure gap of the early years of de tha the closure corrected latent heat flux increased on dispense of a slightly increased uncertainty as the correction of rn is based on the assumption of constant site conditions groundwater level measurements were available from three sites in the catchment müller 1998 two sites are still in operation site 1 represents the conditions of the upper part of oberer wernersbach and reacts fast after precipitation events site 3 is situated at the ridge between triebenbach and wernersbach and is representative for a large groundwater storage leading to considerable damping of the surface signal soil water content was measured with a neutron probe s 23 at 13 sites in the catchment generally every 10 cm until a depth of 100 cm from 1970 to 2000 tensiometers were used additionally close to the tributary n bach between 1991 and 2001 today inside the catchment at de hzd four sites are probed regularly by fdr and tdr devices 2 2 2 measurements at the flux towers all surface energy budget components including net radiation soil heat flux storage related fluxes as well as turbulent heat fluxes are measured at two towers one within wb at the oak regrowth site de hzd the other one is the long term icos spruce site de tha close to the catchment sensible and latent heat momentum as well as water vapour h2o and carbon dioxide co2 fluxes are determined using the eddy covariance ec technique the flux tower at the spruce site was established for an investigation on forest decline in the early 1990 s the rising interest in the carbon balance of forests led to the euroflux project which established the first continent wide network of ec stations including tharandt valentini et al 2000 the ec measurements started in de tha in july 1996 establishing the longest continuous ec record of water and carbon exchange in germany the site de hzd was added in 2010 various additional information is available from

budget method et of wb can be determined as a residual of the water budget over a multi year integration time p minus r for shorter integration periods groundwater soil and snow storage cannot be neglected introducing a considerable challenge in the following we will refer to this term as catchment et to understand the short term dynamics of et and storage and its contribution for the evolution of droughts we applied an approach according to teuling et al 2013 it is based on the water balance of a catchment 1 p r d s e t with precipitation p net discharge or runoff r change in catchment water storage mainly by changes in soil moisture ds and evapotranspiration et all terms in eq 1 are mass flux densities in kgm 2s 1 or mm d 1 for convenient comparison with precipitation standards in terms of anomalies see teuling et al 2013 it can be written as 2 d s d s 0 p r e t d t where ds0 is an arbitrary integration constant from frühauf et al 1999 and hydrological reasoning we know that a balanced soil water status was typically reached in late winter or early spring march or april despite this we choose to use the hydrological year starting at november 1st for the purpose of better acceptance in the hydrological community climatological values of the water balance components i e mean monthly values of the period 1997 2019 were calculated and used for anomaly calculations 2 3 2 eddy covariance method at the flux towers the eddy covariance method yields direct measurements of the turbulent fluxes above canopy typical formulation for et is given as 3 et e c ρ a w q ρ a is air density w is vertical wind speed q stands for specific humidity denotes the deviation of the instantaneous value from the mean and the overbar the mean of a methodologically reasonable time period for mostly pragmatic reasons a frequency of 20 hz and a half hourly time period is commonly applied the method is the state of the art approach i e the new standard to measure turbulent energy and matter transport between the surface and atmosphere aubinet et al 1999 this is associated to the surface energy balance of an ideal site as shown in eq 4 4 rn g j a e h l e t on the left side of eq 4 rn stands for net radiation g for ground heat flux and j for the flux total due to storage changes between the measurement levels of net radiation and soil heat flux bernhofer et al 2003 the sum of values at the left side of eq 4 is often treated as available energy ae for the two turbulent fluxes at the right side sensible heat flux h and latent heat flux l et l is the heat of vaporization appr 2 5 mj kg 1 however uncertainties arise from heterogeneity in canopy structure or terrain limited fetch or by periods of insufficient turbulence falge et al 2001 also the sum of the turbulent fluxes often does not match the available energy which is called the energy balance closure gap foken 2008 panin and bernhofer 2008 therefore evapotranspiration from ec is smaller than the true et after correcting for energy balance closure mauder et al 2020 and proper gap filling reichstein et al 2005 uncertainties are considered stochastic in nature and within the range of 10 of the available energy however an additional systematic underestimation of et is associated to rain interception which is especially relevant in evergreen coniferous forests van dijk et al 2015 measurements during and after rainfall might show a systematic underestimation of et when the canopy and the instruments are both wet and the sensible flux is directed downward in this case both turbulent fluxes have different signs and the standard closure correction scheme is bound to fail at least in cases of low net radiation as in fall and winter this leads to a systematic underestimation an additional sizeable correction of annual et from eddy covariance might occur primarily for the spruce site fischer et al 2022 as catchment et could be used as true et a comparison to etec should consider this potential systematic difference 2 3 3 water budget related indicators as an indicator of the evaporative demand of the atmosphere we used the grass reference evapotranspiration e0 of the food and agricultural organization fao allen et al 1994 it utilises the penman monteith equation and is a common tool to estimate water demand of crops via scaling e0 by crop coefficients the climatic water balance cwb is often used as an indicator for the availability of water for runoff and infiltration cwb is defined as the difference between corrected p and e0 here alternative definitions exist e g p relative to e0 however the bias between the two approaches is small cwb is often used as drought or wetness indicator because it is related to the soil water status and therefore a well accepted indicator for the growing conditions of crops and forests 2 3 4 statistical tools main meteorological t p rg rh and ws and hydrological variables r and derived variables such as e0 and cwb are considered for the climatological and eco hydrological analysis the analysis is based on process understanding in climatology hydrology and ecology and is performed applying statistics mostly provided in r language packages as a commonly used check on long term variations linear trends of yearly sums or averages are tested for significance applying the mann kendall trend test kendall 1955 mann 1945 after the necessary check for autocorrelation a block bootstrapping has to be applied in case autocorrelation exists in this study no significant autocorrelation was found we term trends with a calculated p value of p 0 1 a tendency p values of p 0 05 are termed as significant trend in a linear regression model it is assumed besides linearity that the relationship does not change over time an approach to check the latter assumption is to test the cumulative sum of the ordinary least square residues which was developed by ploberger and krämer 1992 the so called ols cusum test and others was implemented in the r package strucchange zeileis et al 2002 linear and alternative thresholds levels depending on chosen significance level are derived from the test statistic whereby the alternative threshold is more appropriate if structural breaks are suspected at the beginning or the end of the time series an indication of a significant deviation from stationarity is the crossing of the cusum estimate with the threshold cusum is a standardised dimensionless quantity and is interpreted as follows a cusum line fluctuating around 0 would imply a temporal stationary process segments with upward slopes indicate above average conditions while downward slopes indicate below average conditions smooth or abrupt peaks indicate the time of a change in the mean due to the standardisation magnitude and time of changes are comparable between different series the shape of the cusum line is not sensitive to the selected time interval which allows for robust structural change testing 2 3 5 budyko framework to separate effects of climate and land use on et an attribution of changes in et to changes in land use and climate is performed according to renner et al 2014 the approach is based on budyko 1974 and tomer and schilling 2009 and allows to disentangle climate change effects on the catchment water balance from land use effects from the long term water balance et can be derived as the difference between p and r water storage can generally be ignored for long term considerations under the assumption that the available energy can be described by potential evapotranspiration e0 e0 composes the energy limit for et the diagram in fig 3 from renner et al 2014 describes two dimensionless measures water partitioning as q et p and energy partitioning f et e0 the line from the origin of the coordinate system through a point e g q0 f0 can be interpreted as an aridity index for the specific catchment a more humid catchment would lie on a line more to the left an et change caused by a pure land surface change manifests through a change of the position along the specific aridity line contrarily a change in the aridity index i e the climatic conditions manifests through perpendicular deviations from this line for example a climatic change towards more humid conditions would increase relative energy partitioning f while decreasing the relative water partitioning q an observed change in et from point q0 f0 to point q1 f1 can henceforth be separated into a land surface change part δetl etb et0 red arrow in fig 3 and a climate change part δetc et1 etb blue arrow following renner et al 2014 etb can be approximated by et b p 0 f 0 f 1 q 0 q 0 2 q 1 f 0 2 q 0 2 we also used the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi from the two modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer instruments to estimate the vegetation status independently within the area of wb and the flux towers the launch of the satellites 20 years ago limits the study period to 2002 2019 the data of the product myd13a3 version 6 are provided monthly at 1 km spatial resolution by nasa s earth observing system data and information system https lpdaac usgs gov monthly values of nine grid cells centred over the investigation area were used we used the median ndvi value of the months in the main growing period may till august for further analysis 3 results 3 1 time series analysis 3 1 1 dynamics of hydro climatological variables for a first climatological characterisation of wb and the flux towers means of three periods are shown in table 2 1969 1990 representing almost the reference climate without climate change 1991 2019 the first almost 30 yr period with greenhouse gas related increase in temperature 1k and 1997 2019 the period of parallel measurements at wb and de tha time series are visualized along with their linear trends in fig 4 all data refer to hydrological years november to october we start with the atmospheric control of et radiation temperature and wind speed and continue with precipitation runoff and et at catchment level and for the flux tower footprints global radiation shows a significant positive trend over the 50 years looking deeper a declining tendency until the 1980 s followed by a significant increasing trend becomes visible this is similar to global dimming and brightening wild 2005 however it is somewhat postponed by at least a decade compared to data from western europe a related change in temperature might exist but global warming and this regional effect are hard to separate the mean annual temperature from grillenburg has a significant positive trend of 0 4 c per decade mean temperature was 7 2 c in the period 1968 1990 and 8 2 c in 1991 2019 the increases occur in all seasons but are most pronounced in summer months the mean annual wind speed at 42 m at the forest site vegetation height changed from approx 24 m in 1970 to approximately 31 m in 2018 was 3 9 m s no additional statistic is given because the time series is not homogeneous as until 1990 data from a no longer existing smaller tower had to be used the precipitation totals are very similar for the six stations in wb and for the station at wa according to the analysis of the overlapping period from may 1980 until august 2010 maximum differences between the stations in wb are mostly around 10 mm but can reach up to 70 mm for single months however these differences are not significant and therefore primarily of random nature a slight altitudinal gradient in mean monthly precipitation sums exists with highest values at the upper stations n1 and n2 79 mm and the lowest value at the northerly situated lower station n4 72 mm this gradient of about 105 mm per 100 m height increment is more than the average for saxony about 70 mm per 100 m bernhofer et al 2008 the mean monthly catchment average of wb is 77 mm identical to wa which is part of de tha yearly precipitation sums slightly increased from 898 mm in 1969 1990 to 938 mm in 1991 2019 not significant whereby increases occurred in winter months and in july until 2017 the precipitation increase was larger recent dry years reduced it again runoff decreased tendentially between the periods 1969 1990 and 1991 2019 by about 18 or 50 mm yr within the year runoff was largest in march and april and lowest in september for 1968 1990 not shown here in the period 1991 2019 winter runoff increased due to increased precipitation and due to a decreasing contribution of snowfall and snowmelt a runoff peak in march and lower runoff in all successive months are contributing to a consistent picture with earlier snowmelt and may be an increase in et the main hydrological characteristic numbers in german hydrologische hauptzahlen of wb for the period 1968 2019 table 3 illustrate the broad range of runoff conditions especially occurring in recent years from minimum runoff of 0 1 l s in 2018 to maximum runoff of around 8000 l s during the most severe flood in 2002 from analysis of the hydrographs schwarze 2002 runoff components had been separated direct flow has a high share of total runoff 54 fast base flow from infiltration areas is 35 and slow base flow plays a minor role 11 isotope measurements proved that a large part of direct flow is water from the time before the flood event the water has a mean transit time of 38 years ranging between 8 and 650 years schwarze 2002 the catchment et estimate p r increased significantly fig 4 this is in accordance with significant trends of grass reference evapotranspiration e0 as well as of temperature and of global radiation over the complete period of 51 years however the closure gap corrected ec data of et at the tower de tha increased only slightly and statistically not significant for a broader picture ets from both flux towers are included in fig 4 while values of de tha are consistently lower than their catchment equivalents p r by about 250 mm de hzd seems to catch up with p r around 2014 when canopy closure was reached single annual values of p r cannot be interpreted directly but they would have to be corrected with annual water storage change to reproduce actual et this can be illustrated by two examples in the very wet year 2002 p r is 200 mm higher than e0 and in the very dry year 2003 p r is far below e0 in reality a large portion of p contributed to storages in 2002 and supported sustained et in dry 2003 we selected an accumulation time of five years as a compromise between largely reduced bias and sample size of the five years periods long term et from p r estimations are very close to e0 table 2 however grass reference e0 is reflecting well watered short grass and is not representing the maximum et of a forest stand which might allow even higher rates of et fig 4 includes cwb which is close to observed runoff r wet years 1980 1995 and 2002 result in higher and dry years 1976 2003 and 2018 in lower cwb than observed r due to storage effects dampening the catchment response precipitation is contributing to storage in wet years less is converted to r and vice versa for dry years the cusum analysis allows detecting structural changes in time significant changes are indicated if the curve crosses the horizontal line in fig 5 the alternative thresholds levels mentioned in chapter 2 3 4 form an eclipse they were omitted in the graph for the sake of clarity as here they provide no additional information compared to the linear threshold the p cusum series does not show a significant structural change but rather below average conditions in the early 1990 s then above average conditions until 2013 and finally a shift towards the dry years of 2018 and 2019 note that the graph in this analysis will always return to zero by the end of the period analysed t and rg series show significant structural changes below average conditions until 1990 s and above average conditions beginning in the late 1990 s this pattern of rg is typical for the regional effects of air pollution and resulting aerosols see black triangle in the chapter 1 t change shows the often observed breakpoint around 1988 renner and bernhofer 2011 associated with global warming due to the global increase of greenhouse gas concentrations and possibly the independent regional effect of changing aerosol concentration the cusum curve of r is very similar to p and is also not significant the cusum curve of e0 lower panel of fig 5 shows a very significant breakpoint and reflects the structural changes of t and rg input data for e0 this change of e0 might be more drastic than elsewhere as the global and the regional forcing are in line the structural change of p r actual et of the catchment including water storage changes is also significant despite the complex interplay between the strongly changing driving forces t and rg and the hydrologic response of the catchment r which also reflects storage and land use so climate change alone does not fully explain the observed changes in p r 3 1 2 analysis of et changes to separate effects of climate and land use renner et al 2014 applied a budyko framework on 68 catchments in saxony germany to determine the relative share of long term changes of climate change and land management on et here quantified as p r for this study the wb was added green star in fig 6 left panel the points and the star show the mean conditions of the decade 1970 1979 and the arrows indicate the changes to the average value of the next decade 1980 1989 most forested catchments in fig 6 show the effect of increasing sulphur dioxide emissions until 1990 which led to forest die back in elevated regions of saxony consequences were decreasing et between the 1960 s and the 1990 s whereby wb shows a similar tendency not significant the influence of other factors determining the water balance like forest management e g more frequent clear cuts until 1990 1992 and well operating drainage channels cannot be excluded only minor or no changes occurred in non forested basins the right panel of fig 6 zooms into the diagram et p and et eo for the range 0 6 0 9 to facilitate an analysis of wb it shows decadal changes whereby the centre of the decade is labelled besides the visualization of et changes in fig 6 absolute values and changes in percent relative to the previous period are given in table 4 there are always contributions of both land use and climate the reduction of et from the 1970 s to the 1980 s is more influenced by the land use or surface effects which is recognizable by the direction of the arrow namely mainly along the aridity index the reason for the reduction of et is not completely clear but air pollution from local sources and resulting damage of the forest or forest management clear cuts drainage may play a role the change from the 1980 s to the 1990 s shows an increase in et both surface effects and climate change are relevant the change towards the 2000 s is characterized by a continued increase of et 10 which is related to an increase in precipitation by 10 resulting in the wettest decade of the 50 year sample energy availability increased by only 1 henceforth the ratio et e0 rose considerably the framework suggests an increased vitality of the forest despite the disturbance due to the cyclone kyrill which caused significant windbreaks and needle losses in january 2007 spank 2010 the following vegetation period showed a minimum in ndvi as demonstrated by modis data for wb fig 7 nevertheless the forest was able to convert the increase in p into high et rates a pronounced change occurred from the 2000 s to the 2010 s a large increase in rg 17 and in t 0 2 k led to a strong increase in e0 25 while precipitation decreased compared to the 2000 s the aridity index e0 p shifted from 0 8 to more than 1 indicating semi arid conditions in the last decade the cwb p e0 shows a pronounced water deficit in the growing period april to august in the last decade fig 7 a summer water scarcity per se is normal but this severe deficit is unprecedented in the 50 year record without water stress the increase in e0 of 190 mm yr should lead to a similar increase in et however we find that et decreased by 57 mm yr 8 looking at the budyko framework in fig 6 we see a pronounced drop of the normalized ratio et e0 while the ratio of et p remained almost constant since both et and p decreased similarly hence climatic conditions and land use change appear to be equally contributing to that change visualized by the red and blue arrow in fig 6 however the vegetation changes were also related to meteorological conditions in this decade there was no drastic change in forest management excluding potentially still effective consequences of the no longer serviced drainage system but a series of disturbances affected the forest windstorms with windbreaks and needle losses in october 2017 herwart and january 2018 friederike followed by strong summer droughts and insect infestations bark beetle ips typographus in 2018 and 2019 as well as damage due to snow load in january 2019 benjamin the low ndvi in 2018 and 2019 reflect the impact of these events on the forest stands in the area fig 7 3 2 comparing et from catchment and flux towers one of our objectives was to clarify whether et measurements at de tha are representative for wb while earlier studies show a good resemblance frühauf et al 1999 this study shows a remarkable and persistent difference of around 250 mm yr fig 4 and table 2 despite of the practically identical climate and similar land cover the tower within wb de hzd had similarly low et values as de tha in the first years but annual values increased until the oak stand reached its canopy closure and showed et values in the same range as the catchment et by 2014 fig 8 compares seasonal et variations measured at both ec towers in the period 2015 2019 et at both ec sites is quite similar in winter and spring normally there is no water limitation because soil water storages are high or even saturated after snowmelt in winter the et increase in spring slows down at de tha and reaches its peak in june or july between 90and 110 mm month whereas the et maximum at de hzd is between 110and 140 mm month in july noteworthy is the persistently high evaporation until october at de hzd which is due to the larger water storage capacity of the soil in the very dry years 2018 and 2019 the summer maximum is reached one or two months earlier this is more pronounced at de tha and can be explained with soil and forest stand characteristics see appendix a at de tha winter losses by interception are higher evergreen forest compared to the deciduous forests at de hzd combined with the limited soil water storage at de tha this leads to an earlier transpiration reduction at de tha in dry years although the record of de hzd is still too short for a final judgement et of this flux tower is closer to et from wb at least for the most recent and unusually dry years potential reasons for the higher et are soil characteristics smaller interception losses and different stomatal regulation measurements of the soil water content not shown here at de tha show a much earlier drop in dry years than in wet years reflecting the limited soil water storage capacity thus the difference in et between the two flux towers is probably larger in dry years than in wetter years 3 3 storage analysis to gain a deeper insight into dynamics of the water balance elements of wb especially during dry years a water storage analysis similar to teuling et al 2013 was performed but instead of using et of de tha for the catchment we apply a simple approach to obtain plausible monthly et values for wb we assume that a the intra annual variation of et in wb can be derived from ec measurements allowing us to scale et from ec towers to fit the long term p r and b that the main reason responsible for et differences of the two sites besides methodological uncertainties are their soil characteristics discussion in chapter 4 2 therefore the oak regrowth site at de hzd with its similar soil can potentially serve as reference for wb a simple two step approach is proposed 1 the annual difference between catchment et including storage change and etec at de tha excluding storage change is added to the values of etec as the difference became smaller over the years mean annual differences for 5 year intervals were calculated and added 2 for a monthly partitioning of the added part weighting factors were determined that assure a congruence to de hzd for the period 2015 2019 the 12 weighting factors are 0 02 0 02 0 01 0 01 0 02 0 15 0 19 0 17 0 16 0 12 0 05 and 0 08 large factors from june until october assure that largest corrections are imprinted during summer and fall months according to the findings from fig 8 the corrected monthly et for wb is now used for the storage analysis long term averages of the water balance components of the period 1997 2019 are visualized in fig 9 a the graph is designed in such a way that bars above the x axis contribute to a storage increase and below the x axis to a storage decrease note negative signs of r and et for example high p sums in july which increase the storage face even higher et sums plus small r sums which reduce the storage the analysis is performed for water balance years starting in april assuming that soil is at its field capacity because of low et rates in winter and early spring and completed snow melt in early spring a typical seasonal cycle manifests with highest p and et in summer highest r in winter early spring and highest ds in winter cycles are clearly influenced by et beginning with april et rates increase strongly until july sums exceed precipitation causing a depletion of storage ds and low r values with the decline of et in autumn r increases and ds fills up again the uppermost plot shows the cumulative storage evolution throughout the year build up of a storage deficit until september followed by a stepwise reduction of the deficit until march three dry years 2003 2018 and 2019 were analysed using monthly anomalies which were calculated referring to long term averages fig 9b c and d the design of the graphs is similar 2003 is characterized by severe negative p anomalies from april to december causing negative r and et anomalies nearly throughout the whole year fig 9b a relief from the tense storage situation in january 2004 was not only caused by a p surplus 38 mm but also from reduced r 22 mm and et 1mm as a result of depleted soil water ds p r et 38 22 1 61 mm the water balance year 2018 started with a p surplus followed by negative anomalies until november fig 9c negative r anomalies started in may and lasted until december et showed positive anomalies until may as rg and t were high due to a persistent anticyclone over central europe later on increasing soil water deficit led to a drastic drop in et until january the storage deficit continued throughout the year and was reduced somewhat due to a p surplus in december and january please note in this analysis the deficit is not transferred to the next year the characteristics of 2019 were very similar to 2018 warm sunny and a less pronounced negative p anomaly thus et was higher than usual in the first three months beginning with july et was below average and accompanied by very low soil moisture r was extremely low throughout the year and again led to a large storage deficit in december the sums of the anomalies accumulated over the summer half year shy i e april september show that water balance components during dry conditions have changed between 2003 and 2019 table 5 p anomalies are comparable in 2003 and 2018 around 200 mm shy leading to an r anomaly of around 50 mm shy in both years but in 2018 the et anomaly is much more pronounced than in 2003 67 vs 27 mm shy in 2019 this trend continues although the p deficit is less 146 mm shy the r anomaly remains nearly constant 45 mm shy and interestingly the et anomaly is of the same magnitude as in 2018 to test for the influence of individual water budget components on the water storage all months of the summer half year of the period 1997 2019 were included fig 10 we found a clear dependency of storage anomalies to p anomalies r2 0 74 while no significant influence of r or corrected et anomalies could be detected r2 0 14 and 0 03 respectively the thesis of the teuling et al 2013 that months with below average rainfall tend to have above average et which acts to amplify the storage deficit is not supported by this dataset the increasing soil water deficit seems rather to reduce et during summer and fall in wb 4 discussion 4 1 factors contributing to the dynamics of water budget components the dynamics of the hydro meteorological variables show the expected combination of climate related forcing during the 50 years of operation like i natural climate variations ii global warming and iii regional climate specifics as exposure to certain weather patterns and effects of local air pollution despite this climate signal land surface changes were equally important such as changes due to forest management or forest damages the large natural climate variations are most obvious in the p series fig 5 the temporal variability being independent of the long term trends in t and rg global warming relates to a t increase starting around 1988 however the regional dimming between 1960 s and 1990 s and later the regional brightening starting in the late 1990 s similar to global dimming and brightening philipona et al 2009 was a special feature modulating the global climate signal regionally aerosols related to sulphur dioxide emissions from coal burning prolonged the dimming effect until 1997 compared to sites elsewhere in europe jones and moberg 2003 reference evapotranspiration e0 resembles the long term changes of t and rg a significant linear trend of e0 is in line with most catchments of europe teuling et al 2019 the breakpoint analysis revealed that the significant increase started around 2000 p r as an estimate for actual et of wb is significantly increasing linearly and a significant structural change was identified in early 1990 s according to renner and bernhofer 2011 saxon catchments above an altitude of 740 m showed a breakpoint in t and in the runoff ratio r p in 1988 probably due to a higher sensitivity of snow melt driven catchments this seems to hold also for wb despite the altitude of only around 400 m catchment response of actual et to changes in climate or land use may differ in their temporal response however both factors contribute to different degrees on a decadal time scale as the budyko framework analysis has shown interannual variability of p r reflects i the available buffer due to catchment water storage and ii the atmospheric drivers of et see teuling et al 2013 this favours high et in dry years as far as sufficient storage exists for consecutive dry years actual et of the second dry year declines regardless of the high e0 4 2 factors contributing to the lower et from the ec flux tower for 1997 to 2019 the catchment et estimate p r could be directly compared to the flux tower et generally the flux tower etec variation is low typically between 450and 500 mm yr extremes were recorded with 380 mm in 2003 and 600 mm in 2017 the catchment response p r varies from 430 to 950 mm yr no statistical relationship was found between both datasets in the following we look at possible reasons for the systematic differences between catchment and tower et namely differences in climatic conditions soil land cover and its management as well as at methodological aspects of the two methods to arrive at et 4 2 1 climate and site characteristics climatic differences between wb and de tha are small precipitation at de tha is 1 3 higher than at wb rg will be the same while slope and aspect will produce small differences in effective net radiation rn wind speed may be a bit lower for wb westphal 2007 overall neither of these factors nor their combination explain the observed differences in et the larger area of wb compared to the flux tower footprint as well as the location of the flux tower an infiltration site at a small plateau see fig 1 lead to higher heterogeneity of wb as well as to some bias in the site characteristics along the small tributaries of wernersbach n bach etzenbach and triebenbach groundwater influenced soils dominate where a riparian vegetation has prolonged access to water in dry periods these parts of the catchment will disproportionally contribute to et to address soil characteristics important data like usable field capacity ufc or skeletal share skv are listed in table 1 for wb de tha and de hzd soils in wb and at de hzd are capable to store more water in the soil column than soils at de tha high usable field capacity and have henceforth favourable conditions for et in other terms soils at de tha have better infiltration characteristics due to high skeletal fraction and probably due to preferential flow this is supported by the annual courses of etec fig 8 which show significantly lower et between july and october at de tha compared to de hzd associated to the limited soil water availability and the tighter control of stomatal opening at the coniferous stand de tha land cover and its management are additional characteristics to be addressed both sites wb and de tha were covered with 75 coniferous trees and around 20 deciduous trees in 2013 the forest stand in the footprint of de tha is about 40 years older and approximately 10 m higher lai was estimated to be 5 1 for wb 5 6 for de hzd in summer and 4 9 m2 m2 for de tha in 1999 wutzler 2002 despite lower transpiration rates per lai of older trees köstner 2001 even the combined effect of age and lai does not explain the difference in et of wb and de tha 4 2 2 uncertainty and bias of the different methods to derive et finally we need to address potential systematic differences in the methodologies applied to arrive at et values besides random uncertainties there are potential systematic effects that deserve attention the catchment water balance hydrological approach assumes that the mean water storage of a sufficiently long record becomes small enough to be ignored relative to mean et this is only true when the record is long enough typically 5 to 20 years and a few further assumptions are met i the precipitation measurements and their correction as well as the water level measurements and the rating curve are correct ii the complete runoff is recorded at the catchment outlet including groundwater contribution to r and iii the groundwater related catchment size is the same as the surface related size bias in runoff by undetected sub surface flow can be neglected as the concrete wall across the valley prevents any bypass at the weir see chapter 2 2 1 severe floods and instrument failure of the wb stream gauge need careful correction and gap filling respectively in those cases the missing runoff was added manually after a careful analysis of other gauges and indirect indicators of the water level or via modelling for the purpose of an uncertainty estimate let us assume that the uncertainty in r due to i and ii is small and its systematic effect for an average of 50 years is below 1 finally the subsurface catchment might be 0 2 km2 or 4 müller 1998 or even 0 4 km2 8 other local experts smaller than the surface catchment due to the underlying geology considering a subsurface catchment with a reduced area of 4 2 km2 would increase r and henceforth reduce p r values corresponding to systematically lower et to estimate this bias the following assessment was made using the mean contribution of slow groundwater flow of 11 to r schwarze 2002 and applying the reduced catchment size the maximum systematic effect of the sub surface size difference will be around 1 for r and only 0 3 relative to et most of the above effects are random for periods of five years or more besides the small catchment size effects in summary while catchment et has a very low time resolution with little random uncertainties also the maximum systematic bias of catchment et is small the estimate of the potential bias is well below 2 explaining only a marginal part of the difference between et values of wb and de tha uncertainties and bias in et from micrometeorological measurements via ec originate from general shortcomings of the technique and specifics related to water vapour flux ec is considered as the state of the art technique to record fluxes from all kind of surfaces with sufficient homogeneity in the footprint generally ec requires turbulent conditions which are often missing at low wind speeds and stable stratification data points half hourly fluxes with insufficient turbulence lead to low values of turbulent heat fluxes detected via ec ec typically fails to measure 100 of the fluxes balancing the available energy net radiation minus soil heat flux minus heat storage change some reasons of this closure gap had been identified but a consistent picture on this important issue is still only emerging mauder et al 2021 closure gap correction of et is done based on redistributing according to the bowen ratio of the uncorrected ec fluxes see e g falge et al 2001 pastorello et al 2020 however van dijk et al 2015 conclude that standard fluxnet correction approaches need to be reworked for the stable conditions after rainfall as interception under stable conditions with a negative sensible heat flux is a common process for evergreen needle leaf trees in humid temperate climates bernhofer et al 2003 we expect a considerable et underestimation at the spruce site de tha while providing a high temporal resolution uncertainties in flux tower et can be quite large and systematic a more precise estimate of this systematic bias for de tha is subject of the investigation by fischer et al 2022 while in the following we continue to evaluate its contribution relative to the observed et difference here the use of the residual et according to the energy balance ae h l cannot serve as an upper limit of et for periods of negative h actual et can be even larger than the measured residual nevertheless the mean residual et is about 650 mm and therefore much closer to the catchment et compare table 2 4 2 3 quantification of et differences as plausibility checks we used interception and transpiration measurements as well as simulations with a hydrological model fortunately various auxiliary measurements exist at de tha and many studies using data of de tha had been published since the start of the flux measurements in 1996 recently 25 years of site water budget measurements were analysed to arrive at interception grunicke et al 2020 they showed a mean annual below canopy precipitation of around 55 and henceforth interception losses of around 45 of p for the vegetation period between april and october 1997 2018 because of a remarkably higher lai at the location of the below canopy rainfall measurements compared to the lai of the flux tower footprint we applied a scaling factor of 0 8 according to the lai ratio this yields an interception of 36 and a below canopy precipitation of 64 of p sap flow measurements at the same site for the period 2001 2007 clausnitzer et al 2011 showed a 55 contribution of transpiration relative to below canopy precipitation applying these relationships to the period 2006 to 2019 leads to 583 mm of rainfall 210 mm of interception and 205 mm of transpiration for the vegetation period the sum of interception and transpiration of 415 mm is already close to the mean annual tower et of 497 mm any additional et in the november to march period and the annual sum of soil evaporation is not supported a conservative estimate soil evaporation and understorey et is 100 mm for the flux tower site while additional 30 mm is to be expected from winter transpiration for interception especially in the presence of snow we have no serious estimate but in mild winters interception might be high we assume here an interception loss of 24 of winter precipitation 357 mm which yields 86 mm adding up all et components results in 631 mm yr which is 134 mm yr more than the observed value of 497 mm yr for de tha in the period 2006 to 2019 without above mentioned lai scaling factor lai estimates over a longer period of time in larger areas are difficult we calculate 179 mm yr more therefore etec at de tha seems systematically too low by about 130 to 180 mm despite its correction for closure of the energy balance the water budget model brook90 federer 2021 is already widely used luong et al 2021 schwärzel et al 2009 to compute water balance components for the tharandt forest with a focus on et components a recent study vorobevskii et al 2022 highlights different data environments of brook90 local regional and global and the importance of parameterization and forcing there de tha was modelled for the period 1997 2020 three model set ups which were only parametrized and not calibrated simulate an et of around 650 mm yr compare fig 4 in vorobevskii et al 2022 in contrast the calibrated version according to etec simulates 480 mm yr the uncalibrated models simulate a mean interception of 27 whereas the calibrated models of only 8 compared to observations of 39 for the late 1990 s and 33 for the 2010 s grunicke et al 2020 scaled as mentioned above this clearly shows uncertainties in et partitioning especially for the calibrated version we argue that the difference of around 170 mm yr between calibrated and uncalibrated models is another hint for the significant underestimation of true et by ec measurements at de tha based on the above reasoning we speculate that the ec flux correction algorithm for the closure gap is insufficient for interception episodes when negative sensible fluxes boost interception related latent heat flux fischer et al 2022 this process is most obvious for daily totals during late fall and winter with almost zero net radiation nevertheless it is also relevant for short periods after rainfall in spring and summer resuming when tower et is corrected for the interception loss in etec of about 130 180 mm yr rough estimate for details see fischer et al 2022 we arrive at a tower et value of 630 to 680 mm the remaining difference of 40 to 85 mm is attributed to site conditions 4 3 did et change due to climate change as far as meteorological drivers are concerned significant positive trends were found for t and rg for the complete period 1968 to 2019 and the cusum analysis revealed significant breakpoints around 1988 and 1996 respectively global radiation decreased between 1960 s and 1990 s but returned to normal between around 1997 and roughly 2010 these changes led to a significant increase in e0 which are in line with other sites in europe e g teuling et al 2019 and which was also reported earlier for the trends in t p rg e0 and et in the complete elbe catchment teuling et al 2009 the catchment et at wb is significantly increasing despite the insignificant trends in p and r the reason cannot be attributed to climate alone it is rather a combination of changes in forest management more harvesting before 1992 thereafter managing the pure coniferous stands toward mixed or deciduous stands and by not servicing the drainage system in wb changes in the vegetation status and climate change by applying the analysis after renner et al 2014 for an assessment of the respective contribution of climate change vs land use change for the complete wb dataset until 2019 we could identify various phases in changes of et fig 11 the transition from the 1970 s to the 1980 s is characterized by a reduction of et exclusively caused by land surface changes namely damaged vegetation due to acid rain climatic contributions are always positive in the next decades due to the combination of global warming and regional brightening from the 1980 s to the 1990 s et increased significantly besides climatic influence due to healthier forest stands and altered management practices the step to the 2000 s is characterized by a further small increase in et which is mostly due to favourable climatic conditions the et change in the last decade the 2010 s is extraordinary despite increasingly favourable climatic conditions a drastic drop of 57 mm yr in et was observed see table 4 this decrease can only be explained by a reduction of et by changes in land cover since the available energy increased considerably in the last decade considering only the direct climatic impacts et would have increased according to the attribution method however land surface effects more than offset the climatic effects and led to a decline in et we presume that climatic variations lead to changes in the land surface reducing actual et the dry and hot years 2018 and 2019 caused direct drought damages and allowed an unprecedented bark beetle infestation furthermore heavy wind storm and snow load events damaged the tree crowns practically in all of saxony e g smul 2019 thus these extreme events have lasting effects on land use as their intensity and frequency is probably associated with climate change they may trigger feedbacks intensifying climate change applying an approach similar to teuling et al 2013 an analysis of the dynamics of and the interactions between the water balance components was performed and altered et characteristics during droughts were identified instead of using et from the ec tower de tha for wb we derived a more representative et estimate combining monthly catchment and tower et the dry years 2003 2018 and 2019 were analysed relative to the long term average in contrast to findings of teuling et al 2013 these extremely dry years did not show above average or average et teuling et al 2013 stated a drought paradox for wb and two other catchments in europe which means that p deficits are sometimes accompanied by high et rates amplifying water storage anomalies according to our analysis this drought paradox was only present at the beginning of the summer in the dry years 2018 and 2019 differences between our results and those of teuling et al 2013 result from a different data base teuling et al 2013 used et observations of the ec tower de tha directly until 2011 assuming tower et to be representative for the catchment wernersbach e g frühauf et al 1999 the current study is based on a combination of tower et and catchment et observations until 2019 the systematic underestimation of more than 200 mm yr at de tha was strongly reduced by combining both data sets applying et from de tha for wernersbach would result in a long term water storage of 255 mm yr for the period 1997 2019 p r etec 942 208 479 see table 2 the basic assumption of catchment et is that the difference between precipitation and runoff represents the actual et for periods long enough to reduce storage variations considerably small compared to other uncertainties then long term water storage is set to 0 mm yr considering this difference in long term storage explains the different results in et from teuling et al 2013 and this study the general higher level of storage in the work of teuling et al 2013 allows higher et values even during drought events which contributed to the drought paradox we think that tower et is too small despite the ec closure correction and the overall et is somewhat higher in wernersbach catchment due to soil characteristics during long lasting drought events the soil water supports et for some months later followed by et reductions as a consequence our necessary correction rescaling of et changes the magnitude and sometimes even sign of et anomalies therefore we arrive at different conclusions concerning et for typical dry years for the longer data set in fact et acts as a drought aggravating factor only when enough soil water and ground water is available which is generally the case in spring in summer et is considerably lower than average during drought events main driver of the storage dynamics is p runoff was reduced to the minimum of groundwater based discharge which is on average 11 of total r schwarze 2002 with a residence time of 38 years these runoff components are barely influenced by actual moisture conditions resulting in a relatively constant flow of old ground water the contribution of et to storage evolution differs between dry years as the seasonal rainfall distribution evaporative demand and antecedent soil moisture conditions differ as well a common drought pattern was not detected rather an intensification of et anomalies becomes apparent compare table 5 however the sample size is too small for a final judgement nevertheless there is no significant trend in etec at de tha but it is still possible that such tendencies will be found after correcting etec for interception effects on ec 5 conclusion actual evapotranspiration et land use climate and its change are non linearly coupled making simple cause response relationships hard to find however there is enough evidence for a set of well supported statements on the water budget of the tharandt forest as an example for other coniferous forests in a similar climate long data records are needed the more than 50 years record of the catchment wernersbach wb did show a significant positive trend in et but the almost 25 years et record of the flux tower de tha did not about five years of integration were applied to reduce the influence of water storage on et sufficiently for wb the flux tower et shows the hourly and daily dynamics on a monthly scale both observations were combined to yield plausible monthly et estimations for wb on the basis of this corrected and extended database for wb we showed that a decent amount of et is supported only in early summer of drought years drought paradox see teuling et al 2013 later in the year the depletion of soil water leads to a collapse of et a situation that has become increasingly common for wb in the last two decades the long term variability of hydro meteorological variables is clearly related to variability in regional climate but is compensated or enlarged by effects of land use and water management until the 1980 s land use effects most importantly forest stands damaged by acid rain dominated and led to decreasing et rates since the 1990 s both climate increasing atmospheric demand and land use improved management practices led to an increase of actual et in 2010 s climate induced damages of forest stands due to droughts storms snow load and bark beetle infestations counteracted and led to an overall drastic decrease of et in wb on average the systematic long term difference in actual et between wb and the nearby ec station de tha is large around 250 mm yr strictly speaking we conclude that et in the footprint of the flux tower de tha is not representative for wb we did not find any large systematic bias in long term et data from the catchment budget for the wb setup primarily different site characteristics and methodological shortcomings of ec contributed to this bias from plausibility checks based on additional measurements and modelling we found that the contribution of site characteristics explaining around 40 85 mm yr was smaller than the methodological bias explaining around 130 180 mm yr of the observed difference the paired set up of catchment and flux tower helped to identify potential systematic shortcomings of the standard ec closure correction scheme during and after rain events in contrast to low vegetation lysimeters are not a realistic option for a reference of et from tall mature forests a small forested catchment is a potential solution which is a striking argument for the paired catchment flux tower concept with redundant and complementing measurements of et there is a clear answer to the main question of this study concerning the impact of climate change on et at the tharandt forest while a direct positive influence on et exists via an increasing atmospheric demand and actual et is increasing generally as well there are also land use effects which are associated to climate change these indirect effects of climate extremes on forest stands such as droughts beetle infestations wind throws etc will have a lasting impact memory effect even when the climate alone returns to normal the last two years of the investigated period extremely dry and warm could be according to some regional climate projections a preview of future conditions further research should include simulations with physically based hydrological land surface models as well as a careful integration of land use water management changes in these models parameterisation and understanding will profit from highly resolved remote sensing information satellite and airborne finally excellent data records will still be needed improvements like a better ec flux tower correction included after all measurements will remain the benchmark for model performance they will be necessary to isolate and judge on existing changes and they should provide a robust reference for climate change projection of water balance components 6 data along with this paper we provide a freely available monthly hydro climatological dataset for the period 1968 2019 and an

2463,water budgets and climate are related in many ways and at all scales therefore we expect climate change to trigger changes in all water budget components at any scale for central europe observed and projected climate change indicates higher variability of precipitation while evapotranspiration et should increase due to higher temperatures yielding lower and more variable infiltration and runoff however evidence in et records is limited as long term measurements of et are methodologically challenging and as factors other than climate are changing in parallel like vegetation and land use in this study we take advantage of long term hydro meteorological data from the small research catchment wernersbach 4 6 km2 dominated by norway spruce in operation since 1967 and from two eddy covariance ec flux towers all located in the tharandt forest germany the tower de tha is located a few kilometres east of the catchment is spruce dominated and in operation since 1996 after a wind break of a spruce stand situated inside the catchment and planting of deciduous oaks the tower de hzd was set up in 2009 for the first time we report systematically about observation correction methods and metadata of the long data series of the observatory represented by the wernersbach catchment and the ec flux towers climate change signals in the region are mirrored in the tharandt forest records they show rising air temperature with a breakpoint around 1988 and complex changes in solar radiation associated to a regional peak in air pollution around the same time the catchment and both towers did not show any systematic differences in climate or meteorological data allowing us to address observed changes in the water budget components as related to i climate change ii change in vegetation and iii different responses due to different soil and hydrogeological characteristics as well as methodological aspects the catchment term et plus storage derived from precipitation minus runoff showed the expected high variability with a significant increase over the more than 50 years of operation the flux tower de tha showed much lower inter annual variability in et with an average annual total of 486 mm 1997 to 2019 but no significant trend for the same period average catchment et was 734 mm yr the younger flux tower de hzd showed et values in between closer to catchment et at the very dry end of the ten year record 2010 to 2019 an analysis of decadal trends in a budyko framework at catchment level revealed the dominating response of et to land use or vegetation change until around 1990 the climate induced change of et increased in the last decades on the one hand directly due to an increased atmospheric demand on the other hand extreme weather events exerted harmful effects on vegetation especially triggered by two dry years at the end of the record furthermore we found that the mean annual tower et was about 250 mm lower than catchment et despite the careful correction for energy balance closure we attribute this difference to soil and to a lesser extend to vegetation characteristics but also to methodological uncertainties there is evidence from interception and transpiration measurements at the flux tower as well as from water budget modelling that a major contribution of this difference is related to an insufficient ec closure correction during interception events a careful consideration of rain events and evaporation from interception is recommended when addressing et of similar evergreen forests in a humid climate as ec records might be generally too low this illustrates the necessity of redundant and complementary measurements when dealing with large system complexity keywords catchment water budget eddy covariance forest evapotranspiration climate change land surface change icos data availability data are available under http www hydroshare org resource ca36686775a14c75bfe4ada5c51a98c5 1 introduction climate change and its possible effects on the water budget is of increasing concern among environmental scientists as well as among decision makers wwdr 2020 expected shifts towards higher temperatures higher evapotranspiration et and higher variability in precipitation ipcc 2014 would lead to lower and or more variable runoff and eventually lower groundwater recharge climate change thus threatens freshwater resources bates and kundzewicz 2008 however water and land management will often hide these effects especially for large catchments with many competing factors of influence bates and kundzewicz 2008 this adds to the general delay in catchment response to atmospheric drivers due to storage effects thus trends in discharge and et cannot be attributed to climate change alone as other effects influence the system response kundzewicz et al 2013 however for small catchments with an unchanged land cover and land management a warming climate should lead to an increase of et or at least a change of et we can understand from non climatic effects like forest management e g arbeitskreis kliwa et al 2018 therefore additional information on non climatic drivers of the water balance is crucial when we investigate catchment response to climate change the area of investigation is the tharandt forest a large 60 km2 managed forest dominated by spruce stands about 2 3 of the forest south west of dresden the capital of saxony germany the time period covered is 1968 to 2019 climate change is already remarkably evident in central europe a temperature increase of 1 5 k and a shift towards less frequent but more intense precipitation events are observed bates and kundzewicz 2008 ipcc 2014 increasing the risk of floods and droughts bernhofer et al 2006 in saxony this pattern is most pronounced in summer the start of the warming trend can be associated to a regional breakpoint around 1988 renner and bernhofer 2011 seasonally only fall contributed a bit less to this trend bernhofer et al 2015 regional and local changes in precipitation are always subject to uncertainty due to the large temporal and spatial variability of precipitation however a decrease of late spring precipitation apr may jun and an increase in late summer jul aug sep were observed consistently relative to 1961 1990 according to precipitation sums the occurrence and intensity of heavy precipitation decreased in late spring and increased in late summer a fact which might aggravate hydrological droughts in both seasons bernhofer et al 2015 at the end of the period under investigation a serious drought occurred 2018 19 20 with an accumulated deficit relative to normal conditions of around 400 mm throughout saxony this drought was driven by low precipitation and high air temperature leading to high vapour pressure deficit and high evaporative demand pluntke et al 2021 additionally the regional climate was affected by air pollution since the 1960 s large sulphur dioxide emissions from fossil fuel burning led to a high aerosol density in the upper troposphere reducing the global or solar radiation via scattering over most of europe and north america while this effect was reduced by filtering the emissions elsewhere in the early 1980 s leading to a global brightening philipona et al 2009 it continued in neighbouring parts of today s germany poland and czech republic the so called black triangle see e g kolář et al 2015 until the early 1990 please note that this regional brightening i shows a delay of about ten years relative to the global effect and ii was accelerated by the fast reductions of emissions at least in saxony in higher elevations of the black triangle a severe forest dieback occurred due to this heavy air pollution and the associated deposition this caused a reduction in forest cover and forest vitality between 1970 and 1990 with effects on the water budget discharge increased for most forested catchments in the area renner et al 2014 disentangled the typical land use land cover lulc changes from climate change to show these hydro climatological consequences for a large set of catchments in saxony after curbing the sulphur dioxide emissions in the early 1990 s and the following regrowth of the forest by 2010 forest conditions and catchment response had almost returned to conditions before 1960 other typical lulc changes in the area included water management of agricultural areas drainage of wet areas but also irrigation and changes in field size and cropping system due to the use of heavy machinery and the move to large agricultural units cooperatives even forested areas were often drained to improve growth after 1990 some of the monospecific spruce forests were managed towards a larger proportion of deciduous trees like beech or oak therefore we should expect complex responses of the hydrological system depending on the lulc and its management as well as depending on regional and global climate change this study focusses on the catchment wernersbach wb and two accompanying flux towers the wb catchment is a small forested research catchment dyck and peschke 1995 bernhofer 2002 2018 with a data record starting in 1967 this catchment was much less affected by the sulphur dioxide deposition than the forests close to the border of the czech republic this is due to the lower elevation lower wind speed and lower exposure to the emissions it is completely forested mostly by spruce since at least 100 years and no larger reservoirs or agricultural activities had been recorded such small experimental catchments with a single land use and long term monitoring climate hydrology management offer the chance to single out climate effects since 1996 an eddy covariance ec flux tower monitors energy water and carbon fluxes in the same area above an old managed forest dominated by spruce grünwald and bernhofer 2007 in the icos network alam et al 2019 the identifier is de tha which will be used also in this study 2009 10 additionally the flux tower hetzdorf de hzd went into operation this tower is within the catchment and collects flux data from a growing young oak forest after a wind break in 2007 ec based flux networks like fluxnet baldocchi et al 2001 icos or neon enlarged our understanding of the global carbon cycle fernández martínez et al 2017 petrescu et al 2015 but also provide insight into the terrestrial energy and water balance teuling et al 2010 yao et al 2016 including disturbances like droughts graf et al 2020 teuling et al 2013 only a few studies exist on co located catchments with appropriate measurements of precipitation and runoff and flux towers with ec based flux measurements of et like the pioneering comparison of catchment vs tower et by amiro and wuschke 1987 or the multi site study of teuling et al 2013 the only long term data set with some similarity we are aware of is the rietholzbach catchment seneviratne et al 2012 in the swiss alps however the rietholzbach catchment is grassed and a weighing lysimeter provides et comparisons for much shorter periods of three to five years were published graf et al 2014 kosugi and katsuyama 2007 and showed mostly good agreements of catchment and flux tower et for the catchment wb and the flux tower de tha frühauf et al 1999 found a good correspondence between both ets for the water budget year 1997 98 teuling et al 2013 deduced from the combination of wb and de tha and soil moisture estimates of the grace satellite that low precipitation and high et can occur simultaneously at catchment level as long as the storage component is sufficiently large the major research question of the study is whether a response of actual et to observed climate change can be identified to answer this question we have to test the data for consistency including a careful evaluation of the et monitoring techniques potential methodological bias of et and to sort out other factors like storage or land management this leads to the following objectives i to investigate the long term data of the catchment wb 52 years and the flux tower de tha 23 years for the dynamics in the water and energy budget components ii to analyse short term dynamics of et and storage and its contribution for the evolution of droughts iii to attribute et changes to land use and climate changes respectively and iv to check on the respective representativeness of the co located research sites wb and the ec flux towers de tha and de hzd 2 location measurements and methods 2 1 location 2 1 1 general information and geology the wb catchment is situated in the tharandt forest at the low elevations of the erzgebirge ore mountains in saxony germany fig 1 the small river or creek wb is a tributary of the river triebisch which itself drains into the river elbe in meissen the wb is about 3 km long and small tributaries are n bach etzenbach and triebenbach the catchment size is 4 6 km2 if not additionally specified information on the catchment refers to the complete wb watershed regardless of e g different runoff or infiltration characteristics within the catchment for a characterisation of the ec towers a reference area is assigned to each tower footprint according to mellmann et al 2003 kljun et al 2004 the footprint is not static but for simplicity we choose a typical daytime footprint according to ec measurement height and canopy structure as a result a fixed area is used within a 500 m radius around de tha and 130 m around de hzd tower geologically the catchment belongs to the ore mountains erzgebirge and consists of the volcanic rock palaeorhyolite which is strongly fissured in its upper zone palaeorhyolite weathers cohesively causing a cementation of the fissures cretaceous sandstones from the elbe valley deposited on top of the rhyolite but they can be found only in the peripheral areas of the catchment nowadays in the western part of wb these sandstones are tilted likely causing a groundwater flow to the adjacent catchment a reduction of the below surface catchment size by about 0 2 km2 is commonly assumed müller 1998 the topography is characterized by pronounced small scale heterogeneity with mainly gentle slopes 40 1 54 between 1 and 3 height above sea level ranges from 323 to 420 m mean 388 m 2 1 2 soil types spatial distribution of soil types is shown in fig 1 and some characteristics are summarized in table 1 information is based on the soil map 1 50 000 of the saxon state office for environment agriculture and geology crucial soil characteristics which determine the et dynamics are the skeletal fraction skv grain fraction 2 200 mm and the usable field capacity ufc of the soil profile at root level skv was averaged over the whole soil profile with a weighing according to layer depth dominant soil type in wb is norm brown earth which developed over rhyolite rocks according to world reference base for soil resources albeluvisols typically they have high infiltration rates the alluvial zones and some neighbouring areas are groundwater and backwater influenced there they changed to gley gleysols and pseudo gley soils stagnosols planosols gley soils are often saturated leading to fast direct runoff after precipitation events generally the soils in wb show a relative high water retention capacity mean ufc over all relevant soil types having at least a share of 10 is 210 mm see table 1 and low infiltration rates skv 21 vol at de tha the dominating soil types are norm brown earth and brown earth podsol which have high infiltration rates and norm pseudogley which is a backwater influenced soil with low infiltration rates overall infiltration is better but water retention capacity is worse than in wb which is reflected by a ufc of 127 mm and skv of 48 vol the dominant soil type in the footprint of the tower de hzd is slope pseudogley backwater influenced soil two soil types of de hzd are also common in wb the skv is slightly higher 26 vol and the ufc lower 169 mm than in wb 2 1 3 land cover and land use the main land cover in the wb catchment is coniferous forest according to data of the 1980 s norway spruce picea abies was dominating 35 in pure stands and 47 in mixed stands accompanied by 12 scots pine pinus sylvestris in mixed stands and a minor portion of deciduous and coniferous species forest management has changed throughout the period covered here three main clear cutting periods took place in 1965 1970 1978 1981 and 1985 1988 before clear cutting was practically abandoned in 2007 a larger area was subject to a severe wind storm damage after removing the spruce stems a deciduous stand was planted with two oak species quercus rubra quercus robur in 2008 as this offered the unique opportunity to study the effects of a disturbance a micrometeorological tower including ec was set up to monitor the dynamics at the regrowth site in 2010 de hzd the tree species distribution at wb and de tha has been very similar until today however the saxon forest management is slowly converting these forest stands from spruce dominated to mixed stands at this elevation the spruce forest at de tha was established by a special seeding technique called plätzesaat in 1887 that already uses seedlings instead of seeds further replanting took part in 1890 1891 and 1899 however a tree ring analysis of four spruce trees in september 2020 arrived at ages between 114 and 118 years which shows a small discrepancy to the official seeding date in the footprint of the ec tower the forest was composed of 87 coniferous and 13 deciduous trees in 1999 appendix a the understory consists mainly of fagus sylvatica 20 planted and deschampsia flexuosa 50 the young beeches had been introduced to mirror the typical forest management of saxony aiming at a more resilient species composition forest management at de tha also included thinning of the old stand 2002 2011 and 2016 recently white fir abies alba has been introduced as an additional species in the understorey appendix a gives an overview of the development of land cover over time of all three sites comparisons between inventories are hampered because only in 2013 non forested areas were quantified and understorey is not considered in each inventory the apparent increase in spruce in de tha from 2013 to 2019 and the decrease in deciduous trees originates from the latter issue in reality beech is growing as understorey here nevertheless trends towards more deciduous trees are recognizable at all three sites 2 1 4 climate and climate change in germany the climate is oceanic according to köppen geiger type cfb kottek et al 2006 cfb represents a warm temperate year round humid and summer warm climate the continental influence increases from nw to e saxony is consequently more continental at wb the mean temperature was 7 7 c grillenburg and the yearly precipitation sum corrected for wind loss was 921 mm yr 1968 2019 the driest month was april 2007 with 0 3 mm and the wettest month august 2002 with 397 mm the main part of the tharandt forest including wb is characterized by a gentle topography and a considerable variation in microclimate cold air pooling can lead to freezing temperatures close to the ground in any time of the year wind and precipitation are influenced as well by small scale orography there is a clear trend to higher temperatures in all seasons but no clear effect on annual precipitation however there is evidence for precipitation changes in saxony that differ between seasons hänsel et al 2009 the first part of the summer half year apr may jun shows reduced precipitation while the second part jul aug sep was slightly wetter this is in accordance with a positive trend of heavy precipitation schaller et al 2020 2 1 5 hydrologic characterisation the hydrological response of the wb catchment was associated to four hydrologically distinctive area types peschke et al 1999 i 16 are wet and saturated areas along the creeks which form direct flow ii 3 are areas with dominant hypodermic flow well connected to the creek which form direct and hypodermic flow iii 39 are backwater influenced areas with soils of low infiltration rates but high water retention barely connected to the creek and iv 42 are infiltration areas which form base flow a drainage system was created in the 1960 s to improve the site conditions for forest production the drainage system was serviced until 1990 only therefore over the past 30 years drainage should have slowly returned to smaller values decreasing runoff 2 2 measurements in december 1967 measurements started at the catchment wb while the flux towers were in full operation only by 1996 de tha and 2010 de hzd respectively all data meteorological hydrological and metadata are stored in an internal database of the chair of meteorology no initial harmonization was performed in case of instrumental changes overlapping observations are stored separately for this work daily data were prepared which includes checks on homogeneity homogenization and gap filling see below practically all time series consist of data with different equipment and site characteristics recent and historic instrumentation and further metadata are documented in appendix b as an example and as support in teaching a subset of the data is released in parallel to this paper see chapter 6 it consists of monthly hydro meteorological data of the period 1968 2019 and an exemplary daily dataset of the year 2017 of wb and the data of the two ec towers generally ec data are available via the european fluxes database cluster http www europe fluxdata eu the icos carbon portal https www icos cp eu and the global fluxnet initiative https fluxnet org e g the fluxnet2015 dataset was described in pastorello et al 2020 2 2 1 wernersbach catchment the wb catchment was established by hermann pleiβ first holder of the chair of meteorology at tu dresden for education and research within the former faculty of forestry between 1965 and 1967 the main outlet of the wb catchment is defined by a thompson weir with a 90 v notch and a width total height notch depth of 200 cm 90 cm 40 cm respectively bypass flow is blocked by a concrete wall across the valley floor perpendicular to the creek the weir defines the catchment size which was estimated to be 4 6 km2 discharge or runoff r is computed from water level mechanical recording and additionally with a pressure sensor since february 1992 at the weir using the rating curve water level discharge relationship as depicted in fig 2 observations were manually corrected in case of clogging or ice formation discharge measurements by a flow meter various propeller velocimeters ott or similar were performed regularly to establish the rating curve but thereafter additional measurements were done only on demand esp at high discharges later it was checked again on special occasions like after the summer floods in 1980 and in 2002 extreme floods transport considerable amounts of sediments in august 2002 the two upstream sections of the weir were filled with about 3 to 4 m3 of sediments along with the peak discharge in 2018 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the wb the complete weir including the concrete wall and the bypass channel were renovated an ultrasonic sensor to detect the water level and a second ultrasonic sensor for flow velocity were installed for a continuous recording of the water level discharge relationship by 2019 main power was available at the weir until 1990 it was re established in 2021 and allows a continuous sediment and water quality monitoring five hellmann precipitation p gauges 200 cm2 were installed in december 1967 in and close to wb see n1 through n6 in fig 1 in order to capture the spatial variation to reduce wind induced errors tretyakov shields were installed in 1974 recording rain gauges with higher temporal resolution were installed additionally in 1969 1972 siphoning recorders tipping bucket rain gauges in 1995 and a weighing gauge in 2003 daily values are collected from the hellmann gauges and temporally distributed according to the recorder values during post processing episodic re location of rain gauges became necessary due to growing trees in the vicinity to avoid shading effects typically parallel measurements at the old and the new site were performed for some period of time to check for consistency precipitation observations of hellmann gauges were corrected for the typical losses wetting and evaporation loss according to karbaum 1969 and wind induced loss according to richter 1995 as the types of rain gauges changed over time as well as site conditions and manual reading frequency were not always according to standards the corrections had to be adjusted these gauges were zinc coated until november 2002 and were replaced by stainless steel gauges later wetting loss for zinc coated hellmann rain gauges was corrected by adding 0 15 mm per precipitation event evaporation loss from the collecting vessel was corrected in spring and autumn 0 05 mm in winter 0 mm and in summer 0 1 mm per day for the period from the first precipitation event until the observation three times per week depending on the exact start of the rain event and the time of observation calculation is carried out with an accuracy of half a day if necessary half the surcharge is added before the installation of wind shields in february 1974 the tretyakov shields were tested against measurements at the forest clearing close to the ec tower de tha wa little need for additional correction was found therefore after the installation of wind shields no wind correction was applied for hellmann gauges from stainless steel in use since 2002 the total correction note here only wetting and evaporation loss is generally 5 5 this factor was determined from long term parallel observations at the chair of meteorology in tharandt in wintertime october through april between 1968 and 1988 and 1990 91 the hellmann gauges in wb were partly filled with brine to minimize losses due to evaporation and wetting snow detection improved as the concentrated solution melted the snow and the resulting water was less sensible to further wind loss a thin film of petroleum at the surface of the liquid reduced evaporation errors to arrive at precipitation the volume and density of the liquid were determined however results did not drastically improve despite the effort but gave a general picture of the associated bias areal precipitation for the whole catchment is calculated as the arithmetic mean of available reliable stations according to the careful judgement of trained personal from december 1967 until april 1990 stations n1 n5 were available until december 1992 n1 n6 until december 1999 n2 n3 n5 and n6 until october 2008 n1 n2 n3 n5 and n6 and since then n1 n5 temperature t observations are available for the complete period from the forest clearing wa part of de tha and from grillenburg gb both data series are complete gb is used for further analysis because it is very close to the catchment and almost standard conditions prevail wind speed ws is available from gb above grassland at wa from a 19 m tower until 1996 and at de tha at 33 m and 42 m both heights are above canopy none of the stations cover the complete period to get a consistent time series for wb is challenging because of different site characteristics and measuring heights the station with the most similar condition to the forested wb is de tha therefore the time series at 42 m was gap filled via a regression with the dwd station dresden klotzsche 1972 2019 remaining missing values were filled with mean daily values of a yearly cycle where a gaussian white noise was added relative humidity rh is observed at gb since 1968 but a gap of several years exists in the 1980 s and 1990 s the gap was filled using minimum temperature observations adapted magnus approach from murray 1967 the quality of this procedure is good as a cross validation shows with a coefficient of determination of r2 0 89 the sensor has a drift since 2010 i e 100 is never reached this typical error was corrected applying a de trending approach according to körner et al 2020 global radiation rg measurements at the top of the observation towers in de tha and at wa were used for consistency parallel measurements were performed with each new sensor or at the beginning of the operational measurements at the new tower when necessary observations were corrected and referenced to the current radiation sensor kipp zonen cnr1 cnr4 using linear regression models largest differences exist between first measurements at wa with an analogue recorder and manual analysis for daily and hourly values and the following digital records at de tha r2 0 95 at the flux tower de tha net radiation rn was measured by a schulze net radiometer dr lange germany short and longwave radiation were separated using a combination with a sonntag pyranometer lambrecht göttingen germany at de tha until 2007 since 2007 a four component net radiometer kipp zonen cnr1 cnr4 is used inconsistencies were found in a later analysis only to avoid misleading bias the record was adjusted to the recent data this procedure increased net radiation systematically before 2007 increasing the energy balance closure gap of the early years of de tha the closure corrected latent heat flux increased on dispense of a slightly increased uncertainty as the correction of rn is based on the assumption of constant site conditions groundwater level measurements were available from three sites in the catchment müller 1998 two sites are still in operation site 1 represents the conditions of the upper part of oberer wernersbach and reacts fast after precipitation events site 3 is situated at the ridge between triebenbach and wernersbach and is representative for a large groundwater storage leading to considerable damping of the surface signal soil water content was measured with a neutron probe s 23 at 13 sites in the catchment generally every 10 cm until a depth of 100 cm from 1970 to 2000 tensiometers were used additionally close to the tributary n bach between 1991 and 2001 today inside the catchment at de hzd four sites are probed regularly by fdr and tdr devices 2 2 2 measurements at the flux towers all surface energy budget components including net radiation soil heat flux storage related fluxes as well as turbulent heat fluxes are measured at two towers one within wb at the oak regrowth site de hzd the other one is the long term icos spruce site de tha close to the catchment sensible and latent heat momentum as well as water vapour h2o and carbon dioxide co2 fluxes are determined using the eddy covariance ec technique the flux tower at the spruce site was established for an investigation on forest decline in the early 1990 s the rising interest in the carbon balance of forests led to the euroflux project which established the first continent wide network of ec stations including tharandt valentini et al 2000 the ec measurements started in de tha in july 1996 establishing the longest continuous ec record of water and carbon exchange in germany the site de hzd was added in 2010 various additional information is available from

budget method et of wb can be determined as a residual of the water budget over a multi year integration time p minus r for shorter integration periods groundwater soil and snow storage cannot be neglected introducing a considerable challenge in the following we will refer to this term as catchment et to understand the short term dynamics of et and storage and its contribution for the evolution of droughts we applied an approach according to teuling et al 2013 it is based on the water balance of a catchment 1 p r d s e t with precipitation p net discharge or runoff r change in catchment water storage mainly by changes in soil moisture ds and evapotranspiration et all terms in eq 1 are mass flux densities in kgm 2s 1 or mm d 1 for convenient comparison with precipitation standards in terms of anomalies see teuling et al 2013 it can be written as 2 d s d s 0 p r e t d t where ds0 is an arbitrary integration constant from frühauf et al 1999 and hydrological reasoning we know that a balanced soil water status was typically reached in late winter or early spring march or april despite this we choose to use the hydrological year starting at november 1st for the purpose of better acceptance in the hydrological community climatological values of the water balance components i e mean monthly values of the period 1997 2019 were calculated and used for anomaly calculations 2 3 2 eddy covariance method at the flux towers the eddy covariance method yields direct measurements of the turbulent fluxes above canopy typical formulation for et is given as 3 et e c ρ a w q ρ a is air density w is vertical wind speed q stands for specific humidity denotes the deviation of the instantaneous value from the mean and the overbar the mean of a methodologically reasonable time period for mostly pragmatic reasons a frequency of 20 hz and a half hourly time period is commonly applied the method is the state of the art approach i e the new standard to measure turbulent energy and matter transport between the surface and atmosphere aubinet et al 1999 this is associated to the surface energy balance of an ideal site as shown in eq 4 4 rn g j a e h l e t on the left side of eq 4 rn stands for net radiation g for ground heat flux and j for the flux total due to storage changes between the measurement levels of net radiation and soil heat flux bernhofer et al 2003 the sum of values at the left side of eq 4 is often treated as available energy ae for the two turbulent fluxes at the right side sensible heat flux h and latent heat flux l et l is the heat of vaporization appr 2 5 mj kg 1 however uncertainties arise from heterogeneity in canopy structure or terrain limited fetch or by periods of insufficient turbulence falge et al 2001 also the sum of the turbulent fluxes often does not match the available energy which is called the energy balance closure gap foken 2008 panin and bernhofer 2008 therefore evapotranspiration from ec is smaller than the true et after correcting for energy balance closure mauder et al 2020 and proper gap filling reichstein et al 2005 uncertainties are considered stochastic in nature and within the range of 10 of the available energy however an additional systematic underestimation of et is associated to rain interception which is especially relevant in evergreen coniferous forests van dijk et al 2015 measurements during and after rainfall might show a systematic underestimation of et when the canopy and the instruments are both wet and the sensible flux is directed downward in this case both turbulent fluxes have different signs and the standard closure correction scheme is bound to fail at least in cases of low net radiation as in fall and winter this leads to a systematic underestimation an additional sizeable correction of annual et from eddy covariance might occur primarily for the spruce site fischer et al 2022 as catchment et could be used as true et a comparison to etec should consider this potential systematic difference 2 3 3 water budget related indicators as an indicator of the evaporative demand of the atmosphere we used the grass reference evapotranspiration e0 of the food and agricultural organization fao allen et al 1994 it utilises the penman monteith equation and is a common tool to estimate water demand of crops via scaling e0 by crop coefficients the climatic water balance cwb is often used as an indicator for the availability of water for runoff and infiltration cwb is defined as the difference between corrected p and e0 here alternative definitions exist e g p relative to e0 however the bias between the two approaches is small cwb is often used as drought or wetness indicator because it is related to the soil water status and therefore a well accepted indicator for the growing conditions of crops and forests 2 3 4 statistical tools main meteorological t p rg rh and ws and hydrological variables r and derived variables such as e0 and cwb are considered for the climatological and eco hydrological analysis the analysis is based on process understanding in climatology hydrology and ecology and is performed applying statistics mostly provided in r language packages as a commonly used check on long term variations linear trends of yearly sums or averages are tested for significance applying the mann kendall trend test kendall 1955 mann 1945 after the necessary check for autocorrelation a block bootstrapping has to be applied in case autocorrelation exists in this study no significant autocorrelation was found we term trends with a calculated p value of p 0 1 a tendency p values of p 0 05 are termed as significant trend in a linear regression model it is assumed besides linearity that the relationship does not change over time an approach to check the latter assumption is to test the cumulative sum of the ordinary least square residues which was developed by ploberger and krämer 1992 the so called ols cusum test and others was implemented in the r package strucchange zeileis et al 2002 linear and alternative thresholds levels depending on chosen significance level are derived from the test statistic whereby the alternative threshold is more appropriate if structural breaks are suspected at the beginning or the end of the time series an indication of a significant deviation from stationarity is the crossing of the cusum estimate with the threshold cusum is a standardised dimensionless quantity and is interpreted as follows a cusum line fluctuating around 0 would imply a temporal stationary process segments with upward slopes indicate above average conditions while downward slopes indicate below average conditions smooth or abrupt peaks indicate the time of a change in the mean due to the standardisation magnitude and time of changes are comparable between different series the shape of the cusum line is not sensitive to the selected time interval which allows for robust structural change testing 2 3 5 budyko framework to separate effects of climate and land use on et an attribution of changes in et to changes in land use and climate is performed according to renner et al 2014 the approach is based on budyko 1974 and tomer and schilling 2009 and allows to disentangle climate change effects on the catchment water balance from land use effects from the long term water balance et can be derived as the difference between p and r water storage can generally be ignored for long term considerations under the assumption that the available energy can be described by potential evapotranspiration e0 e0 composes the energy limit for et the diagram in fig 3 from renner et al 2014 describes two dimensionless measures water partitioning as q et p and energy partitioning f et e0 the line from the origin of the coordinate system through a point e g q0 f0 can be interpreted as an aridity index for the specific catchment a more humid catchment would lie on a line more to the left an et change caused by a pure land surface change manifests through a change of the position along the specific aridity line contrarily a change in the aridity index i e the climatic conditions manifests through perpendicular deviations from this line for example a climatic change towards more humid conditions would increase relative energy partitioning f while decreasing the relative water partitioning q an observed change in et from point q0 f0 to point q1 f1 can henceforth be separated into a land surface change part δetl etb et0 red arrow in fig 3 and a climate change part δetc et1 etb blue arrow following renner et al 2014 etb can be approximated by et b p 0 f 0 f 1 q 0 q 0 2 q 1 f 0 2 q 0 2 we also used the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi from the two modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer instruments to estimate the vegetation status independently within the area of wb and the flux towers the launch of the satellites 20 years ago limits the study period to 2002 2019 the data of the product myd13a3 version 6 are provided monthly at 1 km spatial resolution by nasa s earth observing system data and information system https lpdaac usgs gov monthly values of nine grid cells centred over the investigation area were used we used the median ndvi value of the months in the main growing period may till august for further analysis 3 results 3 1 time series analysis 3 1 1 dynamics of hydro climatological variables for a first climatological characterisation of wb and the flux towers means of three periods are shown in table 2 1969 1990 representing almost the reference climate without climate change 1991 2019 the first almost 30 yr period with greenhouse gas related increase in temperature 1k and 1997 2019 the period of parallel measurements at wb and de tha time series are visualized along with their linear trends in fig 4 all data refer to hydrological years november to october we start with the atmospheric control of et radiation temperature and wind speed and continue with precipitation runoff and et at catchment level and for the flux tower footprints global radiation shows a significant positive trend over the 50 years looking deeper a declining tendency until the 1980 s followed by a significant increasing trend becomes visible this is similar to global dimming and brightening wild 2005 however it is somewhat postponed by at least a decade compared to data from western europe a related change in temperature might exist but global warming and this regional effect are hard to separate the mean annual temperature from grillenburg has a significant positive trend of 0 4 c per decade mean temperature was 7 2 c in the period 1968 1990 and 8 2 c in 1991 2019 the increases occur in all seasons but are most pronounced in summer months the mean annual wind speed at 42 m at the forest site vegetation height changed from approx 24 m in 1970 to approximately 31 m in 2018 was 3 9 m s no additional statistic is given because the time series is not homogeneous as until 1990 data from a no longer existing smaller tower had to be used the precipitation totals are very similar for the six stations in wb and for the station at wa according to the analysis of the overlapping period from may 1980 until august 2010 maximum differences between the stations in wb are mostly around 10 mm but can reach up to 70 mm for single months however these differences are not significant and therefore primarily of random nature a slight altitudinal gradient in mean monthly precipitation sums exists with highest values at the upper stations n1 and n2 79 mm and the lowest value at the northerly situated lower station n4 72 mm this gradient of about 105 mm per 100 m height increment is more than the average for saxony about 70 mm per 100 m bernhofer et al 2008 the mean monthly catchment average of wb is 77 mm identical to wa which is part of de tha yearly precipitation sums slightly increased from 898 mm in 1969 1990 to 938 mm in 1991 2019 not significant whereby increases occurred in winter months and in july until 2017 the precipitation increase was larger recent dry years reduced it again runoff decreased tendentially between the periods 1969 1990 and 1991 2019 by about 18 or 50 mm yr within the year runoff was largest in march and april and lowest in september for 1968 1990 not shown here in the period 1991 2019 winter runoff increased due to increased precipitation and due to a decreasing contribution of snowfall and snowmelt a runoff peak in march and lower runoff in all successive months are contributing to a consistent picture with earlier snowmelt and may be an increase in et the main hydrological characteristic numbers in german hydrologische hauptzahlen of wb for the period 1968 2019 table 3 illustrate the broad range of runoff conditions especially occurring in recent years from minimum runoff of 0 1 l s in 2018 to maximum runoff of around 8000 l s during the most severe flood in 2002 from analysis of the hydrographs schwarze 2002 runoff components had been separated direct flow has a high share of total runoff 54 fast base flow from infiltration areas is 35 and slow base flow plays a minor role 11 isotope measurements proved that a large part of direct flow is water from the time before the flood event the water has a mean transit time of 38 years ranging between 8 and 650 years schwarze 2002 the catchment et estimate p r increased significantly fig 4 this is in accordance with significant trends of grass reference evapotranspiration e0 as well as of temperature and of global radiation over the complete period of 51 years however the closure gap corrected ec data of et at the tower de tha increased only slightly and statistically not significant for a broader picture ets from both flux towers are included in fig 4 while values of de tha are consistently lower than their catchment equivalents p r by about 250 mm de hzd seems to catch up with p r around 2014 when canopy closure was reached single annual values of p r cannot be interpreted directly but they would have to be corrected with annual water storage change to reproduce actual et this can be illustrated by two examples in the very wet year 2002 p r is 200 mm higher than e0 and in the very dry year 2003 p r is far below e0 in reality a large portion of p contributed to storages in 2002 and supported sustained et in dry 2003 we selected an accumulation time of five years as a compromise between largely reduced bias and sample size of the five years periods long term et from p r estimations are very close to e0 table 2 however grass reference e0 is reflecting well watered short grass and is not representing the maximum et of a forest stand which might allow even higher rates of et fig 4 includes cwb which is close to observed runoff r wet years 1980 1995 and 2002 result in higher and dry years 1976 2003 and 2018 in lower cwb than observed r due to storage effects dampening the catchment response precipitation is contributing to storage in wet years less is converted to r and vice versa for dry years the cusum analysis allows detecting structural changes in time significant changes are indicated if the curve crosses the horizontal line in fig 5 the alternative thresholds levels mentioned in chapter 2 3 4 form an eclipse they were omitted in the graph for the sake of clarity as here they provide no additional information compared to the linear threshold the p cusum series does not show a significant structural change but rather below average conditions in the early 1990 s then above average conditions until 2013 and finally a shift towards the dry years of 2018 and 2019 note that the graph in this analysis will always return to zero by the end of the period analysed t and rg series show significant structural changes below average conditions until 1990 s and above average conditions beginning in the late 1990 s this pattern of rg is typical for the regional effects of air pollution and resulting aerosols see black triangle in the chapter 1 t change shows the often observed breakpoint around 1988 renner and bernhofer 2011 associated with global warming due to the global increase of greenhouse gas concentrations and possibly the independent regional effect of changing aerosol concentration the cusum curve of r is very similar to p and is also not significant the cusum curve of e0 lower panel of fig 5 shows a very significant breakpoint and reflects the structural changes of t and rg input data for e0 this change of e0 might be more drastic than elsewhere as the global and the regional forcing are in line the structural change of p r actual et of the catchment including water storage changes is also significant despite the complex interplay between the strongly changing driving forces t and rg and the hydrologic response of the catchment r which also reflects storage and land use so climate change alone does not fully explain the observed changes in p r 3 1 2 analysis of et changes to separate effects of climate and land use renner et al 2014 applied a budyko framework on 68 catchments in saxony germany to determine the relative share of long term changes of climate change and land management on et here quantified as p r for this study the wb was added green star in fig 6 left panel the points and the star show the mean conditions of the decade 1970 1979 and the arrows indicate the changes to the average value of the next decade 1980 1989 most forested catchments in fig 6 show the effect of increasing sulphur dioxide emissions until 1990 which led to forest die back in elevated regions of saxony consequences were decreasing et between the 1960 s and the 1990 s whereby wb shows a similar tendency not significant the influence of other factors determining the water balance like forest management e g more frequent clear cuts until 1990 1992 and well operating drainage channels cannot be excluded only minor or no changes occurred in non forested basins the right panel of fig 6 zooms into the diagram et p and et eo for the range 0 6 0 9 to facilitate an analysis of wb it shows decadal changes whereby the centre of the decade is labelled besides the visualization of et changes in fig 6 absolute values and changes in percent relative to the previous period are given in table 4 there are always contributions of both land use and climate the reduction of et from the 1970 s to the 1980 s is more influenced by the land use or surface effects which is recognizable by the direction of the arrow namely mainly along the aridity index the reason for the reduction of et is not completely clear but air pollution from local sources and resulting damage of the forest or forest management clear cuts drainage may play a role the change from the 1980 s to the 1990 s shows an increase in et both surface effects and climate change are relevant the change towards the 2000 s is characterized by a continued increase of et 10 which is related to an increase in precipitation by 10 resulting in the wettest decade of the 50 year sample energy availability increased by only 1 henceforth the ratio et e0 rose considerably the framework suggests an increased vitality of the forest despite the disturbance due to the cyclone kyrill which caused significant windbreaks and needle losses in january 2007 spank 2010 the following vegetation period showed a minimum in ndvi as demonstrated by modis data for wb fig 7 nevertheless the forest was able to convert the increase in p into high et rates a pronounced change occurred from the 2000 s to the 2010 s a large increase in rg 17 and in t 0 2 k led to a strong increase in e0 25 while precipitation decreased compared to the 2000 s the aridity index e0 p shifted from 0 8 to more than 1 indicating semi arid conditions in the last decade the cwb p e0 shows a pronounced water deficit in the growing period april to august in the last decade fig 7 a summer water scarcity per se is normal but this severe deficit is unprecedented in the 50 year record without water stress the increase in e0 of 190 mm yr should lead to a similar increase in et however we find that et decreased by 57 mm yr 8 looking at the budyko framework in fig 6 we see a pronounced drop of the normalized ratio et e0 while the ratio of et p remained almost constant since both et and p decreased similarly hence climatic conditions and land use change appear to be equally contributing to that change visualized by the red and blue arrow in fig 6 however the vegetation changes were also related to meteorological conditions in this decade there was no drastic change in forest management excluding potentially still effective consequences of the no longer serviced drainage system but a series of disturbances affected the forest windstorms with windbreaks and needle losses in october 2017 herwart and january 2018 friederike followed by strong summer droughts and insect infestations bark beetle ips typographus in 2018 and 2019 as well as damage due to snow load in january 2019 benjamin the low ndvi in 2018 and 2019 reflect the impact of these events on the forest stands in the area fig 7 3 2 comparing et from catchment and flux towers one of our objectives was to clarify whether et measurements at de tha are representative for wb while earlier studies show a good resemblance frühauf et al 1999 this study shows a remarkable and persistent difference of around 250 mm yr fig 4 and table 2 despite of the practically identical climate and similar land cover the tower within wb de hzd had similarly low et values as de tha in the first years but annual values increased until the oak stand reached its canopy closure and showed et values in the same range as the catchment et by 2014 fig 8 compares seasonal et variations measured at both ec towers in the period 2015 2019 et at both ec sites is quite similar in winter and spring normally there is no water limitation because soil water storages are high or even saturated after snowmelt in winter the et increase in spring slows down at de tha and reaches its peak in june or july between 90and 110 mm month whereas the et maximum at de hzd is between 110and 140 mm month in july noteworthy is the persistently high evaporation until october at de hzd which is due to the larger water storage capacity of the soil in the very dry years 2018 and 2019 the summer maximum is reached one or two months earlier this is more pronounced at de tha and can be explained with soil and forest stand characteristics see appendix a at de tha winter losses by interception are higher evergreen forest compared to the deciduous forests at de hzd combined with the limited soil water storage at de tha this leads to an earlier transpiration reduction at de tha in dry years although the record of de hzd is still too short for a final judgement et of this flux tower is closer to et from wb at least for the most recent and unusually dry years potential reasons for the higher et are soil characteristics smaller interception losses and different stomatal regulation measurements of the soil water content not shown here at de tha show a much earlier drop in dry years than in wet years reflecting the limited soil water storage capacity thus the difference in et between the two flux towers is probably larger in dry years than in wetter years 3 3 storage analysis to gain a deeper insight into dynamics of the water balance elements of wb especially during dry years a water storage analysis similar to teuling et al 2013 was performed but instead of using et of de tha for the catchment we apply a simple approach to obtain plausible monthly et values for wb we assume that a the intra annual variation of et in wb can be derived from ec measurements allowing us to scale et from ec towers to fit the long term p r and b that the main reason responsible for et differences of the two sites besides methodological uncertainties are their soil characteristics discussion in chapter 4 2 therefore the oak regrowth site at de hzd with its similar soil can potentially serve as reference for wb a simple two step approach is proposed 1 the annual difference between catchment et including storage change and etec at de tha excluding storage change is added to the values of etec as the difference became smaller over the years mean annual differences for 5 year intervals were calculated and added 2 for a monthly partitioning of the added part weighting factors were determined that assure a congruence to de hzd for the period 2015 2019 the 12 weighting factors are 0 02 0 02 0 01 0 01 0 02 0 15 0 19 0 17 0 16 0 12 0 05 and 0 08 large factors from june until october assure that largest corrections are imprinted during summer and fall months according to the findings from fig 8 the corrected monthly et for wb is now used for the storage analysis long term averages of the water balance components of the period 1997 2019 are visualized in fig 9 a the graph is designed in such a way that bars above the x axis contribute to a storage increase and below the x axis to a storage decrease note negative signs of r and et for example high p sums in july which increase the storage face even higher et sums plus small r sums which reduce the storage the analysis is performed for water balance years starting in april assuming that soil is at its field capacity because of low et rates in winter and early spring and completed snow melt in early spring a typical seasonal cycle manifests with highest p and et in summer highest r in winter early spring and highest ds in winter cycles are clearly influenced by et beginning with april et rates increase strongly until july sums exceed precipitation causing a depletion of storage ds and low r values with the decline of et in autumn r increases and ds fills up again the uppermost plot shows the cumulative storage evolution throughout the year build up of a storage deficit until september followed by a stepwise reduction of the deficit until march three dry years 2003 2018 and 2019 were analysed using monthly anomalies which were calculated referring to long term averages fig 9b c and d the design of the graphs is similar 2003 is characterized by severe negative p anomalies from april to december causing negative r and et anomalies nearly throughout the whole year fig 9b a relief from the tense storage situation in january 2004 was not only caused by a p surplus 38 mm but also from reduced r 22 mm and et 1mm as a result of depleted soil water ds p r et 38 22 1 61 mm the water balance year 2018 started with a p surplus followed by negative anomalies until november fig 9c negative r anomalies started in may and lasted until december et showed positive anomalies until may as rg and t were high due to a persistent anticyclone over central europe later on increasing soil water deficit led to a drastic drop in et until january the storage deficit continued throughout the year and was reduced somewhat due to a p surplus in december and january please note in this analysis the deficit is not transferred to the next year the characteristics of 2019 were very similar to 2018 warm sunny and a less pronounced negative p anomaly thus et was higher than usual in the first three months beginning with july et was below average and accompanied by very low soil moisture r was extremely low throughout the year and again led to a large storage deficit in december the sums of the anomalies accumulated over the summer half year shy i e april september show that water balance components during dry conditions have changed between 2003 and 2019 table 5 p anomalies are comparable in 2003 and 2018 around 200 mm shy leading to an r anomaly of around 50 mm shy in both years but in 2018 the et anomaly is much more pronounced than in 2003 67 vs 27 mm shy in 2019 this trend continues although the p deficit is less 146 mm shy the r anomaly remains nearly constant 45 mm shy and interestingly the et anomaly is of the same magnitude as in 2018 to test for the influence of individual water budget components on the water storage all months of the summer half year of the period 1997 2019 were included fig 10 we found a clear dependency of storage anomalies to p anomalies r2 0 74 while no significant influence of r or corrected et anomalies could be detected r2 0 14 and 0 03 respectively the thesis of the teuling et al 2013 that months with below average rainfall tend to have above average et which acts to amplify the storage deficit is not supported by this dataset the increasing soil water deficit seems rather to reduce et during summer and fall in wb 4 discussion 4 1 factors contributing to the dynamics of water budget components the dynamics of the hydro meteorological variables show the expected combination of climate related forcing during the 50 years of operation like i natural climate variations ii global warming and iii regional climate specifics as exposure to certain weather patterns and effects of local air pollution despite this climate signal land surface changes were equally important such as changes due to forest management or forest damages the large natural climate variations are most obvious in the p series fig 5 the temporal variability being independent of the long term trends in t and rg global warming relates to a t increase starting around 1988 however the regional dimming between 1960 s and 1990 s and later the regional brightening starting in the late 1990 s similar to global dimming and brightening philipona et al 2009 was a special feature modulating the global climate signal regionally aerosols related to sulphur dioxide emissions from coal burning prolonged the dimming effect until 1997 compared to sites elsewhere in europe jones and moberg 2003 reference evapotranspiration e0 resembles the long term changes of t and rg a significant linear trend of e0 is in line with most catchments of europe teuling et al 2019 the breakpoint analysis revealed that the significant increase started around 2000 p r as an estimate for actual et of wb is significantly increasing linearly and a significant structural change was identified in early 1990 s according to renner and bernhofer 2011 saxon catchments above an altitude of 740 m showed a breakpoint in t and in the runoff ratio r p in 1988 probably due to a higher sensitivity of snow melt driven catchments this seems to hold also for wb despite the altitude of only around 400 m catchment response of actual et to changes in climate or land use may differ in their temporal response however both factors contribute to different degrees on a decadal time scale as the budyko framework analysis has shown interannual variability of p r reflects i the available buffer due to catchment water storage and ii the atmospheric drivers of et see teuling et al 2013 this favours high et in dry years as far as sufficient storage exists for consecutive dry years actual et of the second dry year declines regardless of the high e0 4 2 factors contributing to the lower et from the ec flux tower for 1997 to 2019 the catchment et estimate p r could be directly compared to the flux tower et generally the flux tower etec variation is low typically between 450and 500 mm yr extremes were recorded with 380 mm in 2003 and 600 mm in 2017 the catchment response p r varies from 430 to 950 mm yr no statistical relationship was found between both datasets in the following we look at possible reasons for the systematic differences between catchment and tower et namely differences in climatic conditions soil land cover and its management as well as at methodological aspects of the two methods to arrive at et 4 2 1 climate and site characteristics climatic differences between wb and de tha are small precipitation at de tha is 1 3 higher than at wb rg will be the same while slope and aspect will produce small differences in effective net radiation rn wind speed may be a bit lower for wb westphal 2007 overall neither of these factors nor their combination explain the observed differences in et the larger area of wb compared to the flux tower footprint as well as the location of the flux tower an infiltration site at a small plateau see fig 1 lead to higher heterogeneity of wb as well as to some bias in the site characteristics along the small tributaries of wernersbach n bach etzenbach and triebenbach groundwater influenced soils dominate where a riparian vegetation has prolonged access to water in dry periods these parts of the catchment will disproportionally contribute to et to address soil characteristics important data like usable field capacity ufc or skeletal share skv are listed in table 1 for wb de tha and de hzd soils in wb and at de hzd are capable to store more water in the soil column than soils at de tha high usable field capacity and have henceforth favourable conditions for et in other terms soils at de tha have better infiltration characteristics due to high skeletal fraction and probably due to preferential flow this is supported by the annual courses of etec fig 8 which show significantly lower et between july and october at de tha compared to de hzd associated to the limited soil water availability and the tighter control of stomatal opening at the coniferous stand de tha land cover and its management are additional characteristics to be addressed both sites wb and de tha were covered with 75 coniferous trees and around 20 deciduous trees in 2013 the forest stand in the footprint of de tha is about 40 years older and approximately 10 m higher lai was estimated to be 5 1 for wb 5 6 for de hzd in summer and 4 9 m2 m2 for de tha in 1999 wutzler 2002 despite lower transpiration rates per lai of older trees köstner 2001 even the combined effect of age and lai does not explain the difference in et of wb and de tha 4 2 2 uncertainty and bias of the different methods to derive et finally we need to address potential systematic differences in the methodologies applied to arrive at et values besides random uncertainties there are potential systematic effects that deserve attention the catchment water balance hydrological approach assumes that the mean water storage of a sufficiently long record becomes small enough to be ignored relative to mean et this is only true when the record is long enough typically 5 to 20 years and a few further assumptions are met i the precipitation measurements and their correction as well as the water level measurements and the rating curve are correct ii the complete runoff is recorded at the catchment outlet including groundwater contribution to r and iii the groundwater related catchment size is the same as the surface related size bias in runoff by undetected sub surface flow can be neglected as the concrete wall across the valley prevents any bypass at the weir see chapter 2 2 1 severe floods and instrument failure of the wb stream gauge need careful correction and gap filling respectively in those cases the missing runoff was added manually after a careful analysis of other gauges and indirect indicators of the water level or via modelling for the purpose of an uncertainty estimate let us assume that the uncertainty in r due to i and ii is small and its systematic effect for an average of 50 years is below 1 finally the subsurface catchment might be 0 2 km2 or 4 müller 1998 or even 0 4 km2 8 other local experts smaller than the surface catchment due to the underlying geology considering a subsurface catchment with a reduced area of 4 2 km2 would increase r and henceforth reduce p r values corresponding to systematically lower et to estimate this bias the following assessment was made using the mean contribution of slow groundwater flow of 11 to r schwarze 2002 and applying the reduced catchment size the maximum systematic effect of the sub surface size difference will be around 1 for r and only 0 3 relative to et most of the above effects are random for periods of five years or more besides the small catchment size effects in summary while catchment et has a very low time resolution with little random uncertainties also the maximum systematic bias of catchment et is small the estimate of the potential bias is well below 2 explaining only a marginal part of the difference between et values of wb and de tha uncertainties and bias in et from micrometeorological measurements via ec originate from general shortcomings of the technique and specifics related to water vapour flux ec is considered as the state of the art technique to record fluxes from all kind of surfaces with sufficient homogeneity in the footprint generally ec requires turbulent conditions which are often missing at low wind speeds and stable stratification data points half hourly fluxes with insufficient turbulence lead to low values of turbulent heat fluxes detected via ec ec typically fails to measure 100 of the fluxes balancing the available energy net radiation minus soil heat flux minus heat storage change some reasons of this closure gap had been identified but a consistent picture on this important issue is still only emerging mauder et al 2021 closure gap correction of et is done based on redistributing according to the bowen ratio of the uncorrected ec fluxes see e g falge et al 2001 pastorello et al 2020 however van dijk et al 2015 conclude that standard fluxnet correction approaches need to be reworked for the stable conditions after rainfall as interception under stable conditions with a negative sensible heat flux is a common process for evergreen needle leaf trees in humid temperate climates bernhofer et al 2003 we expect a considerable et underestimation at the spruce site de tha while providing a high temporal resolution uncertainties in flux tower et can be quite large and systematic a more precise estimate of this systematic bias for de tha is subject of the investigation by fischer et al 2022 while in the following we continue to evaluate its contribution relative to the observed et difference here the use of the residual et according to the energy balance ae h l cannot serve as an upper limit of et for periods of negative h actual et can be even larger than the measured residual nevertheless the mean residual et is about 650 mm and therefore much closer to the catchment et compare table 2 4 2 3 quantification of et differences as plausibility checks we used interception and transpiration measurements as well as simulations with a hydrological model fortunately various auxiliary measurements exist at de tha and many studies using data of de tha had been published since the start of the flux measurements in 1996 recently 25 years of site water budget measurements were analysed to arrive at interception grunicke et al 2020 they showed a mean annual below canopy precipitation of around 55 and henceforth interception losses of around 45 of p for the vegetation period between april and october 1997 2018 because of a remarkably higher lai at the location of the below canopy rainfall measurements compared to the lai of the flux tower footprint we applied a scaling factor of 0 8 according to the lai ratio this yields an interception of 36 and a below canopy precipitation of 64 of p sap flow measurements at the same site for the period 2001 2007 clausnitzer et al 2011 showed a 55 contribution of transpiration relative to below canopy precipitation applying these relationships to the period 2006 to 2019 leads to 583 mm of rainfall 210 mm of interception and 205 mm of transpiration for the vegetation period the sum of interception and transpiration of 415 mm is already close to the mean annual tower et of 497 mm any additional et in the november to march period and the annual sum of soil evaporation is not supported a conservative estimate soil evaporation and understorey et is 100 mm for the flux tower site while additional 30 mm is to be expected from winter transpiration for interception especially in the presence of snow we have no serious estimate but in mild winters interception might be high we assume here an interception loss of 24 of winter precipitation 357 mm which yields 86 mm adding up all et components results in 631 mm yr which is 134 mm yr more than the observed value of 497 mm yr for de tha in the period 2006 to 2019 without above mentioned lai scaling factor lai estimates over a longer period of time in larger areas are difficult we calculate 179 mm yr more therefore etec at de tha seems systematically too low by about 130 to 180 mm despite its correction for closure of the energy balance the water budget model brook90 federer 2021 is already widely used luong et al 2021 schwärzel et al 2009 to compute water balance components for the tharandt forest with a focus on et components a recent study vorobevskii et al 2022 highlights different data environments of brook90 local regional and global and the importance of parameterization and forcing there de tha was modelled for the period 1997 2020 three model set ups which were only parametrized and not calibrated simulate an et of around 650 mm yr compare fig 4 in vorobevskii et al 2022 in contrast the calibrated version according to etec simulates 480 mm yr the uncalibrated models simulate a mean interception of 27 whereas the calibrated models of only 8 compared to observations of 39 for the late 1990 s and 33 for the 2010 s grunicke et al 2020 scaled as mentioned above this clearly shows uncertainties in et partitioning especially for the calibrated version we argue that the difference of around 170 mm yr between calibrated and uncalibrated models is another hint for the significant underestimation of true et by ec measurements at de tha based on the above reasoning we speculate that the ec flux correction algorithm for the closure gap is insufficient for interception episodes when negative sensible fluxes boost interception related latent heat flux fischer et al 2022 this process is most obvious for daily totals during late fall and winter with almost zero net radiation nevertheless it is also relevant for short periods after rainfall in spring and summer resuming when tower et is corrected for the interception loss in etec of about 130 180 mm yr rough estimate for details see fischer et al 2022 we arrive at a tower et value of 630 to 680 mm the remaining difference of 40 to 85 mm is attributed to site conditions 4 3 did et change due to climate change as far as meteorological drivers are concerned significant positive trends were found for t and rg for the complete period 1968 to 2019 and the cusum analysis revealed significant breakpoints around 1988 and 1996 respectively global radiation decreased between 1960 s and 1990 s but returned to normal between around 1997 and roughly 2010 these changes led to a significant increase in e0 which are in line with other sites in europe e g teuling et al 2019 and which was also reported earlier for the trends in t p rg e0 and et in the complete elbe catchment teuling et al 2009 the catchment et at wb is significantly increasing despite the insignificant trends in p and r the reason cannot be attributed to climate alone it is rather a combination of changes in forest management more harvesting before 1992 thereafter managing the pure coniferous stands toward mixed or deciduous stands and by not servicing the drainage system in wb changes in the vegetation status and climate change by applying the analysis after renner et al 2014 for an assessment of the respective contribution of climate change vs land use change for the complete wb dataset until 2019 we could identify various phases in changes of et fig 11 the transition from the 1970 s to the 1980 s is characterized by a reduction of et exclusively caused by land surface changes namely damaged vegetation due to acid rain climatic contributions are always positive in the next decades due to the combination of global warming and regional brightening from the 1980 s to the 1990 s et increased significantly besides climatic influence due to healthier forest stands and altered management practices the step to the 2000 s is characterized by a further small increase in et which is mostly due to favourable climatic conditions the et change in the last decade the 2010 s is extraordinary despite increasingly favourable climatic conditions a drastic drop of 57 mm yr in et was observed see table 4 this decrease can only be explained by a reduction of et by changes in land cover since the available energy increased considerably in the last decade considering only the direct climatic impacts et would have increased according to the attribution method however land surface effects more than offset the climatic effects and led to a decline in et we presume that climatic variations lead to changes in the land surface reducing actual et the dry and hot years 2018 and 2019 caused direct drought damages and allowed an unprecedented bark beetle infestation furthermore heavy wind storm and snow load events damaged the tree crowns practically in all of saxony e g smul 2019 thus these extreme events have lasting effects on land use as their intensity and frequency is probably associated with climate change they may trigger feedbacks intensifying climate change applying an approach similar to teuling et al 2013 an analysis of the dynamics of and the interactions between the water balance components was performed and altered et characteristics during droughts were identified instead of using et from the ec tower de tha for wb we derived a more representative et estimate combining monthly catchment and tower et the dry years 2003 2018 and 2019 were analysed relative to the long term average in contrast to findings of teuling et al 2013 these extremely dry years did not show above average or average et teuling et al 2013 stated a drought paradox for wb and two other catchments in europe which means that p deficits are sometimes accompanied by high et rates amplifying water storage anomalies according to our analysis this drought paradox was only present at the beginning of the summer in the dry years 2018 and 2019 differences between our results and those of teuling et al 2013 result from a different data base teuling et al 2013 used et observations of the ec tower de tha directly until 2011 assuming tower et to be representative for the catchment wernersbach e g frühauf et al 1999 the current study is based on a combination of tower et and catchment et observations until 2019 the systematic underestimation of more than 200 mm yr at de tha was strongly reduced by combining both data sets applying et from de tha for wernersbach would result in a long term water storage of 255 mm yr for the period 1997 2019 p r etec 942 208 479 see table 2 the basic assumption of catchment et is that the difference between precipitation and runoff represents the actual et for periods long enough to reduce storage variations considerably small compared to other uncertainties then long term water storage is set to 0 mm yr considering this difference in long term storage explains the different results in et from teuling et al 2013 and this study the general higher level of storage in the work of teuling et al 2013 allows higher et values even during drought events which contributed to the drought paradox we think that tower et is too small despite the ec closure correction and the overall et is somewhat higher in wernersbach catchment due to soil characteristics during long lasting drought events the soil water supports et for some months later followed by et reductions as a consequence our necessary correction rescaling of et changes the magnitude and sometimes even sign of et anomalies therefore we arrive at different conclusions concerning et for typical dry years for the longer data set in fact et acts as a drought aggravating factor only when enough soil water and ground water is available which is generally the case in spring in summer et is considerably lower than average during drought events main driver of the storage dynamics is p runoff was reduced to the minimum of groundwater based discharge which is on average 11 of total r schwarze 2002 with a residence time of 38 years these runoff components are barely influenced by actual moisture conditions resulting in a relatively constant flow of old ground water the contribution of et to storage evolution differs between dry years as the seasonal rainfall distribution evaporative demand and antecedent soil moisture conditions differ as well a common drought pattern was not detected rather an intensification of et anomalies becomes apparent compare table 5 however the sample size is too small for a final judgement nevertheless there is no significant trend in etec at de tha but it is still possible that such tendencies will be found after correcting etec for interception effects on ec 5 conclusion actual evapotranspiration et land use climate and its change are non linearly coupled making simple cause response relationships hard to find however there is enough evidence for a set of well supported statements on the water budget of the tharandt forest as an example for other coniferous forests in a similar climate long data records are needed the more than 50 years record of the catchment wernersbach wb did show a significant positive trend in et but the almost 25 years et record of the flux tower de tha did not about five years of integration were applied to reduce the influence of water storage on et sufficiently for wb the flux tower et shows the hourly and daily dynamics on a monthly scale both observations were combined to yield plausible monthly et estimations for wb on the basis of this corrected and extended database for wb we showed that a decent amount of et is supported only in early summer of drought years drought paradox see teuling et al 2013 later in the year the depletion of soil water leads to a collapse of et a situation that has become increasingly common for wb in the last two decades the long term variability of hydro meteorological variables is clearly related to variability in regional climate but is compensated or enlarged by effects of land use and water management until the 1980 s land use effects most importantly forest stands damaged by acid rain dominated and led to decreasing et rates since the 1990 s both climate increasing atmospheric demand and land use improved management practices led to an increase of actual et in 2010 s climate induced damages of forest stands due to droughts storms snow load and bark beetle infestations counteracted and led to an overall drastic decrease of et in wb on average the systematic long term difference in actual et between wb and the nearby ec station de tha is large around 250 mm yr strictly speaking we conclude that et in the footprint of the flux tower de tha is not representative for wb we did not find any large systematic bias in long term et data from the catchment budget for the wb setup primarily different site characteristics and methodological shortcomings of ec contributed to this bias from plausibility checks based on additional measurements and modelling we found that the contribution of site characteristics explaining around 40 85 mm yr was smaller than the methodological bias explaining around 130 180 mm yr of the observed difference the paired set up of catchment and flux tower helped to identify potential systematic shortcomings of the standard ec closure correction scheme during and after rain events in contrast to low vegetation lysimeters are not a realistic option for a reference of et from tall mature forests a small forested catchment is a potential solution which is a striking argument for the paired catchment flux tower concept with redundant and complementing measurements of et there is a clear answer to the main question of this study concerning the impact of climate change on et at the tharandt forest while a direct positive influence on et exists via an increasing atmospheric demand and actual et is increasing generally as well there are also land use effects which are associated to climate change these indirect effects of climate extremes on forest stands such as droughts beetle infestations wind throws etc will have a lasting impact memory effect even when the climate alone returns to normal the last two years of the investigated period extremely dry and warm could be according to some regional climate projections a preview of future conditions further research should include simulations with physically based hydrological land surface models as well as a careful integration of land use water management changes in these models parameterisation and understanding will profit from highly resolved remote sensing information satellite and airborne finally excellent data records will still be needed improvements like a better ec flux tower correction included after all measurements will remain the benchmark for model performance they will be necessary to isolate and judge on existing changes and they should provide a robust reference for climate change projection of water balance components 6 data along with this paper we provide a freely available monthly hydro climatological dataset for the period 1968 2019 and an

2464,the increasing number of small hold aquaculture ponds for food production globally has raised concerns of their emission of greenhouse gases ghgs such as methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o aeration is commonly applied to improve oxygen supply for the farmed animals but it could have opposite effects on ghg emission it may inhibit anaerobic microbial processes that produce ghgs it may also increase water to air ghg exchange via physical agitation to resolve the overall effect of aeration on ghg emissions this study analyzed and compared the monthly ch4 and n2o emissions from earthen shrimp ponds with and without aeration in the farming period for two consecutive years in an estuary in subtropical southeastern china ch4 flux was mainly influenced by water temperature and dissolved oxygen and it was significantly higher in non aerated pond 7 6 mg m 2h 1 than in aerated ponds 4 5 mg m 2h 1 with ebullition accounting for 90 of the emission conversely non aerated pond had ca 50 lower n2o flux than aerated ponds and dissolved nitrate was the main driving factor the combined co2 equivalent emission in aerated ponds avg 10 829 kg co2 eq ha 1 yr 1 was substantially lower than that in non aerated pond avg 17 627 kg co2 eq ha 1 yr 1 while aeration may increase diffusive flux of ghgs via physical agitation it remains a simple and effective management practice to decrease the overall climate impact of aquaculture ponds keywords artificial aeration greenhouse gases ghgs emission sustained flux global warming potential sgwp climate mitigation aquaculture pond data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the increasing number of aquaculture ponds for food production worldwide fao 2017 causes great concerns of their climate impact through emissions of greenhouse gases for example methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o grinham et al 2018 macleod et al 2020 yuan et al 2021 williams and crutzen 2010 estimated that the aquaculture sector contributed 0 09 tg or 0 3 of the global anthropogenic n2o emission in 2008 the annual global n2o emission from aquaculture is projected to increase to 0 6 tg by 2030 or 5 7 of anthropogenic n2o emission hu et al 2012 based on worldwide database of freshwater aquaculture it was estimated that the top 21 aquaculture producers emitted 6 0 1 2 tg ch4 and 36 7 6 1 gg n2o in 2014 alone which were equivalent to 1 8 and 0 3 of global anthropogenic ch4 and n2o emissions respectively yuan et al 2019 in china the total area for aquaculture pond has expanded to approximately 3 2 104 km2 in 2018 bfma 2019 being the world s largest producer of aquatic products around 60 approximately 15 600 km2 of china s aquaculture ponds are located along the coast duan et al 2020 one of the main aquaculture operations in china is shrimp farming in small coastal ponds with a total area of 2 4 103 km2 bureau of fisheries of the ministry of agriculture bfma 2019 which contributes approximately 12 of the global shrimp culture by areal coverage most shrimp ponds are maintained through feeds and aeration every day yang et al 2017a yang et al 2017b yang et al 2020a chen et al 2016 but some ponds are not aerated or with low aeration frequency although some efforts have been made to characterize the effect of feeds on greenhouse gas ghg production in aquaculture systems adegbeye et al 2019 chen et al 2016 soares and henry silva 2019 yang et al 2020b zhao et al 2021 the effect of aeration is less clear especially for small aquaculture ponds that are often not monitored properly kosten et al 2020 a meta analysis has shown that small aquaculture ponds tended to emit far more ch4 than industrial scale systems with proper aeration and therefore wider use of aeration is recommended to mitigate ch4 emission from aquaculture yuan et al 2019 however while aeration is expected to inhibit the anaerobic microbial processes that produce ch4 it could also accelerate the water to air gas diffusive fluxes hu et al 2013 kosten et al 2020 the balance between the two opposite effects would determine how aeration affects the net ghg emissions and global warming contribution of aquaculture ponds in order to improve our understanding of aeration effects on ghg emissions from aquaculture ponds we analyzed and compared ch4 and n2o fluxes and their main driving factors between aerated and non aerated shrimp ponds over the farming period for two consecutive years in southeastern china 2 materials and methods 2 1 research area the research was carried out in earthen shrimp ponds penaeus vannamei in the shanyutan wetland of the min river estuary mre in southeastern china fig 1 the annual mean air temperature in the region is 19 6 c and the mean rainfall is 1 350 mm tong et al 2012 the average salinity is 4 2 2 5 ppt and the average range of semidiurnal tidal is 0 1 1 5 m tong et al 2018 the dominant vegetation species include native phragmites australis and cyperus malaccensis and the invasive spartina alterniflora covering approximately 30 the shanyutan wetland these shallow aquaculture ponds were created by removing the original marsh vegetation and converting bunds into steep slopes the interval between the removal of native vegetation and the creation of pond was around 10 15 days 2 2 shrimp pond system and experimental design the farming period was between may and november producing a single crop annually before shrimp culturing the ponds were filled to 1 5 0 2 m deep with brackish water salinity 4 2 0 3 drawn from the adjacent estuary commercial feed pellets were added once in the morning 07 00 and once in the afternoon 16 00 some of the ponds had aerators to oxygenate the water but some ponds were not aerated after harvesting in late november water was discharged via spillways please refer to yang et al 2017a yang et al 2017b yang et al 2021 for more details of the aquaculture pond operation water and gas samples were collected from one non aerated pond nap and two aerated ponds ap i and ap ii the sizes of these three ponds ranged from 1 25 to 1 40 ha water depth varied from 1 3 to 1 6 m for the ap aeration was provided by six 1500 w paddlewheel aerators that ran almost continuously stopped for a short time during the feeding periods in each pond a wooden bridge approximately15 m long extending from bank to center was used to collect samples at three locations one near the bank one in the mid section of the bridge and one at the pond center field sampling was conducted during the farming period every month between june and november for two consecutive years 2019 and 2020 for a total of 12 sampling campaigns in each pond on each sampling day all samples were collected at local time 09 00 11 00 am zou et al 2015 wu et al 2019 this extensive sampling effort therefore generated detailed data of the monthly and yearly variations in the ponds 2 3 measurements of dissolved ghg concentrations in order to measure dissolved ch4 and n2o concentrations bubble free water samples were collected from 20 cm below the water surface with a syringe 60 ml equipped with a three way stopcock wang et al 2018 borges et al 2018 each water sample was transferred into a glass serum bottle 55 ml to stop the microbial activities 0 2 ml hgcl2 was added to water before closing the bottles borges et al 2018 zhang et al 2013 the bottles were sealed with butyl rubber stoppers without headspace xiao et al 2019 webb et al 2018 and transported in a cooler back to laboratory for analysis within 4 6 hr the headspace equilibration technique was used to analyze dissolved ghg concentrations davidson et al 2015 wang et al 2021 yu et al 2017 briefly 99 999 purity nitrogen n2 gas was injected into every serum bottle to displace a 25 ml headspace the bottles were than shaken vigorously for 10 min to create an equilibrium between the gaseous phase and the liquid phase after settling for 30 min 5 ml of the headspace gas was withdrawn for ch4 measurement shimadzu gc 2010 with flame ionization detector kyoto japan and 5 ml for n2o measurement shimadzu gc 2014 with electron capture detector kyoto japan calibration curves were produced with

and n2o across the water air interface wai were determined using the floating chamber method natchimuthu et al 2016 wu et al 2021 the area and volume of the floating chamber are 0 1 m2 and 5 2 l respectively the floating chamber was covered with reflective aluminum foil and fitted with styrofoam around the rim for floatation gas flux measurements were conducted at the aforementioned three locations in each pond at each location a 60 ml gas sample was collected at an interval of 15 minute for 45 min with a syringe via a sampling port on the floating chamber gas samples were then injected into aluminum foil gas sample bags dalian delin gas packing co ltd china and transported back to laboratory within 48 h for further analysis in the laboratory the ghg contents in the gas samples were determined by gas chromatographs shimadzu gc 2010 for ch4 and shimadzu gc 2014 for n2o ch4 mg m 2h 1 and n2o μg m 2h 1 fluxes across the wai were calculated as the rate of change in the mass of ch4 and n2o per unit surface area per unit time yuan et al 2021 yang et al 2018 total ch4 and n2o emissions over the farming period were calculated as the sum of the monthly values moore et al 2011 wu et al 2018 2 5 estimation of diffusive and ebullitive ch4 fluxes ch4 fluxes determined by the floating chamber include both diffusive and ebullitive fluxes chuang et al 2017 wu et al 2019 zhu et al 2016 to partition the measurement between the two components diffusive ch4 flux f d mg m 2h 1 across the water atmosphere interface was estimated as follows musenze et al 2014 wanninkhof 1992 white et al 2021 f d kx c w c eq where c w μmol l is the measured dissolved ch4 concentration in the surface water c eq μmol l is the equilibrium dissolved ch4 concentration relative to the ambient atmospheric concentration at each sampling site the gas transfer velocity kx m h was estimated from wind speed and temperature cole and caraco 1998 while different models exist to derive kx klaus and vachon 2020 we used the model by cole and caraco 1998 because of the similar water surface areas and wind speeds in our study to the parameters used by them ebullitive ch4 flux was estimated by subtracting the diffusive flux from the total ch4 flux determined from the floating chamber xiao et al 2017 chuang et al 2017 yang et al 2020b zhu et al 2016 2 6 measurement of ancillary environmental

calculated the co2 equivalent emission based on ipcc methodology by multiplying ch4 emission by a global warming potential value of 45 based on a 100 year time horizon and a gwp value of 1 for co2 and n2o emission by 270 neubauer and megonigal 2019 we also accounted for the ghg contribution of the aerator by multiplying its energy consumption by co2 emission factor for hydropower 10 g co2 per kwh

data fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 effects of aeration on water quality and shrimp yield shrimp aquaculture is generally maintained via daily supply of commercial aquatic feed but only part of the feeds is converted into shrimp biomass avnimelech and ritvo 2003 wang et al 2018 chen et al 2016 yang et al 2020b and the remainder is retained in the water column and sediment yang et al 2021 in the present study artificial aeration significantly increased the level of nh4 n no3 n and tdn in the water column fig 2g 2i similar to other studies in ponds zhu et al 2020 and constructed wetlands ji et al 2021 maltais landry et al 2009a maltais landry et al 2009b this could be attributed to the increased do level promoting remineralization of organic nitrogen from excess feeds and its subsequent release from the sediment han et al 2018 zhu et al 2020 previous studies have suggested that intermittent artificial aeration can be a simple and effective management strategy to enhance water quality and increase animal yield in aquaculture systems boyd 1998 hu et al 2013 kosten et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 based on report by the farmer the mean shrimp yield for the aerated ponds was 6 800 kg ha 1 which was substantially higher than that for the non aerated pond 5 200 kg ha 1 the results suggested that continuous aeration could also increase shrimp yield 4 2 effects of aeration on ch4 emission although some recent studies have shown that microbial ch4 production can occur in oxic waters bogard et al 2014 günthel et al 2019 conventional microbial methanogenesis in oxygen deplete bottom water and sediment remains the principal source of ch4 in shallow and eutrophic systems such as aquaculture ponds tong et al 2021 over the two years of our study do in aps was substantially higher than in nap showing a clear effect of aeration fig 2 accordingly the surface water ch4 concentration in nap was much higher than in aps across all sampling campaigns fig 3 there were large month to month variations in ch4 concentration with lower values usually observed in the summer months perhaps reflecting the increasing activity of ch4 oxidizers surprisingly ch4 flux values were higher in the summer months fig 4 which were opposite to what would be expected from the lower surface water ch4 concentrations a possible explanation is the higher sedimentary ch4 production during the hot summer months and the subsequent release via ebullition allowed ch4 to by pass oxidation in the water column rosentreter et al 2017 crawford et al 2014 wu et al 2019 xing et al 2006 indeed ebullition was estimated to account for the overwhelming majority of ch4 fluxes in all of the studied ponds fig 5 similar to other shallow and eutrophic inland waters e g wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 zhu et al 2016 yang et al 2008 aps had comparable diffusive ch4 flux to nap but considerably lower ebullitive flux suggesting that the aerators were enough to lessen the anoxic condition in sediment in shrimp ponds aeration could have opposing impacts on ch4 emissions on the one hand increased oxygenation of the water could inhibit anaerobic microbial methanogenesis and promote ch4 oxidation liu et al 2016 yuan et al 2019 on the other hand because ch4 is only sparingly soluble in water physical agitation by the aerators could increase diffusive exchange of ch4 from water to air kosten et al 2020 yang et al 2015 in our study the inhibitive effects of aeration can be seen in the overall negative relationship between ch4 fluxes and do fig s2a 2c similar to observations in aerated constructed wetlands ji et al 2021 maltais landry et al 2009a liu et al 2018 yet some data points from aps were noticeably above the trend line indicating stronger ch4 emissions than expected our observations suggest that aeration may increase ch4 fluxes through physical agitation especially in the mid do range ca 9 10 mg l 1 an earlier study estimated that whiteleg shrimp had an average feed conversion ratio of 1 33 in aerated ponds yang et al 2021 from this we estimated the total amount of feeds applied to be 9 044 kg ha 1 y 1 therefore based on the reported shrimp yields the excess feeds i e feeds that were not converted to biomass would average 26 mg m 2h 1 in aps and 44 mg m 2h 1 in nap in other words we may expect 69 more carbon emission from unconsumed feeds in nap compared to ap excess organic carbon would likely be converted to co2 in well oxygenated water but instead to ch4 in oxygen deplete water our measurements showed that ch4 emission in nap was 68 more than that in ap 7 56 vs 4 50 mg m 2h 1 hence the low oxygen condition in nap essentially drove the conversion of all unconsumed feeds to ch4 instead of co2 considering that ch4 is a much stronger ghg than co2 this shows the importance of aeration or the lack of in regulating the climate impact of the aquaculture ponds taking together data across the two consecutive years do and tw were the two key but opposing factors in determining the ch4 emission flux fig 7 for the purpose of mitigating ch4 emission from the shrimp ponds while it would be difficult to manipulate t w do can be easily increased with aerators an interesting observation is the sizable positive effect tdn had on ch4 emission on the contrary the presumptive substrate for methanogenesis doc had weak effect on ch4 emission fig 7 this perhaps indicates that the methanogen activity level was regulated by nitrogen availability 4 3 effects of aeration on n2o emission while methanogenesis is driven predominantly by anaerobic microbial processes in bottom water and sediment n2o can be produced via nitrification of nh4 n and denitrification of no3 n within the water column with the two processes intertwined by a series of reduction oxidation reactions beaulieu et al 2015 maavara et al 2019 yuan et al 2021 not surprisingly the temporal change of n2o emission flux fig 4b mirrored that in dissolved n2o concentration and these two were positively correlated with both no3 n and nh4 n fig s3 and table s2 taking all data together no3 n explained most 89 of the variability in n2o flux fig 7 affirming the singular importance of nutrient loading in driving n2o production in aquaculture ponds hu et al 2013 wu et al 2018 unlike ch4 n2o is highly soluble in water therefore its emission pathway is primarily through diffusive flux and not ebullition and physical turbulence within the water column was expected to increase water to air n2o flux hu et al 2013 kosten et al 2020 indeed n2o flux was consistently higher in aps than in nap fig 4 there was an overall positive correlation between n2o flux and do across all measurements with many of the data points from aps lying above the trend line fig s2d 2f suggesting that physical agitation by the aerators enhanced n2o gaseous exchange across the water air interface 4 4 implications for global warming mitigation with the wild stocks being depleted by overfishing the world is increasingly turning towards aquaculture to satisfy its demand for aquatic animal proteins particularly in developing countries fao 2018 hu et al 2012 yang et al 2017a yang et al 2017b while small hold aquaculture offers benefits including increasing food security adding jobs and promoting rural economy béné et al 2016 fao 2018 hu et al 2012 aquaculture boom can also raise environmental concerns including ghg emissions macleod et al 2020 wu et al 2018 yuan et al 2021 although aquaculture ponds account for only ca 1 8 and 0 3 of the global anthropogenic ch4 and n2o emissions respectively yuan et al 2019 their climate impacts can be significant in regions where small aquaculture ponds are widespread fao 2018 such as along china s coast duan et al 2020 ren et al 2019 as shown in this study the small shrimp ponds in mre in southeastern china were strong ch4 and n2o emitters improvement of management practices will be key to reducing ghg emissions from aquaculture ponds and achieving a clean and sustainable production aeration is a common practice in aquaculture but it may have opposite effects on ghg fluxes from the ponds our results showed that aeration increased n2o emission by 98 but decreased ch4 emission by 40 in order to place the gas flux values in the context of climate impact we calculated the co2 equivalent emission based on the ipcc model for sgwp neubauer and megonigal 2019 ipcc 2013 our calculations showed that the average combined emission in non aerated ponds 342 mg co2 eq m 2h 1 was substantially larger than the global average for reservoirs 242 mg co2 eq m 2h 1 deemer et al 2016 and the average value for china s lakes and reservoirs li et al 2018 whereas the combined emission in aerated ponds 206 mg co2 eq m 2h 1 was considerably lower co2 emission due to electricity consumption by the aerators was negligible overall ch4 emission was vastly more important than n2o emission in terms of centennial scale climate impact of the shrimp ponds and aeration was able to decrease the annual co2 equivalent emission of the shrimp ponds by 40 fig 6 4 5 recommendations for future research our data showed that water temperature had a positive influence on ch4 emission the subtropical location of our study site and the exposed nature of the ponds inevitably led to high water temperatures future study may consider testing the effect of shading as a way to lower the water temperature and ch4 emission because n2o emission was mostly influenced by no3 n a better management of nutrient loading into the ponds may help to reduce n2o emission instead of paddlewheel aerators some farmers use air diffusers for aeration which sit at the bottom of the ponds and release air bubbles while diffusers may oxygenate the entire water column more effectively than paddlewheels rising air bubbles may strip the water column of dissolved ghgs and greatly increase water to air ghg fluxes hu et al 2012 yang et al 2020b a comparative study of the different aerator designs will be useful to produce appropriate recommendations to farmers for mitigating ghg emissions artificial aeration can lead to high do level in water column which would enhance ch4 oxidation to co2 casper et al 2000 kosten et al 2020 and add to co2 emission to air because co2 emissions were not measured in the present study the total co2 equivalent emission from the aerated ponds could have been underestimated further study on the effects of aeration on co2 emissions from aquaculture ponds is needed while the physical effects of aeration on ghg emissions are not expected to depend on the species aquaculture ponds with other species shell or fin fish will likely develop different microbial communities and therefore the magnitude of ghg emissions may be different expanding the study to other aquaculture systems and species will help generate a more detailed understanding of the comprehensive climate impact of the aquaculture sector 5 conclusions this study quantified the effects of artificial aeration on ghg emissions from aquaculture ponds our results indicate that artificial aeration had opposite effects on n2o and ch4 emissions it increased n2o emission likely via physical agitation of the water column but decreased ch4 emission likely by suppressing anaerobic methanogenesis and promoting ch4 oxidation the combined annual co2 equivalent emission from ch4 and n2o in non aerated pond was 1 6 times higher than that in aerated ponds with ch4 being the main contributor these findings suggest that increasing the do level by artificial aeration is a simple inexpensive and effective management strategy to mitigate ghg emissions from aquaculture ponds credit authorship contribution statement ping yang conceptualization methodology

2464,the increasing number of small hold aquaculture ponds for food production globally has raised concerns of their emission of greenhouse gases ghgs such as methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o aeration is commonly applied to improve oxygen supply for the farmed animals but it could have opposite effects on ghg emission it may inhibit anaerobic microbial processes that produce ghgs it may also increase water to air ghg exchange via physical agitation to resolve the overall effect of aeration on ghg emissions this study analyzed and compared the monthly ch4 and n2o emissions from earthen shrimp ponds with and without aeration in the farming period for two consecutive years in an estuary in subtropical southeastern china ch4 flux was mainly influenced by water temperature and dissolved oxygen and it was significantly higher in non aerated pond 7 6 mg m 2h 1 than in aerated ponds 4 5 mg m 2h 1 with ebullition accounting for 90 of the emission conversely non aerated pond had ca 50 lower n2o flux than aerated ponds and dissolved nitrate was the main driving factor the combined co2 equivalent emission in aerated ponds avg 10 829 kg co2 eq ha 1 yr 1 was substantially lower than that in non aerated pond avg 17 627 kg co2 eq ha 1 yr 1 while aeration may increase diffusive flux of ghgs via physical agitation it remains a simple and effective management practice to decrease

availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the increasing number of aquaculture ponds for food production worldwide fao 2017 causes great concerns of their climate impact through emissions of greenhouse gases for example methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o grinham et al 2018 macleod et al 2020 yuan et al 2021 williams and crutzen 2010 estimated that the aquaculture sector contributed 0 09 tg or 0 3 of the global anthropogenic n2o emission in 2008 the annual global n2o emission from aquaculture is projected to increase to 0 6 tg by 2030 or 5 7 of anthropogenic n2o emission hu et al 2012 based on worldwide database of freshwater aquaculture it was estimated that the top 21 aquaculture producers emitted 6 0 1 2 tg ch4 and 36 7 6 1 gg n2o in 2014 alone which were equivalent to 1 8 and 0 3 of global anthropogenic ch4 and n2o emissions respectively yuan et al 2019 in china the total area for aquaculture pond has expanded to approximately 3 2 104 km2 in 2018 bfma 2019 being the world s largest producer of aquatic products around 60 approximately 15 600 km2 of china s aquaculture ponds are located along the coast duan et al 2020 one of the main aquaculture operations in china is shrimp farming in small coastal ponds with a total area of 2 4 103 km2 bureau of fisheries of the ministry of agriculture bfma 2019 which contributes approximately 12 of the global shrimp culture by areal coverage most shrimp ponds are maintained through feeds and aeration every day yang et al 2017a yang et al 2017b yang et al 2020a chen et al 2016 but some ponds are not aerated or with low aeration frequency although some efforts have been made to characterize the effect of feeds on greenhouse gas ghg production in aquaculture systems adegbeye et al 2019 chen et al 2016 soares and henry silva 2019 yang et al 2020b zhao et al 2021 the effect of aeration is less clear especially for small aquaculture ponds that are often not monitored properly kosten et al 2020 a meta analysis has shown that small aquaculture ponds tended to emit far more ch4 than industrial scale systems with proper aeration and therefore wider use of aeration is recommended to mitigate ch4 emission from aquaculture yuan et al 2019 however while aeration is expected to inhibit the anaerobic microbial processes that produce ch4 it could also accelerate the water to air gas diffusive fluxes hu et al 2013 kosten et al 2020 the balance between the two opposite effects would determine how aeration affects the net ghg emissions and global warming contribution of aquaculture ponds in order to improve our understanding of aeration effects on ghg emissions from aquaculture ponds we analyzed and compared ch4 and n2o fluxes and their main driving factors between aerated and non aerated shrimp ponds over the farming period for two consecutive years in southeastern china 2 materials and methods 2 1 research area the research was carried out in earthen shrimp ponds penaeus

average salinity is 4 2 2 5 ppt and the average range of semidiurnal tidal is 0 1 1 5 m tong et al 2018 the dominant vegetation species include native phragmites australis and cyperus malaccensis and the invasive spartina alterniflora covering approximately 30 the shanyutan wetland these shallow aquaculture ponds were created by removing the original marsh vegetation and converting bunds into steep slopes the interval between the removal of native vegetation and the creation of pond was around 10 15 days 2 2 shrimp pond system and experimental design the farming period was between may and november producing a single crop annually before shrimp culturing the ponds were filled to 1 5 0 2 m deep with brackish water salinity 4 2 0 3 drawn from the adjacent estuary commercial feed pellets were added once in the morning 07 00 and once in the afternoon 16 00 some of the ponds had aerators to oxygenate the water but some ponds were not aerated after harvesting in late november water was discharged via spillways please refer to yang et al 2017a yang et al 2017b yang et al 2021 for more details of the aquaculture pond operation water and gas samples were collected from one non aerated pond nap and two aerated ponds ap i and ap ii the sizes of these three ponds ranged from 1 25 to 1 40 ha water depth varied from 1 3 to 1 6 m for the ap aeration was provided by six 1500 w paddlewheel aerators that ran almost continuously stopped for a short time during the feeding periods in each pond a wooden bridge approximately15 m long extending from bank to center was used to collect samples at three locations one near the bank one in the mid section of the bridge and one at the pond center field sampling was conducted during the farming period every month between june and november for two consecutive years 2019 and 2020 for a total of 12 sampling campaigns in each pond on each sampling day all samples were collected at local time 09 00 11 00 am zou et al 2015 wu et al 2019 this extensive sampling effort therefore generated detailed data of the monthly and yearly variations in the ponds 2 3 measurements of dissolved ghg concentrations in order to measure dissolved ch4 and n2o concentrations bubble free water samples were collected from 20 cm below the water surface with a syringe 60 ml equipped with a three way stopcock wang et al 2018 borges et al 2018 each water sample was transferred into a glass serum bottle 55 ml to stop the microbial activities 0 2 ml hgcl2 was added to water before closing the bottles borges et al 2018 zhang et al 2013 the bottles were sealed with butyl rubber stoppers without headspace xiao et al 2019 webb et al 2018 and transported in a cooler back to laboratory for analysis within 4 6 hr the headspace equilibration technique was used to analyze dissolved ghg concentrations davidson et al 2015 wang et al 2021 yu et al 2017 briefly 99 999 purity nitrogen n2 gas was injected into every serum bottle to displace a 25 ml headspace the bottles were than shaken vigorously for 10 min to create an equilibrium between the gaseous phase and the liquid phase after settling for 30 min 5 ml of the headspace gas was withdrawn for ch4

respectively the floating chamber was covered with reflective aluminum foil and fitted with styrofoam around the rim for floatation gas flux measurements were conducted at the aforementioned three locations in each pond at each location a 60 ml gas sample was collected at an interval of 15 minute for 45 min with a syringe via a sampling port on the floating chamber gas samples were then injected into aluminum foil gas sample bags dalian delin gas packing co ltd china and transported back to laboratory within 48 h for further analysis in the laboratory the ghg contents in the gas samples were determined by gas chromatographs shimadzu gc 2010 for ch4 and shimadzu gc 2014 for n2o ch4 mg m 2h 1 and n2o μg m 2h 1 fluxes across the wai were calculated as the rate of change in the

et al 2016 to partition the measurement between the two components diffusive ch4 flux f d mg m 2h 1 across the water atmosphere interface was estimated as follows musenze et al 2014 wanninkhof 1992 white et al 2021 f d kx c w c eq where c w μmol l is the measured dissolved ch4 concentration in the surface water c eq μmol l is the equilibrium dissolved ch4 concentration relative to the ambient atmospheric concentration at each sampling site the gas transfer velocity kx m h was estimated from wind speed and temperature cole and caraco 1998 while different models exist to derive kx klaus and vachon 2020 we used the model by cole and caraco 1998 because of the similar water surface areas and wind speeds in our study to the parameters used by them ebullitive ch4 flux was estimated by subtracting the diffusive flux from the total ch4 flux determined from the floating chamber xiao et al 2017 chuang et al 2017 yang et al 2020b zhu et al 2016 2 6 measurement of ancillary environmental

calculated the co2 equivalent emission based on ipcc methodology by multiplying ch4 emission by a global warming potential value of 45 based on a 100 year time horizon and a gwp value of 1 for co2 and n2o emission by 270 neubauer and megonigal 2019 we also accounted for the ghg contribution of the aerator by multiplying its energy consumption by co2 emission factor for hydropower 10 g co2 per kwh

fig 5 overall ebullition was estimated to account for the majority 94 96 of ch4 emission over the farming period in the two consecutive years nap had a significantly higher mean ch4 ebullitive flux 7

respectively fig 6 energy consumption by the aerators added only 126 136 kg co2 eq ha 1 yr 1 in the aerated ponds across the two consecutive years the co2 equivalent emission from nap averaged 17 626 kg co2 eq ha 1 yr 1 which was 63 and 49 greater than that of ap i and ap ii respectively ch4 accounted for over 95 of the co2 equivalent emission in each pond fig 6 3 6 relationships between gas

data fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 effects of aeration on water quality and shrimp yield shrimp aquaculture is generally maintained via daily supply of commercial aquatic feed but only part of the feeds is converted into shrimp biomass avnimelech and ritvo 2003 wang et al 2018 chen et al 2016 yang et al 2020b and the remainder is retained in the water column and sediment yang et al 2021 in the present study artificial aeration significantly increased the level of nh4 n no3 n and tdn in the water column fig 2g 2i similar to other studies in ponds zhu et al 2020 and constructed wetlands ji et al 2021 maltais landry et al 2009a maltais landry et al 2009b this could be attributed to the increased do level promoting remineralization of organic nitrogen from excess feeds and its subsequent release from the sediment han et al 2018 zhu et al 2020 previous studies have suggested that intermittent artificial aeration can be a simple and effective management strategy to enhance water quality and increase animal yield in aquaculture systems boyd 1998 hu et al 2013 kosten et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 based on report by the farmer the mean shrimp yield for the aerated ponds was 6 800 kg ha 1 which was substantially higher than that for the non aerated pond 5 200 kg ha 1 the results suggested that continuous aeration could also increase shrimp yield 4 2 effects of aeration on ch4 emission although some recent studies have shown that microbial ch4 production can occur in oxic waters bogard et al 2014 günthel et al 2019 conventional microbial methanogenesis in oxygen deplete bottom water and sediment remains the principal source of ch4 in shallow and eutrophic systems such as aquaculture ponds tong et al 2021 over the two years of our study do in aps was substantially higher than in nap showing a clear effect of aeration fig 2 accordingly the surface water ch4 concentration in nap was much higher than in aps across all sampling campaigns fig 3 there were large month to month variations in ch4 concentration with lower values usually observed in the summer months perhaps reflecting the increasing activity of ch4 oxidizers surprisingly ch4 flux values were higher in the summer months fig 4 which were opposite to what would be expected from the lower surface water ch4 concentrations a possible explanation is the higher sedimentary ch4 production during the hot summer months and the subsequent release via ebullition allowed ch4 to by pass oxidation in the water column rosentreter et al 2017 crawford et al 2014 wu et al 2019 xing et al 2006 indeed ebullition was estimated to account for the overwhelming majority of ch4 fluxes in all of the studied ponds fig 5 similar to other shallow and eutrophic inland waters e g wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 zhu et al 2016 yang et al 2008 aps had comparable diffusive ch4 flux to nap but considerably lower ebullitive flux suggesting that the aerators were enough to lessen the anoxic condition in sediment in shrimp ponds aeration could have opposing impacts on ch4 emissions on the one hand increased oxygenation of the water could inhibit anaerobic microbial methanogenesis and promote ch4 oxidation liu et al 2016 yuan et al 2019 on the other hand because ch4 is only sparingly soluble in water physical agitation by the aerators could increase diffusive exchange of ch4 from water to air kosten et al 2020 yang et al 2015 in our study the inhibitive effects of aeration can be seen in the overall negative relationship between ch4 fluxes and do fig s2a 2c similar to observations in aerated constructed wetlands ji et al 2021 maltais landry et al 2009a liu et al 2018 yet some data points from aps were noticeably above the trend line indicating stronger ch4 emissions than expected our observations suggest that aeration may increase ch4 fluxes through physical agitation especially in the mid do range ca 9 10 mg l 1 an earlier study estimated that whiteleg shrimp had an average feed conversion ratio of 1 33 in aerated ponds yang et al 2021 from this we estimated the total amount of feeds applied to be 9 044 kg ha 1 y 1 therefore based on the reported shrimp yields the excess feeds i e feeds that were not converted to biomass would average 26 mg m 2h 1 in aps and 44 mg m 2h 1 in nap in other words we may expect 69 more carbon emission from unconsumed feeds in nap compared to ap excess organic carbon would likely be converted to co2 in well oxygenated water but instead to ch4 in oxygen deplete water our measurements showed that ch4 emission in nap was 68 more than that in ap 7 56 vs 4 50 mg m 2h 1 hence the low oxygen condition in nap essentially drove the conversion of all unconsumed feeds to ch4 instead of co2 considering that ch4 is a much stronger ghg than co2 this shows the importance of aeration or the lack of in regulating the climate impact of the aquaculture ponds taking together data across the two consecutive years do and tw were the two key but opposing factors in determining the ch4 emission flux fig 7 for the purpose of mitigating ch4 emission from the shrimp ponds while it would be difficult to manipulate t w do can be easily increased with aerators an interesting observation is the sizable positive effect tdn had on ch4 emission on the contrary the presumptive substrate for methanogenesis doc had weak effect on ch4 emission fig 7 this perhaps indicates that the methanogen activity level was regulated by nitrogen availability 4 3 effects of aeration on n2o emission while methanogenesis is driven predominantly by anaerobic microbial processes in bottom water and sediment n2o can be produced via nitrification of nh4 n and denitrification of no3 n within the water column with the two processes intertwined by a series of reduction oxidation reactions beaulieu et al 2015 maavara et al 2019 yuan et al 2021 not surprisingly the temporal change of n2o emission flux fig 4b mirrored that in dissolved n2o concentration and these two were positively correlated with both no3 n and nh4 n fig s3 and table s2 taking all data together no3 n explained most 89 of the variability in n2o flux fig 7 affirming the singular importance of nutrient loading in driving n2o production in aquaculture ponds hu et al 2013 wu et al 2018 unlike ch4 n2o is highly soluble in water therefore its emission pathway is primarily through diffusive flux and not ebullition and physical turbulence within the water column was expected to increase water to air n2o flux hu et al 2013 kosten et al 2020 indeed n2o flux was consistently higher in aps than in nap fig 4 there was an overall positive correlation between n2o flux and do across all measurements with many of the data points from aps lying above the trend line fig s2d 2f suggesting that physical agitation by the aerators enhanced n2o gaseous exchange across the water air interface 4 4 implications for global warming mitigation with the wild stocks being depleted by overfishing the world is increasingly turning towards aquaculture to satisfy its demand for aquatic animal proteins particularly in developing countries fao 2018 hu et al 2012 yang et al 2017a yang et al 2017b while small hold aquaculture offers benefits including increasing food security adding jobs and promoting rural economy béné et al 2016 fao 2018 hu et al 2012 aquaculture boom can also raise environmental concerns including ghg emissions macleod et al 2020 wu et al 2018 yuan et al 2021 although aquaculture ponds account for only ca 1 8 and 0 3 of the global anthropogenic ch4 and n2o emissions respectively yuan et al 2019 their climate impacts can be significant in regions where small aquaculture ponds are widespread fao 2018 such as along china s coast duan et al 2020 ren et al 2019 as shown in this study the small shrimp ponds in mre in southeastern china were strong ch4 and n2o emitters improvement of management practices will be key to reducing ghg emissions from aquaculture ponds and achieving a clean and sustainable production aeration is a common practice in aquaculture but it may have opposite effects on ghg fluxes from the ponds our results showed that aeration increased n2o emission by 98 but decreased ch4 emission by 40 in order to place the gas flux values in the context of climate impact we calculated the co2 equivalent emission based on the ipcc model for sgwp neubauer and megonigal 2019 ipcc 2013 our calculations showed that the average combined emission in non aerated ponds 342 mg co2 eq m 2h 1 was substantially larger than the global average for reservoirs 242 mg co2 eq m 2h 1 deemer et al 2016 and the average value for china s lakes and reservoirs li et al 2018 whereas the combined emission in aerated ponds 206 mg co2 eq m 2h 1 was considerably lower co2 emission due to electricity consumption by the aerators was negligible overall ch4 emission was vastly more important than n2o emission in terms of centennial scale climate impact of the shrimp ponds and aeration was able to decrease the annual co2 equivalent emission of the shrimp ponds by 40 fig 6 4 5 recommendations for future research our data showed that water temperature had a positive influence on ch4 emission the subtropical location of our study site and the exposed nature of the ponds inevitably led to high water temperatures future study may consider testing the effect of shading as a way to lower the water temperature and ch4 emission because n2o emission was mostly influenced by no3 n a better management of nutrient loading into the ponds may help to reduce n2o emission instead of paddlewheel aerators some farmers use air diffusers for aeration which sit at the bottom of the ponds and release air bubbles while diffusers may oxygenate the entire water column more effectively than paddlewheels rising air bubbles may strip the water column of dissolved ghgs and greatly increase water to air ghg fluxes hu et al 2012 yang et al 2020b a comparative study of the different aerator designs will be useful to produce appropriate recommendations to farmers for mitigating ghg emissions artificial aeration can lead to high do level in water column which would enhance ch4 oxidation to co2 casper et al 2000 kosten et al 2020 and add to co2 emission to air because co2 emissions were not measured in the present study the total co2 equivalent emission from the aerated ponds could have been underestimated further study on the effects of aeration on co2 emissions from aquaculture ponds is needed while the physical effects of aeration on ghg emissions are not expected to depend on the species aquaculture ponds with other species shell or fin fish will likely develop different microbial communities and therefore the magnitude of ghg emissions may be different expanding the study to other aquaculture systems and species will help generate a more detailed understanding of the comprehensive climate impact of the aquaculture sector 5 conclusions this study quantified the effects of artificial aeration on ghg emissions from aquaculture ponds our results indicate that artificial aeration had opposite effects on n2o and ch4 emissions it increased n2o emission likely via physical agitation of the water column but decreased ch4 emission likely by suppressing anaerobic methanogenesis and promoting ch4 oxidation the combined annual co2 equivalent emission from ch4 and n2o in non aerated pond was 1 6 times higher than that in aerated ponds with ch4 being the main contributor these findings suggest that increasing the do level by artificial aeration is a simple inexpensive and effective management strategy to mitigate ghg emissions from aquaculture ponds credit authorship contribution statement ping yang conceptualization methodology
