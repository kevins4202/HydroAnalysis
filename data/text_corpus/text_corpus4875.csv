disturbed by humans today and pristine regions of primaeval soil on earth scarcely exist the threshold between natural and anthropogenic processes has become obscure gaiuszka 2007 furthermore a collection of expanded concepts such as ambient background anthropogenic background and area background have been frequently addressed to substitute the perturbed but no longer pristine natural background in recent studies mikkonen et al 2017 2018 the synonymous terms include not only geogenic and biological formations of a given substance but also diffuse sources with low emission levels department of ecology 2001 gaiuszka 2007 naval facilities engineering service center 2002 for instance ambient background has been defined by a us governmental document as the concentrations of substances in the environment that are representative of the region surrounding the site and not attributable to an identifiable release natural resources and environmental protection cabinet 2004 such notions have also been referred to in the european standard on anthropogenic background estimation iso 2018 in this context knowledge has been frequently applied in the detection of soil contamination in densely populated areas micó et al 2007 xie et al 2021 therefore knowledge of the ambient background concentrations provides an effective tool in the identification of point pollution sources in regional and global environmental policy decisions polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs as typical persistent organic pollutants pops have received great attention due to their properties of environmental persistence degradation resistance and long distance transportation they are found ubiquitously in various mediums such as soil water sediment and air abbas et al 2022 khalil et al 2022 zhang et al 2018 for instance pahs into airborne particulates can also be transported to the atmosphere and deposited in soil either temporarily or permanently due to their high toxicity mutagenicity and carcinogenicity 16 pahs have been designated as priority compounds of concern by the united states environmental protection agency usepa 2007 wise et al 2015 as an important sink of pahs urban soils have experienced intensive disturbances from urbanization and industrialization especially in some developing countries liu et al 2017 monaco et al 2017 suman et al 2016 previous studies on pah concentrations in urban soils have mainly focused on concentrations and distribution source identification and health risk assessment bilen and turan 2022 gupta and kumar 2020 liu et al 2019 tauqeer et al 2022 it has been reported that pahs originate mainly from natural sources forest fire and volcano eruption and anthropogenic discharge biomass combustion vehicle emissions and industrial production yan et al 2019 pahs in urban soils are mainly attributed to the incomplete combustion of organic carbon far outstripping the natural formation buczyńska et al 2013 considering the semi volatility of pahs the concentrations of organic pollutants in soil eventually reach an equilibrium in the environment with low input by diffuse pollution enabling an evaluation of the ambient background of organic pollutants however there are no effective techniques or criteria regarding the ambient background on organic pollutants such as pahs gałuszka and migaszewski 2011 although many countries have published quality standards for soil pahs to implement target values with different levels depa 2005 swartjes 2003 usepa 2007 those standards are mostly used as general guidelines and are more concerned with the potential risk to humans and ecosystems than with revealing the accumulation properties of contaminants however the latter is a more unambiguous and pertinent reference that can be used to identify contamination levels of urban soils therefore it is more reasonable to propose the ambient background concentration of pahs for discriminating between diffuse pollution accumulation and specific contamination activities in urban environmental risk assessment and contaminated land management currently three types of methods are widely used in the estimation of geochemical or ambient background concentrations including direct indirect and integrated methods gałuszka and migaszewski 2011 the direct methods which are also known geochemical methods aim to collect samples representing the real preindustrial period conditions in purely pristine areas baize and sterckeman 2001 crommentuijn et al 2000 meanwhile the indirect methods are also referred as statistical methods matschullat et al 2000 the methods employ random statistical calculative or graphical techniques to distinguish valid information from raw databases and to deduce the probable range of geogenic or ambient background values the most frequently employed approaches include mean 2 times standard deviations mean 2σ 4σ iterative 2σ calculated distribution function and so on gaiuszka 2007 matschullat et al 2000 all of these approaches propose to eliminate outliers by reducing the raw dataset to obtain an updated clean dataset moreover the integrated method combines both direct and indirect methods in this method the soil samples are purposely collected from presumptively pristine or low pollution areas the calculation of background values is governed by statistical analyses gałuszka and migaszewski 2011 kicińska and turek 2017 obviously both direct and integrated methods aim to determine the pristine natural background level however the indirect methods are more suitable for estimating the ambient background levels of contaminants e g pahs in urban soils because the enrichment of diffuse anthropogenic pollution can be included furthermore mass balance based modeling can also perform an effective mathematical tool and provide a clear depiction in tracking of contaminant fate and transport with economical but determinant parameters patureau et al 2021 yuan et al 2020 the macau special administrative region of china is an international trade tourist and fishing center it is one of the core cities in the guangdong hong kong macau greater bay area which is supported by chinese government policies and positioned to become a vibrant world class city cluster the central committee of the communist party of china and the state council 2019 macau is one of the most densely populated cities in the world reaching a population density of 20 thousand per km2 in 2018 statistics and census service 2019 as the pillar of the economy casinos dominate the gross domestic product gdp of the city heavy industrial manufacturing on the other hand made insignificant contributions to the local economy accounting for only 15 of 932 industrial establishments and accounting for only 1 2 of macau s total value statistics and census service 2019 our previous study has demonstrated that the pollution discharge on local soils is characterized by diffuse sources with few specific industrial site releases xie et al 2021 therefore macau provides a template for the proposal and application of ambient background determination of urban soils the up to date regional geochemical information on the heavy metals and pahs have been partly published xie et al 2021 the threshold levels of pahs are serious barriers for local and national soil environmental quality monitoring and policy making nevertheless they are still absent with the ambient background concepts and purposes therein the main objectives of this study were to 1 estimate the ambient background values of pahs in macau soil based on statistical models and 2 testify the estimated ambient background concentrations by simulating the pah accumulation process 2 material and methods 2 1 study area macau 22 06 39 22 13 06 n 113 31 33 113 35 43 e is situated on the western side of the pearl river delta bordering guangdong province to the north and facing the south china sea to the southeast it consists of the macau peninsula the northern part which is connected to zhuhai china and an island containing coloane and taipa the southern part which is now incorporated into one land mass by a landfill fig 1 the city has a history of integrated eastern and western civilization that has lasted for over 450 years accordingly macau has become a world renowned city with historical and cultural sites and beautiful scenery the local territorial area expanded from 11 6 km2 in 1912 to 32 8 km2 in 2018 approximately 60 of its domain was formed by reclamation the population of macau reached approximately 667 000 in 2018 making the region one of the most populous areas on the planet statistics and census service 2019 macau has a typical subtropical oceanic monsoon climate with abundant heat abundant rain high temperature and humidity the average daily maximum air temperature of july and august 2018 exceeded 35 8 c heavy rains frequently arrive from may to september and are accompanied by typhoons tropical cyclones statistics and census service 2019 2 2 sampling in total thirty one sampling grids were latticed 1 km 1 km according to the geographic characteristics of macau in each grid undisturbed surface soil sites with a depth of 10 cm from residential areas and urban parks were collected fig 1 five surface soil cores from each site were uniformly mixed to form a composite sample to represent the grid appropriately after the removal of litter and debris soil samples were sieved through 2 mm openings at 4 c for further analysis the soil sampling was carried out in july and august of 2018 2 3 statistical description of pah concentrations in soil in macau according to our previous study xie et al 2021 the epa standard method 8270c was used to determine the following 16 priority pahs naphthalene nap acenaphthylene acpy acenaphthene acp fluorene fl phenanthrene phe anthracene ant fluoranthene flt pyrene pyr benzo a anthracene baa chrysene chr benzo b fluorantene bbf benzo k fluoranthene bkf benzo a pyrene bap indeno 1 2 3 cd pyrene ind dibenzo a h anthracene dba and benzo g h i perylene bghip the general description of 16 priority pahs and their total concentrations in macau soils are summarized in table 1 2 4 estimation of ambient background value 2 4 1 mean 2σ method historically the mean 2σ is the first formula for geochemical background evaluation hawkes and webb 1963 the formula is the primary method and is simplified to exhibit a rational concentration range the normal range in a specific area for a given substance means that approximately 95 of the samples are within this range although the obtained concentration range contains sufficient information on the natural or ambient concentrations it is still necessary to include expert knowledge to realistically assess the influences of natural processes and the ambient environment matschullat et al 2000 2 4 2 lepeltier technique lepeltier 1969 proposed a graphical method by evaluating cumulative sums in double logarithmic scale graphs a deviation from the log normal distribution could appear as a bend in the relative cumulative frequencies the bend divides the curve into two parts the sub collective with low frequencies could be regarded as the threshold value mean 2σ of the potential geographic background or background with low but constant disturbances while the samples in the other sub collective could be considered as anomalies that would be eliminated 2 4 3 iterative 2σ technique the iterative 2σ method is a technique that screens appropriate data repeatedly to define the background values erhardt et al 1996 the samples beyond the mean 2σ range of the raw dataset are eliminated using this method the calculation process is iterative until the remaining samples remain stable within the interval finally the remaining samples are composed as an approximated normal distribution the mean 2σ of the latest collective would be determined as the ambient background level the iterative technique is a more radical and mathematically accurate method but is less robust than previous methods due to its algorithm matschullat et al 2000 2 4 4 calculated distribution function it is well known that the essential concept of a closed system steady state equation is that the total amount of chemical present must equal the sum of the individual amounts in each compartment mackay and donald 2001 a high accumulation in one certain part due to human activities could result in a high depletion in other parts of the natural system this law generally works for traced elements because most organic pollutants are artificially generated obbard et al 2007 thus there is an assumption that the natural process distribution function of the chemicals will be constructed when a balance is reached between input and output the lower side represents the depletion of the chemicals while the higher side represents the enrichment of the chemicals in the background value estimation the dataset from the minimum to median value represents undisturbed samples with diffuse pollution while the values larger than the median value are treated as outliers from point source pollution in this method every single value under the median is mirrored against the median by adding the difference from the original value to the median the values in the original sub collective that are larger than the median are replaced by the newly calculated values to obtain a new sequence the updated dataset which is symmetrical to its median would be reformed and represent the natural process function matschullat et al 2000 the calculated values of the mean 2σ method of the updated samples are then taken as the ambient background values of the raw dataset when estimating the ambient background values of pahs the calculation distribution function is also appropriate under the assumption that the median value should be set as the threshold between natural or diffuse processes and a high intensity of anthropogenic activities gao et al 2020 2 5 verifying the estimation of ambient background of pahs a mass balanced regression model was introduced as a tool to verify the accuracies of statistical techniques used to estimate ambient background values in this study the mathematical model was proposed by peng 2015 and first applied in simulating the temporal dynamic accumulation of soil pah concentrations in beijing similarly the distribution of pah concentrations as well as the urbanization properties in this study possessed high spatiotemporal heterogeneity thus it would be reasonable to apply the model to simulate the accumulation process as a function of urbanization duration and further deduce the ambient background concentrations of pahs in macau soils specifically according to the conservation of mass balance in a given system a quantitative change in pah concentrations concerning a period of urbanization could be delivered using the following mathematical equation 1 m t i 0 k l k i e k i t m 0 i 0 k l k i e k l t where m t is a function of the pah concentration ng g 1 at the moment of the t th urbanized year i0 is the baseline input of pahs at the initial time that urbanization begins ng g 1 yr 1 k i is the input rate constant of pahs in the soil yr 1 kl is the loss rate constant yr 1 m 0 is the baseline pah level at the initial time ng g 1 and t denotes the number of urbanization years since pahs have been deposited in the soils a set of parameters including m 0 i0 ki and kl were preset to determine the m t at a definite t th year the history of soils cannot be traced from the 16th century to the present however the soil samples that were collected at different locations could document different urbanization durations from the official statistical data released by the cartography and cadastre bureau direcção dos serviços de cartografia e cadastro the locations where soils were collected could be retroactively determined from 1912 to 2006 based on the memory of local historical materials therefore the sampling locations have different time spans from 12 to 106 years a location with an age of t would then be described as an experience of 106 t years of urbanization the urbanization time was then denoted as x years in eq 2 where 2 x 106 t in this manner eq 3 would be rephrased as follows 3 m x i 0 e 106 k i k l k i m 0 e k l t i 0 e 106 k i k l k i e k l k i x the function of m t was then transformed to a new mathematical expression of m x with respect to t then the pah concentrations with respect to its urbanization age at a given location would be fitted correspondingly according to eq 4 the whole set of parameters including m 0 ki and kl could be deduced however there is still high uncertainty and freedom in the function due to the multiple unknown parameters prerequisites are predetermined to improve the robustness of the modeling simulation for instance the empirical decay rates half lives of pahs at low concentrations in soil were confined to a range for the loss rate kl in eq 3 for reference aronson et al 1998 wild et al 1991 the results of the dynamic simulation would thus become stable and robust and the fitting results barely changed until up to approximately 25 of samples were randomly removed therefore the mass balanced model illustrates the approximate accumulation patterns of pahs at a given urbanized duration moreover the values at a steady state with dynamic equilibrium concentrations were expected to be obtained in the temporal simulation of pah accumulation in macau soils 2 6 ambient background validity with bootstrap resampling to avoid the limitation of the small size of the samples in this study bootstrap resampling method was introduced bootstrapping is an internal validation technique which is more efficient compared to other common methods for model validity kuhn and johnson 2013 steyerberg et al 2003 through bootstrapping the sampling distribution of an estimator replaces the original sample with such resampling process bootstrap makes full use of the dataset for developing and validating models as well as providing error estimates that might have only relatively low variability and minimal bias steyerberg et al 2001 tran and tran 2016 2 7 data analysis microsoft excel was used to describe the general statistical analyses and background value estimation mean 2σ and iterative 2σ methods of pah concentrations in macau soils the background evaluation plots formed using the lepeltier method and calculated distribution function were depicted by python 3 8 additionally rstudio version 3 4 3 was used for parameter estimation and regression fitting of the temporal accumulation simulation based on the mass balanced regression model peng et al 2015 because unaccountable and complicated human activities frequently result in anomalous pah concentrations in urban areas a log transform with the kolmogorov smirnov test was performed to obtain an approximate normal distribution during the data processing of ambient background scheming and regression modeling besides the samples with high standardized residuals that were scattered outside of the 95 confidence intervals were marked as outlying data and removed from the raw dataset in the mass balanced regression process bootstrap resampling was run 1000 times and constructed confidence interval of the bias corrected bootstrap interval with the incorporation of an acceleration constant tran and tran 2016 spss was performed to run the regression model and to derive the bootstrap confidence intervals at 95 confidence levels 3 results and discussion 3 1 the ambient background concentrations of pahs in macau soils the ambient background concentrations of pahs were estimated specifically phe and flt were considered as examples because they were two of the dominant pah compounds table 2 the results of their ambient background concentrations according to the lepeltier distribution and calculated distribution function are also displayed in fig 2 the ambient background concentrations of the remaining compounds are further shown in supplementary table 1 generally the ambient background concentrations estimated using different methods were considerably but reasonably different for the given pah compounds in table 2 among all the methods the mean 2σ method provided the largest mean values and the widest background ranges because of the integrity of the original dataset in contrast the lepeltier distribution and iterative 2σ method possessed the lowest mean values and the narrowest ranges due to their distinctive algorithms with regard to the lepitier distribution method the magnitudes of pah ambient background values were more dependent upon the chemical composition of the compounds that is for lmw pahs the estimated ambient background values by the lepitier method were close to those estimated using the mean 2σ method in contrast for hmw pahs both the means and the ranges of ambient background values estimated by the lepeltier method became much lower the disagreement in the different molecular weights of pah congeners by the lepitier method relied on the emergence of the deviation from the cumulative frequency distribution it has also been reported that lmw pahs especially nap acy and phe exist in the atmosphere in gaseous phase and are transported long distances jones et al 1992 wild and jones 1995 accordingly they had a rather even distribution pattern for most samples which was also demonstrated by the results of the general description thus the transition points for lmw pahs in the lepeltier distribution were detected at a relatively high cumulative frequency however hmw pahs especially flt pry baa chr bap ind daa and bghip which generally originated from local combustion processes had much higher standard deviations as discussed as a result their transition points in the lepeltier curves were much lower the critical points showed up at a very early cumulative frequency once a higher level of anthropogenic activity was introduced fig 2a thus the function was more sensitive in predicting the emergence of scattered pollution and estimating the background values of hmw pahs with respect to the iterative 2σ technique the even lower ambient background value could be attributed to the iterative process the iteration diminished the size of the dataset and further lowered the means and the upper limits of the ambient background ranges considerably matschullat et al 2000 due to the strict screening in shaping the normal distribution of the dataset the iterative 2σ approach has been widely considered as the most susceptible to outliers kicińska and turek 2017 therefore the method could be successfully applied to regional studies diez et al 2007 wojciech et al 2010 moreover the calculated distribution function based estimation for lmw pahs followed a similar pattern as that of the lepeltier function because of the constantly low accumulation rate of lmw pahs the ambient background concentrations from the calculated distribution function fig 2b resembled their means of the original datasets table 2 and lepiltier curves fig 2a because the newly constructed distribution function did not significantly alter the cumulative frequency of the original curve at the beginning stage however for most hmw pahs the background values estimated by the calculated distribution function were much lower than the corresponding means because of the thorough construction of the data distribution the ambient background values were higher than the results of lepeltier because of the sharp sensitivity of the latter function for the induction of hmw pahs however there have not been any convincing criteria of methods used to detect ambient background levels as a reference for comparison therefore a model for simulating the pah accumulation process should be further employed as a tool to verify the credibility of the estimated results according to different techniques 3 2 mass balance based regression modeling of pah accumulation in macau soils the concentrations of the 16 epa priority pahs of soils were delineated with their corresponding urbanization time in macau according to eq 3 the results showed that the concentrations of pah compounds as well as the σpahs in soil could be significantly fitted with urbanization duration p 0 0001 the geogenic background concentrations for most pahs and σpahs according to the mass balanced model were deduced and are exhibited in fig 3 and table 3 the scattered concentrations are presented within the 95 confidence and prediction intervals in fig 3 moreover the fitting curves except that for chy followed a similar dynamic accumulation pattern the concentrations of pahs started from the natural background with relatively low values at the beginning of the development age then the curve experienced a general upward trend along with the urbanization process the circulation of pahs between soil and air with a constant input of low intensity eventually reached equilibrium at a certain age harner et al 2001 liu et al 2010 wei et al 2015 the pah concentration at the steady state did not fluctuate remarkably until an intensive anthropogenic disturbance was suddenly introduced the value in the equilibrium state was considered as a reference of the ambient background at a steady urbanization level with little or diffuse pollution at a regional scale a set of parameters m0 ki and kl which determined the curve patterns and regression accuracy are also listed in table 3 based on the primary parameters the dynamic accumulation processes of pahs were simulated to represent the migration pattern of the semi volatile species in soil during the given urbanization duration the adjusted r2 of the regression model for pah congeners ranged from 17 3 to 59 8 p 0 0001 showing the model had acceptable correlation coefficients specifically the parameter m 0 denoted the initial concentration of a given pah in the simulated urbanization period and this value closely approximated its natural generated background the values of m 0 as well as the estimated geogenic background levels were rather low for most compounds showing that the natural baselines before the denoted urbanization duration were of marginal quantities only nap flt pyr and chr had geogenic background values i e m 0 higher than 1 ng g nap had the largest value of 6 82 ng g and nap has a vapor pressure of 0 085 mm hg at 25 c indicates that nap exists solely as a vapor phase in the atmosphere ambrose et al 1975 therefore relatively high concentrations of these compounds have also been frequently documented in the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area chan et al 2017 chen et al 2005 pintado herrera et al 2017 zhang et al 2006 though it is assumed that the input output of the pollutants in the current model would remain at consistent rates however it is difficult to distinguish exactly when the accumulation of pahs in soils is initiated and how it might be impacted by specific events at certain moments the parameter ki was positive for all pahs indicating a positive correlation between pah concentrations and urbanization processes in macau however the values for all the compounds were rather low indicating a low accumulation rate during the long term urbanization process lee et al 2001 also documented that low concentrations of pahs in the atmosphere were observed in the neighboring city hong kong additionally a minimal and even negative ki value in the estimation of the bap concentration using the model was observed by peng 2015 the result was due to the low discharge rate of the local airborne pollutant it is worth noting that the environmental fate of pahs is significantly affected by climates the residence times of pahs are shorter in subtropical tropical soils than in temperate soils due mainly to high rates of decomposition arising from higher temperatures and moisture levels in subtropical tropical regions okere and semple 2011 wilcke et al 2003 the ambient background values of nap phe and bghip were the predominant compounds with valid concentrations as shown in table 4 it made sense that the dominant values from the modeling simulation did not correspond to every one of those based on the statistical estimation because the simulation is mainly inclined to develop a tendency of accumulation processes with regard to urbanization duration rather than elementary statistics alone for instance the ambient background concentration of chr was not obtained in this study due to its poor convergence of the samples under the current urbanization level with scattered pollution the verification of the statistical techniques used to estimate the ambient background of pahs in urban soils was also performed and shown in table 4 by comparing the results obtained from the statistical models with those obtained from the mathematical modeling simulation the simulated ambient values were generally consistent with those in one or more approaches it could be inferred that most statistical methods could be applied to estimate similar homologous pollutants in most regions or areas with little or diffuse pollution sources specifically for hmw pahs bkf bap ind dba and bghip the ambient background values calculated using the mean 2σ method were almost equal to the mass balanced model simulated values for lmw pahs acpy acp fl and phe the values by the calculated distribution function might be closer to the results of the model simulation nevertheless due to the size and the even statistical distribution of datasets the lepeltier method could be lagged in determining the transition points for some lmw pahs but could be sensitive in terms of the hmw pahs additionally the idealization of the dataset by eliminating the outliers in the iterative 2σ method could cause a distortion in the original information in addition the spatial distributions of the potential point source pollution of pah compounds based on the different ambient background estimation methods mean 2σ and mass balanced models are illustrated in fig 4 again phe and flt were taken as examples of lmw and hmw pah compounds respectively there were slight differences between the distributions of the point source pollution sites for different pah compounds according to either estimation method the reason is that the anthropogenic emission sources of lmw and hmw pah compounds were disparate stogiannidis and laane 2015 tan et al 2022 for the spatial distributions of point source polluted sites for pah compounds by mean 2σ method fig 4a 4b and 4c approximately half of the sites in the study area had evidence of point source pollution inputs which indicated that a proximity of normal distribution of the datasets for different compounds for the spatial distribution of the point source polluted sites by mass balanced model fig 4d 4e and 4f the sites were similar to the corresponding results detected by mean 2σ which validated the applicability of the ambient background estimation by different statistical methods the results of the spatial distributions in fig 4 by different models also agreed with the statistical comparisons in table 4 in general the identified potential source polluted sites with intensive anthropogenic activities were concentrated in macau peninsula while the intensive anthropogenic discharges were much less in coloane and taipa the distribution of the potential polluted sites was also consistent with the previous pollution degree evaluation of the contaminants in macau xie et al 2021 background estimation of chemicals is an effective tool in declaring the pollution activities micó et al 2007 though the sites were detected as potential point source pollution in fig 4 there were still an upper limit or confidence bands in the different models the pah concentrations in few sites exceeded the upper limits of the ambient backgrounds in the models therefore further scrutinies are still necessary to assess the potential pollution levels and identify the specific anthropogenic activities 3 3 model uncertainty the results of the ambient backgrounds using mean 2σ by bootstrap analysis are presented in table 5 the absolute deviation of the means of the resampling datasets from the original samples for pah congeners ranged from 2 26 for fl to 9 40 for ind the absolute deviation of the ambient backgrounds of the resampling datasets from the original samples for pah congeners ranged from 1 86 for fl to 4 60 for flt the accumulation and distribution of σpahs in the resampling dataset showed no deviation in the means and the ambient background intervals between the original samples and resampling dataset the results of bootstrap resampling showed that the original dataset was representative for the concentration distribution in the study area therefore the ambient background estimation based on the original data was reliable although the estimated values according to those statistical methods were essentially in agreement with the results of mass balanced regression model and the methods according to the original dataset proved to be reliable there were currently considerable uncertainty associated with the existing estimates of ambient background values for instance there were still matching disagreements for baa and chr regarding the results between the models the samples with abnormal concentrations could either distort the background estimation in statistical methods for baa or misguide the accumulation trend of the modeling simulation a tendency of convergence was not discovered for chr the uncertainty in the background levels estimation of the models could mainly be attributed to 1 the complexity of land use types in the city in macau residential areas and urban parks are the most frequent land use types in the study area thus the different emission patterns between local residential communities and parks due to the certain anthropogenic activities might influence the ambient background estimation of pahs 2 the contributions of pahs between point contamination and diffuse contamination it is challenging to distinguish scattered point source pollution from diffuse source discharges for some pollutants in urban environments pahs emissions from the sources might also disturb the estimation of ambient background levels in this study macau has few specific industrial site releases and the inputs of pahs from the neighboring cities were not extremely high chen et al 2005 zhang et al 2006 however when the models are applied to other cases specific point pollution from local anthropogenic activities and diffuse pollution from the neighboring cities by long distance transportation should not be excluded what is more the mass balanced regression model barely relied on the urbanization duration in the dynamic simulation of pah accumulation in urban areas the accuracy of the simulation process for the ambient background technique also remained convincing by predetermining the parameters ki and kl with precise monitoring data therefore to improve the accuracies of different approaches the careful selection and criteria of data processing for ambient background estimation are further required 4 conclusion 1 the ambient background concentrations of pahs in macau soils were estimated according to the following methods mean 2σ lepeltier function iterative 2σ and calculated distribution function because of the distribution pattern of samples and the algorithms of the methods the results from different methods were reasonably different 2 a mass balanced regression model with respect to urbanization duration was deployed to test the estimation of ambient background concentrations the simulation results generally agreed with the results from the statistical estimation however clarification of pahs accumulation processes by assigning model parameters is essential to calculate the ambient backgrounds 3 uncertainty analysis by bootstrap resampling was further applied to verify the reliability of the ambient background estimation the results of the error estimation confirmed that the dataset size in this study did not confine the stability of the estimation the models proposed are proved feasible however a rigorous screening for different approaches is still necessary credit authorship contribution statement tian xie conceptualization writing original draft data

background in recent studies mikkonen et al 2017 2018 the synonymous terms include not only geogenic and biological formations of a given substance but also diffuse sources with low emission levels department of ecology 2001 gaiuszka 2007 naval facilities engineering service center 2002 for instance ambient background has been defined by a us governmental document as the concentrations of substances in the environment that are representative of the region surrounding the site and not attributable to an identifiable release natural resources and environmental protection cabinet 2004 such notions have also been referred to in the european standard on anthropogenic background estimation iso 2018 in this context knowledge has been frequently applied in the detection of soil contamination in densely populated areas micó et al 2007 xie et al 2021 therefore knowledge of the ambient background concentrations provides an effective tool in the identification of point pollution sources in regional and global environmental policy decisions polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs as typical persistent organic pollutants pops have received great attention due to their properties of environmental persistence degradation resistance and long distance transportation they are found ubiquitously in various mediums such as soil water sediment and air abbas et al 2022 khalil et al 2022 zhang et al 2018 for instance pahs into airborne particulates can also be transported to the atmosphere and deposited in soil either temporarily or permanently due to their high toxicity mutagenicity and carcinogenicity 16 pahs have been designated as priority compounds of concern by the united states environmental protection agency usepa 2007 wise et al 2015 as an important sink of pahs urban soils have experienced intensive disturbances from urbanization and industrialization especially in some developing countries liu et al 2017 monaco et al 2017 suman et al 2016 previous studies on pah concentrations in urban soils have mainly focused on concentrations and distribution source identification and health risk assessment bilen and turan 2022 gupta and kumar 2020 liu et al 2019 tauqeer et al 2022 it has been reported that pahs originate mainly from natural sources forest fire and volcano eruption and anthropogenic discharge biomass combustion vehicle emissions and industrial production yan et al 2019 pahs in urban soils are mainly attributed to the incomplete combustion of organic carbon far outstripping the natural formation buczyńska et al 2013 considering the semi volatility of pahs the concentrations of organic pollutants in soil eventually reach an equilibrium in the environment with low input by diffuse pollution enabling an evaluation of the ambient background of organic pollutants however there are no effective techniques or criteria regarding the ambient background on organic pollutants such as pahs gałuszka and migaszewski 2011 although many countries have published quality standards for soil pahs to implement target values with different levels depa 2005 swartjes 2003 usepa 2007 those standards are mostly used as general guidelines and are more concerned with the potential risk to humans and ecosystems than with revealing the accumulation properties of contaminants however the latter is a more unambiguous and pertinent reference that can be used to identify contamination levels of urban soils therefore it is more reasonable to propose the ambient background concentration of pahs for discriminating between diffuse pollution accumulation and specific contamination activities in urban environmental risk assessment and contaminated land management currently three types of methods are widely used in the estimation of geochemical or ambient background concentrations including direct indirect and integrated methods gałuszka and migaszewski 2011 the direct methods which are also known geochemical methods aim to collect samples representing the real preindustrial period conditions in purely pristine areas baize and sterckeman 2001 crommentuijn et al 2000 meanwhile the indirect methods are also referred as statistical methods matschullat et al 2000 the methods employ random statistical calculative or graphical techniques to distinguish valid information from raw databases and to deduce the probable range of geogenic or ambient background values the most frequently employed approaches include mean 2 times standard deviations mean 2σ 4σ iterative 2σ calculated distribution function and so on gaiuszka 2007 matschullat et al 2000 all of these approaches propose to eliminate outliers by reducing the raw dataset to obtain an updated clean dataset moreover the integrated method combines both direct and indirect methods in this method the soil samples are purposely collected from presumptively pristine or low pollution areas the calculation of background values is governed by statistical analyses gałuszka and migaszewski 2011 kicińska and turek 2017 obviously both direct and integrated methods aim to determine the pristine natural background level however the indirect methods are more suitable for estimating the ambient background levels of contaminants e g pahs in urban soils because the enrichment of diffuse anthropogenic pollution can be included furthermore mass balance based modeling can also perform an effective mathematical tool and provide a clear depiction in tracking of contaminant fate and transport with economical but determinant parameters patureau et al 2021 yuan et al 2020 the macau special administrative region of china is an international trade tourist and fishing center it is one of the core cities in the guangdong hong kong macau greater bay area which is supported by chinese government policies and positioned to become a vibrant world class city cluster the central committee of the communist party of china and the state council 2019 macau is one of the most densely populated cities in the world reaching a population density of 20 thousand per km2 in 2018 statistics and census service 2019 as the pillar of the economy casinos dominate the gross domestic product gdp of the city heavy industrial manufacturing on the other hand made insignificant contributions to the local economy accounting for only 15 of 932 industrial establishments and accounting for only 1 2 of macau s total value statistics and census service 2019 our previous study has demonstrated that the pollution discharge on local soils is characterized by diffuse sources with few specific industrial site releases xie et al 2021 therefore macau provides a template for the proposal and application of ambient background determination of urban soils the up to date regional geochemical information on the heavy metals and pahs have been partly published xie et al 2021 the threshold levels of pahs are serious barriers for local and national soil environmental quality monitoring and policy making nevertheless they are still absent with the ambient background concepts and purposes therein the main objectives of this study were to 1 estimate the ambient background values of pahs in macau soil based on statistical models and 2 testify the estimated ambient background concentrations by simulating the pah accumulation process 2 material and methods 2 1 study area macau 22 06 39 22 13 06 n 113 31 33 113 35 43 e is situated on the western side of the pearl river delta bordering guangdong province to the north and facing the south china sea to the southeast it consists of the macau peninsula the northern part which is connected to zhuhai china and an island containing coloane and taipa the southern part which is now incorporated into one land mass by a landfill fig 1 the city has a history of integrated eastern and western civilization that has lasted for over 450 years accordingly macau has become a world renowned city with historical and cultural sites and beautiful scenery the local territorial area expanded from 11 6 km2 in 1912 to 32 8 km2 in 2018 approximately 60 of its domain was formed by reclamation the population of macau reached approximately 667 000 in 2018 making the region one of the most populous areas on the planet statistics and census service 2019 macau has a typical subtropical oceanic monsoon climate with abundant heat abundant rain high temperature and humidity the average daily maximum air temperature of july and august 2018 exceeded 35 8 c heavy rains frequently arrive from may to september and are accompanied by typhoons tropical cyclones statistics and census service 2019 2 2 sampling in total thirty one sampling grids were latticed 1 km 1 km according to the geographic characteristics of macau in each grid undisturbed surface soil sites with a depth of 10 cm from residential areas and urban parks were collected fig 1 five surface soil cores from each site were uniformly mixed to form a composite sample to represent the grid appropriately after the removal of litter and debris soil samples were sieved through 2 mm openings at 4 c for further analysis the soil sampling was carried out in july and august of 2018 2 3 statistical description of pah concentrations in soil in macau according to our previous study xie et al 2021 the epa standard method 8270c was used to determine the following 16 priority pahs naphthalene nap acenaphthylene acpy acenaphthene acp fluorene fl phenanthrene phe anthracene ant fluoranthene flt pyrene pyr benzo a anthracene baa chrysene chr benzo b fluorantene bbf benzo k fluoranthene bkf benzo a pyrene bap indeno 1 2 3 cd pyrene ind dibenzo a h anthracene dba and benzo g h i perylene bghip the general description of 16 priority pahs and their total concentrations in macau soils are summarized in table 1 2 4 estimation of ambient background value 2 4 1 mean 2σ method historically the mean 2σ is the first formula for geochemical background evaluation hawkes and webb 1963 the formula is the primary method and is simplified to exhibit a rational concentration range the normal range in a specific area for a given substance means that approximately 95 of the samples are within this range although the obtained concentration range contains sufficient information on the natural or ambient concentrations it is still necessary to include expert knowledge to realistically assess the influences of natural processes and the ambient environment matschullat et al 2000 2 4 2 lepeltier technique lepeltier 1969 proposed a graphical method by evaluating cumulative sums in double logarithmic scale graphs a deviation from the log normal distribution could appear as a bend in the relative cumulative frequencies the bend divides the curve into two parts the sub collective with low frequencies could be regarded as the threshold value mean 2σ of the potential geographic background or background with low but constant disturbances while the samples in the other sub collective could be considered as anomalies that would be eliminated 2 4 3 iterative 2σ technique the iterative 2σ method is a technique that screens appropriate data repeatedly to define the background values erhardt et al 1996 the samples beyond the mean 2σ range of the raw dataset are eliminated using this method the calculation process is iterative until the remaining samples remain stable within the interval finally the remaining samples are composed as an approximated normal distribution the mean 2σ of the latest collective would be determined as the ambient background level the iterative technique is a more radical and mathematically accurate method but is less robust than previous methods due to its algorithm matschullat et al 2000 2 4 4 calculated distribution function it is well known that the essential concept of a closed system steady state equation is that the total amount of chemical present must equal the sum of the individual amounts in each compartment mackay and donald 2001 a high accumulation in one certain part due to human activities could result in a high depletion in other parts of the natural system this law generally works for traced elements because most organic pollutants are artificially generated obbard et al 2007 thus there is an assumption that the natural process distribution function of the chemicals will be constructed when a balance is reached between input and output the lower side represents the depletion of the chemicals while the higher side represents the enrichment of the chemicals in the background value estimation the dataset from the minimum to median value represents undisturbed samples with diffuse pollution while the values larger than the median value are treated as outliers from point source pollution in this method every single value under the median is mirrored against the median by adding the difference from the original value to the median the values in the original sub collective that are larger than the median are replaced by the newly calculated values to obtain a new sequence the updated dataset which is symmetrical to its median would be reformed and represent the natural process function matschullat et al 2000 the calculated values of the mean 2σ method of the updated samples are then taken as the ambient background values of the raw dataset when estimating the ambient background values of pahs the calculation distribution function is also appropriate under the assumption that the median value should be set as the threshold between natural or diffuse processes and a high intensity of anthropogenic activities gao et al 2020 2 5 verifying the estimation of ambient background of pahs a mass balanced regression model was introduced as a tool to verify the accuracies of statistical techniques used to estimate ambient background values in this study the mathematical model was proposed by peng 2015 and first applied in simulating the temporal dynamic accumulation of soil pah concentrations in beijing similarly the distribution of pah concentrations as well as the urbanization properties in this study possessed high spatiotemporal heterogeneity thus it would be reasonable to apply the model to simulate the accumulation process as a function of urbanization duration and further deduce the ambient background concentrations of pahs in macau soils specifically according to the conservation of mass balance in a given system a quantitative change in pah concentrations concerning a period of urbanization could be delivered using the following mathematical equation 1 m t i 0 k l k i e k i t m 0 i 0 k l k i e k l t where m t is a function of the pah concentration ng g 1 at the moment of the t th urbanized year i0 is the baseline input of pahs at the initial time that urbanization begins ng g 1 yr 1 k i is the input rate constant of pahs in the soil yr 1 kl is the loss rate constant yr 1 m 0 is the baseline pah level at the initial time ng g 1 and t denotes the number of urbanization years since pahs have been deposited in the soils a set of parameters including m 0 i0 ki and kl were preset to determine the m t at a definite t th year the history of soils cannot be traced from the 16th century to the present however the soil samples that were collected at different locations could document different urbanization durations from the official statistical data released by the cartography and cadastre bureau direcção dos serviços de cartografia e cadastro the locations where soils were collected could be retroactively determined from 1912 to 2006 based on the memory of local historical materials therefore the sampling locations have different time spans from 12 to 106 years a location with an age of t would then be described as an experience of 106 t years of urbanization the urbanization time was then denoted as x years in eq 2 where 2 x 106 t in this manner eq 3 would be rephrased as follows 3 m x i 0 e 106 k i k l k i m 0 e k l t i 0 e 106 k i k l k i e k l k i x the function of m t was then transformed to a new mathematical expression of m x with respect to t then the pah concentrations with respect to its urbanization age at a given location would be fitted correspondingly according to eq 4 the whole set of parameters including m 0 ki and kl could be deduced however there is still high uncertainty and freedom in the function due to the multiple unknown parameters prerequisites are predetermined to improve the robustness of the modeling simulation for instance the empirical decay rates half lives of pahs at low concentrations in soil were confined to a range for the loss rate kl in eq 3 for reference aronson et al 1998 wild et al 1991 the results of the dynamic simulation would thus become stable and robust and the fitting results barely changed until up to approximately 25 of samples were randomly removed therefore the mass balanced model illustrates the approximate accumulation patterns of pahs at a given urbanized duration moreover the values at a steady state with dynamic equilibrium concentrations were expected to be obtained in the temporal simulation of pah accumulation in macau soils 2 6 ambient background validity with bootstrap resampling to avoid the limitation of the small size of the samples in this study bootstrap resampling method was introduced bootstrapping is an internal validation technique which is more efficient compared to other common methods for model validity kuhn and johnson 2013 steyerberg et al 2003 through bootstrapping the sampling distribution of an estimator replaces the original sample with such resampling process bootstrap makes full use of the dataset for developing and validating models as well as providing error estimates that might have only relatively low variability and minimal bias steyerberg et al 2001 tran and tran 2016 2 7 data analysis microsoft excel was used to describe the general statistical analyses and background value estimation mean 2σ and iterative 2σ methods of pah concentrations in macau soils the background evaluation plots formed using the lepeltier method and calculated distribution function were depicted by python 3 8 additionally rstudio version 3 4 3 was used for parameter estimation and regression fitting of the temporal accumulation simulation based on the mass balanced regression model peng et al 2015 because unaccountable and complicated human activities frequently result in anomalous pah concentrations in urban areas a log transform with the kolmogorov smirnov test was performed to obtain an approximate normal distribution during the data processing of ambient background scheming and regression modeling besides the samples with high standardized residuals that were scattered outside of the 95 confidence intervals were marked as outlying data and removed from the raw dataset in the mass balanced regression process bootstrap resampling was run 1000 times and constructed confidence interval of the bias corrected bootstrap interval with the incorporation of an acceleration constant tran and tran 2016 spss was performed to run the regression model and to derive the bootstrap confidence intervals at 95 confidence levels 3 results and discussion 3 1 the ambient background concentrations of pahs in macau soils the ambient background concentrations of pahs were estimated specifically phe and flt were considered as examples because they were two of the dominant pah compounds table 2 the results of their ambient background concentrations according to the lepeltier distribution and calculated distribution function are also displayed in fig 2 the ambient background concentrations of the remaining compounds are further shown in supplementary table 1 generally the ambient background concentrations estimated using different methods were considerably but reasonably different for the given pah compounds in table 2 among all the methods the mean 2σ method provided the largest mean values and the widest background ranges because of the integrity of the original dataset in contrast the lepeltier distribution and iterative 2σ method possessed the lowest mean values and the narrowest ranges due to their distinctive algorithms with regard to the lepitier distribution method the magnitudes of pah ambient background values were more dependent upon the chemical composition of the compounds that is for lmw pahs the estimated ambient background values by the lepitier method were close to those estimated using the mean 2σ method in contrast for hmw pahs both the means and the ranges of ambient background values estimated by the lepeltier method became much lower the disagreement in the different molecular weights of pah congeners by the lepitier method relied on the emergence of the deviation from the cumulative frequency distribution it has also been reported that lmw pahs especially nap acy and phe exist in the atmosphere in gaseous phase and are transported long distances jones et al 1992 wild and jones 1995 accordingly they had a rather even distribution pattern for most samples which was also demonstrated by the results of the general description thus the transition points for lmw pahs in the lepeltier distribution were detected at a relatively high cumulative frequency however hmw pahs especially flt pry baa chr bap ind daa and bghip which generally originated from local combustion processes had much higher standard deviations as discussed as a result their transition points in the lepeltier curves were much lower the critical points showed up at a very early cumulative frequency once a higher level of anthropogenic activity was introduced fig 2a thus the function was more sensitive in predicting the emergence of scattered pollution and estimating the background values of hmw pahs with respect to the iterative 2σ technique the even lower ambient background value could be attributed to the iterative process the iteration diminished the size of the dataset and further lowered the means and the upper limits of the ambient background ranges considerably matschullat et al 2000 due to the strict screening in shaping the normal distribution of the dataset the iterative 2σ approach has been widely considered as the most susceptible to outliers kicińska and turek 2017 therefore the method could be successfully applied to regional studies diez et al 2007 wojciech et al 2010 moreover the calculated distribution function based estimation for lmw pahs followed a similar pattern as that of the lepeltier function because of the constantly low accumulation rate of lmw pahs the ambient background concentrations from the calculated distribution function fig 2b resembled their means of the original datasets table 2 and lepiltier curves fig 2a because the newly constructed distribution function did not significantly alter the cumulative frequency of the original curve at the beginning stage however for most hmw pahs the background values estimated by the calculated distribution function were much lower than the corresponding means because of the thorough construction of the data distribution the ambient background values were higher than the results of lepeltier because of the sharp sensitivity of the latter function for the induction of hmw pahs however there have not been any convincing criteria of methods used to detect ambient background levels as a reference for comparison therefore a model for simulating the pah accumulation process should be further employed as a tool to verify the credibility of the estimated results according to different techniques 3 2 mass balance based regression modeling of pah accumulation in macau soils the concentrations of the 16 epa priority pahs of soils were delineated with their corresponding urbanization time in macau according to eq 3 the results showed that the concentrations of pah compounds as well as the σpahs in soil could be significantly fitted with urbanization duration p 0 0001 the geogenic background concentrations for most pahs and σpahs according to the mass balanced model were deduced and are exhibited in fig 3 and table 3 the scattered concentrations are presented within the 95 confidence and prediction intervals in fig 3 moreover the fitting curves except that for chy followed a similar dynamic accumulation pattern the concentrations of pahs started from the natural background with relatively low values at the beginning of the development age then the curve experienced a general upward trend along with the urbanization process the circulation of pahs between soil and air with a constant input of low intensity eventually reached equilibrium at a certain age harner et al 2001 liu et al 2010 wei et al 2015 the pah concentration at the steady state did not fluctuate remarkably until an intensive anthropogenic disturbance was suddenly introduced the value in the equilibrium state was considered as a reference of the ambient background at a steady urbanization level with little or diffuse pollution at a regional scale a set of parameters m0 ki and kl which determined the curve patterns and regression accuracy are also listed in table 3 based on the primary parameters the dynamic accumulation processes of pahs were simulated to represent the migration pattern of the semi volatile species in soil during the given urbanization duration the adjusted r2 of the regression model for pah congeners ranged from 17 3 to 59 8 p 0 0001 showing the model had acceptable correlation coefficients specifically the parameter m 0 denoted the initial concentration of a given pah in the simulated urbanization period and this value closely approximated its natural generated background the values of m 0 as well as the estimated geogenic background levels were rather low for most compounds showing that the natural baselines before the denoted urbanization duration were of marginal quantities only nap flt pyr and chr had geogenic background values i e m 0 higher than 1 ng g nap had the largest value of 6 82 ng g and nap has a vapor pressure of 0 085 mm hg at 25 c indicates that nap exists solely as a vapor phase in the atmosphere ambrose et al 1975 therefore relatively high concentrations of these compounds have also been frequently documented in the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area chan et al 2017 chen et al 2005 pintado herrera et al 2017 zhang et al 2006 though it is assumed that the input output of the pollutants in the current model would remain at consistent rates however it is difficult to distinguish exactly when the accumulation of pahs in soils is initiated and how it might be impacted by specific events at certain moments the parameter ki was positive for all pahs indicating a positive correlation between pah concentrations and urbanization processes in macau however the values for all the compounds were rather low indicating a low accumulation rate during the long term urbanization process lee et al 2001 also documented that low concentrations of pahs in the atmosphere were observed in the neighboring city hong kong additionally a minimal and even negative ki value in the estimation of the bap concentration using the model was observed by peng 2015 the result was due to the low discharge rate of the local airborne pollutant it is worth noting that the environmental fate of pahs is significantly affected by climates the residence times of pahs are shorter in subtropical tropical soils than in temperate soils due mainly to high rates of decomposition arising from higher temperatures and moisture levels in subtropical tropical regions okere and semple 2011 wilcke et al 2003 the ambient background values of nap phe and bghip were the predominant compounds with valid concentrations as shown in table 4 it made sense that the dominant values from the modeling simulation did not correspond to every one of those based on the statistical estimation because the simulation is mainly inclined to develop a tendency of accumulation processes with regard to urbanization duration rather than elementary statistics alone for instance the ambient background concentration of chr was not obtained in this study due to its poor convergence of the samples under the current urbanization level with scattered pollution the verification of the statistical techniques used to estimate the ambient background of pahs in urban soils was also performed and shown in table 4 by comparing the results obtained from the statistical models with those obtained from the mathematical modeling simulation the simulated ambient values were generally consistent with those in one or more approaches it could be inferred that most statistical methods could be applied to estimate similar homologous pollutants in most regions or areas with little or diffuse pollution sources specifically for hmw pahs bkf bap ind dba and bghip the ambient background values calculated using the mean 2σ method were almost equal to the mass balanced model simulated values for lmw pahs acpy acp fl and phe the values by the calculated distribution function might be closer to the results of the model simulation nevertheless due to the size and the even statistical distribution of datasets the lepeltier method could be lagged in determining the transition points for some lmw pahs but could be sensitive in terms of the hmw pahs additionally the idealization of the dataset by eliminating the outliers in the iterative 2σ method could cause a distortion in the original information in addition the spatial distributions of the potential point source pollution of pah compounds based on the different ambient background estimation methods mean 2σ and mass balanced models are illustrated in fig 4 again phe and flt were taken as examples of lmw and hmw pah compounds respectively there were slight differences between the distributions of the point source pollution sites for different pah compounds according to either estimation method the reason is that the anthropogenic emission sources of lmw and hmw pah compounds were disparate stogiannidis and laane 2015 tan et al 2022 for the spatial distributions of point source polluted sites for pah compounds by mean 2σ method fig 4a 4b and 4c approximately half of the sites in the study area had evidence of point source pollution inputs which indicated that a proximity of normal distribution of the datasets for different compounds for the spatial distribution of the point source polluted sites by mass balanced model fig 4d 4e and 4f the sites were similar to the corresponding results detected by mean 2σ which validated the applicability of the ambient background estimation by different statistical methods the results of the spatial distributions in fig 4 by different models also agreed with the statistical comparisons in table 4 in general the identified potential source polluted sites with intensive anthropogenic activities were concentrated in macau peninsula while the intensive anthropogenic discharges were much less in coloane and taipa the distribution of the potential polluted sites was also consistent with the previous pollution degree evaluation of the contaminants in macau xie et al 2021 background estimation of chemicals is an effective tool in declaring the pollution activities micó et al 2007 though the sites were detected as potential point source pollution in fig 4 there were still an upper limit or confidence bands in the different models the pah concentrations in few sites exceeded the upper limits of the ambient backgrounds in the models therefore further scrutinies are still necessary to assess the potential pollution levels and identify the specific anthropogenic activities 3 3 model uncertainty the results of the ambient backgrounds using mean 2σ by bootstrap analysis are presented in table 5 the absolute deviation of the means of the resampling datasets from the original samples for pah congeners ranged from 2 26 for fl to 9 40 for ind the absolute deviation of the ambient backgrounds of the resampling datasets from the original samples for pah congeners ranged from 1 86 for fl to 4 60 for flt the accumulation and distribution of σpahs in the resampling dataset showed no deviation in the means and the ambient background intervals between the original samples and resampling dataset the results of bootstrap resampling showed that the original dataset was representative for the concentration distribution in the study area therefore the ambient background estimation based on the original data was reliable although the estimated values according to those statistical methods were essentially in agreement with the results of mass balanced regression model and the methods according to the original dataset proved to be reliable there were currently considerable uncertainty associated with the existing estimates of ambient background values for instance there were still matching disagreements for baa and chr regarding the results between the models the samples with abnormal concentrations could either distort the background estimation in statistical methods for baa or misguide the accumulation trend of the modeling simulation a tendency of convergence was not discovered for chr the uncertainty in the background levels estimation of the models could mainly be attributed to 1 the complexity of land use types in the city in macau residential areas and urban parks are the most frequent land use types in the study area thus the different emission patterns between local residential communities and parks due to the certain anthropogenic activities might influence the ambient background estimation of pahs 2 the contributions of pahs between point contamination and diffuse contamination it is challenging to distinguish scattered point source pollution from diffuse source discharges for some pollutants in urban environments pahs emissions from the sources might also disturb the estimation of ambient background levels in this study macau has few specific industrial site releases and the inputs of pahs from the neighboring cities were not extremely high chen et al 2005 zhang et al 2006 however when the models are applied to other cases specific point pollution from local anthropogenic activities and diffuse pollution from the neighboring cities by long distance transportation should not be excluded what is more the mass balanced regression model barely relied on the urbanization duration in the dynamic simulation of pah accumulation in urban areas the accuracy of the simulation process for the ambient background technique also remained convincing by predetermining the parameters ki and kl with precise monitoring data therefore to improve the accuracies of different approaches the careful selection and criteria of data processing for ambient background estimation are further required 4 conclusion 1 the ambient background concentrations of pahs in macau soils were estimated according to the following methods mean 2σ lepeltier function iterative 2σ and calculated distribution function because of the distribution pattern of samples and the algorithms of the methods the results from different methods were reasonably different 2 a mass balanced regression model with respect to urbanization duration was deployed to test the estimation of ambient background concentrations the simulation results generally agreed with the results from the statistical estimation however clarification of pahs accumulation processes by assigning model parameters is essential to calculate the ambient backgrounds 3 uncertainty analysis by bootstrap resampling was further applied to verify the reliability of the ambient background estimation the results of the error estimation confirmed that the dataset size in this study did not confine the stability of the estimation the models proposed are proved feasible however a rigorous screening for different approaches is still necessary credit authorship contribution statement tian xie conceptualization writing original draft data

24376,species distribution models are popular statistical tools for inferring potential distribution range of species across space and time and are extensively used in conservation planning models based on presence only data e g maxent are widely used however these models assume perfect species detectability occupancy modelling is considered a better modelling technique since it accounts for species detectability presence only models are relatively simpler requiring only presence locations while occupancy models are data hungry models requiring detection non detection data from multiple visits to the survey sites we utilized data from the kerala bird atlas india and modelled current distribution for 109 species using maxent and occupancy approaches maxent performed well even with less occurrences while occupancy model failed for species with fewer than 40 records in terms of evaluation metrics auc and root mean square error both models performed relatively better for species with low occurrences than those with high occurrences generalist species the comparison metrics relative rank scores root mean square error hellinger distance and expectation of shared presences were significantly correlated with the number of occurrences maxent and occupancy based sdms for widespread species had more concordance than sdms of narrowly distributed species there was some discordance between algorithms with regards to diversity hotspot selection of best combination of variables and correction for overprediction can help improve performances of both models and improve consistency between them given the data hungry nature of occupancy models and marginal difference with the maxent models it appears that latter is better suited for predicting the distribution of rare species and studies dealing with cumulative data from multiple species keywords kerala bird atlas maxent sdm site occupancy species detection western ghats data availability data is available from dryad repository and supplementary files the same has been mentioned in the manuscript 1 introduction accurate information on species distribution and ecological constraints are prerequisite for effective conservation measures margules and pressey 2000 extensive on ground surveys across a species distribution range to obtain this information are logistically infeasible statistical models called species distribution models or sdms provide an alternative sdms describes habitat suitability in ecological space and yield a potential distribution map when projected into geographic space phillips et al

statistically or theoretically derived response surfaces guisan and zimmermann 2000 the correlative sdms predict distributions across geographical space and can be extrapolated in space and time elith and leathwick 2009 a variety of algorithms are available to predict the spatial distribution of species but the presence only sdm approaches e g maxent random forest generalized additive models are particularly popular since ascertaining absences with confidence is tedious elith et al 2006 ecologists have used sdms for a variety of applications such as conservation planning and surveys invasive species management and predicting the impact of future climate change engler et al 2017 rahman et al 2019 jha and vasudevan 2020 sreekumar and nameer 2021 an effective sdm can accurately capture occurrence environment relationship and can reliably predict the species occurrence under given environmental conditions however most sdm algorithms assume a constant detection probability across sites failure to account for imperfect detection can compromise estimated prediction maps tyre et al 2003 gu and swihart 2004 occupancy models offer a substitute for presence absence or presence only models occupancy models can accommodate covariates associated with detection probability and the probability of occurrence can be estimated occupancy models use detection non detection data from repeated surveys at a site and simultaneously estimate the probability of occurrence and the probability of species detection mackenzie et al 2002 2006 occupancy models have been used to predict species distribution study occupancy dynamics assess impact of climate change and to address questions about ecological processes such as interspecies competition broms et al 2016 rushing et al 2019 olson et al 2005 altwegg and nichols 2019 the goal of any sdm strategy is to maximize the predictive performance of models occupancy models have the potential to improve the predictive performance of sdms by accounting for detection probability however occupancy models are more data hungry than widely used presence only models and require a larger sample size and repeated survey data perkins taylor and jennifer 2020 few studies have contrasted occupancy models with simpler sdm algorithms and have reported marginal to no significant differences in their predictive performances rota et al 2011 gormley et al 2011 lahoz monfort et al 2014 perkins taylor and frey 2020 here we assessed the predictive performance of occupancy model against maxent a presence only modelling approach which has been shown to out performs other sdm approaches elith et al 2006 phillips et al 2006 valavi et al 2022 we utilized the kerala bird atlas dataset praveen et al 2022 and generated predictive spatial maps for 109 avian species we projected the occupancy and presence only maxent sdms across kerala used four metrics relative rank scores rmse root mean square error hellinger distance and expectation of shared presences esp to compare the consistency in predictions and identified regions of discordance we were interested in knowing whether i occupancy models have higher predictive performance than presence only models ii sdm predictions from the two modelling approaches differs significantly across species iii sdm performances vary according to the number of occurrences rare versus abundant species 2 material and methods 2 1 occurrence data the surveys for the kerala bird atlas kba were conducted during 2015 2020 and species presence data was systematically collected at over 3000 sites by over 400 volunteers across 38 000 sq km area of kerala india every land use class within the state forests 28 of total land restricted to eastern mountainous region plantations and cultivated land 60 of total land and human habitat 4 of total land restricted to the west coast were adequately sampled this was achieved by dividing kerala into cells of size 6 6 km x 6 6 km each cell was further divided into four quadrants of size 3 3 km x 3 3 km and each quadrant was then sub divided into 9 sub cells of size 1 1 km x 1 1 km a single randomly selected sub cell in every quadrant was surveyed for two seasons dry mid jan to mid mar and wet mid july to mid sep figure s1 four 15 min checklists were made per sub cell per season and every bird species seen or heard during the survey was noted excluding nocturnal and pelagic species 361 species 76 families were detected 353 species 75 families in the dry season and 298 species 72 families in the wet season praveen et al 2022 we extracted the centroid of the surveyed sub cells as the exact survey locations within the sub cells were not available single season occupancy model assume that a site s occupancy status has not changed between surveys also the sampling effort repeated visits was inconsistent during the wet season due to inaccessibility of certain high elevation sites for these two reasons we used only dry season records for this analysis we marked a species as present detected if it was reported from the sub cell in any of the four visits ascertaining the absence with confidence can be tricky we marked a species as absent undetected using two criteria it was not recorded from a sub cell after four visits in both the seasons and was not reported from the corresponding cell 6 6 km x 6 6 km area either 2 2 species and variable selection we selected 109 species out of 353 species detected in the dry season excluding abundant species 1000 unique occurrences data deficient species 40 unique occurrences and 18 families of aerial feeders and water birds we excluded abundant species since sdms are known to perform poorly for such widespread and generalist species as the models fail to recognize predictor variables limiting the distribution of the species connor et al 2017 we excluded data deficient species since occupancy model failed to run with low number of occurrences during the initial trials we excluded species such as swifts swallows waders and ducks because we felt our chosen climatic and topographical variables do not capture their habitat requirements we obtained 19 bioclimatic variables from the chelsa database v 1 2 karger et al 2017 which are derived from the remotely sensed climatic data spanning 1979 2013 we obtained srtm elevation data from the usgs web portal https earthexplorer usgs gov and estimated topographic ruggedness index in arcgis 10 0 we obtained land use land cover data for the year 2020 and estimated proportion of cultivated and managed vegetation at 1 sq km cell across kerala chen et al 2022 to capture anthropogenic pressure and human density we used artificial night light layer from nasa s black marble nighttime lights product suite for january 2018 https blackmarble gsfc nasa gov román et al 2018 all layers were of 1 sq km 30 onds resolution and we cropped them for the extent of kerala in arcgis 10 0 based on the correlation matrix we retained only 8 layers for modelling table 1 figure s2 and eliminated highly correlated pearson s r 0 75 layers merow et al 2013 2 3 modelling and evaluation we fitted a single species single season occupancy model implemented in r via package unmarked fiske and chandler 2011 we used the 8 selected variables as site covariates and the time of survey varied from 0600 to 1800 as detection covariate survey effort 15 min checklists and team size 2 5 surveyors were constant across sites and were not used as detection covariates we trained the models on the repeated survey data 4 visits collected at 3195 sites for selection of optimum model best practice is to use the r function dredge which generates a set of models with combinations subsets of fixed effect terms in the global model to keep the execution time reasonable we did not use the above approach and instead fitted 30 different models each with different combination subsets of the 8 selected variables the best model with highest support across the 30 models was determined using aicc scores we generated maxent model phillips et al 2006 using the r package dismo hijmans et al 2020 we fine tuned hyper parameters regularization multiplier and features for every species using the script provided by valavi et al 2022 number of model replicates was set to 5 clamping was set to true maximum iteration was set to 5000 we excluded the variable that contributed less than 2 to the initial model and re ran a final model with the reduced set of variables occurrence records were collected in a systematic and structured manner and entire background region state of kerala was surveyed we expect no spatial bias in our dataset and hence we did not incorporate correction for spatial bias during maxent modelling we used occurrences and 10 000 random background points to train maxent model both the models were projected across the geographical space kerala using the function predict we used the area under a receiver operating characteristic curve auc and rmse to validate the accuracy of both models auc is a commonly used threshold independent accuracy index auc values of 0 5 0 7 are considered low and represent poor model performance values of 0 7 0 9 are considered moderate and values above 0 9 represent excellent model performance peterson et al 2011 rmse indicates the average distance between the predicted values from the model and the actual values in the dataset the lower the rmse the better a given model is able to fit a dataset liu et al 2011 we evaluated the occupancy model using 5 fold partition and estimated rmse metric implemented via r function crossval package unmarked to generate auc for the occupancy models we used leave one out cross validation approach sadoti et al 2017 we also used k fold partitioning to evaluate the maxent model and estimated its auc and rmse via package rocr sing et al 2005 2 4 data analysis and code availability we compared consistency of predictions between algorithms using four approaches relative rank statistic rmse hellinger s distance wilson 2011 and expectation of shared presences esp godsoe 2014 occupancy model predicts true probability of occurrence while maxent model predicts a relative likelihood of occurrence that is proportional to the actual probability of occurrence assuming constant detection probability and no sampling bias guillera arroita et al 2015 for estimating the relative rank statistic we stacked the two sdms and randomly extracted two points from the raster stack and compared their orders we noted if the ranks of the two points from occupancy model were similar to maxent model or not we extracted two such random points from the raster stack 15 000 times 35 of all non na raster cells and estimated the percentage of concurrence i e ranking of random points matched between the two sdms to estimate the other three metrics we converted occupancy and maxent raster files to a one dimensional array such that each row represents the cell location while column values represented raster values at that specific location final dataset had two columns one corresponding to occupancy output and another to the maxent we deleted all observations i e rows which had zero or na for both columns i e areas of zero prediction or those outside the outline of kerala rmse quantifies the difference between the data series being compared lower values of rmse indicate better fit the hellinger distance measures the difference between two probability density functions for continuous variables wilson 2011 in our case predicted raster values hellinger distances varies between 0 and 2 0 suggests exactly similar distribution while 2 suggests discordance between the maps godsoe s esp compares the predicted habitat potential of maxent with that of occupancy model across all cells and the value range between 0 and 1 value of one indicates perfect agreement between the two maps while a value of zero indicates complete geographic separation formulas for the metrics are provided in the r script supplementary file to obtain species richness map we stacked species sdms generated via maxent and occupancy approach separately and summed them we wished to see if the two algorithms predict same regions as biodiversity hotspot this approach is routinely used to identify areas of high biodiversity ko et al 2009 tantipisanuh and gale 2018 raman et al 2022 the list of 109 species included forest dependant and non forest dependant species since species richness maps are often used to identify areas of high conservation significance we identified 22 species of high conservation significance and assessed the species richness maps produced by maxent and occupancy algorithms for these 22 species species of conservation significance where selected on the basis of their iucn redlist status categories included cr en vu nt birdlife international 2022 state of india s birds status categories included high moderate soib 2020 and those endemic to the western ghats all analyses were done in r v 4 0 3 r core team 2022 and the r script has been provided as a supplementary file s1 the variables used for model training and for projection have been provided in table s2 and table s3 respectively the kerala bird atlas dataset with bird records is available from the dryad repository https doi org 10 5061 dryad zpc866t8g 3 results sdms based on maxent and occupancy approaches were built for 109 species of 45 families number of occurrences varied from 44 to 942 with a mean of 298 5 table s1 mean auc values for maxent and occupancy models were 0 76 0 08 and 0 77 0 10 respectively while their mean rmse scores were 0 43 0 09 and 0 16 0 07 respectively suggesting moderate performance aucs of both models were negatively correlated with the number of occurrences and while rmse were positively correlated fig 1 means of the four metrics comparing the consistency between algorithms were as follows relative rank score 0 83 0 06 rmse 0 22 0 08 esp metric 0 38 0 12 hellinger distance 0 26 0 07 fig 2 these metrics were not strongly correlated r 50 to the number of occurrence points fig 3 and were not correlated to each other as well data not shown species richness maps from the two algorithms differed with regards to the predicted areas of high biodiversity maxent predicted a larger area as biodiversity hotspot than occupancy models the difference was less pronounced when only 22 species of conservation concern were taken into consideration fig 4 4 discussion species distribution models are extensively used by researchers for biodiversity conservation and management there are multiple algorithms to build species specific sdms of which only the occupancy models explicitly addresses the problem of detectability the methodology of this study facilitated the comparison of occupancy modelling with maxent modelling using a large dataset from 109 avian species we showed that the predictive performances of maxent and occupancy models were comparable other comparative studies too have reported only a marginal improvement in the performance of occupancy approach over other sdm approaches rota et al 2011 perkins taylor and frey 2020 performances of both modelling approaches as judged using auc and rmse scores were correlated with the number of species occurrences abundant species consistently performed poorer than less abundant species this feature of maxent algorithm has been noted across many studies rota et al 2011 connor et al 2017 for over 3 4th of the species the relative rank score between occupancy and maxent models was above 0 8 gormley et al 2011 reported a strong positive correlation rs 0 89 between the rankings of cells by the two methods for sambhar deer rusa unicolour relative rank score was not related to number of occurrences but hellinger distance esp and rmse scores were it suggests that congruence between the two sdm approaches is not a general rule and varies across species both sdms predicted high elevation areas of kerala the western ghats as areas of high biodiversity however maxent predicted a much larger area than occupancy model sdm overprediction depending on the extent of analysis can lead to misleading prioritization in conservation planning velazco et al 2020 correction of sdm overprediction is crucial particularly when extent of analysis is large maxent has inbuilt clamping feature and regularization parameter to constrain features to remain within the range of values in the training data and restrict extrapolation elith et al 2011 given the computational time constraint we had set clamping to true and selected best fitting regularization parameter for all 109 species from a set of 5 values 0 5 1 2 3 4 we did not include additional habitat features that can affect detections such as canopy cover and undergrowth density these were not available for the survey sites addition of these data could have altered the performance of both algorithms and the final sdms thus there is potential to further fine tune both models for individual species data is expensive it is relatively easier to get occurrence records temporal replication of survey is more resource intensive but is it worth it has been said that performance of a model should be assessed with respect to its objectives or else the comparative studies may fail to reveal the benefits of accounting for detectability lahoz monfort et al 2014 use of occupancy models is unlikely to result in improved predictive performance when detection probability is relatively homogeneous across sites rota et al 2011 our study shows that for majority of the species presence only maxent model performs as good as occurrence model future research can explore the effect of tuning variable and parameters correction for bias in occurrences and corrections to reduce overfitting on consistency between species richness maps from maxent and occupancy models not occupancy but maxent model perform well with small sample sizes which is particularly the case for rare species hence for studies involving rare species and when dealing with multiple species data maxent should suffice for species specific studies occupancy modelling can be a better approach this information is important in a conservation

24376,species distribution models are popular statistical tools for inferring potential distribution range of species across space and time and are extensively used in conservation planning models based on presence only data e g maxent are widely used however these models assume perfect species detectability occupancy modelling is considered a better modelling technique since it accounts for species detectability presence only models are relatively simpler requiring only presence locations while occupancy models are data hungry models requiring detection non detection data from multiple visits to the survey sites we utilized data from the kerala bird atlas india and modelled current distribution for 109 species using maxent and occupancy approaches maxent performed well even with less occurrences while occupancy model failed for species with fewer than 40 records in terms of evaluation metrics auc and root mean square error both models performed relatively better for species with low occurrences than those with high occurrences generalist species the comparison metrics relative rank scores root mean square error hellinger distance and expectation of shared presences were significantly correlated with the number of occurrences maxent and occupancy based sdms for widespread species had more concordance than sdms of narrowly distributed species there was some discordance between algorithms with regards to diversity hotspot selection of best combination of variables and correction for overprediction can help improve performances of both models and improve consistency between them given the data hungry nature of occupancy models and marginal difference with the maxent models it appears that latter is better suited for predicting the distribution of rare species and

conservation measures margules and pressey 2000 extensive on ground surveys across a species distribution range to obtain this information are logistically infeasible statistical models called species distribution models or sdms provide an alternative sdms describes habitat suitability in ecological space and yield a potential distribution map when projected into geographic space phillips et al 2006 sdms achieve this by correlating field observations presences only or presences absences or presences pseudo absences or presences background points to environmental predictor variables based on statistically or theoretically derived response surfaces guisan and zimmermann 2000 the correlative sdms predict distributions across geographical space and can be extrapolated in space and time elith and leathwick 2009 a variety of algorithms are available to predict the spatial distribution of species but the presence only sdm approaches e g maxent random forest generalized additive models are particularly popular since ascertaining absences with confidence is tedious elith et al 2006 ecologists have used sdms for a variety of applications such as conservation planning and surveys invasive species management and predicting the impact of future climate change engler et al 2017 rahman et al 2019 jha and vasudevan 2020 sreekumar and nameer 2021 an effective sdm can accurately capture occurrence environment relationship and can reliably predict the species occurrence under given environmental conditions however most sdm algorithms assume a constant detection probability across sites failure to account for imperfect detection can compromise estimated prediction maps tyre et al 2003 gu and swihart 2004 occupancy models offer a substitute for presence absence or presence only models occupancy models can accommodate covariates associated with detection probability and the probability of occurrence can be estimated occupancy models use detection non detection data from

species 2 material and methods 2 1 occurrence data the surveys for the kerala bird atlas kba were conducted during 2015 2020 and species presence data was systematically collected at over 3000 sites

60 of total land and human habitat 4 of total land restricted to the west coast were adequately sampled this was achieved by dividing kerala into cells of size 6 6 km x 6 6 km each cell was further divided into four quadrants of size 3 3 km x 3 3 km and each quadrant was then sub divided into 9 sub cells of size 1 1 km x 1 1 km a single randomly selected sub cell in every quadrant was surveyed for two seasons dry mid jan to mid mar and wet mid july to mid sep figure s1 four 15 min checklists were made per sub cell per season and every bird species seen or heard during the survey was noted excluding nocturnal and pelagic species 361 species 76 families were detected 353 species 75 families in the dry season and 298 species 72 families in the wet season praveen et al 2022 we extracted the centroid of the surveyed sub cells as the exact survey locations within the sub cells were not available single season occupancy model assume that a site s occupancy status has not changed between surveys also the sampling effort repeated visits was inconsistent during the wet season due to inaccessibility of certain high elevation sites for these two reasons we used only dry season records for this analysis we marked a species as present detected if it was reported from the sub cell in any of the four visits ascertaining the absence with confidence can be tricky we marked a species as absent undetected using two criteria it was not recorded from a sub cell after four visits in both the seasons and was not reported from the corresponding cell 6 6 km x 6 6 km area either 2 2 species and variable selection we selected 109 species out of 353 species detected in the dry season excluding abundant species 1000 unique occurrences data deficient species 40 unique occurrences and 18

from a set of 5 values 0 5 1 2 3 4 we did not include additional habitat features that can affect detections such as canopy cover and undergrowth density these were not available for the survey sites addition of these data could have altered the performance of both algorithms and the final sdms thus there is potential to further fine tune both models for individual species data is expensive it is relatively easier to get occurrence records temporal replication of survey is more resource intensive but is it worth it has been said that performance of a model should be assessed with respect to its objectives or else the comparative studies may fail to reveal the benefits of accounting for detectability lahoz monfort et al 2014 use of occupancy models is unlikely to result in improved predictive performance when detection probability is relatively homogeneous across sites rota et al 2011 our study shows that for majority of the species presence only maxent model performs as good as occurrence model future research can explore the effect of tuning variable and parameters correction for bias in occurrences and corrections to reduce overfitting on consistency between species richness maps from maxent and occupancy models not occupancy but maxent model perform well with small sample sizes which is particularly the case for rare species hence for studies involving rare species and when dealing with multiple species data maxent should suffice for species specific studies occupancy modelling can be a better approach this information is important in a conservation

24377,ecological niche modeling has become common practice amongst ecologists in the last two decades the terms in the field of ecological niche modeling such as ecological niche model species distribution model and habitat suitability model are often used interchangeably although each term can have very different meanings depending on the context of the study without full understanding of model inputs and careful interpretation of model outputs there is a possibility that the dimension of the ecological niche being predicted does not align with the modeling goals of the author this study showcases an example which indicates that it is possible to intentionally model species distribution and habitat suitability separately red spruce picea rubens distribution was modeled by collecting true absence points in proximity to red spruce presence points red spruce suitable habitat was modeled by excluding true absence points and only using pseudo absence points along with presence points models which included presence proximal true absences had functionally greater discriminatory ability in map projections and were more sensitive to subtle environmental changes when compared to models which only included pseudo absence points therefore models which included true absence points more closely approximated the current distribution of red spruce whereas models which only included pseudo absences more closely approximated the potential distribution within the realized niche or suitable habitat of red spruce this study demonstrates that distribution and suitable habitat can and should be modeled separately and emphasizes the necessity of carefully considering modeling objectives and methodologies when interpreting modeling outcomes keywords ecological niche modeling suitable habitat distribution data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction ecological niche models enms relate observations of species occurrence and absence to their environment in order to then approximate some aspect of the niche of that species across space and or time enms have become increasingly popular amongst ecologists over the last two decades contributing to their popularity is the fact that enm s are broadly applicable across species of both rare and ample abundance in marine aquatic and terrestrial environments ahmadi nedushan et al 2006 kaschner et al 2006 williams tripp et al 2012 ecological niche models are powerful computational tools used to understand current and potential species distributions test biogeographic hypotheses and forecast anthropogenic impacts on species the terms in the field of ecological niche modeling such as ecological niche model enm species distribution model sdm and habitat suitability model hsm are often used interchangeably although each term can have very different meanings depending on the context of the study the appropriate usage of modeling terminology has been discussed in several reviews though the literature still conflates different terms with each other bradley et al 2012 melo merino et al 2020 peterson and soberon 2012 soberon and peterson 2005 soberon and peterson 2005 state that more often than not enms predict a fundamental niche encapsulating both distribution and potential distribution therefore for the purposes of this study enm was used as an umbrella term to describe both sdms and hsms further sdm was used to describe models which aim to predict the current distribution of a species whereas hsm was used to describe models which aim to predict the potential distribution of a species given its suitable habitat within a realized niche a primary focus of reviews on the topic of differentiating between the fundamental and realized niche in models has been on modeling distribution and fundamental niches melo merino et al 2020 soberon and peterson 2005 less discussed are the differences that can be found within the realized niche itself many species are subject to natural disturbance regimes and even more species have been disturbed either directly or indirectly through anthropogenic means consequently it may often be the case that a species does not occupy the full extent of its realized niche after a disturbance event creating a discrepancy between the actual distribution of the species and its potential distribution given its suitable habitat this creates a potential problem for ecological niche modelers where the niche model itself does not align with the stated modeling objectives leading to miscommunications and incorrect conclusions therefore it is necessary for methods to be developed which enable modelers to clearly differentiate between the actual distribution of a species and its potential distribution given its suitable habitat red spruce picea rubens in virginia were used to demonstrate how modelers might go about predicting current distributions separately from suitable habitat p rubens is a coniferous tree species native to the upper latitudes of eastern north america and ranges from the southern appalachian mountains in north carolina to southeastern quebec and ontario in the central and southern appalachians of virginia red spruce are only found at the highest elevations between 900 m 1800 m murphy 1917 pielke 1981 as a result the red spruce of virginia are narrowly distributed along the blue ridge mountains and the ridge and valley province red spruce also has a history of recent acute anthropogenic disturbance over the last century from which it has been unable to completely recover from pielke 1981 bliss and vogelmann 1982 hamburg and cogbill 1988 blum 1990 griscom et al 2011 as a result it can be expected that the current distribution of red spruce is less than the suitable habitat available to it in terms of area the predicted discrepancy in area between current and potential distributions allows for these two dimensions of a realized niche to be modeled separately and provides an additional layer of model validation the purpose of this study was to take a first step in demonstrating that a species distribution and suitable habitat can be modeled separately and provide a methodology for doing so two modeling objectives were established to achieve this aim 1 produce a model which more closely approximates the current distribution of red spruce in virginia an sdm 2 produce a model which more closely approximates the potential distribution within the realized niche of red spruce given its suitable habitat an hsm it was predicted that the inclusion of presence proximal true absence points would cause greater discriminatory ability in models resulting in a closer approximation of current distribution as opposed to suitable habitat 2 methods 2 1 study area the state of virginia was used as the spatial extent in which predictions were made presence and true absence points were collected along the blue ridge mountains as well as throughout the ridge and valley province of virginia a presence point indicates the occurrence of red spruce at a given set of coordinates whereas a true absence point indicates the lack of occurrence at the location 2 2 species presence true absence and pseudo absence data presence and absence points act as response variables in ecological niche models enms plots previously identified by the virginia department of conservation and recreation division of natural heritage vadcrdnh to contain red spruce were used to locate and mark presence points with a gps device garmin gpsmap 62st older range maps were also used as a guide to find red spruce populations blum 1990 the limited distribution of red spruce enabled the collection of true absence points that is to say ground truthed absence points in proximity to presence points which is often not feasible for species with widespread distributions pseudo absence background points were randomly generated absence points which served to inform models of the full environmental gradient in the study area presence and true absence points were collected throughout western virginia a total of 338 presence points and 169 true absence points were collected the number of presence points was greater than ten times the number of environmental variables included n 4 in models but not less than 50 presence points total in order to avoid complications from sample size effects hernandez et al 2006 wisz et al 2008 the sdm and hsm both made use of the same 338 presence points true absences were only included in the sdm to increase discrimination within models so that red spruce probability of occurrence i e current distribution would be predicted rather than suitable habitat i e potential distribution an additional 831 pseudo absence points totaling to 1000 overall absence points were generated in the sdm so as to not bias models by only sampling in proximity to red spruce wisz and guisan 2009 for each generation of pseudo absence points one for the sdm and one for the hsm three random samples were produced and used in models to reduce the influence of potentially skewed pseudo absence sampling the hsm lacked any true absence points and exclusively used three randomly generated iterations of 1000 pseudo absence points fig 1 2 3 environmental variable selection a set of 93 environmental variables provided by vadcrdnh served as the predictor variables in enms table a1 these environmental variables had a 30 m x 30 m resolution and were projected in albers conical equal area in order to preserve the accuracy of area calculations in order to reduce the risk of multicollinearity and identify the primary drivers of red spruce distribution several steps were taken as a variable pre selection process first environmental variables were classified as either proximal or distal proximal variables were those variables which more directly influence the physiology of the species e g temperature whereas distal variables had an indirect effect on red spruce physiology e g elevation the most distal variables were eliminated from consideration so that the fundamental physiological drivers of red spruce distribution could be better elucidated the remaining variables were then split into four categories elevation derivatives geology precipitation and temperature within each category relative importance was calculated using the importance function in biomod2 thuiller et al 2009 from each category only the most important variable was selected for use in models keeping with the principle of parsimony finally a variance inflation factor analysis vif test was conducted on the remaining variables a threshold of vif score 10 was defined whereby any variables which exceeded a score of 10 were considered too multicollinear and were therefore eliminated from consideration o brien 2007 response curves were generated for each of the environmental variables in the sdm and hsm using the evaluation strip method in biomod2 the evaluation strip method produces response curves by generating a set of predictions by a model where only one environmental variable is allowed to vary and the remaining environmental variables are held at a constant value elith et al 2005 2 4 algorithm parameterization multi model inference also referred to as ensemble modeling was used whereby many predictions from different algorithms could be averaged together to generate one consensus model ensemble modeling was enabled by the biomod2 r package thuiller et al 2009 models were evaluated based on the true skill statistic tss and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve auc of the roc or simply roc tss scores range from zero to one with the following scale used to assess model performance poor 0 00 0 20 fair 0 21 0 40 moderate 0 41 0 60 substantial 0 61 0 80 excellent 0 81 1 00 landis and koch 1977 roc scores likewise range from zero to one with a slightly different evaluation scale counter predictions roc 0 50 fail 0 51 0 60 poor 0 61 0 70 fair 0 71 0 80 good 0 81 0 90 excellent 0 91 1 00 guisan et al 2017 a threshold of tss 0 80 and roc 0 90 was defined whereby all individual models which fell under these limits were eliminated from ensemble predictions four modeling algorithms were used in each modeling objective in this study generalized linear models glms generalized additive models gams randomforests rfs and boosted regression trees referred to as generalized boosted models gbms in biomod2 glms were run with polynomial terms gams were parameterized to automatically generate formulas and apply smoother functions rfs were run with the default biomod2 parameterizations gbms were run with 6000 trees and 3 cross validation folds all other aspects of algorithm parameterization were left to their default settings in biomod2 version 3 5 1 2 5 ensemble model parameterization two ensemble models were generated in this study accounting for the sdm and hsm ensembles used a cross validation procedure where three evaluation runs of the models were conducted with each model run being calibrated using a randomly selected subset of 80 of data which was then evaluated on the remaining 20 of data each ensemble also ran three additional times for each of the three pseudo absence selections therefore each individual ensemble model contained 36 different individual models 4 algorithms x 3 evaluation runs x 3 pseudo absence selections within each ensemble model three types of averages were calculated the first type of average was a simple mean of predictions across the 36 individual models the second type of average was weighted based on model evaluation scores whereby a higher evaluation score led to a corresponding high weight when calculating averages the final average was a committee average which uses binary prediction maps from each of the 36 individual models generated by assessing the highest quality predictions as the basis for calculating averages ensemble models were evaluated based on the tss as well as the sensitivity rate of correctly identifying presence suitable habitat and specificity rate of correctly identifying absence unsuitable habitat of models of the three ensemble averages calculated the type with the highest sensitivity and specificity scores were selected as representatives the mapped prediction values from the representative hsm ensemble models were binned using the following habitat classification scale in order to better visualize map projections unsuitable 0 00 0 20 poor 0 21 0 40 fair 0 41 0 60 good 0 61 0 80 excellent 0 81 1 00 the sdm ensemble map predictions were binned using the same intervals however values represent a probability of occurrence as opposed to habitat suitability not present 0 00 0 20 low occurrence probability 0 21 0 40 intermediate occurrence probability 0 41 0 60 good occurrence probability 0 61 0 80 high occurrence probability 0 81 1 00 3 results 3 1 environmental variable selection the most important environmental variables from the elevation derivatives geology precipitation and temperature categories were maximum temperature of the warmest month mxtpwrmmth may precipitation mayprecip total insolation derived from direct and diffuse but not reflected radiation for the summer solstice radsumsol and distance to acidic shale bedrock geo200 table a2 these four predictor variables were used and held constant in both the species distribution model sdm and habitat suitability model hsm 3 2 species distribution models with the exception of two generalized linear models glms all individual models in the sdm ensemble had a true skill statistic score tss 0 80 and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve score roc 0 90 indicating excellent predictions two glms had a 0 80 tss 0 60 and a 0 90 roc 0 80 and were therefore excluded from ensemble predictions table a3 randomforests rfs and generalized boosted models gbms had identical tss and roc scores followed by generalized additive models gams and glms table 1 randomforest response curves showed strong agreement across individual models fig 2 a for mxtpwrmmth probability of occurrence was highest at approximately 24 c and decreased as temperature increased with a severe decline to a probability of zero occurring around 26 c across all models at temperatures below 23 c probability of occurrence dropped precipitously response to mayprecip was positive as precipitation increased a noticeable increase in probability of occurrence occurred around 110 mm and typically peaked with the highest precipitation amounts of about 200 mm geo200 only featured perturbations in response at distances between zero and 5000 m generally probability of occurrence decreased as distance from acidic shale bedrock increased but quickly rebounded at approximately 2500 m radsumsol response plots showed a negative relationship between occurrence probability and insolation probability of occurrence typically decreased between 30 and 35 watts per square meter w m2 fig 2a sdm ensemble predictions were excellent with tss scores 0 90 the committee average was selected to be the representative model as it had the highest sensitivity and specificity amongst the ensemble predictions fig 3 a table 2 3 3 habitat suitability models all individual models in the hsm ensemble had a tss 0 80 and roc 0 90 indicating excellent predictions table a4 tss and roc scores exhibited minimal variation between algorithms with rfs and gbms having the highest overall scores table 1 response curves show fairly strong agreement across individual rf models there is a decline to zero probability of suitable habitat occurrence at maximum temperatures above 26 c a distinct increase in the probability of the occurrence of suitable habitat takes place above 120 mm of may precipitation an increase in suitable habitat probability occurs between zero and 5000 m from acidic shale bedrock after which there is a decline followed by no further perturbations an increase in suitable habitat occurrence probability occurs above 30 w m2 after which there is minimal perturbation fig 2b hsm ensemble predictions were excellent with tss 0 90 the committee average was selected to be the representative model as it had the highest sensitivity and specificity fig 3b table 3 3 4 species distribution models versus habitat suitability models for both the sdm and hsm the 0 0 0 2 bins accounted for the most area when compared to the other bins the sdm accounts for a much greater area in the 0 2 0 4 bin compared to the hsm area in the 0 4 0 6 and 0 6 0 8 bins areas are relatively even with the sdm having a slightly greater number of hectares in both instances in the 0 8 1 0 bin the hsm has a much greater area when compared to the sdm table 4 a visual comparison of the sdm and hsm in southwestern virginia shows the increased discriminatory ability of the sdm while both models are able to identify and agree on broadly unoccupied unsuitable habitat fig 4 4 discussion current and potential red spruce distributions were modeled separately to investigate the possibility of explicitly differentiating between species distribution models sdms and habitat suitability models hsms the inclusion of true absence points located in close proximity to presence points in the distribution model successfully caused a greater discrimination to occur in the sdm when compared to the hsm the resulting sdm was able to identify more nuanced relationships between presence points and their environment when compared with the hsm the method of modeling both current distribution and potential distribution simultaneously also yielded the unexpected benefit of additional insight into the ecology of the study organism for example the sdm was able to detect a decline in the probability of occurrence at temperatures below approximately 23 c whereas the hsm response curves did not portray this decline fig 2a and b this decline at the lower extent of the maximum temperatures of the warmest month mxtpwrmmth likely reflects an increase in competition for red spruce at the colder extremes cold adapted tree species such as balsam fir and fraser fir compete with red spruce at high elevations where few other species can thrive dumais and prevost 2007 an alternative but not mutually exclusive explanation for the decline in the probability of occurrence at the lowest maximum temperatures could be cold stress this alternative explanation is much less likely as red spruce has been found to exist in environments with maximum temperatures of just 21 c while decline in probability of occurrence begins as maximum temperatures decrease below 23 c blum 1990 fig 2a interestingly sdms had noticeably lower true skill statistic tss and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve roc evaluation scores than those of the hsms table 1 although sdms had lower evaluation scores when compared to hsms sdms clearly had greater discriminatory ability figs 2a b 3a b and 4 therefore the lower sdm scores more likely reflect the difficulty of the modeling objective as opposed to poor performance in achieving that modeling objective sdms regularly encountered data which was contradictory e g presence and true absence points with similar environmental variable values on a non random basis due to the use of presence proximal true absence points making distribution more difficult to model in contrast hsms only dealt with randomly generated pseudo absence points in which contradictory data points occurred on a purely random basis and therefore carried less weight in models while modeling distribution separately from habitat suitability using presence proximal true absence points was demonstrated to be a useful method in this study the novelty of the application of this technique for the purpose of differentiating between model types leaves much to be explored in terms of its implementation a question that remains about implementing presence proximal true absence points to model distribution is whether this method can be used for species with broad distributions because red spruce has such a narrow distribution it is relatively easy to collect true absence points at the edges of its distribution however such sampling with a widespread species would be considerably more difficult and would likely take many more absence points to produce a meaningful change in model outcomes there is also the possibility of incorporating an environmental variable in models which describes the limitations of a species distribution in lieu of absence points to produce a distribution model rather than a habitat suitability model chen and leites 2020 implemented an environmental variable which accounted for land use legacies when modeling species distributions this method could be used to differentiate between distributions and habitat suitability for species which have experienced anthropogenic disturbances from which they have not yet recovered this study is an additional step taken in an ongoing process to create clarity about the terminology and methodologies used in the field of ecological niche modeling it was demonstrated that it is possible to model the current distribution of a species separately from its potential distribution using presence proximal true absence points not only does differentiating between distribution and suitable habitat make model interpretations more accurate

calculating averages the final average was a committee average which uses binary prediction maps from each of the 36 individual models generated by assessing the highest quality predictions as the basis for calculating averages ensemble models were evaluated based on the tss as well as the sensitivity rate of correctly identifying presence suitable habitat and specificity rate of correctly identifying absence unsuitable habitat of models of the three ensemble averages calculated the type with the highest sensitivity and specificity scores were selected as representatives the mapped prediction values from the representative hsm ensemble models were binned using the following habitat classification scale in order to better visualize map projections unsuitable 0 00 0 20 poor 0 21 0 40 fair 0 41 0 60 good 0 61 0 80 excellent 0 81 1 00 the sdm ensemble map predictions were binned using the same intervals however values represent a probability of occurrence as opposed to habitat suitability not present 0 00 0 20 low occurrence probability 0 21 0 40 intermediate occurrence probability 0 41 0 60 good occurrence probability 0 61 0 80 high occurrence probability 0 81 1 00 3 results 3 1 environmental variable selection the most important environmental variables from the elevation derivatives geology precipitation and temperature categories were maximum temperature of the warmest month mxtpwrmmth may precipitation mayprecip total insolation derived from direct and diffuse but not reflected radiation for the summer solstice radsumsol and distance to acidic shale bedrock geo200 table a2 these four predictor variables were used and held constant in both the species distribution model sdm and habitat suitability model hsm 3 2 species distribution models with the exception of two generalized linear models glms all individual models in the sdm ensemble had a true skill statistic score tss 0 80 and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve score roc 0 90 indicating excellent predictions two glms had a 0 80 tss 0 60 and a 0 90 roc 0 80 and were therefore excluded from ensemble predictions table a3 randomforests rfs and generalized boosted models gbms had identical tss and roc scores followed by generalized additive models gams and glms table 1 randomforest response curves showed strong agreement across individual models fig 2 a for mxtpwrmmth probability of occurrence was highest at approximately 24 c and decreased as temperature increased with a severe decline to a probability of zero occurring around 26 c across all models at temperatures below 23 c probability of occurrence dropped precipitously response to mayprecip was positive as precipitation increased a noticeable increase in probability of occurrence occurred around 110 mm and typically peaked with the highest precipitation amounts of about 200 mm geo200 only featured perturbations in response at distances between zero and 5000 m generally probability of occurrence decreased as distance from acidic shale bedrock increased but quickly rebounded at approximately 2500 m radsumsol response plots showed a negative relationship between occurrence probability and insolation probability of occurrence typically decreased between 30 and 35 watts per square meter w m2 fig 2a sdm ensemble predictions were excellent with tss scores 0 90 the committee average was selected to be the representative model as it had the highest sensitivity and specificity amongst the ensemble predictions fig 3 a table 2 3 3 habitat suitability models all individual models in the hsm ensemble had a tss 0 80 and roc 0 90 indicating excellent predictions table a4 tss and roc scores exhibited minimal variation between algorithms with rfs and gbms having the highest overall scores table 1 response curves show fairly strong agreement across individual rf models there is a decline to zero probability of suitable habitat occurrence at maximum temperatures above 26 c a distinct increase in the probability of the occurrence of suitable habitat takes place above 120 mm of may precipitation an increase in suitable habitat probability occurs between zero and 5000 m from acidic shale bedrock after which there is a decline followed by no further perturbations an increase in suitable habitat occurrence probability occurs above 30 w m2 after which there is minimal perturbation fig 2b hsm ensemble predictions were excellent with tss 0 90 the committee average was selected to be the representative model as it had the highest sensitivity and specificity fig 3b table 3 3 4 species distribution models versus habitat suitability models for both the sdm and hsm the 0 0 0 2 bins accounted for the most area when compared to the other bins the sdm accounts for a much greater area in the 0 2 0 4 bin compared to the hsm area in the 0 4 0 6 and 0 6 0 8 bins areas are relatively even with the sdm having a slightly greater number of hectares in both instances in the 0 8 1 0 bin the hsm has a much greater area when compared to the sdm table 4 a visual comparison of the sdm and hsm in southwestern virginia shows the increased discriminatory ability of the sdm while both models are able to identify and agree on broadly unoccupied unsuitable habitat fig 4 4 discussion current and potential red spruce distributions were modeled separately to investigate the possibility of explicitly differentiating between species distribution models sdms and habitat suitability models hsms the inclusion of true absence points located in close proximity to presence points in the distribution model successfully caused a greater discrimination to occur in the sdm when compared to the hsm the resulting sdm was able to identify more nuanced relationships between presence points and their environment when compared with the hsm the method of modeling both current distribution and potential distribution simultaneously also yielded the unexpected benefit of additional insight into the ecology of the study organism for example the sdm was able to detect a decline in the probability of occurrence at temperatures below approximately 23 c whereas the hsm response curves did not portray this decline fig 2a and b this decline at the lower extent of the maximum temperatures of the warmest month mxtpwrmmth likely reflects an increase in competition for red spruce at the colder extremes cold adapted tree species such as balsam fir and fraser fir compete with red spruce at high elevations where few other species can thrive dumais and prevost 2007 an alternative but not mutually exclusive explanation for the decline in the probability of occurrence at the lowest maximum temperatures could be cold stress this alternative explanation is much less likely as red spruce has been found to exist in environments with maximum temperatures of just 21 c while decline in probability of occurrence begins as maximum temperatures decrease below 23 c blum 1990 fig 2a interestingly sdms had noticeably lower true skill statistic tss and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve roc evaluation scores than those of the hsms table 1 although sdms had lower evaluation scores when compared to hsms sdms clearly had greater discriminatory ability figs 2a b 3a b and 4 therefore the lower sdm scores more likely reflect the difficulty of the modeling objective as opposed to poor performance in achieving that modeling objective sdms regularly encountered data which was contradictory e g presence and true absence points with similar environmental variable values on a non random basis due to the use of presence proximal true absence points making distribution more difficult to model in contrast hsms only dealt with randomly generated pseudo absence points in which contradictory data points occurred on a purely random basis and therefore carried less weight in models while modeling distribution separately from habitat suitability using presence proximal true absence points was demonstrated to be a useful method in this study the novelty of the application of this technique for the purpose of differentiating between model types leaves much to be explored in terms of its implementation a question that remains about implementing presence proximal true absence points to model distribution is whether this method can be used for species with broad distributions because red spruce has such a narrow distribution it is relatively easy to collect true absence points at the edges of its distribution however such sampling with a widespread species would be considerably more difficult and would likely take many more absence points to produce a meaningful change in model outcomes there is also the possibility of incorporating an environmental variable in models which describes the limitations of a species distribution in lieu of absence points to produce a distribution model rather than a habitat suitability model chen and leites 2020 implemented an environmental variable which accounted for land use legacies when modeling species distributions this method could be used to differentiate between distributions and habitat suitability for species which have experienced anthropogenic disturbances from which they have not yet recovered this study is an additional step taken in an ongoing process to create clarity about the terminology and methodologies used in the field of ecological niche modeling it was demonstrated that it is possible to model the current distribution of a species separately from its potential distribution using presence proximal true absence points not only does differentiating between distribution and suitable habitat make model interpretations more accurate but it also has the added benefit of providing additional insight into the ecology and distribution limitations of the study organism funding this research did not receive any specific grant from

24378,land use and cover change lucc is a pervasive driver of today s global socioecological crisis in light of the lucc in many agricultural landscapes worldwide natural resource conservation is critical put aside dry agricultural landscapes have significant limitations when attempting to guarantee long term food production and other ecosystem services in ecological scarcity conditions under climate change scenarios in this research an intermediate disturbance complexity idc model was applied to evaluate how ecological scarcity in nw iran can be affected by anthropogenic disturbance and landscape complexity this model calculates both the behaviour of the human appropriation of net primary production hanpp a proxy of the amount of anthropic disturbance and a landscape ecology le metric which measures complexity as a heterogeneous and well connected land matrix hanpp results show how dry pastures are affected by human pressure while the results for le indicate how human activities are affecting ecological corridors linking the northern and the southern parts of the study area finally idc results show that intermediate disturbance can have a positive effect on the provision of human needs and at the same time can help maintain the landscape s ecological functionality the analysis confirms that land use policies should consider the landscape as a whole and should avoid applying a string of ad hoc decisions to minor pieces of the territory our findings support the view that a strong relationship between intermediate disturbance and landscape complexity exists which highlights the importance of traditional economic activities as ways of maintaining biocultural landscapes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords disturbance ecology

2019 mokhtari et al 2022 at all organisation levels from organisms to landscape and the whole biosphere anthropogenic activities induce complex changes including biodiversity loss darvishi et al 2014b climate change tallis et al 2018 mousavi and falahatkar 2020 soil degradation foley et al 2005 and the alteration of landscape ecological services and functions lam and conway 2018 such as primary production these tendencies increase the extent of human transformed landscapes and may cause ecological scarcity threatening the worldwide food security of human societies foley et al 2005 socioecological challenges at landscape level are one of the many dilemmas facing natural resource conservation and any failure to take into account their consequences will hamper any attempt to guarantee long term food production and ecological services pimentel et al 1992 franklin and lindenmayer 2009 boron et al 2016 landis 2017 in this matter still a debate rages over the links between natural resources degradation due to ever expanding human driven agricultural landscape and the biodiversity conservation as a proxy of basic ecological processes cardinale et al 2012 net primary production npp as the primary energetic input of all undertaking biotic processes on the earth zhang et al 2018 is influenced by socioeconomic interference within the landscape the human appropriation of net primary production hanpp assesses the anthropogenic disturbance and estimates the alteration of an ecosystem s energy flow which is defined as the difference between the npp potential provided by the unchanged ecosystem and the available biomass for ecological processes haberl 1997 the more hanpp indicates less available energy to maintain trophic chains and consequently more effect of human intervention on the landscape functions such as biodiversity hosting although hanpp has been used at global and regional scales it was not applied at landscape level as the optimal scale that regards human perception for sustainable land use planning hersperger 1994 ahern 1999 despite the importance of spatial information in land use planning dühr and müller 2012 and of hanpp maps in decision making indrajit et al 2019 there is little exploration of the spatial interrelation between patterns of hanpp and landscape complexity in different types of territory marull et al 2016a 2018a therefore it is crucial to integrate biophysical and cultural processes in order to tackle the impact of human action on ecological scarcity ecological scarcity is a concept that embraces various types of disturbances that hamper economic growth and affect natural resource availability schmitt et al 2016 and can be used to improve environmental management grinberg et al 2012 in other words ecological scarcity refers to a decline in the fundamental energy landscape integration and the consequent fall in ecological processes and services yousefi et al 2020 therefore further researches are needed in the realm of linking the cultural processes and anthropogenic disturbances through social metabolism approach at the landscape scale with ecological scarcity and above all to disturbances related to biodiversity hosting and associated ecosystem services as fundamental landscape functions darvishi et al 2022 an intermediate disturbance hypothesis has been proposed to explain biodiversity conservation huston 2014 patterns of intermediate disturbance give rise to high biodiversity levels in human transformed landscapes due to the co existence of species with contrasting ecological requirements that depend on the vertical horizontal complexity of agroecosystems marull et al 2016b accordingly an interdisciplinary approach is required to analyse the socioecological function of landscape fry 2001 however the intermediate disturbance hypothesis has rarely been used to synthesize socioecological interactions spatially or to study landscape complexity the role of landscape complexity in neutralizing the human alteration of ecosystems is thus a new and interesting research topic marull et al 2019 from a land use planning and conservation perspective analysing the effects of intermediate disturbance on biodiversity and ecosystem services allows us to apply the land sparing vs land sharing debate at the landscape scale perfecto and vandermeer 2010 the land sparing strategy consists of intensifying human dominated land use e g cropping or urbanization in certain areas to devote more marginal areas to nature conservation matson et al 1997 by contrast the land sharing approach seeks to develop a synergistic interaction of human land uses and natural conservation within a complex landscape tscharntke et al 2012 many of those who aim to combine these two approaches stress the need for more research to shed light on the effects of intermediate disturbance on biodiversity and ecosystem services phalan et al 2011 especially in conditions of ecological scarcity and climate change scenarios the main purpose of the present research was to investigate how different levels of human disturbance and landscape complexity opdam et al 2018 are associated with ecological scarcity management in an arid agricultural landscape in iran in this paper we used a mathematical model to evaluate the impact of different levels of hanpp on landscape patterns and processes to synthesize the relationships between human made disturbances and landscape function we improved an intermediate disturbance complexity idc model marull et al 2016a and applied to illuminate the role of the land sharing approach tscharntke et al 2012 in providing fundamental ecological functions and services in human transformed landscapes moreover the sub objective of study was to investigate how landscape composition and configuration affect the ecological scarcity of a landscape system 2 material and methods 2 1 case study most of iran s bio cultural landscapes are covered by hot desert 39 38 cold desert 15 5 hot semi arid 5 13 and cold semi arid 22 27 with a very low or no npp capacity raziei 2017 the area influenced by these climate types covers 82 of the whole country and is predicted to increase to 95 of its total surface area by 2100 due to global climate change mir mousavi and kiani 2017 most food production is based on livestock and crops in iran bakhtiyari et al 2017 karimi et al 2018 accordingly water shortage madani et al 2016 climate change vaghefi et al 2015 mousavi et al 2017 and a population of over 80 million statistical centre of iran 2016 may lead to a deterioration in natural resources and biodiversity in the coming decades qazvin province represents iran s landscape and the middle east region as well which located in the west of tehran and south of the alborz mountains 35 24 36 48 n 48 44 50 51 e and covers an area of 1562 600 ha statistical centre of iran 2016 fig 1 the province extends from 170 to 4100 m above sea level and is covered by desert and dry pastures small forest area dry and irrigated farmlands and urban areas panahi fard and mahvi 2018 yousefi et al 2020 the landscape structure in qazvin is the product of the long term interaction between human activity and nature that characterizes the iranian biocultural regions water resources are limited as is typical in large dry plains montazar et al 2010 and in recent decades groundwater extraction and inter watershed transfer have decreased water resources mirzaei et al 2019 based on the latest census 2016 the province has 1237 761 inhabitants 75 of whom live in towns and 25 in rural areas qazvin was recognized as a separate province in 1997 due to its special geographical location near the capital of iran yousefi et al 2021b it is well connected with tehran as it lies on a main european transit route in addition since the late 1960s the policy related to the restriction of the establishment of new industries within a radius of 120 km from tehran has led to striking industrial development and agricultural production thus despite its 0 96 share of the country s surface area and 1 6 of its population the province s industry contributes 2 84 to iran s gross domestic product gdp while investment in the province s industry represents 4 2 of all industrial investment in iran statistical centre of iran 2016 accordingly qazvin province is one of the most economically important regions experiencing intensive agricultural activities and suffering from water contamination mirzaei et al 2019 and over grazing in dry pastures eslami et al 2019 2 2 data collections the hybrid method has been used to classify land use and land cover lulc map by combining google earth maps and on screen visual digitization of field data in 2018 1 april 2018 to late september 2018 pastures and forests were extracted using landsat 8 imagery by normalized difference vegetation index ndvi zhumanova et al 2018 the road network map 1 2000 was produced by the data from the urban development organization of iran the river map irrigation network and wells were prepared using data from the agricultural organization of iran dem data was used to generate slope aspect and elevation layers and landsat images were used to produce ndvi darvishi et al 2016 the study was based on 1345 hexagon shaped sample cells each cell 1100 ha lying completely or more than 95 within the borders of the qazvin province fig 1 in this study all measures and indicators have been standardized using fuzzy standardization algorithm 2 3 methods 2 3 1 intermediate disturbance complexity the intermediate disturbance complexity idc model explores how the combination of anthropogenic disturbance and landscape complexity affects the capacity of the land matrix to provide biodiversity and landscape services marull et al 2016a landscape complexity marull et al 2019 can be measured using the landscape ecology le metric which captures landscape patterns l heterogeneity and processes eci connectivity for each sample cell the anthropogenic disturbance can be calculated using hanpp haberl et al 2016 which measures the effect of land use on energy availability biomass for heterotrophic food chains and as a resource for building up biomass stocks in terrestrial ecosystems haberl et al 2014 yousefi et al 2021a finally the intermediate disturbance complexity idc model is based on both le and hanpp eq 5 1 i d c l e 1 h a n p p 100 idc improves our understanding of the socioecological functions of a landscape and their potential effects on biodiversity and associated ecosystem services marull et al 2019 and reveals how different management strategies affect the relationship between social metabolism and landscape complexity to conclude the intermediate disturbance complexity the statistical relationships between hanpp and landscape ecology metrics used as proxy for biodiversity in the set of cells of our experimental design at landscape scale hexagons have been studied 2 3 1 1 landscape complexity the land cover map fig 1 was used to estimate the following landscape pattern and process metrics mcgarigal and marks 1995 darvishi et al 2014a dupras et al 2016 marull et al 2018b number of patches np patch richness pr edge density ed shannon weiner index l effective mesh size ems and ecological connectivity index eci np refers to the total number of land cover patches that exist within the sample cells gökyer 2013 the more patches there are the more diverse the landscape in the cells cardille and turner 2017 pr shows the number of different patch types in each sample cell marull et al 2015 pr is used to calculate l which measures the equi diversity of land covers based on two computations the number of distinct patch types and the proportional distribution of the area between the patch types marull et al 2019 by custom these two elements are named richness and evenness richness quantify the landscape composition while evenness measures the landscape configuration as the structural constituent gökyer 2013 therefore l is a useful metric for identifying the landscape pattern in ecology vranken et al 2015 we used the following expression eq 1 2 l i 1 k p i log k p i 1 p u where k is the number of land cover classes potential habitats in the sample cell and pi is the ratio of the non urban land cover in a specific sample cell pu is the built up land cover resulting in the potential habitats loss ed is the total edge in a sample cell darvishi et al 2015 and equals the sum of the lengths m of all edge segments of the corresponding patch type divided by the total area m2 multiplied by 10 000 to convert to hectares if a cell border is present ed includes the cell boundary segments in the corresponding patch type and represents true edge only i e contrast weight 0 if a cell border is absent ed includes a user specified proportion of cell boundary segments in the corresponding patch type clément et al 2017 regardless of whether a sample cell border is present or not ed includes a user specified proportion of background edge segments in the corresponding patch type marull et al 2018a the landscape fragmentation can be estimated by the effective mesh size ems index jaeger 2000 which measures the possibility of a connection between two randomly selected points within a landscape marull et al 2018b in this case the more anthropogenic barriers i e urban areas show a more fragmentation but lower ems and cell connection following marull and mallarach 2005 an ecological connectivity model was used for landscape process assessment this assessment relies on ecological functional areas efa and calculates the cost distance between them including the anthropogenic barriers effect and takes into account the type of barriers the range of distances and the type of land cover involved darvishi et al 2020 the ecological connectivity index eci emphasizes the connectivity role of the efa in the landscape eq 2 e c i b 10 9 l n 1 x i l n 1 x t 3 3 eci m 1 m n ec i b m where ecib is the basic index calculated for each efa separately xi is the value of the sum of the cost distance by pixel xt is the maximum theoretical cost distance and m is the total number of efa in the landscape to calculate the landscape complexity it is necessary to reduce the number of metrics for this purpose the correlations between landscape metrics enabled us to carry out a principal component analysis pca of the variables involved marull et al 2015 the high correlations between landscape metrics table 1 a leads us to perform a pca therefore we carried out a pca of the variables involved table 7 b that shows the major contributors to the first component c1 are pr np ed and l i e landscape patterns while for the second component c2 are ems and eci i e landscape processes our results led us to consider only two variables l and eci so that both components of landscape complexity patterns and processes are represented and include land cover heterogeneity and ecological connectivity l was calculated as a conversion of the shannon wiener index to capture the landscape richness and evenness and eci was calculated based on ecological functional areas and anthropogenic barriers to show the matter and energy flows in the landscape which has been used in several studies marull et al 2015 and 2019 as a representative of the landscape pattern and process respectively once we have reduced the dimensions of the land cover metrics we obtain a component resulting of the linear combination of l and eci component coefficient 0 671 explained variance 71 279 we call this new h eci component landscape metrics le we calculated le using the two different metrics according to marull et al 2019 landscape complexity can be measured using the landscape ecology le metric which captures landscape patterns l heterogeneity and processes eci connectivity for each sample cell in this study eq 3 4 le l ecia 10 2 2 3 1 2 human appropriation of net primary production hanpp hanpp was calculated for each sample cell as the weighted sum of fixed factors wi multiplied by the ratio of the surface area covered by each land cover type eq 4 h a n p p h a n p p l u c h a n p p h a r v h a n p p l u c n p p 0 n p p a c t 5 hanpp i 1 k w i p i where hanppluc is the change of npp due to anthropogenic disturbance and hanppharv is the npp appropriation due to harvests hanppluc indicates the difference between actual npp nppact and potential npp npp0 while wi is the weight and pi is the ratio of land cover i in a sample cell after calculating different npp and harvested quantities hanpp values were calculated npp0 values were extracted from the global hanpp assessment krausmann et al 2013 available at http www uni klu ac at socec inhalt 5605 htm nppact values are the outcomes of the sum of nppharv and nppunharv values harvested ratios from each land cover and across each sample cell were transformed into energy values galán et al 2016 conversion factors such as the losses in the residue product ratio guzmán et al 2014 were applied to account for unharvested biomass 2 3 2 landscape potential hanpp values can be negative when nppact is higher than npp0 due to fertilizer input or irrigation which limits the use of the index in specific places marull et al 2018a given that this is the case of the dry agricultural landscape of the qazvin province we developed a net primary production landscape potential npp0 lp to compensate for this constraint we estimated npp0 lp by taking into account several ecological factors aspect slope elevation vegetation density and water resources that can improve the accuracy of npp0 see fig s1 in supplementary material the analysis aimed to improve the npp0 according to the given criteria using a fuzzy logic approach geographical properties affect biomass production directly due to their impact on environmental factors such as rainfall and temperature and indirectly through their influence on factors such as soil formation ivanov et al 2008 due to the interplay of many different factors understanding how these properties operate is highly complex although an important part of their impact can be attributed to sunlight and moisture regimes griffiths et al 2009 based on fieldwork as the altitude rises above 1800 m a s l vegetation densities gradually decrease thus elevation data were standardized using fuzzy logic as shown in fig s1a according to rezaei et al 2006 increasing slope gradients significantly reduces all landscape function indices as well as soil organic carbon and total nitrogen percentages therefore as the gradient increases biomass production decreases fig s1c the aspect was non directional where the slope is less than 10 makhdoom 2001 the nutrient cycling index was significantly affected by aspect rezaei et al 2006 show that on north facing slopes this index has higher mean values than on south facing slopes accordingly the aspect decreased from north to south fig s1b the four variables aspect slope elevation and vegetation density affect biomass production less vegetation means less available biomass fig s1d every location within 1 km of a water element lake river well irrigation network or reservoir is considered to harbour some type of vegetation fig s1e then water resources are considered to increase biomass production 2 3 3 cluster analysis in order to identify the main landscape typologies in the qazvin province we performed a cluster analysis ca by partitioning the 1354 sample cells based on combinations of human disturbance hanpp and landscape patterns and processes metrics we split the dataset into clusters k means clustering in spss ibm spss statistics version 19 0 0 329 was used which clusters data based on macqueen s algorithm johnson and wichern 2002 the appropriate numbers of clusters were determined by interpreting the meaningfulness of different clustering outputs with the support of a variance ratio criterion milligan and cooper 1985 caliński and harabasz 1974 the data used were first standardized and then clustering was performed based on standardized data demonstrating the different topologies of the landscape will help us to identify the effects of the landscape composition and configuration on the vulnerability of a landscape system the result of the idc model and landscape composition and configuration has been identified in each cluster to communicate between landscape composition and configuration and ecological scarcity 3 results and discussion 3 1 land cover distribution the qazvin province possesses a fairly diversified landscape with mountains in the north and a semi desert area in the east and is surrounded by dry agricultural land there is also a high density of irrigated farms as can be seen in fig 1 the northern part of the region is covered by pastures with high medium and low vegetation density where agriculture occupies less than 5 of the surface area there is also a small area of non productive forest land in the north of the region in total the case study area is covered by forests 0 81 high 7 28 medium 32 56 and low 10 40 pastures deserts 6 75 tree crop groves 5 66 irrigated 14 41 and dry 18 17 farmland water surfaces 0 13 and infrastructures 3 83 3 2 landscape patterns and processes table 2 shows the number of sample cells for five different categories very low low medium high and very high of the six landscape metrics analysed in the qazvin province the territorial distribution of the metric values is expressed by hexagon shaped sample cells fig 2 the results of the landscape pattern metrics showed that 362 sample cells are in the high range of the ed while 503 sample cells are in the low range of the np table 2 in all 76 sample cells have fewer than two different patch types very low pr the highest sample cell count corresponds to the medium range of pr 749 sample cells finally there are just 22 sample cells with a very high pr in general the higher the value of pr the higher l state of the land matrix based on fig 2 wherever there is a permanent river the pr is higher a simple buffer assessment shows that approximately 23 of the sample cells in the case study have a high or very high pr but that in a 2 km margin along the banks of the permanent rivers 35 of the sample cells have a high or very high pr therefore rivers probably have a positive effect on habitat diversity l is very low in 257 sample cells table 2 especially in the east fig 2 which implies that there is less land cover heterogeneity l again when looking at the map the high l values are found in the north and southwest it should be noted that most of the low l values 624 sample cells are scattered throughout the study area especially in the centre the results of the landscape process metrics demonstrated that ems has 615 sample cells with the lowest value table 2 scattered from west to east and from the centre to the south along the motorway which shows that fragmentation has occurred in the land matrix fig 2 the northern and the southern belts as well as the western desert areas have high ems values that show less fragmentation than centre the lowest values of eci fig 2 are mainly due to the impact of the transport network and urban development in total 204 and 335 sample cells respectively have very low or low eci values table 2 however the largest eci value with 369 sample cells has high connectivity it is remarkable to note that even before urban development got underway an increase in agricultural activities and industrialization had already begun as a result decision makers now need to designate ecological corridors to protect biodiversity in the north sample cells still possess high or very high ecological connectivity similar to the west and south fig 2 although these three areas are poorly interconnected the population growth that has occurred since the recognition of qazvin as a new province the urban developments scattered throughout the region especially around the city and along the motorway and the construction of roads to connect these developments act as barriers fragmenting the territory that has all but erased its ecological connectivity nevertheless some landscapes still have high or very high levels of connectivity of up to almost 40 table 1 3 3 net primary production to calculate hanpp different npps were estimated that are shown in fig 3 the npp potential increases from the centre to the north and to the south but the other npps have higher values in the centre and lower values in the north and south this is due to developing agriculture in the centre of the qazvin province which increased the current npp due to less unharvested npp and more harvested npp forests and semi deserts have no harvested npp the centre of the qazvin province has 132 sample cells with negative hanpp values fig 3 that show high current npp and less potential npp due to the use of both fertilizers and irrigation with irrigation and fertilizing the npp capacity could increase in this study npp capacity is based on basic capacity which is one of its defects however given the scarcity of water in the study area negative npp values may imply overcapacity however due to this constraint we tried to resolve the defect caused by the npp potential we created five specific maps shown in fig s1 see supplementary material maps a b c and d show the factors used to decrease the basic values that we obtained from the global hanpp assessment map e shows the water resources which were used as the increasing factor finally map f is the npp0 lp that we used in this case study instead of the basic values of the npp potential aspect slope elevation vegetation density and water resources are the natural factors that affect the npp therefore we applied these local factors to estimate the real npp potential which we refer to as npp0 lp in this case study thus according to fig 4 b north east qazvin has a higher value for the new hanpp value this part of the province has more pastureland and a higher npp0 lp value these pastures are affected by climate change more than other types of land cover in iran tahmasebi et al 2013 askarizadeh et al 2018 as well overgrazing has a serious effect on pastures fallahzade and hajabbasi 2011 soofi et al 2018 as a result in natural areas the higher hanpp reveals resource deterioration probably due to a combination of climate change and overgrazing in the centre of the case study area where irrigated farmland is widespread the hanpp value is lower because of the high production and high unharvested biomass that remains on the land 3 4 intermediate disturbance complexity the results show that idc is low in the north which consists mostly of pastures but is high in the plains where agriculture is predominant fig 4d based on marull et al 2016a wherever the highest level of idc is attained hanpp tends towards 50 60 idc has the highest values traditional agriculture in the qazvin plains had the highest idc nonetheless this relationship seems to be locally variable fig 4 which calls for a further geohistorical study of the complex interplay between driving forces social metabolism integrated land uses and landscape ecology scientifically based agroecological models should critically examine select and adapt biocultural heritage to current contexts and new challenges in sustainable agricultural landscape development pungetti 2013 3 5 relationship between landscape composition and configuration and ecological scarcity the cluster analysis ca grouped the 1354 sample cells into five landscape typologies using three indices landscape pattern c1 pca landscape process c2 pca and hanpp fig 5 the five clusters are titled and characterized based on the specific parameters and main land cover in each group cluster 1 n 542 is called dry pastures due to the dominant cover of pasture by the number of sample cells based on fig 5a the different types of pastures covered 76 of this cluster fig 4a this cluster has low landscape structure heterogeneity gökyer 2013 and high landscape process connectivity that indicated low landscape fragmentation wrbka et al 2004 fig 6 according to fig 7 this cluster has a high intermediate disturbance complexity that can support biodiversity marull et al 2019 cluster 2 n 236 named intensive agriculture lies in the qazvin plains fig 4a it is characterized by intensive agriculture 53 and has a low landscape pattern and process mean values fig 6 it has the lowest hanpp mean value irrigated agriculture groves dry farmland and semi desert contain 87 of this cluster fig 5b which shows this cluster is affected by socio economic drivers this cluster has changed from semi desert to intensive agriculture through human activities which provided high biomass in the landscapes these landscapes were expected to have a low idc but obtained a medium value due to the high biomass remains in the landscapes that can support biodiversity cluster 3 n 296 is named traditional agriculture including the sample cells with crops and trees mostly located near rivers or traditional agriculture sites fig 4a it has a much higher landscape pattern value than other clusters a slightly high process and hanpp value fig 6 this cluster has very sustainable land cover mosaics with mixed different types of pastures 58 irrigated farmland 6 dry farmland 19 and groves 8 fig 5c intermediate disturbance complexity in this cluster is high because of high landscape complexity and high biomass production traditional landscapes can produce more food for humans and support biodiversity simultaneously cluster 4 n 199 is called developed areas due to the sample cells where land uses are primarily industrial and urban area basically located along the main roads fig 4a landscape patterns and processes have low mean value due to landscape fragmentation by transportation networks fig 6 in this cluster 10 of the area has been covered by different types of infrastructures fig 5d including industry 2 urban 5 water surface 1 and the main road 2 anthropogenic disturbance in this cluster is high and landscape heterogeneity is low which makes these landscapes unsuitable for biodiversity because of human disturbance these landscapes lost their food production ability finally cluster 5 n 81 is attributed to desert areas comprising sample cells with dry low pastures as well as semi desert areas in the east of the qazvin province fig 4a landscape metrics fig 6 are characterized by lower patterns homogeneous land cover but higher processes value high ecological connectivity which is because of low anthropogenic disturbances in this case hanpp has a negative value due to low vegetation growth this cluster shows low pastures 46 semi desert 40 and dry farmland 10 covering 96 of the study area due to low precipitation and water scarcity yousefi et al 2020 the idc model has been recently tested in biocultural landscapes including the mediterranean bioregion marull et al 2018a and tropical latin america marull et al 2018b the results are similar in both cases in the past higher landscape metrics patterns and processes were often associated with mid range levels of human disturbance hanpp while current landscape metrics decreased along with increasing hanpp i e high levels of disturbance by intensive industrial farming our study in the middle east region shows similar results with the highest idc values found in traditional agricultural areas moreover traditional agriculture has higher levels of idc than some natural areas including pastures table 3 shows all the values of the landscape metrics for each cluster in the fuzzy logic standard format landscape patterns are higher in clusters 1 and 3 than in other clusters due to the high diversity in land cover types although some of the landscape pattern metrics are lower in cluster 5 the high landscape process metrics in cluster 3 and 5 result from naturalness and continuity of land covers the issue that arises is how to interpret the data according to the density of the hanpp le pairs of values fig 7 reflects the relationship between human disturbance and landscape complexity marull and font 2017 and represents the idc values of a given territory fig 4d fig 7 shows important variables in different clusters of the study ranging from notable human disturbance to very high levels of hanpp mainly because of livestock growth i e overgrazing and climate change effects as well as a decrease in landscape complexity le resulted from destroying traditional integrated agriculture polyculture and the development of infrastructures 4 conclusions we applied the intermediate disturbance complexity idc model marull et al 2016a to the qazvin province to determine the extent of its landscape ecological scarcity human appropriation of net primary production hanpp was used as an indicator of anthropogenic disturbance in dry environments based on landscape metrics patterns and process and hanpp we divided the study area into five landscape typologies and performed a cluster analysis to identify different socioecological patterns due to the methodological limitations of hanpp in specific situations e g irrigated desert landscapes we improved the potential net primary production npp0 lp calculation by incorporating four mitigating factors aspect slope elevation and vegetation and one additional factor water resources into the original model finally we used idc to assess how different levels of human appropriation of photosynthetic capacity affect the landscape s functional structure which potentially hosts biodiversity on a regional scale as far as our best knowledge few researchers have studied the relationship between these variables wrbka et al 2004 haberl et al 2005 vačkář and chobot orlitová 2012 marull et al 2019 the landscape metrics analysis shows that the transportation infrastructures divided the province into northern and southern parts indicating that land use planning should consider the territory as a whole and avoid simply employing a string of ad hoc decisions based on sectorial policies in specific parts of the biocultural landscapes darvishi et al 2020 further the results showed that traditional agriculture could play a key role in hosting biodiversity and meeting social needs even though many researchers believe that agricultural land plays a negative role in biodiversity conservation the results of our study refute this claim and in some areas such as the qazvin province where there is no intensive natural vegetation coverage traditional agriculture can play a key role in hosting biodiversity along with meeting human nutritional needs mehring et al 2017 the cluster analysis and the driving forces indicated that traditional farming plays a crucial role in shaping and maintaining a complex set of land cover mosaics our findings suggest that a great deal of the biodiversity currently that exists in the northern part of the study area may actually be associated with the remaining land cover mosaics that still tended by the local peasantry yousefi et al 2020 then we concluded that the presence of the biocultural heritage may stimulate the hump shaped relationship we found between hanpp and landscape complexity assessed conjointly with land cover heterogeneity and ecological connectivity a result that fits well with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis protecting natural spaces but at the same time allowing them to be isolated by the spread of anthropogenic barriers that decrease ecological connectivity will eventually lead to biodiversity loss in the whole of qazvin province conversely the conservation of heterogeneous and well connected landscapes with a positive interplay between intermediate level of farming disturbance and landscape complexity will help preserve a wildlife friendly agroecological matrix that is likely to hold high levels of biodiversity and sustainable food production the only exceptions perhaps being the rare specialist species that require some specific habitats and other conservation policies tscharntke et al 2012 considering biodiversity is of highly importance in spatial planning as it contributes to food security and other ecosystem services this concept at landscape species and genetic levels will help improve nutrition and sustainable agriculture toledo and burlingame 2006 this integrative approach which focuses on biodiversity and food security is critical for sustainable development and contributes to solving the food biodiversity dilemma cardinale et

24378,land use and cover change lucc is a pervasive driver of today s global socioecological crisis in light of the lucc in many agricultural landscapes worldwide natural resource conservation is critical put aside dry agricultural landscapes have significant limitations when attempting to guarantee long term food production and other ecosystem services in ecological scarcity conditions under climate change scenarios in this research an intermediate disturbance complexity idc model was applied to evaluate how ecological scarcity in nw iran can be affected by anthropogenic disturbance and landscape complexity this model calculates both the behaviour of the human appropriation of net primary production hanpp a proxy of the amount of anthropic disturbance and a landscape ecology le metric which measures complexity as a heterogeneous and well connected land matrix hanpp results show how dry pastures are affected by human pressure while the results for le indicate how human activities are affecting ecological corridors linking the northern and the southern parts of the study area finally idc results show that intermediate disturbance can have a positive effect on the provision of human needs and at the same time can help maintain the landscape s ecological functionality the analysis confirms that land use policies should consider the landscape as a whole and should avoid applying a string of ad hoc decisions to minor pieces of the territory our findings support the view that a strong relationship between intermediate disturbance and landscape complexity exists which highlights the importance of traditional economic activities as ways of maintaining biocultural landscapes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords disturbance ecology

climate change tallis et al 2018 mousavi and falahatkar 2020 soil degradation foley et al 2005 and the alteration of landscape ecological services and functions lam and conway 2018 such as primary

socioecological challenges at landscape level are one of the many dilemmas facing natural resource conservation and any failure to take into account their consequences will hamper any attempt to guarantee long term food production and ecological services pimentel et al 1992 franklin and lindenmayer 2009 boron et al 2016 landis 2017 in this matter still a debate rages over the links between natural resources degradation due to ever expanding human driven agricultural landscape and the biodiversity conservation as a proxy of basic ecological processes cardinale et al 2012 net primary production npp as the primary energetic input of all undertaking biotic processes on the earth zhang et al 2018 is influenced by socioeconomic interference within the landscape the human appropriation of net primary production hanpp assesses the anthropogenic disturbance and estimates the alteration of an ecosystem s energy flow which is defined as the difference between the npp potential provided by the unchanged ecosystem and the available biomass for ecological processes haberl 1997 the more hanpp indicates less available energy to maintain trophic chains and consequently more effect of human intervention on the landscape functions such as biodiversity hosting although hanpp has been used at global and regional scales it was not applied at landscape level as the optimal scale that regards human perception for sustainable land use planning hersperger 1994 ahern 1999 despite the importance of spatial information in land use planning dühr and müller 2012 and of hanpp maps in decision making indrajit et al 2019 there is little exploration of the spatial interrelation between patterns of hanpp and landscape complexity in different types of territory marull et al 2016a 2018a therefore it is crucial to integrate biophysical and cultural processes in order to tackle the impact of human action on ecological scarcity ecological scarcity is a concept that embraces various types of disturbances that hamper economic growth and affect natural resource availability schmitt et al 2016 and can be used to improve environmental management grinberg et al 2012 in other words ecological scarcity refers to a decline in the fundamental energy landscape integration and the consequent fall in ecological processes and services yousefi et al 2020 therefore further researches are needed in the realm of linking the cultural processes and anthropogenic disturbances through social metabolism approach at the landscape scale with ecological scarcity and above all to disturbances related to biodiversity hosting and associated ecosystem services as fundamental landscape functions darvishi et al 2022 an intermediate disturbance hypothesis has been proposed to explain biodiversity conservation huston 2014 patterns of intermediate disturbance give rise to high biodiversity levels in human transformed landscapes due to the co existence of species with contrasting ecological requirements that depend on the vertical horizontal complexity of agroecosystems marull et al 2016b accordingly an interdisciplinary approach is required to analyse the socioecological function of landscape fry 2001 however the intermediate disturbance hypothesis has rarely been used to synthesize socioecological interactions spatially or to study landscape complexity the role of landscape complexity in neutralizing the human alteration of ecosystems is thus a new and interesting research topic marull et al 2019 from a land use planning and conservation perspective analysing the effects of intermediate disturbance on biodiversity and ecosystem services allows us to apply the land sparing vs land sharing debate at the landscape scale perfecto and vandermeer 2010 the land sparing strategy consists of intensifying human dominated land use e g cropping or urbanization in certain areas to devote more marginal areas to nature conservation matson et al 1997 by contrast the land sharing approach seeks to develop a synergistic interaction of human land uses and natural conservation within a complex landscape tscharntke et al 2012 many of those who aim to combine these two approaches stress the need for more research to shed light on the effects of intermediate disturbance on biodiversity and ecosystem services phalan et al 2011 especially in conditions of ecological scarcity and climate change scenarios the main purpose of the present research was to investigate how different levels of human disturbance and landscape complexity opdam et al 2018 are associated with ecological scarcity management in an arid agricultural landscape in iran in this paper we used a mathematical model to evaluate the impact of different levels of hanpp on landscape patterns and processes to synthesize the relationships between human made disturbances and landscape function we improved an intermediate disturbance complexity idc model marull et al 2016a and applied to illuminate the role of the land sharing approach tscharntke et al 2012 in providing fundamental ecological functions and services in human transformed landscapes moreover the sub objective of study was to investigate how landscape composition and configuration affect the ecological scarcity of a landscape system 2 material and methods 2 1 case study most of iran s bio cultural landscapes are covered by hot desert 39 38 cold desert 15 5 hot semi arid 5 13 and cold semi arid 22 27 with a very low or no npp capacity raziei 2017 the area influenced by these climate types covers 82 of the whole country and is predicted to increase to 95 of its total surface area by 2100 due to global climate change mir mousavi and kiani 2017 most food production is based on livestock and crops in iran bakhtiyari et al 2017 karimi et al 2018 accordingly water shortage madani et al 2016 climate change vaghefi et al 2015 mousavi et al 2017 and a population of over 80 million statistical centre of iran 2016 may lead to a deterioration in natural resources and biodiversity in the coming decades qazvin province represents iran s landscape and the middle east region as well which located in the west of tehran and south of the alborz mountains 35 24 36 48 n 48 44 50 51 e and covers an area of 1562 600 ha statistical centre of iran 2016 fig 1 the province extends from 170 to 4100 m above sea level and is covered by desert and dry pastures small forest area dry and irrigated farmlands and urban areas panahi fard and mahvi 2018 yousefi et al 2020 the landscape structure in qazvin is the product of the long term interaction between human activity and nature that characterizes the iranian biocultural regions water resources are limited as is typical in large dry plains montazar et al 2010 and in recent decades groundwater extraction and inter watershed transfer have decreased water resources mirzaei et al 2019 based on the latest census 2016 the province has 1237 761 inhabitants 75 of whom live in towns and 25 in rural areas qazvin was recognized as a separate province in 1997 due to its special geographical location near the capital of iran yousefi et al 2021b it is well connected with tehran as it lies on a main european transit route in addition since the late 1960s the policy related to the restriction of the establishment of new industries within a radius of 120 km from tehran has led to striking industrial development and agricultural production thus despite its 0 96 share of the country s surface area and 1 6 of its population the province s industry contributes 2 84 to iran s gross domestic product gdp while investment in the province s industry represents 4 2 of all industrial investment in iran statistical centre of iran 2016 accordingly qazvin province is one of the most economically important regions experiencing intensive agricultural activities and suffering from water contamination mirzaei et al 2019 and over grazing in dry pastures eslami et al 2019 2 2 data collections the hybrid method has been used to classify land use and land cover lulc map by combining google earth maps and on screen visual digitization of field data in 2018 1 april 2018 to late september 2018 pastures and forests were extracted using landsat 8 imagery by normalized difference vegetation index ndvi zhumanova et al 2018 the road network map 1 2000 was produced by the data from the urban development organization of iran the river map irrigation network and wells were prepared using data from the agricultural organization of iran dem data was used to generate slope aspect and elevation layers and landsat images were used to produce ndvi darvishi et al 2016 the study was based on 1345 hexagon shaped sample cells each cell 1100 ha lying completely or more than 95 within the borders of the qazvin province fig 1 in this study all measures and indicators have been standardized using fuzzy standardization algorithm 2 3 methods 2 3 1 intermediate disturbance complexity the intermediate disturbance complexity idc model explores how the combination of anthropogenic disturbance and landscape complexity affects the capacity of the land matrix to provide biodiversity and landscape services marull et al 2016a landscape complexity marull et al 2019 can be measured using the landscape ecology le metric which captures landscape patterns l heterogeneity and processes eci connectivity for each sample cell the anthropogenic disturbance can be calculated using hanpp haberl et al 2016 which measures the effect of land use on energy availability biomass for heterotrophic food chains and as a resource for building up biomass stocks in terrestrial ecosystems haberl et al 2014 yousefi et al 2021a finally the intermediate disturbance complexity idc model is based on both le and hanpp eq 5 1 i d c l e 1 h a n p p 100 idc improves our understanding of the socioecological functions of a landscape and their potential effects on biodiversity and associated ecosystem services marull et al 2019 and reveals how different management strategies affect the relationship between social metabolism and landscape complexity to conclude the intermediate disturbance complexity the statistical relationships between hanpp and landscape ecology metrics used as proxy for biodiversity in the set of cells of our experimental design at landscape scale hexagons have been studied 2 3 1 1 landscape complexity the land cover map fig 1 was used to estimate the following landscape pattern and process metrics mcgarigal and marks 1995 darvishi et al 2014a dupras et al 2016 marull et al 2018b number of patches np patch richness pr edge density ed shannon weiner index l effective mesh size ems and ecological connectivity index eci np refers to the total number of land cover patches that exist within the sample cells gökyer 2013 the more patches there are the more diverse the landscape in the cells cardille and turner 2017 pr shows the number of different patch types in each sample cell marull et al 2015 pr is used to calculate l which measures the equi diversity of land covers based on two computations the number of distinct patch types and the proportional distribution of the area between the patch types marull et al 2019 by custom these two elements are named richness and evenness richness quantify the landscape composition while evenness measures the landscape configuration as the structural constituent gökyer 2013 therefore l is a useful metric for identifying the landscape pattern in ecology vranken et al 2015 we used the following expression eq 1 2 l i 1 k p i log k p i 1 p u where k is the number of land cover classes potential habitats in the sample cell and pi is the ratio of the non urban land cover in a specific sample cell pu is the built up land cover resulting in the potential habitats loss ed is the total edge in a sample cell darvishi et al 2015 and equals the sum of the lengths m of all edge segments of the corresponding patch type divided by the total area m2 multiplied by 10 000 to convert to hectares if a cell border is present ed includes the cell boundary segments in the corresponding patch type and represents true edge only i e contrast weight 0 if a cell border is absent ed includes a user specified proportion of cell boundary segments in the corresponding patch type clément et al 2017 regardless of whether a sample cell border is present or not ed includes a user specified proportion of background edge segments in the corresponding patch type marull et al 2018a the landscape fragmentation can be estimated by the effective mesh size ems index jaeger 2000 which measures the possibility of a connection between two randomly selected points within a landscape marull et al 2018b in this case the more anthropogenic barriers i e urban areas show a more fragmentation but lower ems and cell connection following marull and mallarach 2005 an ecological connectivity model was used for landscape process assessment this assessment relies on ecological functional areas efa and calculates the cost distance between them including the anthropogenic barriers effect and takes into account the type of barriers the range of distances and the type of land cover involved darvishi et al 2020 the ecological connectivity index eci emphasizes the connectivity role of the efa in the landscape eq 2 e c i b 10 9 l n 1 x i l n 1 x t 3 3 eci m 1 m n ec i b m where ecib is the basic index calculated for each efa separately xi is the value of the sum of the cost distance by pixel xt is the maximum theoretical cost distance and m is the total number of efa in the landscape to calculate the landscape complexity it is necessary to reduce the number of metrics for this purpose the correlations between landscape metrics enabled us to carry out a principal component analysis pca of the variables involved marull et al 2015 the high correlations between landscape metrics table 1 a leads us to perform a pca therefore we carried out a pca of the variables involved table 7 b that shows the major contributors to the first component c1 are pr np ed and l i e landscape patterns while for the second component c2 are ems and eci i e landscape processes our results led us to consider only two variables l and eci so that both components of landscape complexity patterns and processes are represented and include land cover heterogeneity and ecological connectivity l was calculated as a conversion of the shannon wiener index to capture the landscape richness and evenness and eci was calculated based on ecological functional areas and anthropogenic barriers to show the matter and energy flows in the landscape which has been used in several studies marull et al 2015 and 2019 as a representative of the landscape pattern and process respectively once we have reduced the dimensions of the land cover metrics we obtain a component resulting of the linear combination of l and eci component coefficient 0 671 explained variance 71 279 we call this new h eci component landscape metrics le we calculated le using the two different metrics according to marull et al 2019 landscape complexity can be measured using the landscape ecology le metric which captures landscape patterns l heterogeneity and processes eci connectivity for each sample cell in this study eq 3 4 le l ecia 10 2 2 3 1 2 human appropriation of net primary production hanpp hanpp was calculated for each sample cell as the weighted sum of fixed factors wi multiplied by the ratio of the surface area covered by each land cover type eq 4 h a n p p h a n p p l u c h a n p p h a r v h a n p p l u c n p p 0 n p p a c t 5 hanpp i 1 k w i p i where hanppluc is the change of npp due to anthropogenic disturbance and hanppharv is the npp appropriation due to harvests hanppluc indicates the difference between actual npp nppact and potential npp npp0 while wi is the weight and pi is the ratio of land cover i in a sample cell after calculating different npp and harvested quantities hanpp values were calculated npp0 values were extracted from the global hanpp assessment krausmann et al 2013 available at http www uni klu ac at socec inhalt 5605 htm nppact values are the outcomes of the sum of nppharv and nppunharv values harvested ratios from each land cover and across each sample cell were transformed into energy values galán et al 2016 conversion factors such as the losses in the residue product ratio guzmán et al 2014 were applied to account for unharvested biomass 2 3 2 landscape potential hanpp values can be negative when nppact is higher than npp0 due to fertilizer input or irrigation which limits the use of the index in specific places marull et al 2018a given that this is the case of the dry agricultural landscape of the qazvin province we developed a net primary production landscape potential npp0 lp to compensate for this constraint we estimated npp0 lp by taking into account several ecological factors aspect slope elevation vegetation density and water resources that can improve the accuracy of npp0 see fig s1 in supplementary material the analysis aimed to improve the npp0 according to the given criteria using a fuzzy logic approach geographical properties affect biomass production directly due to their impact on environmental factors such as rainfall and temperature and indirectly through their influence on factors such as soil formation ivanov et al 2008 due to the interplay of many different factors understanding how these properties operate is highly complex although an important part of their impact can be attributed to sunlight and moisture regimes griffiths et al 2009 based on fieldwork as the altitude rises above 1800 m a s l vegetation densities gradually decrease thus elevation data were standardized using fuzzy logic as shown in fig s1a according to rezaei et al 2006 increasing slope gradients significantly reduces all landscape function indices as well as soil organic carbon and total nitrogen percentages therefore as the gradient increases biomass production decreases fig s1c the aspect was non directional where the slope is less than 10 makhdoom 2001 the nutrient cycling index was significantly affected by aspect rezaei et al 2006 show that on north facing slopes this index has higher mean values than on south facing slopes accordingly the aspect decreased from north to south fig s1b the four variables aspect slope elevation and vegetation density affect biomass production less vegetation means less available biomass fig s1d every location within 1 km of a water element lake river well irrigation network or reservoir is considered to harbour some type of vegetation fig s1e then water resources are considered to increase biomass production 2 3 3 cluster analysis in order to identify the main landscape typologies in the qazvin province we performed a cluster analysis ca by partitioning the 1354 sample cells based on combinations of human disturbance hanpp and landscape patterns and processes metrics we split the dataset into clusters k means clustering in spss ibm spss statistics version 19 0 0 329 was used which clusters data based on macqueen s algorithm johnson and wichern 2002 the appropriate numbers of clusters were determined by interpreting the meaningfulness of different clustering outputs with the support of a variance ratio criterion milligan and cooper 1985 caliński and harabasz 1974 the data used were first standardized and then clustering was performed based on standardized data demonstrating the different topologies of the landscape will help us to identify the effects of the landscape composition and configuration on the vulnerability of a landscape system the result of the idc model and landscape composition and configuration has been identified in each cluster to communicate between landscape composition and configuration and ecological scarcity 3 results and discussion 3 1 land cover distribution the qazvin province possesses a fairly diversified landscape with mountains in the north and a semi desert area in the east and is surrounded by dry agricultural land there is also a high density of irrigated farms as can be seen in fig 1 the northern part of the region is covered by pastures with high medium and low vegetation density where agriculture occupies less than 5 of the surface area there is also a small area of non productive forest land in the north of the region in total the case study area is covered by forests 0 81 high 7 28 medium 32 56 and low 10 40 pastures deserts 6 75 tree crop groves 5 66 irrigated 14 41 and dry 18 17 farmland water surfaces 0 13 and infrastructures 3 83 3 2 landscape patterns and processes table 2 shows the number of sample cells for five different categories very low low medium high and very high of the six landscape metrics analysed in the qazvin province the territorial distribution of the metric values is expressed by hexagon shaped sample cells fig 2 the results of the landscape pattern metrics showed that 362 sample cells are in the high range of the ed while 503 sample cells are in the low range of the np table 2 in all 76 sample cells have fewer than two different patch types very low pr the highest sample cell count corresponds to the medium range of pr 749 sample cells finally there are just 22 sample cells with a very high pr in general the higher the value of pr the higher l state of the land matrix based on fig 2 wherever there is a permanent river the pr is higher a simple buffer assessment shows that approximately 23 of the sample cells in the case study have a high or very high pr but that in a 2 km margin along the banks of the permanent rivers 35 of the sample cells have a high or very high pr therefore rivers probably have a positive effect on habitat diversity l is very low in 257 sample cells table 2 especially in the east fig 2 which implies that there is less land cover heterogeneity l again when looking at the map the high l values are found in the north and southwest it should be noted that most of the low l values 624 sample cells are scattered throughout the study area especially in the centre the results of the landscape process metrics demonstrated that ems has 615 sample cells with the lowest value table 2 scattered from west to east and from the centre to the south along the motorway which shows that fragmentation has occurred in the land matrix fig 2 the northern and the southern belts as well as the western desert areas have high ems values that show less fragmentation than centre the lowest values of eci fig 2 are mainly due to the impact of the transport network and urban development in total 204 and 335 sample cells respectively have very low or low eci values table 2 however the largest eci value with 369 sample cells has high connectivity it is remarkable to note that even before urban development got underway an increase in agricultural activities and industrialization had already begun as a result decision makers now need to designate ecological corridors to protect biodiversity in the north sample cells still possess high or very high ecological connectivity similar to the west and south fig 2 although these three areas are poorly interconnected the population growth that has occurred since the recognition of qazvin as a new province the urban developments scattered throughout the region especially around the city and along the motorway and the construction of roads to connect these developments act as barriers fragmenting the territory that has all but erased its ecological connectivity nevertheless some landscapes still have high or very high levels of connectivity of up to almost 40 table 1 3 3 net primary production to calculate hanpp different npps were estimated that are shown in fig 3 the npp potential increases from the centre to the north and to the south but the other npps have higher values in the centre and lower values in the north and south this is due to developing agriculture in the centre of the qazvin province which increased the current npp due to less unharvested npp and more harvested npp forests and semi deserts have no harvested npp the centre of the qazvin province has 132 sample cells with negative hanpp values fig 3 that show high current npp and less potential npp due to the use of both fertilizers and irrigation with irrigation and fertilizing the npp capacity could increase in this study npp capacity is based on basic capacity which is one of its defects however given the scarcity of water in the study area negative npp values may imply overcapacity however due to this constraint we tried to resolve the defect caused by the npp potential we created five specific maps shown in fig s1 see supplementary material maps a b c and d show the factors used to decrease the basic values that we obtained from the global hanpp assessment map e shows the water resources which were used as the increasing factor finally map f is the npp0 lp that we used in this case study instead of the basic values of the npp potential aspect slope elevation vegetation density and water resources are the natural factors that affect the npp therefore we applied these local factors to estimate the real npp potential which we refer to as npp0 lp in this case study thus according to fig 4 b north east qazvin has a higher value for the new hanpp value this part of the province has more pastureland and a higher npp0 lp value these pastures are affected by climate change more than other types of land cover in iran tahmasebi et al 2013 askarizadeh et al 2018 as well overgrazing has a serious effect on pastures fallahzade and hajabbasi 2011 soofi et al 2018 as a result in natural areas the higher hanpp reveals resource deterioration probably due to a combination of climate change and overgrazing in the centre of the case study area where irrigated farmland is widespread the hanpp value is lower because of the high production and high unharvested biomass that remains on the land 3 4 intermediate disturbance complexity the results show that idc is low in the north which consists mostly of pastures but is high in the plains where agriculture is predominant fig 4d based on marull et al 2016a wherever the highest level of idc is attained hanpp tends towards 50 60 idc has the highest values traditional agriculture in the qazvin plains had the highest idc nonetheless this relationship seems to be locally variable fig 4 which calls for a further geohistorical study of the complex interplay between driving forces social metabolism integrated land uses and landscape ecology scientifically based agroecological models should critically examine select and adapt biocultural heritage to current contexts and new challenges in sustainable agricultural landscape development pungetti 2013 3 5 relationship between landscape composition and configuration and ecological scarcity the cluster analysis ca grouped the 1354 sample cells into five landscape typologies using three indices landscape pattern c1 pca landscape process c2 pca and hanpp fig 5 the five clusters are titled and characterized based on the specific parameters and main land cover in each group cluster 1 n 542 is called dry pastures due to the dominant cover of pasture by the number of sample cells based on fig 5a the different types of pastures covered 76 of this cluster fig 4a this cluster has low landscape structure heterogeneity gökyer 2013 and high landscape process connectivity that indicated low landscape fragmentation wrbka et al 2004 fig 6 according to fig 7 this cluster has a high intermediate disturbance complexity that can support biodiversity marull et al 2019 cluster 2 n 236 named intensive agriculture lies in the qazvin plains fig 4a it is characterized by intensive agriculture 53 and has a low landscape pattern and process mean values fig 6 it has the lowest hanpp mean value irrigated agriculture groves dry farmland and semi desert contain 87 of this cluster fig 5b which shows this cluster is affected by socio economic drivers this cluster has changed from semi desert to intensive agriculture through human activities which provided high biomass in the landscapes these landscapes were expected to have a low idc but obtained a medium value due to the high biomass remains in the landscapes that can support biodiversity cluster 3 n 296 is named traditional agriculture including the sample cells with crops and trees mostly located near rivers or traditional agriculture sites fig 4a it has a much higher landscape pattern value than other clusters a slightly high process and hanpp value fig 6 this cluster has very sustainable land cover mosaics with mixed different types of pastures 58 irrigated farmland 6 dry farmland 19 and groves 8 fig 5c intermediate disturbance complexity in this cluster is high because of high landscape complexity and high biomass production traditional landscapes can produce more food for humans and support biodiversity simultaneously cluster 4 n 199 is called developed areas due to the sample cells where land uses are primarily industrial and urban area basically located along the main roads fig 4a landscape patterns and processes have low mean value due to landscape fragmentation by transportation networks fig 6 in this cluster 10 of the area has been covered by different types of infrastructures fig 5d including industry 2 urban 5 water surface 1 and the main road 2 anthropogenic disturbance in this cluster is high and landscape heterogeneity is low which makes these landscapes unsuitable for biodiversity because of human disturbance these landscapes lost their food production ability finally cluster 5 n 81 is attributed to desert areas comprising sample cells with dry low pastures as well as semi desert areas in the east of the qazvin province fig 4a landscape metrics fig 6 are characterized by lower patterns homogeneous land cover but higher processes value high ecological connectivity which is because of low anthropogenic disturbances in this case hanpp has a negative value due to low vegetation growth this cluster shows low pastures 46 semi desert 40 and dry farmland 10 covering 96 of the study area due to low precipitation and water scarcity yousefi et al 2020 the idc model has been recently tested in biocultural landscapes including the mediterranean bioregion marull et al 2018a and tropical latin america marull et al 2018b the results are similar in both cases in the past higher landscape metrics patterns and processes were often associated with mid range levels of human disturbance hanpp while current landscape metrics decreased along with increasing hanpp i e high levels of disturbance by intensive industrial farming our study in the middle east region shows similar results with the highest idc values found in traditional agricultural areas moreover traditional agriculture has higher levels of idc than some natural areas including pastures table 3 shows all the values of the landscape metrics for each cluster in the fuzzy logic standard format landscape patterns are higher in clusters 1 and 3 than in other clusters due to the high diversity in land cover types although some of the landscape pattern metrics are lower in cluster 5 the high landscape process metrics in cluster 3 and 5 result from naturalness and continuity of land covers the issue that arises is how to interpret the data according to the density of the hanpp le pairs of values fig 7 reflects the relationship between human disturbance and landscape complexity marull and font 2017 and represents the idc values of a given territory fig 4d fig 7 shows important variables in different clusters of the study ranging from notable human disturbance to very high levels of hanpp mainly because of livestock growth i e overgrazing and climate change effects as well as a decrease in landscape complexity le resulted from destroying traditional integrated agriculture polyculture and the development of infrastructures 4 conclusions we applied the intermediate disturbance complexity idc model marull et al 2016a to the qazvin province to determine the extent of its landscape ecological scarcity human appropriation of net primary production hanpp was used as an indicator of anthropogenic disturbance in dry environments based on landscape metrics patterns and process and hanpp we divided the study area into five landscape typologies and performed a cluster analysis to identify different socioecological patterns due to the methodological limitations of hanpp in specific situations e g irrigated desert landscapes we improved the potential net primary production npp0 lp calculation by incorporating four mitigating factors aspect slope elevation and vegetation and one additional factor water resources into the original model finally we used idc to assess how different levels of human appropriation of photosynthetic capacity affect the landscape s functional structure which potentially hosts biodiversity on a regional scale as far as our best knowledge few researchers have studied the relationship between these variables wrbka et al 2004 haberl et al 2005 vačkář and chobot orlitová 2012 marull et al 2019 the landscape metrics analysis shows that the transportation infrastructures divided the province into northern and southern parts indicating that land use planning should consider the territory as a whole and avoid simply employing a string of ad hoc decisions based on sectorial policies in specific parts of the biocultural landscapes darvishi et al 2020 further the results showed that traditional agriculture could play a key role in hosting biodiversity and meeting social needs even though many researchers believe that agricultural land plays a negative role in biodiversity conservation the results of our study refute this claim and in some areas such as the qazvin province where there is no intensive natural vegetation coverage traditional agriculture can play a key role in hosting biodiversity along with meeting human nutritional needs mehring et al 2017 the cluster analysis and the driving forces indicated that traditional farming plays a crucial role in shaping and maintaining a complex set of land cover mosaics our findings suggest that a great deal of the biodiversity currently that exists in the northern part of the study area may actually be associated with the remaining land cover mosaics that still tended by the local peasantry yousefi et al 2020 then we concluded that the presence of the biocultural heritage may stimulate the hump shaped relationship we found between hanpp and landscape complexity assessed conjointly with land cover heterogeneity and ecological connectivity a result that fits well with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis protecting natural spaces but at the same time allowing them to be isolated by the spread of anthropogenic barriers that decrease ecological connectivity will eventually lead to biodiversity loss in the whole of qazvin province conversely the conservation of heterogeneous and well connected landscapes with a positive interplay between intermediate level of farming disturbance and landscape complexity will help preserve a wildlife friendly agroecological matrix that is likely to hold high levels of biodiversity and sustainable food production the only exceptions perhaps being the rare specialist species that require some specific habitats and other conservation policies tscharntke et al 2012 considering biodiversity is of highly importance in spatial planning as it contributes to food security and other ecosystem services this concept at landscape species and genetic levels will help improve nutrition and sustainable agriculture toledo and burlingame 2006 this integrative approach which focuses on biodiversity and food security is critical for sustainable development and contributes to solving the food biodiversity dilemma cardinale et

24379,future climate conditions will alter the frequency and intensity of typhoons thus post windthrow management which can enhance tree recovery in wind disturbed forests with dense understory species is essential for sustainable forest management to adapt to climate change this study explores management options that can recover the above ground biomass agb and tree species composition after windthrow damage even under climate change a case study area was established in the oshima hiyama national forest in southern hokkaido northern japan which were damaged by typhoons in late august 2016 we incorporated the understory species sasa kurilensis as understory vegetation into the landis ii net ecosystem carbon and nitrogen succession extension v6 3 model to simulate the outcome of tree establishment under climate change agb recovery up to the year 2100 at 1 753 damaged grid cells was simulated for the intergovernmental panel on climate change representative concentration pathway rcp 2 6 and 8 5 scenarios different post windthrow management cases were designed by varying the treatment of fallen trees and the types of trees planted the results demonstrated that salvage logging and planting successfully recovered the agb by 2050 at the landscape scale regardless of the climate change scenario whereas leaving fallen trees in the damaged site or salvage logging only did not facilitate the recovery of agb leaving fallen trees in damaged grid cells as ecological legacies recovered the agb only in damaged grid cells with a sufficient number of advanced seedlings of adequate types of species irrespective of the climate change scenario the decreasing water equivalent of snowpack in the rcp scenarios caused sasa kurilensis mortality and promoted the recovery of agb of trees the dominant species recovered in natural forests which experienced either salvage logging or leaving trees in the damaged site varied among climate change scenarios the warmer climate condition facilitated the recovery of fagus crenata by 2100 these results can help designing a robust forest recovery even in uncertain future climate keywords forest landscape model landis ii wind disturbance forest recovery sasa kurilensis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction disturbance regimes in forest ecosystems such as wind fire and drought will be altered by climate change seidl et al 2017 ipcc 2021 in the asia pacific region the frequency of tropical cyclones is projected to increase yoshida et al 2017 climate change will also increase the wind speed of supertyphoons and the precipitation of each typhoon in the region mext and jma 2020 watanabe et al 2019 yoshida et al 2017 tsuboki et al 2015 strong winds and increased rainfall associated with typhoons cause severe damage to forests morimoto et al 2021a and changes in disturbance regimes will alter the carbon dynamics and species composition of forest ecosystems hotta et al 2021 wu et al 2019 the post windthrow management that can be applied at a regional scale includes damage assessment salvage logging soil scarification site preparation by prescribed burning or by heavy machinery planting seedlings and seeding sanginés de cárcer et al 2021 taeroe et al 2019 currently when a severe forest disaster occurs in japan national and local governments restore the disturbed forests by methods such as salvage logging and planting maff n d under climate change japan will experience intense typhoons more frequently than in the past as reviewed above therefore it is necessary to develop post windthrow management strategies aimed at the rapid recovery of damaged forests before subsequent disturbances occur previous studies have modeled the recovery of tree species after wind disturbances and have examined practices that can enhance engineering resilience holling 1996 using the individual based gap dynamics model and forest landscape model flm they simulated vegetation transitions according to the life history characteristics of each tree he 2008 seidl et al 2011 shifley et al 2017 in particular they assessed the recovery process of above ground carbon dobor et al 2020 biomass and species composition lucash et al 2017 2019 and biodiversity and ecosystem services cantarello et al 2017 lucash et al 2017 demonstrated that active conversion to climate adapted congeneric tree species can recover both species composition and above ground biomass agb before and 50 years after windfall under climate change lucash et al 2017 they also found that the number of tree species within stands and the growth rate of each tree had a positive correlation with medium to long term 50 years recovery of species composition and agb after windfall lucash et al 2019 dobor et al 2020 also reported that salvage logging of damaged trees prevented insect damage and resulted in faster recovery of above ground c 100 years after wind disturbance dobor et al 2020 interactions between trees and understory vegetation must also be considered when planning forest restoration lombaerde et al 2020 a dense and persistent understory vegetation layer inhibits tree establishment and growth by several processes competition for resources allelopathy interference with seed and seedling predation formation of a mechanical barrier through litter accumulation and mechanical damage landuyt et al 2019 royo and carson 2006 however the understory vegetation layer has not been adequately considered in traditional modeling of forest recovery after disturbance landuyt et al 2018 dense and tall often exceeding 2 m in height understory vegetation e g dwarf bamboo sasa spp is widely distributed on the forest floor in heavy snowfall regions of east asia toyooka et al 1983 when disturbance events create gaps the understory species grow rapidly suppressing tree regeneration nakashizuka and numata 1982 yamamoto 2000 thus hand weeding and soil scarification is important for reforestation hirata et al 2011 ito et al 2018 previous studies have demonstrated that gaps did not develop into forests even after 35 45 years without soil scarification aoyama et al 2011 masaki et al 2021 and that the above ground c content of a site was reduced by up to 44 compared to that of a site planted after surface scarification owari et al 2011 several studies have modeled the interactions between over and understory species under climate change to understand the impact on long term forest dynamics four types of modeling approaches have been utilized logistic growth of the diameter at breast height dbh or tree height rule based modeling demographic modeling and statistical modeling brock et al 2020 landuyt et al 2018 for example the landclim model focused on light and water competition between four types of herbs grasses tall forbs ferns and small herbs and seedlings the model was modified to compute the leaf area index lai of herbs as a function of the diameter growth of herbs and successfully simulated the phenomena of arrested succession thrippleton et al 2016 2018a the modified landclim model demonstrated that large herbaceous biomass and ungulate browsing are a strong filter for tree regeneration and result in arrested succession thrippleton et al 2018b furthermore in ferns that do not produce structural tissues and do not have dbh competition with seedlings was modeled using height as an indicator of growth brock et al 2020 new zealand forest dynamics simulations revealed that shade intolerant conifers persisted longer and grew larger in the presence of dense ferns because the ferns reduced angiosperm density and moderated the competition of tree species brock et al 2020 in herb layer introduction into the landscape dndc model haas et al 2013 the herb layer increased the above ground net ecosystem productivity nep after disturbance however the increase in nep was greater when the damaged stand could be restored to forest dirnböck et al 2020 thus several models have represented the competitive relationship between herb layers and tree species and investigated how the direct effects of climate change on tree regeneration are altered by herb layers however the distribution and density of understory vegetation layers will be altered due to climate change tsuyama et al 2011 modeling of the interaction between understory and tree species requires more mechanistic simulation to represent the indirect effects of climate change on tree regeneration dynamics after disturbances landuyt et al 2019 2018 against this background the purpose of this study is to propose post windthrow management strategies capable of regenerating forests under climate change using a modified process based flm the specific objectives are i to introduce understory species into the landis ii flm ii to identify the key mechanism of biomass recovery under climate change and iii to robustly explore post windthrow management strategies for the treatment of damaged trees the reforestation strategy and the survival rates of dwarf bamboo and tree seedlings to quickly recover biomass and species composition 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description this study was conducted in the forest management area of the oshima hiyama national forest in northern japan fig 1 42 27 n 139 51 e elevation between 5 and 1 090 m above sea level a s l total area of 136 km2 spatial resolution of analysis was 10 m 10 m plantation and natural forests were located at low to mid and mid to high elevations respectively the mean annual temperature was 2 5 c 9 2 c while the annual precipitation was 1 059 1 835 mm national land information division national spatial planning and regional policy bureau mlit of japan 2012 the annual maximum snow depth was 61 447 cm the soil was mainly cambisol iuss working group wrb 2006 categorized as brown forest soil hokkaido prefecture 2020 and the dominant tree species in the national forest before the wind disturbances are listed in table 1 the plantation forests consisted of abies sachalinensis and crypotomeria japonica whereas the natural forests mainly consisted of fagus crenata and betula ermanii among other species standard forestry practice in national forests of the study area is the thinning and clear cutting of a sachalinensis in plantation forests the study area was located near the northern limit of f crenata c japonica whose northern limit of natural distribution is located in northern honshu is planted only in this area in hokkaido c japonica is widely distributed even in the warmest regions of japan and is expected to increase in growth under climate change in areas that are currently cold toriyama et al 2021 in hokkaido prefecture almost 90 of the forest floor is covered by dwarf bamboo toyooka et al 1983 the dominant understory vegetation in our study area was sasa kurilensis which often exceeds 2 m in height toyooka et al 1983 the study areas experienced severe wind disturbances by three typhoons chanthu kompasu and lionrock in august 2016 fig 1 a total of 1 753 grid cells were damaged by strong winds and heavy rains over 30 m

and the natural forests of f crenata and b ermanii 932 grid cells 160 1 021 m a s l the spatial distributions of tree seedlings and dwarf bamboo s kurilensis at each damaged site were not recorded 2 2 landis ii model necn v6 3 2 2 1 general description of necn v6 3 in this study landis ii a flm was applied to simulate forest recovery by post windthrow management under climate change scheller et al 2007 landis ii is a spatially explicit flm developed based on the gap dynamic model and is used to calculate the vegetation dynamics of shrubs and trees for a species age cohort scheller et al 2007 over the past 20 years this model has been applied to various areas mainly in north america http www landis ii org projects several studies also applied the landis ii in the other landscape of the same prefecture in japan to conduct a scenario analysis of ecosystem services haga et al 2019 and 2020 and simulate the tree recovery on nursery logs hotta et al 2021 the landis ii model allows the user to select a submodule that calculates seed establishment growth competition mortality and c and nutrient cycles in this study the net ecosystem carbon and nitrogen succession extension v6 3 hereafter referred to as necn v6 3 scheller et al 2011 was selected for the following reasons i it can mechanistically compute the establishment and biomass growth of seedlings as a function of temperature and precipitation ii the tree species cohorts in necn v6 3 are represented by its species name age and biomass and it is common to other landis ii extensions and iii previous versions of necn have been applied in vegetation recovery research following mountain fire and windthrow disturbances lucash et al 2019 2018 2017 necn v6 3 was developed based on the landis ii biomass succession extension scheller et al 2007 and implements soil organic matter and c dynamics from the century model parton et al 1987 and the environmental response function related to the establishment and growth of plant species cohorts under climate change 2 2 2 modifications of necn v6 3 in this study we modified three ecological processes of necn v6 3 to represent the competition between understory vegetation particularly s kurilensis which has settled on every forest floor and seedlings first the establishment probability calculation of necn v6 3 was modified to reflect the lai of both tree and understory species fig 2 a second the tree and understory vegetation layers were separated to compute the realistic light competition depending on their agb which was used as a surrogate variable for understory and tree height fig 2b third the additional mortality of the understory vegetation layer due to the water equivalent of snowpack decline under future climate change was calculated fig 2 these modifications to necn v6 3 allow the model users to represent the phenomenon that trees cannot be established on a dark forest floor covered by dense understory vegetation depending on their shade tolerance in addition even if tree species cohorts can be established at the site their agb growth will be suppressed by understory vegetation until the agb of the trees exceeds that of the understory vegetation furthermore the modified necn v6 3 can represent the indirect impacts of climate change on tree recovery through changes in the understory vegetation dynamics fig 2 details of the modifications are provided below first necn v6 3 computes whether seedlings of tree species s p p can be established at a grid cell i in a certain year y r by algorithm 1 algorithm 1 prob en v yr i spp min soil moist botk inde gree day minj ante mp if tree coho rt b m i c unde rsto ry b m i unde rsto ryad just then spec ie s spp can be established at site s in algorithm 1 p r o b e n v y r i s p p is determined based on the minimum of the three environmental conditions the index of dryness the growing degree days gdd and the lowest temperature in january soilmoist is the establishment probability calculated based on the degree of dryness in a year and the probability decreases as the number of drying days increases 0 1 botkindegreeday is a convex upward function 0 1 of the 4 4 c based gdd in addition minjantemp is a function that returns 1 when the site is above the minimum allowable temperature for each species and 0 otherwise see the user guide and source code of necn v6 3 for more information lastly p r o b l i g h t y r i s p p represents the degree of shade table 2 estimated from the total lai of both tree and understory vegetation at the site and the shade tolerance of the species tables 2 and 3 by incorporating understory vegetation the total lai increases depending on the amount of understory vegetation and p r o b l i g h t y r i s p p becomes more accurate a species cohort can be established at site s when the two establishment probabilities exceed uniformly generated random numbers 0 1 next the effects of the understory vegetation layer on the agb growth of tree seedlings were incorporated in necn v6 3 the monthly agb growth of the species cohort at each site is calculated as the difference between the monthly net primary productivity npp and mortality the monthly npp is computed as a function of the maximum monthly npp for the species soil temperature cohort lai and competition between cohorts for light water and nitrogen resources at each site the original necn v6 3 assumed that the older cohorts are always taller than younger ones therefore older cohorts had an advantage in competing for light we modified this light competition algorithm such that seedlings are suppressed by understory cohorts if the agb of a tree cohort is smaller than that of the understory cohorts to identify whether the species is understory or not a new boolean species parameter was added this modification allows seedlings to be released from suppression by understory cohorts when their agb increases as illustrated in eq 1 and 2 1 grid la i m i c

0 28 0 42 and 0 56 were tested and 0 14 was selected based on the agb growth of trees see supplementary material s4 finally climate change will affect the distribution of s kurilensis hereafter referred to as dwarf bamboo species through changes in temperature and snow depth a decrease in snow cover due to climate change will reduce the biomass of dwarf bamboo as winter snow cover has been reported to protect dwarf bamboo from frost damage and desiccation oshima 1962 usui 1962 previous species distribution modeling studies showed that the maximum snow water equivalent is a key explanatory variable of the distribution of sasa species including s kurilensis tsuyama et al 2008 and 2011 for example tsuyama et al 2008 demonstrated the maximum snow water equivalent decrease resulted in a reduction of s kurilensis habitat thus the rate of additional winter mortality of dwarf bamboo in year y was set with reference to changes in the maximum annual water equivalent of snowpack mm y 1 calculated in necn v6 3 and the mean monthly temperature in january c for each climate scenario the decrease in the agb of dwarf bamboo in year y a d d m o r t r a t e y was calculated as 3 a d d m o r t r a t e y m a x w e s y 3 m a x w e s 2010 s 3 where m a x w e s y is the maximum annual water equivalent of snowpack mm y 1 and m a x w e s 2010 s is the mean m a x w e s y during the 2010s mm y 1 we aimed to calculate the ratio in volume cm3 then we used a cubic function to convert the units of cm to cm3 the agb of dwarf bamboo was reduced as a d d m o r t r a t e y yearly when the following two conditions were met simultaneously i the m a x w e s y sufficiently decreased more than 1 σ from the mean amount in the 2010s i e the decrease was larger than the current annual variance and ii the mean air temperature in january was below 0 c see supplementary material figs s6 6 and s6 7 in the current climate scenario current the additional mortality of dwarf bamboo did not occur because we used the same monthly climate data for every year during the simulation the additional mortality of dwarf bamboo was applied to all dwarf bamboo cohorts by reducing its aboveground biomass using the biomass harvest extension v 4 4 gustafson et al 2000 2 2 3 parameterization of landis ii necn v6 3 necn v6 3 requires the life history traits and parameters for each plant species table 3 lists the parameters related to the model modification and the impact of climate change shade and drought tolerances were set based on the literature values editorial board of essentials of forest and forestry practice faculty of agriculture tokyo university of agriculture and technology 2007 the species temperature requirements for establishment and growth minimum and maximum gdd minimum temperature in january and ppdf parameters were determined based on the occurrence of each species from the vegetation map provided by the ministry of the environment which is a basic survey of the forest ecosystem s diversity at 1 000 monitoring sites biodiversity center of japan moe 2021 maff 2021 ministry of the environment monitoring sites 1000 project 2021 see supplementary material s2 the other parameters e g ppdf 3 and 4 used the default parameters as often as possible see supplementary material s1 dwarf bamboo including s kurilensis is a single breeding plant that is clonally propagated therefore we assumed that dwarf bamboo was located in every forest floor and that the seed dispersal distance was 0 m it has been reported that dwarf bamboo dies all at once after flowering to promote forest succession in 60 100 year cycles janzen 1976 makita et al 2010 however this phenomenon was assumed not to occur during the simulation period the agb growth and mortality were calibrated by referring to the empirical agb growth lai npp and leaf and wood mortality see supplementary material s3 and s4 using the spotpy v1 5 14 package houska et al 2015 global sensitivity analysis was performed using the extended fast method and parameters with high sensitivity were selected saltelli et al 1999 the root mean square error of agb growth and litterfall was used as the objective function the sensitive parameters were calibrated by latin hypercube sampling and the mean values of the top 1 of the parameter candidates were used see supplementary material s4 2 3 landscape initialization 2 3 1 vegetation in necn v6 3 the cohorts in each grid cell at the starting year of the simulation are initialized with user input information about species name age and agb of each cohort in japan forest attribute information such as the dominant tree species age and timber volume m3 ha 1 are recorded in a forest inventory database maff 2017 the spatial distribution of tree species was set according to the forest inventory and the volume m3 ha 1 was converted to agb dry weight biomass m 2 by multiplying the biomass expansion coefficient and volume density greenhouse gas inventory office of japan and ministry of the environment japan eds 2021 if volume information was lacking for a stand it was substituted by the mean volume of the 5 year age class for the same tree species in the forest management area the spatial distributions of seedlings and dwarf bamboo were not recorded in the forest inventory the abundance of seedlings was set based on pre simulation using necn v6 3 we performed three spin up simulations based on the dominant species and their age before the windthrow disturbance and the surrounding forest structure for the spin up simulation seed dispersal from tree species within 500 m of each of the 1 753 damaged stands was considered among the cohorts established during the spin up simulation we assumed that those with less than the minimum agb in the local yield table which was equivalent to 12 to 16 years old cohorts were seedlings this was because necn v6 3 only tracks each cohort s age and biomass information the species name and mean volume of seedlings were then calculated from the spin up for each damaged site s kurilensis was assumed to be distributed in every forest stand however the agb of dwarf bamboo varies among stands based on the individual tree size distance and species in each forest stand tatsumi and owari 2013 thus we first estimated the culm density of dwarf bamboo from the tree species type broadleaf or conifer tree density and distance from the dwarf bamboo to the tree in the forest stand using the hierarchical bayesian model developed by tatsumi and owari 2013 the tree species type and tree density information were obtained from the forest inventory database the trees and dwarf bamboo were assumed to be uniformly distributed across the 10 m 10 m grid cell because landis ii does not consider spatial heterogeneity within a grid cell therefore the distance to the trees from dwarf bamboo was assumed to be zero the agb of dwarf bamboo on the forest floor has been reported to be one half to one third that in open land saitoh et al 2012 thus the agb of dwarf bamboo in the stand with the highest culm density was assumed to be the maximum agb in the literature 7 kg biomass m 2 to avoid underestimating the agb of dwarf bamboo in addition the agb of dwarf bamboo was assumed to decrease as the culm density decreased the ages of dwarf bamboo and seedlings were assumed to be 11 and 10 years respectively at the start of the simulations 2 3 2 ecoregion in the necn grid cells with similar climatic conditions have the same climatic data to simulate vegetation transitions at a large spatial extent thus climate clusters were determined from the 30 year mean yearly weather values using a grid with 1 km resolution national land information division national spatial planning and regional policy bureau mlit of japan 2012 then k means clustering was performed to identify three climate clusters using the warmth index wi the mean temperature in january and the precipitation in summer april to september and winter october to march each 1 km resolution grid cell was classified as either lowland low altitude high temperature low rainfall highland high altitude low temperature high rainfall in winter or midland located between lowland and highland in terms of altitude see supplementary material figs s6 1 s6 3 the initial values of the soil c pool soil depth and soil texture were set based on the literature and previous studies haga et al 2020 ugawa et al 2012 the decomposition rate parameters were the same as those used in a previous study haga et al 2020 2 4 scenarios 2 4 1 climate change the statistically downscaled intergovernmental panel on climate change representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios at 1 km 1 km resolution across japan were spatially averaged across ecoregions agro meteorological grid square data naro nishimori et al 2019 the rcp 2 6 and 8 5 scenarios were available for five climate models csiro mk3 6 0 gfdl cm3 hadgem2 es miroc5 and mri cgcm3 the monthly maximum and minimum temperatures and the total monthly precipitation were extracted for each climate model and rcp as input data for necn v6 3 the maximum water equivalent of snowpack per year m a x w e s y in eq 3 was calculated using future climate data and the necn v6 3 internal algorithm considering the balance between the monthly maximum minimum temperature precipitation snowmelt and sublimation the extreme and moderate climate scenarios were selected using the maximum and minimum changes in the wi 5 c base c y 1 precipitation mm y 1 and m a x w e s mm y

temperature rise and precipitation decrease and rcp8 5 gfdl cm3 maximum temperature rise and maximum m a x w e s decrease were selected table 4 and supplementary material figs s6 4 s6 7 finally we prepared five future climate scenarios for forest recovery simulation including the aforementioned four future climate scenarios and one in which the 30 year mean climate continued 2 4 2 post windthrow management in this study we assumed that all overstory trees were collapsed in the site damaged by the three typhoons in 2016 three post management cases were designed for each forest type i e natural and plantation forests based on the treatment of damaged trees the reforestation strategy and the survival rates of dwarf bamboo and tree seedlings in the control cl case all fallen trees were left on the forest floor in natural and plantation forests and the agb of dwarf bamboo and advanced seedlings the cohorts that survived the wind damage was assumed to be reduced by 10 due to being trapped under fallen trees in the cases of salvage logging sl1 and sl2 the fallen trees were removed from the forest stand in the plantation forests in the two salvage logging sl cases the cohorts of all species on the forest floor were completely removed to represent soil scarification removal of surface soil and remaining roots by heavy machinery for the following plantation in sl1 the same tree species as the trees collapsed by typhoons were planted whereas in sl2 c japonica which is distributed in warmer regions was planted in the two sl cases weeding of dwarf bamboo and clean cutting of non plantation species were performed 1 5 10 20 and 30 years after the typhoon referring to the standard local forestry practice hokkaido 2019 in natural forests in the two sl cases natural regeneration was promoted by removing fallen trees with heavy machinery without scarifying the ground after fallen trees were removed therefore in these forests 60 of the dwarf bamboo and advanced seedling biomass was assumed to be reduced according to a previous study ohsato et al 1996 the agb reduction of dwarf bamboo and seedlings the tree planting and clean cutting was conducted by the biomass harvest extension v 4 4 gustafson et al 2000 2 5 simulation settings and evaluation 2 5 1 single grid cell simulation as sensitivity analysis using the calibrated landis ii we performed a sensitivity analysis of the effect of the initial dwarf bamboo biomass u n d e r s t o r y a d j u s t and advanced tree seedling biomass on forest recovery it has been suggested that recovery is difficult when the herbaceous agb exceeds 400 g m 2 thrippleton et al 2018b therefore we used 0 100 200 300 400 500 1 500 3 000 and 4 500 g m 2 for both the dwarf bamboo and seedling biomass the u n d e r s t o r y a d j u s t parameter was tested from 0 5 to 1 5 in increments of 0 5 the climate data of the lowland ecoregion for all five climate change scenarios were used a total of 86 years of simulations until 2100 were repeated 10 times for each scenario we evaluated changes in the agb and the recovery time required for the agb of the tree cohort to exceed that of the dwarf bamboo we defined that a site had recovered to a forest when the agb of overstory species exceeded that of understory species we also defined recovery time as the time from 2016 to the site was recovered to the forest 2 5 2 landscape simulation landscape scale vegetation succession in the entire study area 139 km2 including 1 753 damaged sites was simulated from 2014 to 2100 the time step for the agb growth and material cycle was 1 month whereas that for species recruitment and the additional mortality of dwarf bamboo was 1 year the additional mortality of dwarf bamboo due to climate change and post windthrow management was calculated using biomass harvest extension v 4 4 the agb was output every 2 years by output biomass v 3 0 and biomass by age output v 3 0 due to the limitation of computational resources in this study area previous field studies suggested that the natural regeneration of larix kaempheri would not be successful due to disease and rat damage nakagawa 2014 thus natural regeneration of the species was not considered forest regeneration after windthrow damage was evaluated by the agb in 2051 and 2099 and by changes in the dominant species by 2099 we treated 2051 as a mid term endpoint that evaluates how trees recover before the next typhoon may hit the study area the long term impacts on agb and species composition were evaluated by 2099 the analysis was performed using r v4 1 1 r core team 2021 the disturbance and establishment of species cohorts are key stochastic processes in necn v6 3 in this study locations of wind disturbed grid cells were deterministically decided because this study focused on the tree recovery of the wind damaged grid cells in 2016 post windthrow management and the additional mortality of dwarf bamboo were also deterministically simulated moreover the single grid cell simulation indicated that the uncertainty in agb growth and forest recovery after wind disturbance due to the stochastic establishment process was smaller than the differences between climate scenarios forest management scenarios and initial vegetation conditions fig 3 and table 5 thus this study calculated only five repetitions for each combination of climate change scenario and post wind management case due to limited computational resources the dominant species were also compared between the five repetitions at the grid cell level if less than 50 of the repetitions agreed on the dominant species the grid cell was labeled as an uncertain grid cell input files and analysis scripts are available at https github com hagachi project landis understory 3 results 3 1 single grid cell simulation 3 1 1 sensitivity analysis of understory species suppression fig 3 presents the agb recovery after wind disturbance in a single grid cell using the calibrated tree species and dwarf bamboo under the different climate change scenarios where the u n d e r s t o r y a d j u s t parameter was set to 1 b ermanii and quercus crispula which are more shade intolerant than other species dominated when the calculation was started from bare land under the current climate scenario fig 3 row 1 in contrast when the calculation started from the dwarf bamboo dominant condition the site could not be restored to forest until 2100 fig 3 row 1 the agb of dwarf bamboo reached approximately 6 kg m 2 after 20 years these results are in good agreement with other field studies in japan aoyama et al 2011 masaki et al 2021 thus we set the u n d e r s t o r y a d j u s t parameter to 1 in the following simulation climate change altered the future dominant species when the calculation was started from bare land in the four climate change scenarios the agb of b ermanii in 2100 was lower by 24 50 than that in the current climate scenario due to the failure to establish in warmer climates fig 3 column 1 and supplementary material fig s7 2 column 1 this decline allowed q crispula which is distributed in warmer regions table 3 to become the dominant species in the rcp2 6 miroc5 and rcp8 5 gfdl scenarios and the agb of the species was 69 149 higher than that in the current climate scenario fig 3 rows 2 5 when the calculation was initialized with dwarf bamboo shade tolerant species such as a sachalinensis and f crenata dominated in the four climate change scenarios as dwarf bamboo declined due to the decrease in m a x w e s after 2050 broadleaf forests dominated by f crenata which are distributed in warmer regions than a sachalinensis table 3 were established fig 3 rows 2 5 the results also indicate that the impact of climate change and the presence absence of dwarf bamboo on tree species biomass and dominant species was larger than the uncertainty of the stochastic establishment calculation of necn v6 3 3 1 2 sensitivity analysis of the effect of the initial forest stand and climate change on forest recovery time table 5 presents the recovery time in which the agb of the tree species exceeded that of dwarf bamboo after the windthrow in 2015 for each initial agb of a sachalinensis and dwarf bamboo in the case where the agb of advanced tree seedlings of a sachalinensis was smaller than that of dwarf bamboo the forest did not recover for 84 years duration of the simulation in the current climate scenario in the four climate change scenarios the disturbed site was restored to forest regardless of the initial conditions however there were large variations in recovery time in the site where seedlings had a larger agb than dwarf bamboo the recovery time for the rcp 8 5 hadgem2 gfdl csiro scenarios was 28 38 years whereas that for the rcp2 6 miroc5 scenario was an average of 59 years table 5 in contrast in the rcp8 5 hadgem2 gfdl csiro scenarios the site was restored to forest in approximately 10 years when the agb of dwarf bamboo was less than or equal to that of advanced tree seedlings when the agb of the seedlings was less than 500 g m 2 the rcp2 6 miroc5 scenario required approximately 50 years for the site to be restored to forest regardless of the initial conditions supplementary material fig s7 3 in the current climate scenario forest recovery was possible only if the agb of advanced tree seedlings was sufficiently larger than that of dwarf bamboo supplementary material fig s7 3 3 2 landscape simulation 3 2 1 agb in forest recovery agb recovery in the 1 753 damaged grid cells differed significantly as a result of different post windthrow management strategies and climate change fig 4 the standard deviation of the mean agb of 1 753 grid cells in 2051 between five repetitions were small ranging from 0 01 to 0 13 kg m 2 supplementary material fig s8 in the cl case agb recovery by 2050 was strongly influenced by future climate scenarios the rcp8 5 gfdl cm3 and rcp8 5 hadgem scenarios led to the maximum forest recovery in both natural and plantation forests fig 4 column 1 which is because the agb of dwarf bamboo decreased as the m a x w e s depth decreased supplementary material fig s6 7 in contrast in the cl case both the current and rcp2 6 miroc5 climate scenarios could not achieve forest recovery in natural forests by 2051 in the current climate scenario the abundance of dwarf bamboo was not disturbed by the unchanged m a x w e s in the rcp2 6 miroc5 scenario the decrease in m a x w e s was small in both frequency and intensity due to small changes in temperature and precipitation thus the seedlings in rcp2 6 miroc5 continued to be shaded by dwarf bamboo until 2051 fig 4 upper left panel in the the cl case only 10 of dwarf bamboo was reduced by being trapped by fallen trees as a result the agb of the plantation forest in the cl case was larger by 3 10 kg m 2 than that of the natural forest in 2050 reflecting the difference in advanced seedlings fig 4 column 1 agb recovery in the two sl cases differed according to whether trees were planted and the type of trees planted fig 4 columns 2 3 in natural forests in the sl1 and sl2 cases agb recovery was almost identical to that in natural forests in the cl case because only 60 of dwarf bamboo was removed in plantation forests in the sl1 and sl2 cases dwarf bamboo was completely removed by scarification in order to plant trees and weed after planting thus the plantation forests in the sl1 case recovered the agb to the same level as in 2015 fig 4 bottom middle panel in the plantation forests in the sl1 case where the same tree species as before the wind disturbance were planted the current climate scenario resulted in the highest agb recovery by 2050 fig 4 bottom middle panel when climate adapted tree species were planted in plantation forests in the sl2 case the agb recovery was greater than that in the sl1 case fig 4 bottom right panel agb recovery in natural forests depended on the additional mortality of dwarf bamboo due to climate change and the abundance of dwarf bamboo and advanced seedlings before the typhoon disturbances fig 5 a in natural forests in the cl case the rcp 8 5 gfdl hadgem2 scenarios which exhibited a large decrease in m a x w e s successfully recovered the agb to the same level as the natural forest before the wind disturbance regardless of the initial understory conditions whereas the current and rcp2 6 miroc5 scenarios could not recover the agb in most conditions fig 5a however for all climate change scenarios the agb of trees in 2050 was recovered to the same level as in the natural forests before the wind disturbance only when the initial agb of dwarf bamboo was less than 2 kg m 2 and the initial agb of advanced tree seedlings was 1 2 kg m 2 fig 5a top left panel in the natural forests in the two sl cases 60 of dwarf bamboo and tree seedlings was disturbed by removing fallen trees however recovery was at the same level as in the cl case by 2051 fig 5a top right panel in the plantation forest in the cl case the agb was recovered regardless of the climate change scenario when the initial dwarf bamboo was less than advanced seedlings and enough advanced seedlings were present as in natural forests fig 5b column 1 in the plantation forests in the sl1 and sl2 cases the agb was recovered regardless of the climate change scenario the sl2 case recovered more agb than the sl1 case particularly for the three rcp8 5 scenarios because sl2 involved planting c japonica which is distributed in warmer regions fig 5b columns 2 3 however the agb recovery in the sl1 and sl2 cases in the three rcp8 5 scenarios was less than in the cl case when the advanced seedlings exceeded 1 kg dry weight m 2 fig 5b 3 2 2 dominant species in forest recovery the dominant vegetation in the 2050s and 2100s was uncertain due to future climate scenarios fig 6 the five repetitions were in agreement about the dominant species in almost all the damaged grid cells in 2099 and only less than 4 were not in agreement fig 6 gray and black colors and supplementary material s11 in the cl case 97 of the damaged grid cells were dominated by dwarf bamboo in 2021 five years after the typhoon regardless of the climate scenario on the other hand tree species dominated only 3 of the grid cells in 2021 due to the growth of advanced seedlings in the current climate scenario only 45 of the grid cells were restored to forest even in 2099 supplementary material table s11 1 a sachalinensis and b ermanii dominated the damaged grid cells with less dwarf bamboo and sufficient advanced seedlings after wind damage in the rcp2 6 miroc5 scenario m a x w e s started decreasing after the 2050s thus 52 and 94 of the damaged grid cells recovered to forest by 2051 and 2099 respectively future climate scenarios with rising temperatures reduced the establishment probability of all species except for c japonica in all ecoregions supplementary material figs s9 1 s9 3 thus in the three rcp8 5 scenarios the dominant species and level of agb recovery differed from the current and rcp2 6 miroc5 scenarios in the rcp8 5 csiro gfdl scenarios m a x w e s started decreasing in the same pattern and almost all the damaged grid cells recovered to forest by 2051 however the dominant species differed between the csiro and gfdl models due to the extent of temperature increase the dominant species in csiro in 2099 was a sachalinensis whereas that in gfdl was f crenata which is adapted to warmer environments table 3 in the rcp8 5 hadgem2 scenario where m a x w e s started decreasing after the 2020s shade intolerant tree species such as b ermanii and c japonica dominated the damaged grid cells due to seed dispersal from surrounding forests and the growth of advanced seedlings even in 2021 by 2100 f crenata forests increased as in the gfdl in the two sl cases the removal of damaged trees and plantation resulted in different dominant species from those in the cl case fig 6 columns 2 3 by the 2050s a sachalinensis and c japonica dominated 47 of the damaged grid cells in the sl1 and sl2 cases respectively due to reforestation after removing damaged trees in plantation forests subsequently in the rcp8 5 gfdl scenario where the temperature increase by the 2100s was the largest the dominant species transitioned from a sachalinensis to f crenata in the sl1 case there were few transitions from c japonica to other species in the sl2 case in natural forests in the current climate scenario dwarf bamboo was the dominant species by 2100 regardless of the management scenario fig 6 row 1 in the four rcp scenarios in the sl1 and sl2 cases the 60 reduction in dwarf bamboo and advanced tree seedlings during the removal of damaged trees resulted in different dominant species from those in the cl case fig 6 columns 2 and 3 and supplementary material table s11 in the natural forest in the cl case the dominant species in the four rcp scenarios were mainly pioneer species b ermanii and f crenata which are also currently distributed in warmer areas in contrast in the natural forest in the sl1 and sl2 cases the proportion of grid cells dominated by b ermanii decreased and the proportion of f crenata increased supplementary material table s11 4 discussion this study incorporated the understory vegetation layer in landis ii to simulate the vegetation recovery process of different reforestation methods after stand replacing wind disturbances under climate change our proposed modification is simple and applicable to the other process based landscape models in the following we discuss the utility of introducing understory vegetation in flms potential interactions with other ecological processes implications for reforestation under climate change and the limiting factors for future model improvement 4 1 understory species modeling in the flm the impact of shading by understory herbaceous layers on tree regeneration has been modeled in previous studies thrippleton et al 2016 2018a brock et al 2020 the present study also incorporated competition between understory vegetation and tree layers using the agb and lai computed by landis ii necn v6 3 in addition to this modification we also demonstrated the impact of changes in snow depth due to climate change on understory species i e dwarf bamboo survival which alters the future regeneration dynamics of overstory tree species landuyt et al 2019 2018 the reduction in snow depth and the additional mortality of understory plants were loosely coupled in this study our algorithm is scalable for models that compute i the lai internally ii the establishment and biomass growth of a plant cohort as a function of lai and iii the impact of climate change on the lai of understory species thus more mechanistic models applying our algorithm can reveal interactions between climate change understory layers and overstory layers in the case without soil scarification cl the damaged grid cells were dominated by dwarf bamboo and had difficulty recovering the same agb level as prior to the wind disturbance for several decades at landscape scales as also reported in previous studies aoyama et al 2011 masaki et al 2021 as reported by thrippleton et al 2018 400 g biomass m 2 of the herb layer was the threshold for the recovery of tree species however in the current climate scenario in this study the recovery of tree species was affected by the amount of not only the herb layer but also the advanced seedlings table 5 and supplementary material fig s7 4 recovery of tree species was accelerated as dwarf bamboo abundance decreased with climate change table 5 similar results were obtained at the landscape scale fig 5 our results suggest that the success of forest recovery differs greatly due to changes in the survival of understory vegetation the degree of competition between understory vegetation and tree species also depends on the types of understory species aoyama et al 2011 in the modified necn v6 3 competition is controlled by the lai growth rates and the u n d e r s t o r y a d j u s t parameter that adjusts the competitive relationship between understory vegetation and tree species our sensitivity analysis demonstrated that u n d e r s t o r y a d j u s t had a large impact on the recovery time supplementary material table s7 an u n d e r s t o r y a d j u s t value smaller than the default 1 0 resulted in a reduced recovery time this study assumed that u n d e r s t o r y a d j u s t is a common parameter for all understory species however this parameter should be set separately for each species reflecting the individual functional traits in future studies that simulate multiple understory herb species 4 2 key drivers reducing the establishment of tree species under climate change climate change increased the uncertainty of the dominant species that could be established in damaged grid cells a major influence on the establishment probability of tree species was the increase in temperature which differed between climate change scenarios supplementary material s9 in the rcp8 5 scenarios with high temperature increases the establishment probability of species that initially existed in the region such as a sachalinensis and b ermanii decreased reaching almost zero near 2100 the establishment probability of f crenata also decreased but remained high 0 75 until approximately 2050 even in the rcp8 5 scenario in contrast the establishment probability of c japonica exhibited an increasing trend studies using species distribution models have also predicted that the potential vegetation of various species will change with climate change in japan tanaka et al 2012 nakao et al 2013 previous forest landscape modeling studies revealed the impact of temperature and precipitation change and disturbance on tree species regeneration lucash et al 2019 2018 2017 our study supports these studies and emphasizes that the suppression of germination and seedling growth by understory vegetation reduces the opportunity to establish various tree species and is an essential driver of long term forest dynamics under climate change while sl and plantation recovered agb regardless of the initial condition and climate scenario sl alone could not recover the agb by 2050 due to the insufficient reduction of dwarf bamboo figs 4 and 5b our results suggest that forest recovery is possible without sl when the amount of advanced seedlings exceeds that of dwarf bamboo damaged trees in plantation forests are often salvage logged and sold to compensate for the economic losses in addition removing fallen trees from damaged grid cells reduces the risk of a mass attack by bark beetles in surrounding forests which may cause further forest degradation dobor et al 2020 however ecological legacies including fallen trees may contribute to forest regeneration preventing fungal damage of seedlings and improving the light environment harmon and franklin 1989 nakagawa et al 2001 takahashi et al 2000 weaver et al 2009 fallen trees have also been reported to prevent ungulate browsing in the damaged grid cells and to promote forest recovery morimoto et al 2021b in japan the distribution of deer is expanding and deer browsing is a major concern kaji et al 2000 takatsuki 2009 as a result it is critical to understand the interaction between the treatment of fallen trees other disturbance events and regeneration however further modeling studies are required hotta et al 2021 de jager et al 2017 siedl and rammer 2017 4 3 exploring post windthrow management with robust tree recovery regardless of climate change in terms of agb recovery of the plantation forest sl and plantation led to robust recovery by 2050 in this study in both the sl1 and sl2 cases the agb recovered by 2050 regardless of the climate scenario fig 4 and supplementary material fig s10 planting climate change adapted tree species promoted higher agb recovery than planting current species in large temperature increase scenarios at the landscape scale leaving fallen trees at the damaged site led to higher agb recovery than sl and plantation however the dominant species around 2100 depended on the temperature response of each species in the natural forest the presence of advanced seedlings reduced the uncertainty of agb recovery between different climate scenarios by 2050 in both the cl and two sl cases fig 5 however there was high uncertainty about the dominant species for different climate change scenarios and different approaches for treating fallen trees fig 6 therefore robust forest regeneration using ecological legacies as described in section 4 2 after wind damage requires the effective detection of damaged sites and the screening of suitable sites by referring to both understory species and seedlings this study did not consider the mass attack of bark beetles and the expansion of the deer population under climate change thus our results should be interpreted with caution fallen trees on the forest floor prevent deer browsing but may increase the risk of mass attacks by bark beetles on the surrounding forest climate change will also cause the regime shift of these disturbances ohashi et al 2016 cudmore et al 2010 thus leaving fallen trees will be effective in forests where the deer population density is high and there are no artificial forests nearby to avoid the risk of disease and pests 4 4 limitations of our model modification in this study we did not perform detailed modeling of the plant physiological phenomena based on the mortality of the understory vegetation the timing of the flowering and death of dwarf bamboo species can only be roughly estimated from past flowering behavior through a review of the literature and interviews with experts stochastic modeling of the simultaneous death of dwarf bamboo is a key future task moreover landis ii assumes that the amount of woody tissue affects competitive relationships this study modeled sasa species which have large agb and culms and the applicability of our results to other types of understory species must be carefully verified this study used agb and lai as a proxy for the light competition between understory and seedlings because necn v6 3 does not directly calculate a light environment moreover the effect of seedling suppression by understory was implemented as a step function to simplify the algorithm i e seedlings were suddenly released from the suppression at a threshold the further application of our algorithm into mechanistic models of light environment photosynthesis and tree height growth will enable the gradual release of suppression which is more realistic moreover the parameterization of the establishment probability table table 2 is another challenge in this study due to the data limitation in the ordinal landis ii studies users use the default table but it will affect long term species composition the current landis ii model is unable to accurately predict changes in snow depth however our sensitivity analysis indicated the importance of snow depth calculation since necn v6 3 computes the water equivalent of snowpack in monthly steps using a bucket model in this study dwarf bamboo was disturbed only when the snow was sufficiently reduced focusing only on relative changes in the current and future snow depth eq 2 to consider the impacts of snow depth change on the phenology and survival of tree seedlings and understory species the calculation of snow depth should also be improved the initial spatial distribution of understory vegetation is also difficult to predict therefore in this study dwarf bamboo was estimated based on the type and density of tree species and seedlings were estimated by pre simulation several studies based on unmanned aerial vehicles have estimated the distribution of understory species inoue et al 2019 lombaerde et al 2020 combining studies on dwarf bamboo and tree seedling estimation can help to understand the holistic relationships between over and understory species during climate change 5 conclusions in this study we introduced understory species into the landis ii necn v6 3 flm and simulated forest recovery after windthrow disturbances in northern japan to explore robust and sustainable post windthrow management strategies under different future climate change scenarios the results revealed that sl and plantation was able to recover the agb regardless of the climate change scenario leaving fallen trees on damaged grid cells as ecological legacies successfully recovered the agb regardless of the climate change scenario only if the grid cells had a larger agb of advanced seedlings of adequate types of species than dwarf bamboo however the dominant tree species in the recovered forest varied among different climate change scenarios these results can help designing a robust forest recovery even in uncertain future climate funding this research was funded by the environment research and

24379,future climate conditions will alter the frequency and intensity of typhoons thus post windthrow management which can enhance tree recovery in wind disturbed forests with dense understory species is essential for sustainable forest management to adapt to climate change this study explores management options that can recover the above ground biomass agb and tree species composition after windthrow damage even under climate change a case study area was established in the oshima hiyama national forest in southern hokkaido northern japan which were damaged by typhoons in late august 2016 we incorporated the understory species sasa kurilensis as understory vegetation into the landis ii net ecosystem carbon and nitrogen succession extension v6 3 model to simulate the outcome of tree establishment under climate change agb recovery up to the year 2100 at 1 753 damaged grid cells was simulated for the intergovernmental panel on climate change representative concentration pathway rcp 2 6 and 8 5 scenarios different post windthrow management cases were designed by varying the treatment of fallen trees and the types of trees planted the results demonstrated that salvage logging and planting successfully recovered the agb by 2050 at the landscape scale regardless of the climate change scenario whereas leaving fallen trees in the damaged site or salvage logging only did not facilitate the recovery of agb leaving fallen trees in damaged grid cells as ecological legacies recovered the agb only in damaged grid cells with a sufficient number of advanced seedlings of adequate types of species irrespective of the climate change scenario the decreasing water equivalent of snowpack in the rcp scenarios caused sasa kurilensis mortality and promoted the recovery of agb of trees the dominant species recovered in natural forests which experienced either salvage logging or leaving trees in the damaged site varied among climate change scenarios the warmer climate condition facilitated the recovery of fagus crenata by 2100 these results can help designing a robust forest recovery even in uncertain future climate keywords forest landscape model landis ii wind disturbance forest recovery sasa kurilensis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction disturbance regimes in forest ecosystems such as wind fire and drought will be altered by climate change seidl et al 2017 ipcc 2021 in the asia pacific region the frequency of tropical cyclones is projected to increase yoshida et al 2017 climate change will also increase the wind speed of supertyphoons and the precipitation of each typhoon in the region mext and jma 2020 watanabe et al 2019 yoshida et al 2017 tsuboki et al 2015 strong winds and increased rainfall associated with typhoons cause severe damage to forests morimoto et al 2021a and changes in disturbance regimes will alter the carbon dynamics and species composition of forest ecosystems hotta et al 2021 wu et al 2019 the post windthrow management that can be applied at a regional scale includes damage assessment salvage logging soil scarification site preparation by prescribed burning or by heavy machinery planting seedlings and seeding sanginés de cárcer et al 2021 taeroe et al 2019 currently when a severe forest disaster occurs in japan national and local governments restore the disturbed forests by methods such as salvage logging and planting maff n d under climate change japan will experience intense typhoons more frequently than in the past as reviewed above therefore it is necessary to develop post windthrow management strategies aimed at the rapid recovery of damaged forests before subsequent disturbances occur previous studies have modeled the recovery of tree species after wind disturbances and have examined practices that can enhance engineering resilience holling 1996 using the individual based gap dynamics model and forest landscape model flm they simulated vegetation transitions according to the life history characteristics of each tree he 2008 seidl et al 2011 shifley et al 2017 in particular they assessed the recovery process of above ground carbon dobor et al 2020 biomass and species composition lucash et al 2017 2019 and biodiversity and ecosystem services cantarello et al 2017 lucash et al 2017 demonstrated that active conversion to climate adapted congeneric tree species can recover both species composition and above ground biomass agb before and 50 years after windfall under climate change lucash et al 2017 they also found that the number of tree species within stands and the growth rate of each tree had a positive correlation with medium to long term 50 years recovery of species composition and agb after windfall lucash et al 2019 dobor et al 2020 also reported that salvage logging of damaged trees prevented insect damage and resulted in faster recovery of above ground c 100 years after wind disturbance dobor et al 2020 interactions between trees and understory vegetation must also be considered when planning forest restoration lombaerde et al 2020 a dense and persistent understory vegetation layer inhibits tree establishment and growth by several processes competition for resources allelopathy interference with seed and seedling predation formation of a mechanical barrier through litter accumulation and mechanical damage landuyt et al 2019 royo and carson 2006 however the understory vegetation layer has not been adequately considered in traditional modeling of forest recovery after disturbance landuyt et al 2018 dense and tall often exceeding 2 m in height understory vegetation e g dwarf bamboo sasa spp is widely distributed on the forest floor in heavy snowfall regions of east asia toyooka et al 1983 when disturbance events create gaps the understory species grow rapidly suppressing tree regeneration nakashizuka and numata 1982 yamamoto 2000 thus hand weeding and soil scarification is important for reforestation hirata et al 2011 ito et al 2018 previous studies have demonstrated that gaps did not develop into forests even after 35 45 years without soil scarification aoyama et al 2011 masaki et al 2021 and that the above ground c content of a site was reduced by up to 44 compared to that of a site planted after surface scarification owari et al 2011 several studies have modeled the interactions between over and understory species under climate change to understand the impact on long term forest dynamics four types of modeling approaches have been utilized logistic growth of the diameter at breast height dbh or tree height rule based modeling demographic modeling and statistical modeling brock et al 2020 landuyt et al 2018 for example the landclim model focused on light and water competition between four types of herbs grasses tall forbs ferns and small herbs and seedlings the model was modified to compute the leaf area index lai of herbs as a function of the diameter growth of herbs and successfully simulated the phenomena of arrested succession thrippleton et al 2016 2018a the modified landclim model demonstrated that large herbaceous biomass and ungulate browsing are a strong filter for tree regeneration and result in arrested succession thrippleton et al 2018b furthermore in ferns that do not produce structural tissues and do not have dbh competition with seedlings was modeled using height as an indicator of growth brock et al 2020 new zealand forest dynamics simulations revealed that shade intolerant conifers persisted longer and grew larger in the presence of dense ferns because the ferns reduced angiosperm density and moderated the competition of tree species brock et al 2020 in herb layer introduction into the landscape dndc model haas et al 2013 the herb layer increased the above ground net ecosystem productivity nep after disturbance however the increase in nep was greater when the damaged stand could be restored to forest dirnböck et al 2020 thus several models have represented the competitive relationship between herb layers and tree species and investigated how the direct effects of climate change on tree regeneration are altered by herb layers however the distribution and density of understory vegetation layers will be altered due to climate change tsuyama et al 2011 modeling of the interaction between understory and tree species requires more mechanistic simulation to represent the indirect effects of climate change on tree regeneration dynamics after disturbances landuyt et al 2019 2018 against this background the purpose of this study is to propose post windthrow management strategies capable of regenerating forests under climate change using a modified process based flm the specific objectives are i to introduce understory species into the landis ii flm ii to identify the key mechanism of biomass recovery under climate change and iii to robustly explore post windthrow management strategies for the treatment of damaged trees the reforestation strategy and the survival rates of dwarf bamboo and tree seedlings to quickly recover biomass and species composition 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description this study was conducted in the forest management area of the oshima hiyama national forest in northern japan fig 1 42 27 n 139 51 e elevation between

the mean annual temperature was 2 5 c 9 2 c while the annual precipitation was 1 059 1 835 mm national land information division national spatial planning and regional policy bureau mlit of japan 2012 the annual maximum snow depth was 61 447 cm the soil was mainly cambisol iuss working group wrb 2006 categorized as brown forest soil hokkaido prefecture 2020 and the dominant tree species in the national forest before the wind disturbances are listed in table 1 the plantation forests consisted of abies sachalinensis and crypotomeria japonica whereas the natural forests mainly consisted of fagus crenata and betula ermanii among other species standard forestry practice in national forests of the study area is the thinning and clear cutting of a sachalinensis in plantation forests the study area was located near the northern limit of f crenata c japonica whose northern limit of natural distribution is located in northern honshu is planted only in this area in hokkaido c japonica is widely distributed even in the warmest regions of japan and is expected to increase in growth under climate change in areas that are currently cold toriyama et al 2021 in hokkaido prefecture almost 90 of the forest floor is covered by dwarf bamboo toyooka et al 1983 the dominant understory vegetation in our study area was sasa kurilensis which often exceeds 2 m in height toyooka et al 1983 the study areas experienced severe wind disturbances by three typhoons chanthu kompasu and lionrock in august 2016 fig 1 a total of 1 753 grid cells were damaged by strong winds and heavy rains over 30 m s and 55 mm day at maximum respectively morimoto et al 2021a japan meteorological agency 2022 the damaged grid cells included the plantation forests of a sachalinensis 812 grid cells 140 724 m a s l and the natural forests of f crenata and b ermanii 932 grid cells 160 1 021 m a s l the spatial distributions of tree seedlings and dwarf bamboo s kurilensis at each damaged site were not recorded 2 2 landis ii model necn v6 3 2 2 1 general description of necn v6 3 in this study landis ii a flm was applied to simulate forest recovery by post windthrow management under climate change scheller et al 2007 landis ii is a spatially explicit flm developed based on the gap dynamic model and is used to calculate the vegetation dynamics of shrubs and trees for a species age cohort scheller et al 2007 over the past 20 years this model has been applied to various areas mainly in north america http www landis ii org projects several studies also applied the landis ii in the other landscape of the same prefecture in japan to conduct a scenario analysis of ecosystem services haga et al 2019 and 2020 and simulate the tree recovery on nursery logs hotta et al 2021 the landis ii model allows the user to select a submodule that calculates seed establishment growth competition mortality and c and nutrient cycles in this study the net ecosystem carbon and nitrogen succession extension v6 3 hereafter referred to as necn v6 3 scheller et al 2011 was selected for the following reasons i it can mechanistically compute the establishment and biomass growth of seedlings as a function of temperature and precipitation ii the tree species cohorts in necn v6 3 are represented by its species name age and biomass and it is common to other landis ii extensions and iii previous versions of necn have been applied in vegetation recovery research following mountain fire and windthrow disturbances lucash et al 2019 2018 2017 necn v6 3 was developed based on the landis ii biomass succession extension scheller et al 2007 and implements soil organic matter and c dynamics from the century model parton et al 1987 and the environmental response function related to the establishment and growth of plant species cohorts under climate change 2 2 2 modifications of necn v6 3 in this study we modified three ecological processes of necn v6 3 to represent the competition between understory vegetation particularly s kurilensis which has settled on every forest floor and seedlings first the establishment probability calculation of necn v6 3 was modified to reflect the lai of both tree and understory species fig 2 a second the tree and understory vegetation layers were separated to compute the realistic light competition depending on their agb which was used as a surrogate variable for understory and tree height fig 2b third the additional mortality of the understory vegetation layer due to the water equivalent of snowpack decline under future climate change was calculated fig 2 these modifications to necn v6 3 allow the model users to represent the phenomenon that trees cannot be established on a dark forest floor covered by dense understory vegetation depending on their shade tolerance in addition even if tree species cohorts can be established at the site their agb growth will be suppressed by understory vegetation until the agb of the trees exceeds that of the understory vegetation furthermore the modified necn v6 3 can represent the indirect impacts of climate change on tree recovery through changes in the understory vegetation dynamics fig 2 details of the modifications are provided below first necn v6 3 computes whether seedlings of tree species s p p can be established at a grid cell i in a certain year y r by algorithm 1 algorithm 1 prob en v yr i spp min soil moist botk inde gree day minj ante mp if tree coho rt b m i c unde rsto ry b m i unde rsto ryad just then spec ie s spp can be established at site s in algorithm 1 p r o b e n v y r i s p p is determined based on the minimum of the three environmental conditions the index of dryness the growing degree days gdd and the lowest temperature in january soilmoist is the establishment probability calculated based on the degree of dryness in a year and the probability decreases as the number of drying days increases 0 1 botkindegreeday is a convex upward function 0 1 of the 4 4 c based gdd in addition minjantemp is a function that returns 1 when the site is above the minimum allowable temperature for each species and 0 otherwise see the user guide and source code of necn v6 3 for more information lastly p r o b l i g h t y r i s p p represents the degree of shade table 2 estimated from the total lai of both tree and understory vegetation at the site and the shade tolerance of the species tables 2 and 3 by incorporating understory vegetation the total lai increases depending on the amount of understory vegetation and p r o b l i g h t y r i s p p becomes more accurate a species cohort can be established at site s when the two establishment probabilities exceed uniformly generated random numbers 0 1 next the effects of the understory vegetation layer on the agb growth of tree seedlings were incorporated in necn v6 3 the monthly agb growth of the species cohort at each site is calculated as the difference between the monthly net primary productivity npp and mortality the monthly npp is computed as a function of the maximum monthly npp for the species soil temperature cohort lai and competition between cohorts for light water and nitrogen resources at each site the original necn v6 3 assumed that the older cohorts are always taller than younger ones therefore older cohorts had an advantage in competing for light we modified this light competition algorithm such that seedlings are suppressed by understory cohorts if the agb of a tree cohort is smaller than that of the understory cohorts to identify whether the species is understory or not a new boolean species parameter was added this modification allows seedlings to be released from suppression by understory cohorts when their agb increases as illustrated in eq 1 and 2 1 grid la i m i c

light competition limit for npp growth ranges from 0 1 k is an adjustment parameter for the sensitivity of biomass growth to s i t e l a i m i c the default value of k was 0 14 thus in this study 0 14 0 28 0 42 and 0 56 were tested and 0 14 was selected based on the agb growth of trees see supplementary material s4 finally climate change will affect the distribution of s kurilensis hereafter referred to as dwarf bamboo species through changes in temperature and snow depth a decrease in snow cover due to climate change will reduce the biomass of dwarf bamboo as winter snow cover has been reported to protect dwarf bamboo from frost damage and desiccation oshima 1962 usui 1962 previous species distribution modeling studies showed that the maximum snow water equivalent is a key explanatory variable of the distribution of sasa species including s kurilensis tsuyama et al 2008 and 2011 for example tsuyama et al 2008 demonstrated the maximum snow water equivalent decrease resulted in a reduction of s kurilensis habitat thus the rate of additional winter mortality of dwarf bamboo in year y was set with reference to changes in the maximum annual water equivalent of snowpack mm y 1 calculated in necn v6 3 and the mean monthly temperature in january c for each climate scenario the decrease in the agb of dwarf bamboo in year y a d d m o r t r a t e y was calculated as 3 a d d m o r t r a t e y m a x w e s y 3 m a x w e s 2010 s 3 where m a x w e s y is the maximum annual water equivalent of snowpack mm y 1 and m a x w e s 2010 s is the mean m a x w e s y during the 2010s mm y 1 we aimed to calculate the ratio in volume cm3 then we used a cubic function to convert the units of cm to cm3 the agb of dwarf bamboo was reduced as a d d m o r t r a t e y yearly when the following two conditions were met simultaneously i the m a x w e s y sufficiently decreased more than 1 σ from the mean amount in the 2010s i e the decrease was larger than the current annual variance and ii the mean air temperature in january was below 0 c see supplementary material figs s6 6 and s6 7 in the current climate scenario current the additional mortality of dwarf bamboo did not occur because we used the same monthly climate data for every year during the simulation the additional mortality of dwarf bamboo was applied to all dwarf bamboo cohorts by reducing its aboveground biomass using the biomass harvest extension v 4 4 gustafson et al 2000 2 2 3 parameterization of landis ii necn v6 3 necn v6 3 requires the life history traits and parameters for each plant species table 3 lists the parameters related to the model modification and the impact of climate change shade and drought tolerances were set based on the literature values editorial board of essentials of forest and forestry practice faculty of agriculture tokyo university of agriculture and technology 2007 the species temperature requirements for establishment and growth minimum and maximum gdd minimum temperature in january and ppdf parameters were determined based on the occurrence of each species from the vegetation map provided by the ministry of the environment which is a basic survey of the forest ecosystem s diversity at 1 000 monitoring sites biodiversity center of japan moe 2021 maff 2021 ministry of the environment monitoring sites 1000 project 2021 see supplementary material s2 the other parameters e g ppdf 3 and 4 used the default parameters as often as possible see supplementary material s1 dwarf bamboo including s kurilensis is a single breeding plant that is clonally propagated therefore we assumed that dwarf bamboo was located in every forest floor and that the seed dispersal distance was 0 m it has been reported that dwarf bamboo dies all at once after flowering to promote forest succession in 60 100 year cycles janzen 1976 makita et al 2010 however this phenomenon was assumed not to occur during the simulation period the agb growth and mortality were calibrated by referring to the empirical agb growth lai npp and leaf and wood mortality see supplementary material s3 and s4 using the spotpy v1 5 14 package houska et al 2015 global sensitivity analysis was performed using the extended fast method and parameters with high sensitivity were selected saltelli et al 1999 the root mean square error of agb growth and litterfall was used as the objective function the sensitive parameters were calibrated by latin hypercube sampling and the mean values of the top 1 of the parameter candidates were used see supplementary material s4 2 3 landscape initialization 2 3 1 vegetation in necn v6 3 the cohorts in each grid cell at the starting year of the simulation are initialized with user input information about species name age and agb of each cohort in japan forest attribute information such as the dominant tree species age and timber volume m3 ha 1 are recorded in a forest inventory database maff 2017 the spatial distribution of tree species was set according to the forest inventory and the volume m3 ha 1 was converted to agb dry weight biomass m 2 by multiplying the biomass expansion coefficient and volume density greenhouse gas inventory office of japan and ministry of the environment japan eds 2021 if volume information was lacking for a stand it was substituted by the mean volume of the 5 year age class for the same tree species in the forest management area the spatial distributions of seedlings and dwarf bamboo were not recorded in the forest inventory the abundance of seedlings was set based on pre simulation using necn v6 3 we performed three spin up simulations based on the dominant species and their age before the windthrow disturbance and the surrounding forest structure for the spin up simulation seed dispersal from tree species within 500 m of each of the 1 753 damaged stands was considered among the cohorts established during the spin up simulation we assumed that those with less than the minimum agb in the local yield table which was equivalent to 12 to 16 years old cohorts were seedlings this was because necn v6 3 only tracks each cohort s age and biomass information the species name and mean volume of seedlings were then calculated from the spin up for each damaged site s kurilensis was assumed to be distributed in every forest stand however the agb of dwarf bamboo varies among stands based on the individual tree size distance and species in each forest stand tatsumi and owari 2013 thus we first estimated the culm density of dwarf bamboo from the tree species type broadleaf or conifer tree density and distance from the dwarf bamboo to the tree in the forest stand using the hierarchical bayesian model developed by tatsumi and owari 2013 the tree species type and tree density information were obtained from the forest inventory database the trees and dwarf bamboo were assumed to be uniformly distributed across the 10 m 10 m grid cell because landis ii does not consider spatial heterogeneity within a grid cell therefore the distance to the trees from dwarf bamboo was assumed to be zero the agb of dwarf bamboo on the forest floor has been reported to be one half to one third that in open land saitoh et al 2012 thus the agb of dwarf bamboo in the stand with the highest culm density was assumed to be the maximum agb in the literature 7 kg biomass m 2 to avoid underestimating the agb of dwarf bamboo in addition the agb of dwarf bamboo was assumed to decrease as the culm density decreased the ages of dwarf bamboo and seedlings were assumed to be 11 and 10 years respectively at the start of the simulations 2 3 2 ecoregion in the necn grid cells with similar climatic conditions have the same climatic data to simulate vegetation transitions at a large spatial extent thus climate clusters were determined from the 30 year mean yearly weather values using a grid with 1 km resolution national land information division national spatial planning and regional policy bureau mlit of japan 2012 then k means clustering was performed to identify three climate clusters using the warmth index wi the mean temperature in january and the precipitation in summer april to september and winter october to march each 1 km resolution grid cell was classified as either lowland low altitude high temperature low rainfall highland high altitude low temperature high rainfall in winter or midland located between lowland and highland in terms of altitude see supplementary material figs s6 1 s6 3 the initial values of the soil c pool soil depth and soil texture were set based on the literature and previous studies haga et al 2020 ugawa et al 2012 the decomposition rate parameters were the same as those used in a previous study haga et al 2020 2 4 scenarios 2 4 1 climate change the statistically downscaled intergovernmental panel on climate change representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios at 1 km 1 km resolution across japan were spatially averaged across ecoregions agro meteorological grid square data naro nishimori et al 2019 the rcp 2 6 and 8 5 scenarios were available for five climate models csiro mk3 6 0 gfdl cm3 hadgem2 es miroc5 and mri cgcm3 the monthly maximum and minimum temperatures and the total monthly precipitation were extracted for each climate model and rcp as input data for necn v6 3 the maximum water equivalent of snowpack per year m a x w e s y in eq 3 was calculated using future climate data and the necn v6 3 internal algorithm considering the balance between the monthly maximum minimum temperature precipitation snowmelt and sublimation the extreme and moderate climate scenarios were selected using the maximum and minimum changes in the wi 5 c base c y 1 precipitation mm y 1 and m a x w e s mm y

temperature rise and precipitation decrease and rcp8 5 gfdl cm3 maximum temperature rise and maximum m a x w e s decrease were selected table 4 and supplementary material figs s6 4 s6 7 finally we prepared five future climate scenarios for forest recovery simulation including the aforementioned four future climate scenarios and one in which the 30 year mean climate continued 2 4 2 post windthrow management in this study we assumed that all overstory trees were collapsed in the site damaged by the three typhoons in 2016 three post management cases were designed for each forest type i e natural and plantation forests based on the treatment of damaged trees the reforestation strategy and the survival rates of dwarf bamboo and tree seedlings in the control cl case all fallen trees were left on the forest floor in natural and plantation forests and the agb of dwarf bamboo and advanced seedlings the cohorts that survived the wind damage was assumed to be reduced by 10 due to being trapped under fallen trees in the cases of salvage logging sl1 and sl2 the fallen trees were removed from the forest stand in the plantation forests in the two salvage logging sl cases the cohorts of all species on the forest floor were completely removed to represent soil scarification removal of surface soil and remaining roots by heavy machinery for the following plantation in sl1 the same tree species as the trees collapsed by typhoons were planted whereas in sl2 c japonica which is distributed in warmer regions was planted in the two sl cases weeding of dwarf bamboo and clean cutting of non plantation species were performed 1 5 10 20 and 30 years after the typhoon referring to the standard local forestry practice hokkaido 2019 in natural forests in the two sl cases natural regeneration was promoted by removing fallen trees with heavy machinery without scarifying the ground after fallen trees were removed therefore in these forests 60 of the dwarf bamboo and advanced seedling biomass was assumed to be reduced according to a previous study ohsato et al 1996 the agb reduction of dwarf bamboo and seedlings the tree planting and clean cutting was conducted by the biomass harvest extension v 4 4 gustafson et al 2000 2 5 simulation settings and evaluation 2 5 1 single grid cell simulation as sensitivity analysis using the calibrated landis ii we performed a sensitivity analysis of the effect of the initial dwarf bamboo biomass u n d e r s t o r y a d j u s t and advanced tree seedling biomass on forest recovery it has been suggested that recovery is difficult when the herbaceous agb exceeds 400 g m 2 thrippleton et al 2018b therefore we used 0 100 200 300 400 500 1 500 3 000 and 4 500 g m 2 for both the dwarf bamboo and seedling biomass the u n d e r s t o r y a d j u s t parameter was tested from 0 5 to 1 5 in increments of 0 5 the climate data of the lowland ecoregion for all five climate change scenarios were used a total of 86 years of simulations until 2100 were repeated 10 times for each scenario we evaluated changes in the agb and the recovery time required for the agb of the tree cohort to exceed that of the dwarf bamboo we defined that a site had recovered to a forest when the agb of overstory species exceeded that of understory species we also defined recovery time as the time from 2016 to the site was recovered to the forest 2 5 2 landscape simulation landscape scale vegetation succession in the entire study area 139 km2 including 1 753 damaged sites was simulated from 2014 to 2100 the time step for the agb growth and material cycle was 1 month whereas that for species recruitment and the additional mortality of dwarf bamboo was 1 year the additional mortality of dwarf bamboo due to climate change and post windthrow management was calculated using biomass harvest extension v 4 4 the agb was output every 2 years by output biomass v 3 0 and biomass by age output v 3 0 due to the limitation of computational resources in this study area previous field studies suggested that the natural regeneration of larix kaempheri would not be successful due to disease and rat damage nakagawa 2014 thus natural regeneration of the species was not considered forest regeneration after windthrow damage was evaluated by the agb in 2051 and 2099 and by changes in the dominant species by 2099 we treated 2051 as a mid term endpoint that evaluates how trees recover before the next typhoon may hit the study area the long term impacts on agb and species composition were evaluated by 2099 the analysis was performed using r v4 1 1 r core team 2021 the disturbance and establishment of species cohorts are key stochastic processes in necn v6 3 in this study locations of wind disturbed grid cells were deterministically decided because this study focused on the tree recovery of the wind damaged grid cells in 2016 post windthrow management and the additional mortality of dwarf bamboo were also deterministically simulated moreover the single grid cell simulation indicated that the uncertainty in agb growth and forest recovery after wind disturbance due to the stochastic establishment process was smaller than the differences between climate scenarios forest management scenarios and initial vegetation conditions fig 3 and table 5 thus this study calculated only five repetitions for each combination of climate change scenario and post wind management case due to limited computational resources the dominant species were also compared between the five repetitions at the grid cell level if less than 50 of the repetitions agreed on the dominant species the grid cell was labeled as an uncertain grid cell input files and analysis scripts are available at https github com hagachi project landis understory 3 results 3 1 single grid cell simulation 3 1 1 sensitivity analysis of understory species suppression fig 3 presents the agb recovery after wind disturbance in a single grid cell using the calibrated tree species and dwarf bamboo under the different climate change scenarios where the u n d e r s t o r y a d j u s t parameter was set to 1 b ermanii and quercus crispula which are more shade intolerant than other species dominated when the calculation was started from bare land under the current climate scenario fig 3 row 1 in contrast when the calculation started from the dwarf bamboo dominant condition the site could not be restored to forest until 2100 fig 3 row 1 the agb of dwarf bamboo reached approximately 6 kg m 2 after 20 years these results are in good agreement with other field studies in japan aoyama et al 2011 masaki et al 2021 thus we set the u n d e r s t o r y a d j u s t parameter to 1 in the following simulation climate change altered the future dominant species when the calculation was started from bare land in the four climate change scenarios the agb of b ermanii in 2100 was lower by 24 50 than that in the current climate scenario due to the failure to establish in warmer climates fig 3 column 1 and supplementary material fig s7 2 column 1 this decline allowed q crispula which is distributed in warmer regions table 3 to become the dominant species in the rcp2 6 miroc5 and rcp8 5 gfdl scenarios and the agb of the species was 69 149 higher than that in the current climate scenario fig 3 rows 2 5 when the calculation was initialized with dwarf bamboo shade tolerant species such as a sachalinensis and f crenata dominated in the four climate change scenarios as dwarf bamboo declined due to the decrease in m a x w e s after 2050 broadleaf forests dominated by f crenata which are distributed in warmer regions than a sachalinensis table 3 were established fig 3 rows 2 5 the results also indicate that the impact of climate change and the presence absence of dwarf bamboo on tree species biomass and dominant species was larger than the uncertainty of the stochastic establishment calculation of necn v6 3 3 1 2 sensitivity analysis of the effect of the initial forest stand and climate change on forest recovery time table 5 presents the recovery time in which the agb of the tree species exceeded that of dwarf bamboo after the windthrow in 2015 for each initial agb of a sachalinensis and dwarf bamboo in the case where the agb of advanced tree seedlings of a sachalinensis was smaller than that of dwarf bamboo the forest did not recover for 84 years duration of the simulation in the current climate scenario in the four climate change scenarios the disturbed site was restored to forest regardless of the initial conditions however there were large variations in recovery time in the site where seedlings had a larger agb than dwarf bamboo the recovery time for the rcp 8 5 hadgem2 gfdl csiro scenarios was 28 38 years whereas that for the rcp2 6 miroc5 scenario was an average of 59 years table 5 in contrast in the rcp8 5 hadgem2 gfdl csiro scenarios the site was restored to forest in approximately 10 years when the agb of dwarf bamboo was less than or equal to that of advanced tree seedlings when the agb of the seedlings was less than 500 g m 2 the rcp2 6 miroc5 scenario required approximately 50 years for the site to be restored to forest regardless of the initial conditions supplementary material fig s7 3 in the current climate scenario forest recovery was possible only if the agb of advanced tree seedlings was sufficiently larger than that of dwarf bamboo supplementary material fig s7 3 3 2 landscape simulation 3 2 1 agb in forest recovery agb recovery in the 1 753 damaged grid cells differed significantly as a result of different post windthrow management strategies and climate change fig 4 the standard deviation of the mean agb of 1 753 grid cells in 2051 between five repetitions were small ranging from 0 01 to 0 13 kg m 2 supplementary material fig s8 in the cl case agb recovery by 2050 was strongly influenced by future climate scenarios the rcp8 5 gfdl cm3 and rcp8 5 hadgem scenarios led to the maximum forest recovery in both natural and plantation forests fig 4 column 1 which is because the agb of dwarf bamboo decreased as the m a x w e s depth decreased supplementary material fig s6 7 in contrast in the cl case both the current and rcp2 6 miroc5 climate scenarios could not achieve forest recovery in natural forests by 2051 in the current climate scenario the abundance of dwarf bamboo was not disturbed by the unchanged m a x w e s in the rcp2 6 miroc5 scenario the decrease in m a x w e s was small in both frequency and intensity due to small changes in temperature and precipitation thus the seedlings in rcp2 6 miroc5 continued to be shaded by dwarf bamboo until 2051 fig 4 upper left panel in the the cl case only 10 of dwarf bamboo was reduced by being trapped by fallen trees as a result the agb of the plantation forest in the cl case was larger by 3 10 kg m 2 than that of the natural forest in 2050 reflecting the difference in advanced seedlings fig 4 column 1 agb recovery in the two sl cases differed according to whether trees were planted and the type of trees planted fig 4 columns 2 3 in natural forests in the sl1 and sl2 cases agb recovery was almost identical to that in natural forests in the cl case because only 60 of dwarf bamboo was removed in plantation forests in the sl1 and sl2 cases dwarf bamboo was completely removed by scarification in order to plant trees and weed after planting thus the plantation forests in the sl1 case recovered the agb to the same level as in 2015 fig 4 bottom middle panel in the plantation forests in the sl1 case where the same tree species as before the wind disturbance were planted the current climate scenario resulted in the highest agb recovery by 2050 fig 4 bottom middle panel when climate adapted tree species were planted in plantation forests in the sl2 case the agb recovery was greater than that in the sl1 case fig 4 bottom right panel agb recovery in natural forests depended on the additional mortality of dwarf bamboo due to climate change and the abundance of dwarf bamboo and advanced seedlings before the typhoon disturbances fig 5 a in natural forests in the cl case the rcp 8 5 gfdl hadgem2 scenarios which exhibited a large decrease in m a x w e s successfully recovered the agb to the same level as the natural forest before the wind disturbance regardless of the initial understory conditions whereas the current and rcp2 6 miroc5 scenarios could not recover the agb in most conditions fig 5a however for all climate change scenarios the agb of trees in 2050 was recovered to the same level as in the natural forests before the wind disturbance only when the initial agb of dwarf bamboo was less than 2 kg m 2 and the initial agb of advanced tree seedlings was 1 2 kg m 2 fig 5a top left panel in the natural forests in the two sl cases 60 of dwarf bamboo and tree seedlings was disturbed by removing fallen trees however recovery was at the same level as in the cl case by 2051 fig 5a top right panel in the plantation forest in the cl case the agb was recovered regardless of the climate change scenario when the initial dwarf bamboo was less than advanced seedlings and enough advanced seedlings were present as in natural forests fig 5b column 1 in the plantation forests in the sl1 and sl2 cases the agb was recovered regardless of the climate change scenario the sl2 case recovered more agb than the sl1 case particularly for the three rcp8 5 scenarios because sl2 involved planting c japonica which is distributed in warmer regions fig 5b columns 2 3 however the agb recovery in the sl1 and sl2 cases in the three rcp8 5 scenarios was less than in the cl case when the advanced seedlings exceeded 1 kg dry weight m 2 fig 5b 3 2 2 dominant species in forest recovery the dominant vegetation in the 2050s and 2100s was uncertain due to future climate scenarios fig 6 the five repetitions were in agreement about the dominant species in almost all the damaged grid cells in 2099 and only less than 4 were not in agreement fig 6 gray and black colors and supplementary material s11 in the cl case 97 of the damaged grid cells were dominated by dwarf bamboo in 2021 five years after the typhoon regardless of the climate scenario on the other hand tree species dominated only 3 of the grid cells in 2021 due to the growth of advanced seedlings in the current climate scenario only 45 of the grid cells were restored to forest even in 2099 supplementary material table s11 1 a sachalinensis and b ermanii dominated the damaged grid cells with less dwarf bamboo and sufficient advanced seedlings after wind damage in the rcp2 6 miroc5 scenario m a x w e s started decreasing after the 2050s thus 52 and 94 of the damaged grid cells recovered to forest by 2051 and 2099 respectively future climate scenarios with rising temperatures reduced the establishment probability of all species except for c japonica in all ecoregions supplementary material figs s9 1 s9 3 thus in the three rcp8 5 scenarios the dominant species and level of agb recovery differed from the current and rcp2 6 miroc5 scenarios in the rcp8 5 csiro gfdl scenarios m a x w e s started decreasing in the same pattern and almost all the damaged grid cells recovered to forest by 2051 however the dominant species differed between the csiro and gfdl models due to the extent of temperature increase the dominant species in csiro in 2099 was a sachalinensis whereas that in gfdl was f crenata which is adapted to warmer environments table 3 in the rcp8 5 hadgem2 scenario where m a x w e s started decreasing after the 2020s shade intolerant tree species such as b ermanii and c japonica dominated the damaged grid cells due to seed dispersal from surrounding forests and the growth of advanced seedlings even in 2021 by 2100 f crenata forests increased as in the gfdl in the two sl cases the removal of damaged trees and plantation resulted in different dominant species from those in the cl case fig 6 columns 2 3 by the 2050s a sachalinensis and c japonica dominated 47 of the damaged grid cells in the sl1 and sl2 cases respectively due to reforestation after removing damaged trees in plantation forests subsequently in the rcp8 5 gfdl scenario where the temperature increase by the 2100s was the largest the dominant species transitioned from a sachalinensis to f crenata in the sl1 case there were few transitions from c japonica to other species in the sl2 case in natural forests in the current climate scenario dwarf bamboo was the dominant species by 2100 regardless of the management scenario fig 6 row 1 in the four rcp scenarios in the sl1 and sl2 cases the 60 reduction in dwarf bamboo and advanced tree seedlings during the removal of damaged trees resulted in different dominant species from those in the cl case fig 6 columns 2 and 3 and supplementary material table s11 in the natural forest in the cl case the dominant species in the four rcp scenarios were mainly pioneer species b ermanii and f crenata which are also currently distributed in warmer areas in contrast in the natural forest in the sl1 and sl2 cases the proportion of grid cells dominated by b ermanii decreased and the proportion of f crenata increased supplementary material table s11 4 discussion this study incorporated the understory vegetation layer in landis ii to simulate the vegetation recovery process of different reforestation methods after stand replacing wind disturbances under climate change our proposed modification is simple and applicable to the other process based landscape models in the following we discuss the utility of introducing understory vegetation in flms potential interactions with other ecological processes implications for reforestation under climate change and the limiting factors for future model improvement 4 1 understory species modeling in the flm the impact of shading by understory herbaceous layers on tree regeneration has been modeled in previous studies thrippleton et al 2016 2018a brock et al 2020 the present study also incorporated competition between understory vegetation and tree layers using the agb and lai computed by landis ii necn v6 3 in addition to this modification we also demonstrated the impact of changes in snow depth due to climate change on understory species i e dwarf bamboo survival which alters the future regeneration dynamics of overstory tree species landuyt et al 2019 2018 the reduction in snow depth and the additional mortality of understory plants were loosely coupled in this study our algorithm is scalable for models that compute i the lai internally ii the establishment and biomass growth of a plant cohort as a function of lai and iii the impact of climate change on the lai of understory species thus more mechanistic models applying our algorithm can reveal interactions between climate change understory layers and overstory layers in the case without soil scarification cl the damaged grid cells were dominated by dwarf bamboo and had difficulty recovering the same agb level as prior to the wind disturbance for several decades at landscape scales as also reported in previous studies aoyama et al 2011 masaki et al 2021 as reported by thrippleton et al 2018 400 g biomass m 2 of the herb layer was the threshold for the recovery of tree species however in the current climate scenario in this study the recovery of tree species was affected by the amount of not only the herb layer but also the advanced seedlings table 5 and supplementary material fig s7 4 recovery of tree species was accelerated as dwarf bamboo abundance decreased with climate change table 5 similar results were obtained at the landscape scale fig 5 our results suggest that the success of forest recovery differs greatly due to changes in the survival of understory vegetation the degree of competition between understory vegetation and tree species also depends on the types of understory species aoyama et al 2011 in the modified necn v6 3 competition is controlled by the lai growth rates and the u n d e r s t o r y a d j u s t parameter that adjusts the competitive relationship between understory vegetation and tree species our sensitivity analysis demonstrated that u n d e r s t o r y a d j u s t had a large impact on the recovery time supplementary material table s7 an u n d e r s t o r y a d j u s t value smaller than the default 1 0 resulted in a reduced recovery time this study assumed that u n d e r s t o r y a d j u s t is a common parameter for all understory species however this parameter should be set separately for each species reflecting the individual functional traits in future studies that simulate multiple understory herb species 4 2 key drivers reducing the establishment of tree species under climate change climate change increased the uncertainty of the dominant species that could be established in damaged grid cells a major influence on the establishment probability of tree species was the increase in temperature which differed between climate change scenarios supplementary material s9 in the rcp8 5 scenarios with high temperature increases the establishment probability of species that initially existed in the region such as a sachalinensis and b ermanii decreased reaching almost zero near 2100 the establishment probability of f crenata also decreased but remained high 0 75 until approximately 2050 even in the rcp8 5 scenario in contrast the establishment probability of c japonica exhibited an increasing trend studies using species distribution models have also predicted that the potential vegetation of various species will change with climate change in japan tanaka et al 2012 nakao et al 2013 previous forest landscape modeling studies revealed the impact of temperature and precipitation change and disturbance on tree species regeneration lucash et al 2019 2018 2017 our study supports these studies and emphasizes that the suppression of germination and seedling growth by understory vegetation reduces the opportunity to establish various tree species and is an essential driver of long term forest dynamics under climate change while sl and plantation recovered agb regardless of the initial condition and climate scenario sl alone could not recover the agb by 2050 due to the insufficient reduction of dwarf bamboo figs 4 and 5b our results suggest that forest recovery is possible without sl when the amount of advanced seedlings exceeds that of dwarf bamboo damaged trees in plantation forests are often salvage logged and sold to compensate for the economic losses in addition removing fallen trees from damaged grid cells reduces the risk of a mass attack by bark beetles in surrounding forests which may cause further forest degradation dobor et al 2020 however ecological legacies including fallen trees may contribute to forest regeneration preventing fungal damage of seedlings and improving the light environment harmon and franklin 1989 nakagawa et al 2001 takahashi et al 2000 weaver et al 2009 fallen trees have also been reported to prevent ungulate browsing in the damaged grid cells and to promote forest recovery morimoto et al 2021b in japan the distribution of deer is expanding and deer browsing is a major concern kaji et al 2000 takatsuki 2009 as a result it is critical to understand the interaction between the treatment of fallen trees other disturbance events and regeneration however further modeling studies are required hotta et al 2021 de jager et al 2017 siedl and rammer 2017 4 3 exploring post windthrow management with robust tree recovery regardless of climate change in terms of agb recovery of the plantation forest sl and plantation led to robust recovery by 2050 in this study in both the sl1 and sl2 cases the agb recovered by 2050 regardless of the climate scenario fig 4 and supplementary material fig s10 planting climate change adapted tree species promoted higher agb recovery than planting current species in large temperature increase scenarios at the landscape scale leaving fallen trees at the damaged site led to higher agb recovery than sl and plantation however the dominant species around 2100 depended on the temperature response of each species in the natural forest the presence of advanced seedlings reduced the uncertainty of agb recovery between different climate scenarios by 2050 in both the cl and two sl cases fig 5 however there was high uncertainty about the dominant species for different climate change scenarios and different approaches for treating fallen trees fig 6 therefore robust forest regeneration using ecological legacies as described in section 4 2 after wind damage requires the effective detection of damaged sites and the screening of suitable sites by referring to both understory species and seedlings this study did not consider the mass attack of bark beetles and the expansion of the deer population under climate change thus our results should be interpreted with caution fallen trees on the forest floor prevent deer browsing but may increase the risk of mass attacks by bark beetles on the surrounding forest climate change will also cause the regime shift of these disturbances ohashi et al 2016 cudmore et al 2010 thus leaving fallen trees will be effective in forests where the deer population density is high and there are no artificial forests nearby to avoid the risk of disease and pests 4 4 limitations of our model modification in this study we did not perform detailed modeling of the plant physiological phenomena based on the mortality of the understory vegetation the timing of the flowering and death of dwarf bamboo species can only be roughly estimated from past flowering behavior through a review of the literature and interviews with experts stochastic modeling of the simultaneous death of dwarf bamboo is a key future task moreover landis ii assumes that the amount of woody tissue affects competitive relationships this study modeled sasa species which have large agb and culms and the applicability of our results to other types of understory species must be carefully verified this study used agb and lai as a proxy for the light competition between understory and seedlings because necn v6 3 does not directly calculate a light environment moreover the effect of seedling suppression by understory was implemented as a step function to simplify the algorithm i e seedlings were suddenly released from the suppression at a threshold the further application of our algorithm into mechanistic models of light environment photosynthesis and tree height growth will enable the gradual release of suppression which is more realistic moreover the parameterization of the establishment probability table table 2 is another challenge in this study due to the data limitation in the ordinal landis ii studies users use the default table but it will affect long term species composition the current landis ii model is unable to accurately predict changes in snow depth however our sensitivity analysis indicated the importance of snow depth calculation since necn v6 3 computes the water equivalent of snowpack in monthly steps using a bucket model in this study dwarf bamboo was disturbed only when the snow was sufficiently reduced focusing only on relative changes in the current and future snow depth eq 2 to consider the impacts of snow depth change on the phenology and survival of tree seedlings and understory species the calculation of snow depth should also be improved the initial spatial distribution of understory vegetation is also difficult to predict therefore in this study dwarf bamboo was estimated based on the type and density of tree species and seedlings were estimated by pre simulation several studies based on unmanned aerial vehicles have estimated the distribution of understory species inoue et al 2019 lombaerde et al 2020 combining studies on dwarf bamboo and tree seedling estimation can help to understand the holistic relationships between over and understory species during climate change 5 conclusions in this study we introduced understory species into the landis ii necn v6 3 flm and simulated forest recovery after windthrow disturbances in northern japan to explore robust and sustainable post windthrow management strategies under different future climate change scenarios the results revealed that sl and plantation was able to recover the agb regardless of the climate change scenario leaving fallen trees on damaged grid cells as ecological legacies successfully recovered the agb regardless of the climate change scenario only if the grid cells had a larger agb of advanced seedlings of adequate types of species than dwarf bamboo however the dominant tree species in the recovered forest varied among different climate change scenarios these results can help designing a robust forest recovery even in uncertain future climate funding this research was funded by the environment research and
