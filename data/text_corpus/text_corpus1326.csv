6630,climate change coupled with the current trend in rapid urbanization is increasing the risk of flooding that can cause loss of life and damage to property adapting to climate change impacts and flood mitigation has become a life critical factor as well as a severe challenge green infrastructure and low impact development methods are common approaches that are increasingly used to address stormwater management in developed environments the analysis and results of this study show that amc ic does impact flood response even in urban developed catchments and that it can significantly impact flood responses during storm events we show that considering amc ics coupled with changes in seasonal rainfall patterns that are projected for warmer climates in the future can modulate some of the increases in flood risk due to climate change the prevailing thought is that antecedent moisture conditions amcs have little to no relevance in urban hydrology particularly in relation to climate change however current trends in use of stormwater management methods that depend on local storage and infiltration is increasingly making amc or initial conditions ic a factor in urban flooding despite this trend there is little available literature that discuss the aspect of amc ic that can have an implication on urban flood management here we move towards filling this gap in current literature related to impacts of amcs in flooding of developed areas by focusing on how possible changes in seasonal rainfall patterns in a warming climate might impact amc and starting conditions in stormwater best management practices swbmps and how those changed initial conditions impact flood risk in developed areas using a comprehensive hydrologic hydraulic model of an urban developed catchment and continuous simulation we demonstrate the importance of accurately accounting for initial conditions in flood assessments we consider average summer temperatures based on approximately 70 years of historic data to select warm and cold years we compare the model results between the warm and cold years as a proxy to look at trends related to a future warming climate keywords antecedent moisture conditions climate change urban flooding continuous simulation 1 introduction the current trend in population demographics and rapid urbanization is increasing the risk of flooding that can cause loss of life and damage to property the risks of urban flooding and related stresses are exacerbated by climatic changes that are projected to occur ashley et al 2005 miller and hutchins 2017 schreider et al 2000 willems et al 2012b zhou et al 2016 warming temperatures are projected to intensify storms in a future climate resulting in greater storm intensities fadhel et al 2018 lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 wasko and sharma 2015 current literature shows that increased rainfall and more peaked temporal patterns of storms as a result of climate change will increase flood risk in urban areas fadhel et al 2018 hettiarachchi et al 2018 kundzewicz et al 2014 wasko and sharma 2015 in addition to storms increasing in intensity climate change is also impacting the overall patterns of storm occurrences the seasonal distribution of storm events are projected to change due to warming temperatures with wet areas getting wetter and dry areas getting dryer marvel and bonfils 2013 walsh and lawler 1981 based on the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2014 report on climate extremes the projected trends are for a higher proportion of the annual rainfall to occur in heavier rainfall events with some areas experiencing intense storm events even though total rainfall is projected to decrease seneviratne et al 2012 changes in the distribution of rainfall events over a longer period such as the summer season can impact antecedent conditions within the watershed ivancic and shaw 2015 wasko et al 2015 woldemeskel and sharma 2016 currently literature investigating climate change impacts on urban flooding focus on single storm events of a particular return period scaling intensity duration frequency idf curves with temperature or downscaling global circulation models generated rainfall events arnbjerg nielsen et al 2013 fadhel et al 2018 guo and adams 1998 hettiarachchi et al 2018 huang et al 2016 lambourne and stephenson 1987 mamo 2015 nguyen et al 2010 sørup et al 2016 willems et al 2012a zhou et al 2016 while these studies show an increase in the threat of flooding in dense urban areas with high impervious surfaces due to climate change they do not account for changes in rainfall distribution over extended periods of time in short they do not consider changes in antecedent moisture conditions amc for urban environments if climatic change is expected to change not just rainfall intensities but the seasonal distribution of rainfall as well it is only appropriate to look at storm events over a whole season there is little doubt that antecedent moisture impacts hydrologic modelling of large scale catchments many studies have shown that amc is a key factor in accurately modelling and predicting flooding in natural catchments ivancic and shaw 2015 pathiraja et al 2012 sharma et al 2018 wasko and sharma 2017a woldemeskel and sharma 2016 in particular wasko and sharma 2017b discuss the differences between the increase in rainfall intensities and the overall decrease in stream flows in a warming climate they suggest that the lack of correspondence between precipitation and stream flow scaling can be explained by changing temperatures causing changes in soil moisture and such factors in effect the antecedent conditions related to losses from runoff rate and volume similarly there are studies that have evaluated the effectiveness of green infrastructure and low impact development methods in mitigating flooding impacts discussed in following section but as far as the authors are aware there are few if no studies that consider changes in amc due to climate change and the impact on urban flooding the lack of studies or urban catchments and initial conditions is understandable as the prevailing thought is that urban catchments consist of mostly impervious landuse types and are essentially impervious to variations in amc this is despite the increased use of green infrastructure as part of the tools that are used in adaptation to climate change impacts gill et al 2007 and as retrofits to deal with existing flooding problems in cities this green infrastructure approach leads to storage elements forming a larger part of urban stormwater management system as discussed in the following sections hence the initial conditions ics of these storage elements in smaller urban developed catchments essentially become the antecedent condition similar to soil moisture deficit levels in a large scale catchment therefore we postulate that the current trend in adaptation methods and stormwater management in urban areas can increase the effects of amc ic on urban flooding we speculate that if climate change results in changes to the distribution of rainfall events in a season the impact on amcs and ics can actually modulate flood risk during more frequent storms even though the more extreme storm events continue to result in severe flooding in hettiarachchi et al 2018 rainfall patterns during storm events adjusted to account for warming temperatures coupled with a detailed hydrologic and hydraulic model of a developed urban area showed that the intensification of rainfall due to climate change can increase urban flooding by as much as 35 in this paper we look at the seasonal distribution of rainfall over the summer period to determine the probability of flooding and how the frequency of flooding compares between warmer and colder summers we use the mean summer period temperature to determine warm and cold years and use continuous simulation with a detailed h h model to generate the resulting depth of water during rain events in a developed environment we compare the model results for the warm and cold summers as proxy to discuss the impacts of a warming climate 2 urban stormwater management trends and relevance of antecedent moisture conditions the world s urban population is expected to grow by 2 3 billion to 6 3 billion people by 2050 united nations 2011 this growth adds severe strains on urban cities for liveable space and infrastructure zhou 2014 as cities expand and impervious land cover increases even less severe more frequent storms can result in dangerous flood conditions the added connectivity of surface runoff and storm sewer systems resulting from expanding urban areas also serves to compound this effect miller and hutchins 2017 rainfall events that might have resulted in minor or nuisance flooding can become major flooding causing significant disruptions danger to public safety and adding to the already significant economic impacts doocy et al 2013 moftakhari et al 2017 adapting to climate change impacts and flood mitigation collectively referred as management of surface runoff in urban developed environments has become a life critical factor as well as a severe challenge urbanization can also impact catchment response to storms with increase in flow rates and decreasing water quality galster et al 2006 hollis 1975 nelson et al 2006 these changes in flow rates and water quality tends to have a deleterious effect on the receiving water bodies such as stream rivers and lakes barbosa et al 2012 degradation of water quality in surface water bodies leads to water contact and supply concerns that can also threaten human health gaffield et al 2003 sidhu et al 2012 to curb such adverse downstream impacts due to changes or increases in impervious land area stormwater management rules have been brought about by governmental and regulatory units such as city governments catchment management organizations and basin management authorities to that end green infrastructure low impact development lid methods water sensitive urban design wsud or stormwater best management practices sw bmps are common terms that are used to reference technologies and approaches that are increasingly used to address stormwater management in developed environments bertilsson et al hancock et al 2010 kuller et al 2017 locatelli et al 2017 mcgrane 2016 the authors will use sw bmps to reference all constructed stormwater management features for the remainder of this manuscript some of the more common methods used to meet these requirements and mitigate flow rates and volumes include the use of detention retention ponds along with infiltration methods such as rainwater gardens infiltration swales green roofs and subsurface storage pyke et al 2011 of these methods retention detention ponds are more widely used especially in the usa due to design and construction simplicity and relative effectiveness hancock et al 2010 semadeni davies et al 2008 the current trend is to integrate these stormwater management features into the overall layout of the development plans fryd et al 2010 geldof and stahre 2005 as presented in fig 1 housing developments most often use the stormwater management pond as a local amenity or as an avenue to provide for a natural ecosystem such as wetlands fig 1 the functionality of these sw bmps is dependent either on storing or infiltrating surface runoff generated during a storm event the addition of such sw bmps makes amcs relevant to the urban environment when looking at modelling these catchments along with the intensity the temporal distribution of precipitation during a storm event can have a significant impact on the effectiveness these sw bmps hettiarachchi et al 2018 amcs will dictate how saturated or dry the soils are in infiltration based methods and will also determine the variation of water levels in detention ponds the level of water in these ponds will determine the volume of storage available to mitigate excess runoff during a storm this is why contrary to the prevailing thought modern day urban stormwater systems are not completely impervious to amcs even though there are minimal to no natural streams or channels in majority of stormwater conveyance system in urban or development environments these constructed sw bmps makes knowing the water levels prior to a storm event relevant to urban flooding and as a result any changes to amcs with climate change need to be considered in future urban flooding assessments 3 catchment model and data the hydraulic component of modelling urban stormwater systems tends to be more important relative to large catchments and riverine systems where the hydrology dominates hence urban stormwater models require a higher level of detail to generate reliable and accurate flood results schmitt et al 2004 schreider et al 2000 the depth of flooding rather than the flow rate becomes a key result in the context of urban flooding due to the complex hydraulic interactions with the built environment which cannot be adequately captured in rainfall runoff models for these reasons the storm water model management swmm modelling package by the united states environmental protection agency is used here among the various methods available in the hydrologic hydraulic h h modelling space ranging from the simple rationale method hromadka 1989 to the very complex use or neural networks wu and chau 2011 the swmm engine is widely used bisht et al 2016 and forms the backbone of most of the dynamic h h modelling packages used in the water resources industry the h h model used here is based on a complex urban catchment in minnesota usa this model was developed for the south washington watershed district swwd in the state of minnesota usa to manage surface water flows as well as for planning and management of on going development work and capital improvement projects the catchment area of the swwd is a highly developed urban suburban area and extends over 65 m2 165 km2 the model was initially built in the year 2000 and has been continuously maintained and updated with the latest available landuse land cover and stormwater infrastructure information the model includes extensive detail of all landuse types and stormwater infrastructures including sewers culvert crossing open channel reaches and constructed and natural storages highly detailed delineation of both sub catchment boundaries and impervious area was done using a high resolution digital elevation model dem development construction and grading plan overlays and aerial imagery within a geographic information system gis environment all surface runoff is fed into the appropriate inflow points of the hydraulic conveyance system the model has been validated and used to design major capital improvement and flood mitigation projects hettiarachchi et al 2012 the supplemental information associated with this paper includes detailed information on the model the model includes geometry details to explicitly model the street overflow routes where flooding occurs as well as depth area curves that capture flooding at the storage nodes the detailed geometry included in the model provides an accurate representation of flood extents for the purposes of this study and to reduce the complexity and model run times the model was trimmed to the upper section of the swwd representing an area of approximately 8 5 square miles fig 2 it should be noted that the section of the model selected includes the most developed part of the overall watershed with a mix of high to low density residential commercial and industrial type landuses therefore this model can be assumed to represent a typical developed watershed and the results to reflect responses of typical stormwater systems in typical developed areas precipitation and temperature data used in the analysis were sourced from the national centers for environmental information hosted by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa both hourly and daily rainfall data were obtained from the climate data online site for minneapolis and st paul msp international airport gauge which is the closest major airport to the study area daily data for the msp airport was available from 1901 through 2014 while hourly data was available from 1948 through 2014 though daily data is available through noaa for more recent years the modelling period was limited to 2014 due to the hourly dataset that ends that year daily maximum minimum and average temperature data was also obtained for the period from 1901 through 2014 for this analysis days that did not have precipitation data were assumed to have no rain the average monthly evaporation data for the same period as the temperature data was taken from the minnesota department of natural resources mndnr climate data available at https www dnr state mn us climate wxsta pan evaporation html the daily average evaporation for each month during the summer period was added to the model based on the data available through the mndnr and was unchanged for all model runs therefore modelled results that are discussed are primarily dependent on changes in precipitation patterns 4 methodology the workflow as described below follows three main phases the overall approach is summarized in table 1 step 1 is the model setup so that it can accurately model extended periods in continuous simulation mode which was followed by selecting the warm and cold years from the available historical data for this paper we extract the modelled water levels at markgraf and wilmes lake fig 2 markgraf is a local waterbody that drains a predominantly industrial watershed and used as a second reference location to present results wilmes lake is a local minor lake along the main thalweg and the outlet point for this catchment as is the primary reference point for the model results availability of surveyed bathymetric data at these locations make them more suitable than most of the other open water bodies modelled especially when water levels draw below the normal water level 4 1 model setup and verification as the model used in this analysis has been continuously updated verified and extensively used for design of large scale capital stormwater projects for over 15 years the model verification process for this paper was limited to comparing the model performance when run continuously for the summer months johnson and stefan 2006 discuss the variation of ice out months in the minnesota lakes as it relates to the warming climate which indicates that the ice out dates have occurred earlier in the recent past their research shows that typical ice out for the southern part of the state is march april hence the model start month was set for may to ensure that the water levels in open water bodies stabilize after the snow melt period and the starting water levels were set as the normal water level nwl or equal to the primary outlet elevation at all open water bodies this would also ensure that any flooding caused by spring runoff would not be included in the results the model end date was set at september to avoid the pre winter drawdown which occurs in october where the lake level is artificially lowered to allow additional storage for possible excess snowmelt in the following spring by modelling for the entire summer seasons the h h model essentially run as a continuous simulation cs this is not typically the case in h h model analysis which are used for event based modelling but studies exist that discuss and compare event based modelling with continues simulation for flood predictions in particular stephens et al 2018 compares how event based modelling compares with continuous simulation based modelling in the context of impacts of climate change on flooding with both methods found to be appropriate avellaneda et al 2017 uses epa swmm which is the modelling package used in this manuscript to look at cumulative performance of green infrastructure through long term simulation of these methods which again supports the use of epa swmm as an appropriate tool for this study as per the swmm manual epa 2016 the soil infiltration parameters were set at the driest level for the soil type which essentially sets the maximum infiltration rate for a soil type at the start of the simulation typically in event simulation soil moisture parameters are set to an appropriate value for each soil type but in cs the model continuously accounts for soil moisture and recharge of infiltration capacity during the simulation period which then correctly accounts for amcs during a precipitation event as discussed before average monthly evaporation available from the state of minnesota department of natural resources were used to update the model evaporation for this study the evaporation rates were set as daily values averaged for each month to verify that the model setup was adequate to run continuously the model was run for 3 summer periods that reflect wet average and dry years based on total summer rain as shown in fig 3 results for these three verification years match reasonably well when compared to the available gauge lake elevations confirming that the model can be applied for continuous simulation in this catchment 4 2 selection of modelled years daily temperatures for the summer months from 1948 through to 2013 were used to calculate the average temperature for the summer for each year to match the availability of hourly rainfall data used in the modelling process the years were ranked from the highest summer temperature to the lowest summer temperature from which the ten warmest years were picked from the ten top ranked years and the ten coldest years were picked as the lowest ranked ten years the selected warm and cold years are presented in table 2 along with the average summer temperature for each year it is interesting to note that the difference between the average of the warmest and coldest year temperatures is approximately 3 deg c which corresponds to the predicted global temperature increase in the ipcc report on long term climate change projections by the year 2100 collins et al 2013 these ten warm and ten cold selected years form the basis for the modelling analysis that follows which also helps to keep the level of modelling effort within reason selection of the summer period was intended to avoid periods of snowfall and focus the modelling analysis on flooding due to summer storms mass curves of daily rainfall for the summer period were generated for each of the 20 selected years using data extending back to 1948 is purely to represent rainfall patterns that have occurred along with the associated with the temperatures of each year 4 3 modelling and analysis for each of the 20 selected years the model was run from the 1st of may through the 30th of september with hourly rainfall spanning the modelled months distributed evenly over the watershed after which the water level output from the model at wilmes lake and markgraf were extracted for further analysis the local maxima were identified from the continuous depth data generated from the model also a set of local minima was extracted by setting a threshold equal to the elevation of the primary outlet that would then represent the occurrence of a minimum elevation in lake level at or below the hydraulic outlet elevation at wilmes lake the distinction of minima below the outlet elevation of the lake is that this would represent low water surface elevations that occurred due to environmental forcing rather than hydraulic draw down of water level through outflow from the outlet probability density functions pdfs and empirical cumulative distribution functions cdfs were calculated for the two sets of maxima points for the warm and cold years similarly cdfs were developed for the peak rainfall intensities for the warm years and cold years along with cdfs for the minima below the outlet threshold 5 results and discussion here we present the results addressing the question of how climate change might affect amc ics in urban catchments and thereby impact catchment response and flooding even though we are using historic data table 2 shows close to a 3 deg c increase in the average summer temperature between the 10 coldest and 10 warmest years which is similar to projected temperature increases collins et al 2013 seneviratne et al 2012 trenberth 2011 hence we suggest that it is reasonable to use the results as a proxy to evaluate impacts of climate change on amc ics and urban flooding in addition the majority of the warm years appear to occur after the turn of the century while most of the colder years are in the 1960s again suggesting that we are comparing the past colder conditions with possible future warmer conditions fig 4 shows the mass curves separated for the 10 cold years and 10 warm years there is a clear difference in the rainfall pattern throughout the summer between the cold years and the warm years the variability is much greater for those years that classed as warm versus those that classed as cold however the average cumulative rainfall amounts which are shown in thicker lines are similar this suggests that although overall seasonal rainfall amounts are the same the pattern or intensities of individual rainfall events differs which is consistent with current available literature that projects rainfall patterns to change towards fewer but larger more intense storms in a future warming climate collins et al 2013 walsh et al 2014 it is important to note that these rainfall patterns and temperature differences are based on historic data and not from weather generation of projected data using global circulation models of future climate change following are the results presented in probability density function pdf and empirical cumulative distribution function cdfs curves which allows us to look at changes across severity and magnitude fig 5 a shows the pdf and fig 5 b cdfs for the peak rainfall intensities that occurred during the set of 10 warmer years and 10 colder years the pdf cdfs for the warm and cold rainfall peak intensities show that the probability of more intense rainfall is higher during warm years which is as expected and well documented in literature alexander et al 2006 hettiarachchi et al 2018 lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 wasko and sharma 2015 though the mean intensities between warmer and colder years are not very different the warmer years show a positive skew with more events exceeding a 2in hr intensity fig 5 a shows that the rainfall in colder years occurs more frequently in events less than 1 inch hour fig 5 b shows that there is a higher probability of rainfall intensities above the 20th percentile in the warmer years fig 5 a and b confirm the qualitative assessment of fig 4 that the rainfall occurs in fewer more intense events in the warmer years the distribution of peak flood depths as a result of the modelling analysis is presented in fig 6 fig 6a compares the pdf of the peak depths or the local maxima at wilmes lake between the 10 warmest and 10 coldest years while fig 6 b shows the cdfs of the same peak flood depths similarly fig 7 shows the cdf for peak depths at markgraf comparing figs 5 a and 6 a there is a higher chance of a larger peak depth occurring in colder years if for the sake of comparison we consider a flood depth of 8 ft for wilmes lake which is close to 2 ft above the normal water level there is a higher frequency of flooding occurring in colder years than in warmer years similar to fig 6 b which shows that the probability of flooding particularly at or below the 80th percentile is higher in the colder years fig 7 also shows a similar distribution at markgraf where the warmer years are in the lower side of peak depths to approximately the 80th percentile even though the difference between warmer colder flood peaks is smaller at markgraf due to the smaller watershed area draining to this storage area only 0 4 m2 this confirms the pattern of peak depth distribution at wilmes lake overall these distributions suggest that there is a higher probability of flooding in colder years we note that the higher percentile rainfall intensities and peak depth do match in figs 5 b 6 b and 7 which shows that the extremely intense storms which have a higher occurrence in warmer years are most likely producing the highest peak depths these results essentially means there is a reversal between the distributions of peak rainfall intensities and resulting peak flood depths this flip between rainfall intensity and peak flood depths is clearer in the cdf plots in figs 5 b and 6 b this is an unexpected result as the conventional wisdom is that a higher frequency in intense storms is normally expected to generate a higher frequency of flood depths particularly in developed urban areas the p value for a kolgmorov smirov test which is a non parametric test for the difference between two samples for a difference in the peak depths cdfs at wilmes lake is 0 041 the p value suggests that the difference is statistically significant and not purely observed by chance we also note that these results are based on historic data for the past 75 years the rainfall patterns and temperatures used for this study are not based on any projections to the future using weather generators or global circulation models as discussed in the methodology we used a simple approach of selecting the warmest and coldest years based on average temperature during the summer months from 1948 using the warm cold year difference as a proxy for a future climate hence the results present an indication on how rainfall patterns and the resulting potential for flooding can vary with temperatures as well as aiding our understanding of possible changes in warming climate to understand the flip in the cdf between the intensity of rainfall and the flood peaks presented in figs 5b and 6b distributions of the water level minima are presented in fig 8 similar to the maxima fig 8 a shows the pdf and 8 b shows the cdf of the minima below the outlet threshold fig 8 a shows that the water level decreased below the outlet level more often in the warmer years especially between 5 5 and 6 ft fig 8 b shows that there is a much higher probability of lower water elevations for the warmer years compared to the colder years this result shows that draw down of the lake due to environmental forcing occurred more often in the warmer years hence there is a higher probability of water level being lower prior to a storm event during warmer years the lower water levels means there is more available storage volume at wilmes lake therefore the available storage to absorb the increased runoff during storms tends to modulate the impact of the higher intensity storms during warmer years when the water level is higher than the outlet level the rate of outflow or the drawdown of the water level after a storm is predominantly governed by hydraulic factors once the water level decreases to match the lowest outlet level from a storage pond or lake there is no more flow through the outlet and any further decrease in water level is due to environmental factors such as evaporation hence the results presented in fig 8 demonstrate that pattern of stronger but less frequent rainfall events during the summers of the warmer years allows evaporation from the lake to draw down the water level below the outlet level more often compared to the colder years the absolute values of flood depths difference between the warmer and colder years might not translate to an appreciable difference in flood impacts and damages in this catchment depending on the frequency return period of the event considered nevertheless the trend in the results is of great interest the results presented here follow a similar pattern to those presented in wasko and sharma 2017b where for natural catchments the change in stream flow did not generally correspond with the increase in rainfall during warmer years due to impacts of amcs the results discussed here show that amc ic can be an important factor in urban flooding as well the overall values of the difference in flood depths should also be considered in the context that these results are based on historic rainfall data and is not based on projecting to future climates when considering global warming projections for rcp4 5 or rcp8 5 the changes in temperature and precipitation patterns could be more significant the temperature difference presented here is not necessarily at the upper end of the projections particularly over the land were we observe increases up to 6 c the potential for a greater modulation of flooding in urban areas due to changes in rainfall patterns and antecedent initial conditions as a result of a warmer climate remains even though not specifically addressed in this manuscript the effects of higher evaporation in a warmer climate can significantly add to this effect it is important to also note that fig 5 does not change the probability of flooding at the extremes during the warmer years as expected extreme storm events will overwhelm the stormwater conveyance and management systems and will typically results in the highest level of flooding hettiarachchi et al 2018 5 1 how do the results explain the impact of amc on urban flooding at the outset we postulated that the increasing use of stormwater management features such as storage ponds and infiltration swales increase the impact of amc on flooding even in urban developed environments the results and discussion presented above substantiate this and support the hypothesis that changes in rainfall patterns coupled with changes in amcs that can occur due to warmer temperatures can actually have a modulating effect on flooding it is important to note that this effect is driven by different aspects of amcs between larger rural catchments vs urban and developed areas the prevailing idea of how amcs impact runoff rate and volume from catchments focuses primarily on how much soil moisture is available and the resultant abstraction of rainfall what this study shows is that in the case of urban catchments it is the initial conditions in stormwater management features that impact amc conditions that result in abstraction of runoff volumes and the effect on flood levels and this is true for even the smallest of urban catchments as discussed before abstraction due to soil moisture deficit can be considered equivalent to hydraulic abstraction in urban catchments one important consideration is that amc and the level of hydraulic abstraction is effective and relevant mainly in urban catchments with distributed stormwater management features with that said it is also important to note that use of distributed stormwater management in developed areas is the current trend and will be a common feature in built environments as adaptation to climate change continues 5 2 implications on urban flood management the potential modulating effect that we discussed in the paper can have a significant impact on the design of sw bmps the broader range of results that are generated from the modelling approach in the study can lead to a more cost effective design of sw bmps and can increase the probability that these management features will provide the intended benefits to the catchment over a wider range of naturally climate conditions when considering the severe economic impacts of flooding with the cost of global flooding exceeding multiple billion dollars a year em dat and is expected to get worse in the future doocy et al 2013 this approach can also increase potential to optimize benefit cost ratio as well as make better use of the limited space available in urban developed environments for sw bmps other studies that have looked at design of urban stormwater systems and adaption methods within the uncertainties of climate change also present the need to adopt a flexible design approach arnbjerg nielsen et al 2013 refsgaard et al 2013 this study further illustrates the need either a move away from single event based modelling and analysis in preference of continuous simulation or b develop methods to adequately consider changes in amc in event based modelling even when modelling developed urban catchments the discussion above results from the fact that the modelling analysis was done over the entire summer period for each year using continuous simulation this allowed the system to emulate the natural processes that occur in the catchment to a sufficient level to capture the variability in flooding that occurs over a longer period the current technology and available data allow this type of analysis to be done without too much additional effort and the added value in correctly describing flood response as a function of amc far outweigh the expended effort and costs the uncertainties in h h modelling and the variability of climatic drivers related to flooding are well documented beven and binley 1992 franz and hogue 2011 renard et al 2010 modelling longer periods using continuous simulation can help mitigate some of these uncertainties when trying to characterise stormwater systems using mathematical equations when modelling urban catchments as previously discussed in this paper amcs have been shown to have a significant impact on runoff generated from large catchment areas where it generally accepted in hydrology that a certain return interval storm does not always generate the same return interval runoff and nor does it always result in the same return interval flood depth as for urban catchments this disconnect has been largely ignored mainly due to the nature of high percentage of impervious land cover which lends to assume that a certain idf storm would generate the same return interval runoff and thereby the same return interval flood depths what we have shown in this paper is that this assumption might not always hold true even in urban catchments and developed areas with new sw bmps that are more common in development projects and as retrofits for flood management there can be a similar disconnect between the return interval of a storm and the flood depths albeit the surface runoff generated might still be the same we have shown that there is potential for sw bmps to be more effective in future warmer climates and create a disconnect between the intensity of storms and resulting floods all of the above point to the fact that a wider range of simulation of stormwater systems and looking at longer periods of analysis will assist in better designs and better choices on adaptation and will increase the resiliency of the system to combat the impacts of climate change in urban environments 6 conclusions in this manuscript we performed long term continuous modelling of an urban developed catchment to evaluate the impacts of changing distribution of precipitation events in a changing climate by coupling changes in storm rainfall intensities and seasonal rainfall patterns we show that both are equally important to the flood response in a future warmer climate we also show that antecedent conditions can and do impact flooding in current developed urban environments that include constructed stormwater management features which is in contrast to prevailing thought and literature we argue that these urban stormwater management features can behave in a similar way to soil moisture deficit in large scale natural catchments even though the probability of higher rainfall intensities increased during warmer summers the probability of flooding during warmer years reduced although widespread flooding can be expected resulting from the most rare and extreme storms the results here suggest that the inclusion of the variability of amc ics that can prevail in a future climate along with projected distributions of rainfall events can have a modulating effect on flooding in many current constructed environments the methods used for this study are simple and straight forward and can be applied to almost any urban area with a stormwater system model with sufficient detail the implications of doing a similar analysis can be significant when looking at design of flood mitigation and adaptation methods in urban developed environments the generation of a probability distribution of results can help with a risk based optimization for adaptation and a more flexible design approach to take maximum advantage of limited space in urban areas and provide a more resilient level of flood protection for prevention of loss of life the authors see two elements that can further improve this study the first is to apply this analysis to different watersheds and in different climatic regions although we acknowledge that the availability of models with sufficient detail to repeat this analysis in other areas can be a challenge the second is to add a more detailed accounting for evaporation a daily temperature based modelling of evaporation will add to a better response in open water bodies to temperature variation especially when considering that the temperatures are expected to increase in a future climate declaration of

6630,climate change coupled with the current trend in rapid urbanization is increasing the risk of flooding that can cause loss of life and damage to property adapting to climate change impacts and flood mitigation has become a life critical factor as well as a severe challenge green infrastructure and low impact development methods are common approaches that are increasingly used to address stormwater management in developed environments the analysis and results of this study show that amc ic does impact flood response even in urban developed catchments and that it can significantly impact flood responses during storm events we show that considering amc ics coupled with changes in seasonal rainfall patterns that are projected for warmer climates in the future can modulate some of the increases in flood risk due to climate change the prevailing thought is that antecedent moisture conditions amcs have little to no relevance in urban hydrology particularly in relation to climate change however current trends in use of stormwater management methods that depend on local storage and infiltration is increasingly making amc or initial conditions ic a factor in urban flooding despite this trend there is little available literature that discuss the aspect of amc ic that can have an implication on urban flood management here we move towards filling this gap in current literature related to impacts of amcs in flooding of developed areas by focusing on how possible changes in seasonal rainfall patterns in a warming climate might impact amc and starting conditions in stormwater best management practices swbmps and how those changed initial conditions impact flood risk in developed areas using a comprehensive hydrologic hydraulic model of an urban developed catchment and continuous simulation we demonstrate the importance of accurately accounting for initial conditions in flood assessments we consider average summer temperatures based on approximately 70 years of historic data to select warm and cold years we compare the model results between the warm and cold years as a proxy to look at trends related to a future warming climate keywords antecedent moisture conditions climate change urban flooding continuous simulation 1 introduction the current trend in population demographics and rapid urbanization is increasing the risk of flooding that can cause loss of life and damage to property the risks of urban flooding and related stresses are exacerbated by climatic changes that are projected to occur ashley et al 2005 miller and hutchins 2017 schreider et al 2000 willems et al 2012b zhou et al 2016 warming temperatures are projected to intensify storms in a future climate resulting in greater storm intensities fadhel et al 2018 lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 wasko and sharma 2015 current literature shows that increased rainfall and more peaked temporal patterns of storms as a result of climate change will increase flood risk in urban areas fadhel et al 2018 hettiarachchi et al 2018 kundzewicz et al 2014 wasko and sharma 2015 in addition to storms increasing in intensity climate change is also impacting the overall patterns of storm occurrences the seasonal distribution of storm events are projected to change due to warming temperatures with wet areas getting wetter and dry areas getting dryer marvel and bonfils 2013 walsh and lawler 1981 based on the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2014 report on climate extremes the projected trends are for a higher proportion of the annual rainfall to occur in heavier rainfall events with some areas experiencing intense storm events even though total rainfall is projected to decrease seneviratne et al 2012 changes in the distribution of rainfall events over a longer period such as the summer season can impact antecedent conditions within the watershed ivancic and shaw 2015 wasko et al 2015 woldemeskel and sharma 2016 currently literature investigating climate change impacts on urban flooding focus on single storm events of a particular return period scaling intensity duration frequency idf curves with temperature or downscaling global circulation models generated rainfall events arnbjerg nielsen et al 2013 fadhel et al 2018 guo and adams 1998 hettiarachchi et al 2018 huang et al 2016 lambourne and stephenson 1987 mamo 2015 nguyen et al 2010 sørup et al 2016 willems et al 2012a zhou et al 2016 while these studies show an increase in the threat of flooding in dense urban areas with high impervious surfaces due to climate change they do not account for changes in rainfall distribution over extended periods of time in short they do not consider changes in antecedent moisture conditions amc for urban environments if climatic change is expected to change not just rainfall intensities but the seasonal distribution of rainfall as well it is only appropriate to look at storm events over a whole season there is little doubt that antecedent moisture impacts hydrologic modelling of large scale catchments many studies have shown that amc is a key factor in accurately modelling and predicting flooding in natural catchments ivancic and shaw 2015 pathiraja et al 2012 sharma et al 2018 wasko and sharma 2017a woldemeskel and sharma 2016 in particular wasko and sharma 2017b discuss the differences between the increase in rainfall intensities and the overall decrease in stream flows in a warming climate they suggest that the lack of correspondence between precipitation and stream flow scaling can be explained by changing temperatures causing changes in soil moisture and such factors in effect the antecedent conditions related to losses from runoff rate and volume similarly there are studies that have evaluated the effectiveness of green infrastructure and low impact development methods in mitigating flooding impacts discussed in following section but as far as the authors are aware there are few if no studies that consider changes in amc due to climate change and the impact on urban flooding the lack of studies or urban catchments and initial conditions is understandable as the prevailing thought is that urban catchments consist of mostly impervious landuse types and are essentially impervious to variations in amc this is despite the increased use of green infrastructure as part of the tools that are used in adaptation to climate change impacts gill et al 2007 and as retrofits to deal with existing flooding problems in cities this green infrastructure approach leads to storage elements forming a larger part of urban stormwater management system as discussed in the following sections hence the initial conditions ics of these storage elements in smaller urban developed catchments essentially become the antecedent condition similar to soil moisture deficit levels in a large scale catchment therefore we postulate that the current trend in adaptation methods and stormwater management in urban areas can increase the effects of amc ic on urban flooding we speculate that if climate change results in changes to the distribution of rainfall events in a season the impact on amcs and ics can actually modulate flood risk during more frequent storms even though the more extreme storm events continue to result in severe flooding in hettiarachchi et al 2018 rainfall patterns during storm events adjusted to account for warming temperatures coupled with a detailed hydrologic and hydraulic model of a developed urban area showed that the intensification of rainfall due to climate change can increase urban flooding by as much as 35 in this paper we look at the seasonal distribution of rainfall over the summer period to determine the probability of flooding and how the frequency of flooding compares between warmer and colder summers we use the mean summer period temperature to determine warm and cold years and use continuous simulation with a detailed h h model to generate the resulting depth of water during rain events in a developed environment we compare the model results for the warm and cold summers as proxy to discuss the impacts of a warming climate 2 urban stormwater management trends and relevance of antecedent moisture conditions the world s urban population is expected to grow by 2 3 billion to 6 3 billion people by 2050 united nations 2011 this growth adds severe strains on urban cities for liveable space and infrastructure zhou 2014 as cities expand and impervious land cover increases even less severe more frequent storms can result in dangerous flood conditions the added connectivity of surface runoff and storm sewer systems resulting from expanding urban areas also serves to compound this effect miller and hutchins 2017 rainfall events that might have resulted in minor or nuisance flooding can become major flooding causing significant disruptions danger to public safety and adding to the already significant economic impacts doocy et al 2013 moftakhari et al 2017 adapting to climate change impacts and flood mitigation collectively referred as management of surface runoff in urban developed environments has become a life critical factor as well as a severe challenge urbanization can also impact catchment response to storms with increase in flow rates and decreasing water quality galster et al 2006 hollis 1975 nelson et al 2006 these changes in flow rates and water quality tends to have a deleterious effect on the receiving water bodies such as stream rivers and lakes barbosa et al 2012 degradation of water quality in surface water bodies leads to water contact and supply concerns that can also threaten human health gaffield et al 2003 sidhu et al 2012 to curb such adverse downstream impacts due to changes or increases in impervious land area stormwater management rules have been brought about by governmental and regulatory units such as city governments catchment management organizations and basin management authorities to that end green infrastructure low impact development lid methods water sensitive urban design wsud or stormwater best management practices sw bmps are common terms that are used to reference technologies and approaches that are increasingly used to address stormwater management in developed environments bertilsson et al hancock et al 2010 kuller et al 2017 locatelli et al 2017 mcgrane 2016 the authors will use sw bmps to reference all constructed stormwater management features for the remainder of this manuscript some of the more common methods used to meet these requirements and mitigate flow rates and volumes include the use of detention retention ponds along with infiltration methods such as rainwater gardens infiltration swales green roofs and subsurface storage pyke et al 2011 of these methods retention detention ponds are more widely used especially in the usa due to design and construction simplicity and relative effectiveness hancock et al 2010 semadeni davies et al 2008 the current trend is to integrate these stormwater management features into the overall layout of the development plans fryd et al 2010 geldof and stahre 2005 as presented in fig 1 housing developments most often use the stormwater management pond as a local amenity or as an avenue to provide for a natural ecosystem such as wetlands fig 1 the functionality of these sw bmps is dependent either on storing or infiltrating surface runoff generated during a storm event the addition of such sw bmps makes amcs relevant to the urban environment when looking at modelling these catchments along with the intensity the temporal distribution of precipitation during a storm event can have a significant impact on the effectiveness these sw bmps hettiarachchi et al 2018 amcs will dictate how saturated or dry the soils are in infiltration based methods and will also determine the variation of water levels in detention ponds the level of water in these ponds will determine the volume of storage available to mitigate excess runoff during a storm this is why contrary to the prevailing thought modern day urban stormwater systems are not completely impervious to amcs even though there are minimal to no natural streams or channels in majority of stormwater conveyance system in urban or development environments these constructed sw bmps makes knowing the water levels prior to a storm event relevant to urban flooding and as a result any changes to amcs with climate change need to be considered in future urban flooding assessments 3 catchment model and data the hydraulic component of modelling urban stormwater systems tends to be more important relative to large catchments and riverine systems where the hydrology dominates hence urban stormwater models require a higher level of detail to generate reliable and accurate flood results schmitt et al 2004 schreider et al 2000 the depth of flooding rather than the flow rate becomes a key result in the context of urban flooding due to the complex hydraulic interactions with the built environment which cannot be adequately captured in rainfall runoff models for these reasons the storm water model management swmm modelling package by the united states environmental protection agency is used here among the various methods available in the hydrologic hydraulic h h modelling space ranging from the simple rationale method hromadka 1989 to the very complex use or neural networks wu and chau 2011 the swmm engine is widely used bisht et al 2016 and forms the backbone of most of the dynamic h h modelling packages used in the water resources industry the h h model used here is based on a complex urban catchment in minnesota usa this model was developed for the south washington watershed district swwd in the state of minnesota usa to manage surface water flows as well as for planning and management of on going development work and capital improvement projects the catchment area of the swwd is a highly developed urban suburban area and extends over 65 m2 165 km2 the model was initially built in the year 2000 and has been continuously maintained and updated with the latest available landuse land cover and stormwater infrastructure information the model includes extensive detail of all landuse types and stormwater infrastructures including sewers culvert crossing open channel reaches and constructed and natural storages highly detailed delineation of both sub catchment boundaries and impervious area was done using a high resolution digital elevation model dem development construction and grading plan overlays and aerial imagery within a geographic information system gis environment all surface runoff is fed into the appropriate inflow points of the hydraulic conveyance system the model has been validated and used to design major capital improvement and flood mitigation projects hettiarachchi et al 2012 the supplemental information associated with this paper includes detailed information on the model the model includes geometry details to explicitly model the street overflow routes where flooding occurs as well as depth area curves that capture flooding at the storage nodes the detailed geometry included in the model provides an accurate representation of flood extents for the purposes of this study and to reduce the complexity and model run times the model was trimmed to the upper section of the swwd representing an area of approximately 8 5 square miles fig 2 it should be noted that the section of the model selected includes the most developed part of the overall watershed with a mix of high to low density residential commercial and industrial type landuses therefore this model can be assumed to represent a typical developed watershed and the results to reflect responses of typical stormwater systems in typical developed areas precipitation and temperature data used in the analysis were sourced from the national centers for environmental information hosted by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa both hourly and daily rainfall data were obtained from the climate data online site for minneapolis and st paul msp international airport gauge which is the closest major airport to the study area daily data for the msp airport was available from 1901 through 2014 while hourly data was available from 1948 through 2014 though daily data is available through noaa for more recent years the modelling period was limited to 2014 due to the hourly dataset that ends that year daily maximum minimum and average temperature data was also obtained for the period from 1901 through 2014 for this analysis days that did not have precipitation data were assumed to have no rain the average monthly evaporation data for the same period as the temperature data was taken from the minnesota department of natural resources mndnr climate data available at https www dnr state mn us climate wxsta pan evaporation html the daily average evaporation for each month during the summer period was added to the model based on the data available through the mndnr and was unchanged for all model runs therefore modelled results that are discussed are primarily dependent on changes in precipitation patterns 4 methodology the workflow as described below follows three main phases the overall approach is summarized in table 1 step 1 is the model setup so that it can accurately model extended periods in continuous simulation mode which was followed by selecting the warm and cold years from the available historical data for this paper we extract the modelled water levels at markgraf and wilmes lake fig 2 markgraf is a local waterbody that drains a predominantly industrial watershed and used as a second reference location to present results wilmes lake is a local minor lake along the main thalweg and the outlet point for this catchment as is the primary reference point for the model results availability of surveyed bathymetric data at these locations make them more suitable than most of the other open water bodies modelled especially when water levels draw below the normal water level 4 1 model setup and verification as the model used in this analysis has been continuously updated verified and extensively used for design of large scale capital stormwater projects for over 15 years the model verification process for this paper was limited to comparing the model performance when run continuously for the summer months johnson and stefan 2006 discuss the variation of ice out months in the minnesota lakes as it relates to the warming climate which indicates that the ice out dates have occurred earlier in the recent past their research shows that typical ice out for the southern part of the state is march april hence the model start month was set for may to ensure that the water levels in open water bodies stabilize after the snow melt period and the starting water levels were set as the normal water level nwl or equal to the primary outlet elevation at all open water bodies this would also ensure that any flooding caused by spring runoff would not be included in the results the model end date was set at september to avoid the pre winter drawdown which occurs in october where the lake level is artificially lowered to allow additional storage for possible excess snowmelt in the following spring by modelling for the entire summer seasons the h h model essentially run as a continuous simulation cs this is not typically the case in h h model analysis which are used for event based modelling but studies exist that discuss and compare event based modelling with continues simulation for flood predictions in particular stephens et al 2018 compares how event based modelling compares with continuous simulation based modelling in the context of impacts of climate change on flooding with both methods found to be appropriate avellaneda et al 2017 uses epa swmm which is the modelling package used in this manuscript to look at cumulative performance of green infrastructure through long term simulation of these methods which again supports the use of epa swmm as an appropriate tool for this study as per the swmm manual epa 2016 the soil infiltration parameters were set at the driest level for the soil type which essentially sets the maximum infiltration rate for a soil type at the start of the simulation typically in event simulation soil moisture parameters are set to an appropriate value for each soil type but in cs the model continuously accounts for soil moisture and recharge of infiltration capacity during the simulation period which then correctly accounts for amcs during a precipitation event as discussed before average monthly evaporation available from the state of minnesota department of natural resources were used to update the model evaporation for this study the evaporation rates were set as daily values averaged for each month to verify that the model setup was adequate to run continuously the model was run for 3 summer periods that reflect wet average and dry years based on total summer rain as shown in fig 3 results for these three verification years match reasonably well when compared to the available gauge lake elevations confirming that the model can be applied for continuous simulation in this catchment 4 2 selection of modelled years daily temperatures for the summer months from 1948 through to 2013 were used to calculate the average temperature for the summer for each year to match the availability of hourly rainfall data used in the modelling process the years were ranked from the highest summer temperature to the lowest summer temperature from which the ten warmest years were picked from the ten top ranked years and the ten coldest years were picked as the lowest ranked ten years the selected warm and cold years are presented in table 2 along with the average summer temperature for each year it is interesting to note that the difference between the average of the warmest and coldest year temperatures is approximately 3 deg c which corresponds to the predicted global temperature increase in the ipcc report on long term climate change projections by the year 2100 collins et al 2013 these ten warm and ten cold selected years form the basis for the modelling analysis that follows which also helps to keep the level of modelling effort within reason selection of the summer period was intended to avoid periods of snowfall and focus the modelling analysis on flooding due to summer storms mass curves of daily rainfall for the summer period were generated for each of the 20 selected years using data extending back to 1948 is purely to represent rainfall patterns that have occurred along with the associated with the temperatures of each year 4 3 modelling and analysis for each of the 20 selected years the model was run from the 1st of may through the 30th of september with hourly rainfall spanning the modelled months distributed evenly over the watershed after which the water level output from the model at wilmes lake and markgraf were extracted for further analysis the local maxima were identified from the continuous depth data generated from the model also a set of local minima was extracted by setting a threshold equal to the elevation of the primary outlet that would then represent the occurrence of a minimum elevation in lake level at or below the hydraulic outlet elevation at wilmes lake the distinction of minima below the outlet elevation of the lake is that this would represent low water surface elevations that occurred due to environmental forcing rather than hydraulic draw down of water level through outflow from the outlet probability density functions pdfs and empirical cumulative distribution functions cdfs were calculated for the two sets of maxima points for the warm and cold years similarly cdfs were developed for the peak rainfall intensities for the warm years and cold years along with cdfs for the minima below the outlet threshold 5 results and discussion here we present the results addressing the question of how climate change might affect amc ics in urban catchments and thereby impact catchment response and flooding even though we are using historic data table 2 shows close to a 3 deg c increase in the average summer temperature between the 10 coldest and 10 warmest years which is similar to projected temperature increases collins et al 2013 seneviratne et al 2012 trenberth 2011 hence we suggest that it is reasonable to use the results as a proxy to evaluate impacts of climate change on amc ics and urban flooding in addition the majority of the warm years appear to occur after the turn of the century while most of the colder years are in the 1960s again suggesting that we are comparing the past colder conditions with possible future warmer conditions fig 4 shows the mass curves separated for the 10 cold years and 10 warm years there is a clear difference in the rainfall pattern throughout the summer between the cold years and the warm years the variability is much greater for those years that classed as warm versus those that classed as cold however the average cumulative rainfall amounts which are shown in thicker lines are similar this suggests that although overall seasonal rainfall amounts are the same the pattern or intensities of individual rainfall events differs which is consistent with current available literature that projects rainfall patterns to change towards fewer but larger more intense storms in a future warming climate collins et al 2013 walsh et al 2014 it is important to note that these rainfall patterns and temperature differences are based on historic data and not from weather generation of projected data using global circulation models of future climate change following are the results presented in probability density function pdf and empirical cumulative distribution function cdfs curves which allows us to look at changes across severity and magnitude fig 5 a shows the pdf and fig 5 b cdfs for the peak rainfall intensities that occurred during the set of 10 warmer years and 10 colder years the pdf cdfs for the warm and cold rainfall peak intensities show that the probability of more intense rainfall is higher during warm years which is as expected and well documented in literature alexander et al 2006 hettiarachchi et al 2018 lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 wasko and sharma 2015 though the mean intensities between warmer and colder years are not very different the warmer years show a positive skew with more events exceeding a 2in hr intensity fig 5 a shows that the rainfall in colder years occurs more frequently in events less than 1 inch hour fig 5 b shows that there is a higher probability of rainfall intensities above the 20th percentile in the warmer years fig 5 a and b confirm the qualitative assessment of fig 4 that the rainfall occurs in fewer more intense events in the warmer years the distribution of peak flood depths as a result of the modelling analysis is presented in fig 6 fig 6a compares the pdf of the peak depths or the local maxima at wilmes lake between the 10 warmest and 10 coldest years while fig 6 b shows the cdfs of the same peak flood depths similarly fig 7 shows the cdf for peak depths at markgraf comparing figs 5 a and 6 a there is a higher chance of a larger peak depth occurring in colder years if for the sake of comparison we consider a flood depth of 8 ft for wilmes lake which is close to 2 ft above the normal water level there is a higher frequency of flooding occurring in colder years than in warmer years similar to fig 6 b which shows that the probability of flooding particularly at or below the 80th percentile is higher in the colder years fig 7 also shows a similar distribution at markgraf where the warmer years are in the lower side of peak depths to approximately the 80th percentile even though the difference between warmer colder flood peaks is smaller at markgraf due to the smaller watershed area draining to this storage area only 0 4 m2 this confirms the pattern of peak depth distribution at wilmes lake overall these distributions suggest that there is a higher probability of flooding in colder years we note that the higher percentile rainfall intensities and peak depth do match in figs 5 b 6 b and 7 which shows that the extremely intense storms which have a higher occurrence in warmer years are most likely producing the highest peak depths these results essentially means there is a reversal between the distributions of peak rainfall intensities and resulting peak flood depths this flip between rainfall intensity and peak flood depths is clearer in the cdf plots in figs 5 b and 6 b this is an unexpected result as the conventional wisdom is that a higher frequency in intense storms is normally expected to generate a higher frequency of flood depths particularly in developed urban areas the p value for a kolgmorov smirov test which is a non parametric test for the difference between two samples for a difference in the peak depths cdfs at wilmes lake is 0 041 the p value suggests that the difference is statistically significant and not purely observed by chance we also note that these results are based on historic data for the past 75 years the rainfall patterns and temperatures used for this study are not based on any projections to the future using weather generators or global circulation models as discussed in the methodology we used a simple approach of selecting the warmest and coldest years based on average temperature during the summer months from 1948 using the warm cold year difference as a proxy for a future climate hence the results present an indication on how rainfall patterns and the resulting potential for flooding can vary with temperatures as well as aiding our understanding of possible changes in warming climate to understand the flip in the cdf between the intensity of rainfall and the flood peaks presented in figs 5b and 6b distributions of the water level minima are presented in fig 8 similar to the maxima fig 8 a shows the pdf and 8 b shows the cdf of the minima below the outlet threshold fig 8 a shows that the water level decreased below the outlet level more often in the warmer years especially between 5 5 and 6 ft fig 8 b shows that there is a much higher probability of lower water elevations for the warmer years compared to the colder years this result shows that draw down of the lake due to environmental forcing occurred more often in the warmer years hence there is a higher probability of water level being lower prior to a storm event during warmer years the lower water levels means there is more available storage volume at wilmes lake therefore the available storage to absorb the increased runoff during storms tends to modulate the impact of the higher intensity storms during warmer years when the water level is higher than the outlet level the rate of outflow or the drawdown of the water level after a storm is predominantly governed by hydraulic factors once the water level decreases to match the lowest outlet level from a storage pond or lake there is no more flow through the outlet and any further decrease in water level is due to environmental factors such as evaporation hence the results presented in fig 8 demonstrate that pattern of stronger but less frequent rainfall events during the summers of the warmer years allows evaporation from the lake to draw down the water level below the outlet level more often compared to the colder years the absolute values of flood depths difference between the warmer and colder years might not translate to an appreciable difference in flood impacts and damages in this catchment depending on the frequency return period of the event considered nevertheless the trend in the results is of great interest the results presented here follow a similar pattern to those presented in wasko and sharma 2017b where for natural catchments the change in stream flow did not generally correspond with the increase in rainfall during warmer years due to impacts of amcs the results discussed here show that amc ic can be an important factor in urban flooding as well the overall values of the difference in flood depths should also be considered in the context that these results are based on historic rainfall data and is not based on projecting to future climates when considering global warming projections for rcp4 5 or rcp8 5 the changes in temperature and precipitation patterns could be more significant the temperature difference presented here is not necessarily at the upper end of the projections particularly over the land were we observe increases up to 6 c the potential for a greater modulation of flooding in urban areas due to changes in rainfall patterns and antecedent initial conditions as a result of a warmer climate remains even though not specifically addressed in this manuscript the effects of higher evaporation in a warmer climate can significantly add to this effect it is important to also note that fig 5 does not change the probability of flooding at the extremes during the warmer years as expected extreme storm events will overwhelm the stormwater conveyance and management systems and will typically results in the highest level of flooding hettiarachchi et al 2018 5 1 how do the results explain the impact of amc on urban flooding at the outset we postulated that the increasing use of stormwater management features such as storage ponds and infiltration swales increase the impact of amc on flooding even in urban developed environments the results and discussion presented above substantiate this and support the hypothesis that changes in rainfall patterns coupled with changes in amcs that can occur due to warmer temperatures can actually have a modulating effect on flooding it is important to note that this effect is driven by different aspects of amcs between larger rural catchments vs urban and developed areas the prevailing idea of how amcs impact runoff rate and volume from catchments focuses primarily on how much soil moisture is available and the resultant abstraction of rainfall what this study shows is that in the case of urban catchments it is the initial conditions in stormwater management features that impact amc conditions that result in abstraction of runoff volumes and the effect on flood levels and this is true for even the smallest of urban catchments as discussed before abstraction due to soil moisture deficit can be considered equivalent to hydraulic abstraction in urban catchments one important consideration is that amc and the level of hydraulic abstraction is effective and relevant mainly in urban catchments with distributed stormwater management features with that said it is also important to note that use of distributed stormwater management in developed areas is the current trend and will be a common feature in built environments as adaptation to climate change continues 5 2 implications on urban flood management the potential modulating effect that we discussed in the paper can have a significant impact on the design of sw bmps the broader range of results that are generated from the modelling approach in the study can lead to a more cost effective design of sw bmps and can increase the probability that these management features will provide the intended benefits to the catchment over a wider range of naturally climate conditions when considering the severe economic impacts of flooding with the cost of global flooding exceeding multiple billion dollars a year em dat and is expected to get worse in the future doocy et al 2013 this approach can also increase potential to optimize benefit cost ratio as well as make better use of the limited space available in urban developed environments for sw bmps other studies that have looked at design of urban stormwater systems and adaption methods within the uncertainties of climate change also present the need to adopt a flexible design approach arnbjerg nielsen et al 2013 refsgaard et al 2013 this study further illustrates the need either a move away from single event based modelling and analysis in preference of continuous simulation or b develop methods to adequately consider changes in amc in event based modelling even when modelling developed urban catchments the discussion above results from the fact that the modelling analysis was done over the entire summer period for each year using continuous simulation this allowed the system to emulate the natural processes that occur in the catchment to a sufficient level to capture the variability in flooding that occurs over a longer period the current technology and available data allow this type of analysis to be done without too much additional effort and the added value in correctly describing flood response as a function of amc far outweigh the expended effort and costs the uncertainties in h h modelling and the variability of climatic drivers related to flooding are well documented beven and binley 1992 franz and hogue 2011 renard et al 2010 modelling longer periods using continuous simulation can help mitigate some of these uncertainties when trying to characterise stormwater systems using mathematical equations when modelling urban catchments as previously discussed in this paper amcs have been shown to have a significant impact on runoff generated from large catchment areas where it generally accepted in hydrology that a certain return interval storm does not always generate the same return interval runoff and nor does it always result in the same return interval flood depth as for urban catchments this disconnect has been largely ignored mainly due to the nature of high percentage of impervious land cover which lends to assume that a certain idf storm would generate the same return interval runoff and thereby the same return interval flood depths what we have shown in this paper is that this assumption might not always hold true even in urban catchments and developed areas with new sw bmps that are more common in development projects and as retrofits for flood management there can be a similar disconnect between the return interval of a storm and the flood depths albeit the surface runoff generated might still be the same we have shown that there is potential for sw bmps to be more effective in future warmer climates and create a disconnect between the intensity of storms and resulting floods all of the above point to the fact that a wider range of simulation of stormwater systems and looking at longer periods of analysis will assist in better designs and better choices on adaptation and will increase the resiliency of the system to combat the impacts of climate change in urban environments 6 conclusions in this manuscript we performed long term continuous modelling of an urban developed catchment to evaluate the impacts of changing distribution of precipitation events in a changing climate by coupling changes in storm rainfall intensities and seasonal rainfall patterns we show that both are equally important to the flood response in a future warmer climate we also show that antecedent conditions can and do impact flooding in current developed urban environments that include constructed stormwater management features which is in contrast to prevailing thought and literature we argue that these urban stormwater management features can behave in a similar way to soil moisture deficit in large scale natural catchments even though the probability of higher rainfall intensities increased during warmer summers the probability of flooding during warmer years reduced although widespread flooding can be expected resulting from the most rare and extreme storms the results here suggest that the inclusion of the variability of amc ics that can prevail in a future climate along with projected distributions of rainfall events can have a modulating effect on flooding in many current constructed environments the methods used for this study are simple and straight forward and can be applied to almost any urban area with a stormwater system model with sufficient detail the implications of doing a similar analysis can be significant when looking at design of flood mitigation and adaptation methods in urban developed environments the generation of a probability distribution of results can help with a risk based optimization for adaptation and a more flexible design approach to take maximum advantage of limited space in urban areas and provide a more resilient level of flood protection for prevention of loss of life the authors see two elements that can further improve this study the first is to apply this analysis to different watersheds and in different climatic regions although we acknowledge that the availability of models with sufficient detail to repeat this analysis in other areas can be a challenge the second is to add a more detailed accounting for evaporation a daily temperature based modelling of

6631,scale represents an important concept in all scientific disciplines but the scaling effect related to non point source nps pollution simulation and sensitivity parameters has not yet been reported in this study the sliding window the fourier amplitude sensitivity test and the nested watershed idea were used with the soil and water assessment tool swat model to explore the temporal and spatial scaling effects of parameter sensitivity in a typical watershed of the three gorges reservoir region china the results indicated that a great scaling effect could be observed at varying spatio temporal scales while the scaling effect would be transferred and amplified from the hydrological modelling to the nps simulation soil properties such as sol k and sol bd were identified as key parameters under smaller spatial and temporal scales while channel related parameters in terms of alpha bf ch k and ch n showed greater sensitivity at larger scales specifically some parameters such as ch n usle k usle p and erorgp were always identified as key sensitive parameters for the sediment and nps tp simulations but some parameters such as ch k showed sensitivity only above a specific spatial scale 778 km2 in this study these results could be used as a reference for studying the scaling effect of model parameter sensitivity and provide important information for model construction and the management of nps pollution at different scales keywords non point source pollution parameter sensitivity scaling effect sliding window fourier amplitude sensitivity test soil and water assessment tool 1 introduction as an important concept in all scientific disciplines scale refers to the spatial or temporal dimension of a specific natural phenomenon wu et al 2006 correspondingly scaling effect indicates the impacts of the changing scales on the research results or the possibility that the research results obtained at specific scales could be extended to other scales as multiple processes operate and vary across a range of scales dungan et al 2002 understanding the natural processes and their relative stability over scales is very important in recent decades more researches and applications have focused on the scaling issues in ecology geoscience and hydrology but scale problems related to water quality issues have rarely been studied chen et al 2018a b randhir and tsvetkova 2011 non point source nps pollution has become one of the major obstacles and hot topics related to water quality protection in recent years chen et al 2017 moges et al 2018 the reason is that nps pollution has great spatial temporal variability randomness and uncertainty due to the high variability of driving forces heterogeneity of human activities ongley et al 2010 wickham et al 2006 wang et al 2018a b therefore accurate assessments play a key role in investigating the reasons for and taking management measures against nps pollution leip et al 2015 numerous distributed and semi distributed hydrological models dhms sdhms have been developed and used widely in hydrological and nps pollution h nps predictions due to limited resources chen et al 2018a b kliment et al 2008 lian et al 2007 reshmidevi et al 2018 however it should be noted that the simulation results and multiple parameters of these physical based models are scale variable or scale dependent barrios and francés 2012 chen et al 2018a b huang et al 2017 2010 merz et al 2009 versini et al 2015 sensitivity analysis sa represents an indispensable step in the construction and application of hydrological models especially for complex dhms sdhms herman et al 2013 and it improves the efficiency of model calibration and increases the reliability of model application kannan et al 2007 razavi and gupta 2016 saltelli et al 2004 zadeh et al 2017 to date sa methods can be divided into local sensitivity analysis lsa and global sensitivity analysis gsa mousivand et al 2014 saltelli et al 2000 typical lsa methods such as the one variable at a time oat and the differential analysis da method helton and davis 2003 are less reliable because they cannot fully find optimal parameters and ignore the interaction between multiple parameters helton 1993 as a good substitute for lsa gsa methods including regression analysis ra morris screening sobol s methods fourier amplitude sensitivity test fast and regional sensitivity analysis rsa have been developed bilotta et al 2012 gamerith et al 2013 norton 2015 olaya abril et al 2017 wang et al 2013 these methods consider the interaction between different parameters by changing multiple model parameters simultaneously cibin et al 2010 however the parameter sensitivity of hydrological models is also scale dependent because several different processes occur at multiple scales for hydrological studies spatial scales could be divided into experimental slope catchment watershed intercontinental and global scales while temporal scales could be represented using hourly daily monthly and annual intervals ongley et al 2010 the traditional application of sa is based on the aggregation of model residuals across the whole time series and leads to a constant parameter sensitivity but the parameter sensitivity may be time variant due to the temporal variation of the watershed processes instead the sliding windows approach considers parameter recognition as a function of the simulation time interval and has been used to represent the temporal variability of parameter sensitivity wagener et al 2003 several studies have used this approach to analyse the temporal performance of hydrological models guse et al 2014 pianosi and wagener 2016 meanwhile the time varying and multi timescale tvmt method was proposed to remedy the deficiency of the previous sliding window approaches such as fixing window sizes massmann et al 2014 has used this method to explore the time varying sensitive parameters across temporal scales however the spatial scaling effect of parameter sensitivity is poorly understood and as far as we know the scaling effect in relation to nps simulation remains poorly reported in this paper the scaling effect of parameter sensitivity was explored by conducting the following tasks 1 an integrated analytical method was proposed for studying the scaling effect of parameter sensitivity 2 the sensitive parameters of a typical watershed model were identified and compared at multiple temporal and spatial scales and 3 suggestions were given for model construction and nps pollution management this proposed method was tested in the daning river watershed which is a typical watershed located in the three gorges reservoir region tgrr of china 2 methodology an integrated analytical method shown in fig 1 is proposed for evaluating the scaling effect of parameter sensitivity first detailed basic data were collected at a fine scale and compiled with the model inputs and the hydrological model was calibrated using these inputs second the sliding window and nested watershed idea were used in combination with the watershed model to find different sensitive parameter sets at varying temporal and spatial scales third high sensitivity parameter sets were obtained using an advanced gsa method finally the scaling effects of parameter sensitivity were quantified for the h nps simulation by comparative analysis 2 1 generating data series at finer scales generally the model represents a mathematical expression that abstracts practical environments and represents a tool for simulating all hydrological processes within a watershed a typical modelling cycle consists of the following parts input data model parameter and structure and model output to study scale issues attribute and spatial input data should be collected at finer temporal scales then simulation results were derived from a series of empirical mathematical or physical equations and parameters this process can be generalized by the following schematic diagram where x 1 x 2 x n are the input data needed for model establishment i e attribute data such as observed flow and water quality data as well as spatial data such as digital elevation model dem y is the simulated results of the model 2 2 generating data series at different temporal scales using the tvmt method next the ranges and distributions of the model parameters are set which is very important for the following sa the ranges of parameters could be considered according to the model s manual or the results of local investigations meanwhile if specific prior information is lacking the parameter ranges could be defined to follow uniform normal log normal or other classic distributions for an effective search different parameter sets could be obtained using random sampling e g the monte carlo method based on the default parameter range and the related distribution set to 20 000 times to produce stable first order sensitivity indices werkhoven et al 2008 then the models with different parameter sets were run and calibrated at a fine time step and the sensitivity of the model performance metric was calculated by associating the sensitivity indices rosolem et al 2013 xie et al 2017 the root mean squared error rmse was chosen to evaluate the model performance because it is widely used to characterize the variance between the simulated and observed values specifically the rmse was adjusted as a scale dependent term by incorporating the sliding window approach as shown in eq 1 then the rmse was combined with the fast method cukier et al 1973 reusser et al 2011 to calculate the first sensitivity index of each parameter 1 rms e t w 1 w 1 i t 1 2 w i t 1 2 w s i obs s i sim 2 where w is the size of the sliding window and t is the time step for the temporal sa this is the section where it is important to show the temporal period with the window size w i represents the time step along the temporal period and the range is t w 2 to t w 2 s i obs represents the observed value of flow sediment or total phosphorus tp on day i and s i sim represents the simulated value of flow sediment or tp on day i the first order sensitivity indices can then be calculated under the combination of the proposed goodness of fit rmse and the moving window size finally the scaling temporal effects of parameter sensitivity can be obtained 2 3 generating data series at varying spatial scales using nested watershed idea based on geographic theory a watershed can be divided into a distinct stream network and a corresponding number of sub watersheds while the stream reaches can be outlined by the landscape cross section channel relief and the surrounding terrain thus a watershed can be divided as river tributaries while a nested relationship can be identified from upstream and downstream tributaries during this step the river network was extracted based on the dem and the flow direction was calculated as an indispensable part of the river network extraction jiang et al 2013 the d8 algorithm was used because of its operability and adaptability to terrain the basic idea is to traverse the dem after filling the depression using a moving 3 3 window from the upper left corner of the input image then the distance weighted drop p is calculated between the centre pixel and the eight adjacent grid elements finally the cell with max p was selected and the k value and the flow direction of the centre pixel dir were determined liu et al 2008 2 p h i h k h i h k 2 k 1 3 5 7 k 2 4 6 8 3 dir 2 k 1 where i j is the central pixel location hi represents its elevation value and hk indicates the elevation value of its neighbourhood grid k starts in the east and takes the value of 1 8 in the clockwise direction the dem elevation and flow value of one of the arithmetic windows are shown in fig 2 using the d8 algorithm the runoff on the surface grid was calculated with respect to the lowest elevation of the eight adjacent grids to the central grid then the grid to the solid line was connected as the river network according to the principle that the flow of water always flows to the lowlands after several drainage areas were identified based on the nested watershed idea the model could be run at different spatial scales and sensitive parameters were identified at different spatial scales then the spatial scaling effects could be quantified by identifying the sensitive parameters from the perspective of the nested watershed idea 2 4 using the gsa method to identify sensitive parameters to quantify the sensitive parameters the fast cukier et al 1973 reusser et al 2011 method was used as a typical gsa method the fast method is able to estimate parameter sensitivities for nonlinear complex models the fast method can be regarded as a variance decomposition method which decomposes the total variance of the model outputs into the variance contributions due to variations of single factors i e parameters and inputs it can be described as follows 4 v i n v i i n j i 1 n v ij i n j i 1 n k j 1 n v ijk v 12 n in eq 4 v indicates the total variance of the model outputs i j and k represent the parameters to be considered and n is the number of parameters vi and vij denote the variance that can be explained by parameter i first order variance and the variance that can be explained by parameter i second order variance and j respectively the high order variance represents the covariance caused by multiple parameters the first order sensitivity index si is the ratio of the total variance of the model output caused by a single parameter which can be calculated from the following formula 5 s i v i v the oscillation method was used to sample the parameter value spaces to cover the whole range of parameters as far as possible then the unique frequency ω i was distributed to an individual parameter i the searching function of the parameter group was derived from saltelli et al 1999 6 x i s 1 2 1 π arcsin sin ω i s where x i represents the value of parameter i and ω i represents the angular frequency of a concussion s is a mathematical parameter and represents the search curve the output of the oscillated model can be obtained after obtaining the fourier parameter set the variation can be simultaneously divided into the contributions of different frequencies they are the corresponding parameters using the fast method the sensitive parameters were found and compared at different temporal and spatial scales 2 5 the selection and description of a typical model in this study the swat which was developed by the united states department of agriculture agriculture research service usda ars was selected as the target tool the detailed information about the swat model can be found in the references arnold et al 1998 usda scs 1972 williams 1969 chen et al 2018a b kliment et al 2008 the amount of dissolved p transported to the main stream can be divided into two sections dissolved p attached to soil particles and to sediment they are calculated using the following eqs 7 and 8 respectively 7 p surf p solutionsurf q surf ρ d e p t h surf k d s u r f where p surf is the amount of dissolved p transported to the main stream in surface runoff kg p ha p solutionsurf is the amount of dissolved p in the top 10 mm of soil kg p metric ton soil q surf is the surface runoff generated on a given day mm ρ is the soil density of the top 10 mm of soil mg m3 dept h surf is the depth of soil mm and k d s u r f is the soil separation coefficient m3 mg 8 sed p surf 0 001 c o n c sedp q sed a hru ε p s e d where sed p surf is the amount of dissolved p attached to sediment kg p ha con c sedp is the concentration of dissolved p in the top 10 mm of soil attached to sediment kg p metric ton soil q sed is the sediment yield on a given day metric ton a hur is the area of hru ha and ε p s e d is the phosphorous enrichment ratio the semi automated method sufi2 of swat cup was used to calibrate the swat model abbaspour et al 2007a b calibration and sensitivity analyses were carried out and the sensitive parameters related to the runoff sediment and tp simulation were obtained and are shown in table 1 3 case study 3 1 study area description in this study the daning watershed which is located in the three gorges reservoir region tgrr of china fig 3 was chosen as the study area the upstream drainage area of the wuxi monitoring section 108 44 110 11 e 31 04 31 44 n was selected covering a total drainage area of 2422 km2 mountains and low hills account for more than 95 and less than 5 of the total area of the watershed respectively the mean annual temperature and precipitation were approximately 18 c and 1120 mm respectively while the rainy season april to october accounted for 90 of the yearly precipitation shen et al 2014 the measured daily flow and sediment were obtained from the changjiang water resources committee china while the monthly water quality data were obtained from the wuxi county environmental protection bureau the daily rainfall data from 2000 to 2015 were obtained from the meteorological bureau of wuxi county and the china national meteorological administration the dem data were obtained by the digitalization of raw data provided by the national fundamental geographic information center of china the land use map with a resolution of 1 100 000 and the soil type map with a resolution of 1 50 000 were obtained from the resources and environment science data center of the chinese sciences academy and the agricultural science committee of wuxi city moreover the soil physical properties which include soil density soil hydraulic conductivity field capacity and soil initial p content were obtained from the institute of soil science in nanjing china in this study the periods of 2000 2008 and 2009 2015 were selected as the calibration and validation periods respectively model calibration was performed at both daily and monthly scales while the monthly observed sediment and flow data were the average value of daily observations for the daily scale the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse values were quantified as 0 54 2000 2008 and 0 50 2009 2015 in the calibration and validation periods respectively while the nse values related to the flow simulation at the monthly step were 0 64 2000 2008 and 0 77 2009 2015 respectively fig 4 a d for sediment modelling the nse values for daily and monthly sediment were 0 35 and 0 39 fig 4e and f respectively the model performance at daily scales was slightly worse than those at monthly scales which was consistent with the results of previous studies the reason for this result was because the amount of data to be fitted increases with the decrease of time scale thus greater errors of the recession calculation might be obtained in the calibration and validation periods yang et al 2008 the nse values for the monthly tp during the calibration and validation periods were 0 52 2000 2008 and 0 59 2009 2015 respectively fig 4g and h compared to previous studies malagó et al 2017 the hydrological and nps simulation could be judged as satisfactory and acceptable respectively and the calibrated model at the daily scale could be used for the following analysis 3 2 temporal and spatial scaling effects of parameter sensitivity based on the sa results the target parameters shown in table 1 were selected to study the temporal and spatial scale effect of parameter sensitivity 3 2 1 temporal scaling effect of parameter sensitivity to elucidate the temporal scaling effect the window sizes were set at 10 30 90 and 300 days to obtain the sensitivity indices and evaluate the parameter sensitivity at the daily monthly seasonal and annual scales respectively the parameter sensitivity indices of the selected parameters for runoff sediment and tp output under different evaluation timescales are shown in figs 5 7 specifically the minimum value of the first order sensitivity index was close to 0 while the maximum value was close to 0 8 colour bars in figs 5 7 the value of approximately 0 8 indicates that approximately 80 of the observed variance of the model outputs can be explained by this parameter as shown in fig 5 for hydrological modelling alpha bf showed high sensitivity under different temporal scales throughout the entire simulation period with the sensitivity indices ranging from 0 1 to 0 8 the reason for this result was that the study region is dominated by mountains thus the correlation between groundwater and surface runoff was high zhai et al 2014 ch k and ch n showed certain sensitivity under the daily and monthly scales during the rainy season but they displayed little sensitivity during the dry season the reason was that swat model uses the tributary input path to calculate the transmission loss of the runoff into the main channel and ch k is the parameter to control the amount of transmission loss from surface runoff xie et al 2017 however with the further increasing temporal scale these two parameters presented sensitivity throughout the entire simulation period sol k and sol bd showed sensitivity during the rainy season but they were not sensitive during the dry season and the sensitivity index decreased with the increasing temporal scale which was opposite from ch k and ch n ch k and ch n were parameters that directly affected the runoff simulation and their sensitivity indexes were 0 07 0 05 and 0 34 0 21 respectively and were higher than those of sol k and sol bd indicating that these two parameters were more sensitive if the computation interval was set from the monthly to the seasonal scale this result was consistent with previous studies showing that channel geographic features had a great influence on runoff prediction over longer i e seasonal scales the reason for this result was that precipitation would cause seasonal erosion of the channel which would further affect the generation of runoff our results also showed that the soil factor mainly had sensitivity on a daily scale indicating that soil properties would affect the runoff process on a small temporal scale griensven et al 2006 for sediment modelling high sensitivity was observed in usle k usle p ch n and spcon fig 6 the parameters of ch n had high sensitivity with the sensitivity indices being 0 18 0 07 and 0 21 0 04 under the seasonal and annual scales respectively indicating that the channel characteristic parameters would control sediment routing for example spcon is the linear parameter used to calculate the maximum sediment load which was also related to the maximum velocity of the channel thus spcon would show greater sensitivity to sediment simulation during the rainy season at a large temporal scale abbaspour et al 2007a b at the daily and monthly scales the main sensitive parameters affecting the sediment output were usle k usle p and ch n the hydrological cycle which is both the driving force for the generation and the carrier of the sediment was influenced by the physical and chemical properties of the soil at small temporal scales while the channel and groundwater cycle became the main influencing factors at large temporal scales this result could be explained by the lag time between the land process and river response as well as the different concentration times of the direct runoff and groundwater therefore soil property parameters for small timescale simulations and parameters related to channel features for large timescale simulations should be focused on in the prediction of sediment loads as shown in fig 7 the sensitivity parameters in nps tp modelling contained erorgp usle k usle p sol bd and ch k which were slightly different from those of the runoff and sediment simulations at the annual scale erorgp usle k usle p and ch k showed higher sensitivity ch k had a direct influence on the runoff process simulation and the runoff gathering process would cause soluble p to dissolve in water and be transported with runoff erorgp represents the enrichment ratio of organic phosphorus in sediment transport which showed the effect of sediment was most significant in the process of tp transport at the annual scale as sediment was mainly transported by runoff reusser et al 2011 both usle k and usle p are the key parameters in the universal soil loss equation usle used to calculate the soil erosion amount thus the amount of adsorbed p changed with the changing amount of eroded sediment tang et al 2015 the inter annual heterogeneity of sediment output led to a varying tp output on the annual scale these parameters also showed certain sensitivity values at the seasonal scale and the sensitivity indices varied in different periods of the year at the daily and monthly scales the sensitivity parameters had relatively lower sensitivity indices which were consistent with those of the hydrologic and sediment simulations the erorgp parameter had a significant effect on the nps pollution and the hydrological parameters of the model also showed sensitivity in the nps pollution simulation in general the parameters related to soil physical and chemical properties were more sensitive to the model simulations under the daily and monthly scales however as the simulation scale increased the channel characteristic parameters viz ch k with a first order sensitivity index of 0 34 0 21 and ch n with a first order sensitivity index of 0 21 0 04 became the main sensitive parameters affecting the nps simulation 3 2 2 spatial scaling effect of parameter sensitivity using the d8 algorithm the watershed was divided into 22 sub basins by setting the threshold value of the catchment area as 50 km2 fig 8 based on the nested watershed idea jarvis 1976 eight river sections were selected from upstream to downstream reaches and the drainage area was divided into eight levels according to the decreasing nesting relation of the tributary as shown in fig 9 the outlets of sub basins nos 1 4 5 6 9 13 20 and 22 were numbered as grade 1 66 km2 grade 2 349 km2 grade 3 778 km2 grade 4 825 km2 grade 5 1485 km2 grade 6 2013 km2 grade 7 2378 km2 and grade 8 2422 km2 basins respectively the spatial scaling effects will be quantified on the basis of the above watershed classification the first order sensitivity indices of parameters at different spatial scales are shown in figs 10 and 11 as shown in fig 10a for hydrologic modelling the main sensitivity parameters were sol bd sol k ch k ch n and alpha bf which were relatively stable across all spatial scales the spatial scaling effect of two soil parameters in terms of sol k and sol bd on runoff simulation was obvious from 66 km2 to 825 km2 and the first order sensitivity of these two parameters decreased with the increase in the spatial scale this result showed that due to the regional variability of the physical and chemical properties the impact of key soil properties on runoff simulation decreased with the increasing spatial scale the first order sensitivity indices of ch k and alpha bf increased with the increasing spatial scale while the values were obviously higher from 1485 km2 to 2422 km2 than those from 66 km2 to 825 km2 due to the mountainous characteristics the hydraulic relationship between the groundwater and surface runoff could not be neglected in the runoff simulation shen et al 2008 these results also showed differences in hydrological balance processes at different spatial scales the sensitivity parameters were similar from 825 to 2422 km2 indicating specific similarity of the runoff process at these scales soil properties such as hydraulic conductivity and wet bulk density affect the hydrological balance process at small spatial scales while the channel features and factors affecting the groundwater component play more important roles at large spatial scales woldesenbet et al 2017 for sediment modelling fig 10b little difference could be observed in parameter sensitivity between different spatial scales while the sensitivity parameters affecting sediment simulation were ch n usle k and usle p as shown in fig 10c the variation of first order sensitivity indices was basically the same for the tp simulation and the key sensitive parameters were erorgp usle p usle k sol bd and ch k which were slightly different from those of the runoff simulation the first order sensitivity index of sol bd was as high as 0 3 at the spatial scale of 66 km2 which indicated that soil physical conditions have a certain effect on the nps simulation in those headstream watersheds the effects of sol bd on the nps simulation decreased at spatial scales from 349 km2 to 1485 km2 and then strengthened from 2013 km2 to 2422 km2 the usle p and usle k were identified as sensitivity parameters because they affected both the sediment and the nps tp simulations shen et al 2008 zhai et al 2014 the first order sensitivity index of ch k which was also sensitive to the runoff simulation increased with the increasing spatial scale as runoff is the driving force of pollutant migration erorgp was a specific sensitivity parameter that affected nps pollution simulation only due to its intent related to the pollutant calculation the spatial variation of the sensitivity parameters for runoff sediment and tp simulations at the annual scale is shown in fig 11 in general alpha bf ch k ch n and sol k were all identified as key parameters affecting the hydrological simulation at all spatial scales but their first order sensitivity indices were completely different fig 11a for example sol bd and sol k showed sensitivity in a specific time period at the spatial scale of 66 km2 but the two parameters did not show sensitivity from 349 to 2422 km2 this result indicated that the soil moisture conditions are key factors that influence the runoff generation of the headstream watershed as the spatial scales increased from 349 to 2422 km2 alpha bf ch k and ch n were identified as the sensitivity parameters and they showed high first order sensitivity indices throughout the study period the indices of alpha bf ch k and ch n were in the following descending order ch k alpha bf ch n indicating that the channel characteristics and groundwater had greater impacts on the flow simulation at different spatial scales the sensitivity parameters that affected the sediment simulation were identified as ch n at all spatial scales fig 11b which was consistent with the results of previous studies abbaspour et al 2007a b shen et al 2008 as one of the important parameters for hydrological simulation ch n would further affect the soil erosion and sediment simulations spcon which is the linear parameter for calculating the maximum sediment load in the model also showed certain sensitivity but the first order sensitivity index was relatively lower unlike hydrological and sediment modelling the parameters affecting the tp simulation were erorgp usle k and usle p fig 11c and the first order sensitivity indices of these three parameters were higher at the spatial scale of 66 km2 the sensitivity of ch k gradually increased when the spatial scale increased above 349 km2 and the ch k showed increasing impacts on tp outputs throughout the simulation period above a spatial scale of 778 km2 runoff is the driving force of sediment and pollutants and the dissolved p attached to sediment is also one of the sources of nps tp output therefore the parameters sensitive to sediment and hydrology simulation would indirectly influence the nps tp output in this study area usle k usle p and ch k were identified as the key parameters that influenced the sediment and runoff directly thus they were also key parameters for the prediction of tp griensven et al 2006 hong and purucker 2018 in addition to the parameters that were sensitive to sediment and hydrology specific parameters such as erorgp also influenced the nps p yield because this parameter controlled the p transport with sediment 4 conclusion and implications in this study the scaling effects of sensitive parameters were explored using the sliding window and the nested watershed idea in a typical watershed in the three gorges reservoir region china the results showed that channel related parameters in terms of alpha bf ch k and ch n showed greater sensitivity at larger spatial and temporal scales while soil properties such as sol k and sol bd were identified as key parameters at smaller scales specifically ch k showed sensitivity to tp output only above a spatial scale of 778 km2 different from hydrological simulation the ch n usle k usle p and erorgp were further identified as key sensitive parameters for the sediment and nps tp simulations sensitivity parameters need to be re recognized due to the differences in watershed characteristics as well as natural conditions it should also be noted that this integrated framework of the sa method could be a reference for studying the scale effect of parameter sensitivity and provide important information for the construction of the swat model in future studies the regional patterns of model parameters and the scale effect of parameter sensitivity may hence be worthwhile to analysis similarity more evaluation indicators should be studied to reduce the deviation of parameter sensitivity calculation with the results presented the sensitivity parameters had obvious spatial temporal scaling effects and the most sensitive parameters depended on the spatial temporal and event driven conditions at smaller spatial and temporal scales the parameters related to soil properties and the simulation objects themselves would show high sensitivity with increasing temporal scale the sensitivity of parameters related to channel characteristics increased gradually while the influence of parameters related to soil properties gradually weakened based on these results it was ensured that if the key parameters were accurately determined other parameters could be fixed to a predetermined value to reduce the simulation uncertainty moreover sa is not only a useful tool for model calibration but also helps to identify the key processes of the watershed human activities and lucc which have great impacts on soil properties would affect the generation and movement of nps pollutants thus the management of nps pollution could be achieved by changing soil properties and agricultural planting conditions in small scale headstream watersheds while the control of nps pollution in large scale watersheds could be performed by improving channel conditions as well as optimizing land use allocation declaration of interest statement the authors declare

6631,scale represents an important concept in all scientific disciplines but the scaling effect related to non point source nps pollution simulation and sensitivity parameters has not yet been reported in this study the sliding window the fourier amplitude sensitivity test and the nested watershed idea were used with the soil and water assessment tool swat model to explore the temporal and spatial scaling effects of parameter sensitivity in a typical watershed of the three gorges reservoir region china the results indicated that a great scaling effect could be observed at varying spatio temporal scales while the scaling effect would be transferred and amplified from the hydrological modelling to the nps simulation soil properties such as sol k and sol bd were identified as key

as ch n usle k usle p and erorgp were always identified as key sensitive parameters for the sediment and nps tp simulations but some parameters such as ch k showed sensitivity only above a specific

scaling effect indicates the impacts of the changing scales on the research results or the possibility that the research results obtained at specific scales could be extended to other scales as

2008 lian et al 2007 reshmidevi et al 2018 however it should be noted that the simulation results and multiple parameters of these physical based models are scale variable or scale dependent barrios and francés 2012 chen et al 2018a b huang et al 2017 2010 merz et al 2009 versini et al 2015 sensitivity analysis sa represents an indispensable step in the construction and application of hydrological models especially for complex dhms sdhms herman et al 2013 and it improves the efficiency of model calibration and increases the reliability of model application kannan et al 2007 razavi and gupta 2016 saltelli et al 2004 zadeh et al 2017 to date sa methods can be divided into local sensitivity analysis lsa and global sensitivity analysis gsa mousivand et al 2014 saltelli et al 2000 typical lsa methods such as the one variable at a time oat and the differential analysis da method helton and davis 2003 are less reliable because they cannot fully find optimal parameters and ignore the interaction between multiple parameters helton 1993 as a good substitute for lsa gsa methods including regression analysis ra morris screening sobol s methods fourier amplitude sensitivity test fast and regional sensitivity analysis rsa have been developed bilotta et al 2012 gamerith et al 2013 norton 2015 olaya abril et al 2017 wang et al 2013 these methods consider the interaction between different parameters by changing multiple model parameters simultaneously cibin et al 2010 however the parameter sensitivity of hydrological models is also scale dependent because several different processes occur at multiple scales for hydrological studies spatial scales could be divided into experimental slope catchment watershed intercontinental and global scales while temporal scales could be represented using hourly daily monthly and annual intervals ongley et al 2010 the traditional application of sa is based on the aggregation of model residuals across the whole time series and leads to a constant parameter sensitivity but the parameter sensitivity may be time variant due to the temporal variation of the watershed processes instead the sliding windows approach considers parameter recognition as a function of the simulation time interval and has been used to represent the temporal variability of parameter sensitivity wagener et al 2003 several studies have used this approach to analyse the temporal performance of hydrological models guse et al 2014 pianosi and wagener 2016 meanwhile the time varying and multi timescale tvmt method was proposed to remedy the deficiency of the previous sliding window approaches such as fixing window sizes massmann et al 2014 has used this method to explore the time varying sensitive parameters across temporal scales however the spatial scaling effect of parameter sensitivity is poorly understood and as far as we know the scaling effect in relation to nps simulation remains poorly reported in this paper the scaling effect of parameter sensitivity was explored by conducting the following tasks 1 an integrated analytical method was proposed for studying the scaling effect of parameter sensitivity 2 the sensitive parameters of a typical watershed model were identified and compared at multiple temporal and spatial scales and 3 suggestions were given for model construction and nps pollution management this proposed method was tested in the daning river watershed which is a typical watershed located in the three gorges reservoir region tgrr of china 2 methodology an integrated analytical method shown in fig 1 is proposed for evaluating the scaling effect of parameter sensitivity first detailed basic data were collected at a fine scale and compiled with the model inputs and the hydrological model was calibrated using these inputs second the sliding window and nested watershed idea were used in combination with the watershed model to find different sensitive parameter sets at varying temporal and spatial scales third high sensitivity parameter sets were obtained using an advanced gsa method finally the scaling effects of parameter sensitivity were quantified for the h nps simulation by comparative analysis 2 1 generating data series at finer scales generally the model represents a mathematical expression that abstracts practical environments and represents a tool for simulating all hydrological processes within a watershed a typical modelling cycle consists of the following parts input data model parameter and structure and model output to study scale issues attribute and spatial input data should be collected at finer temporal scales then simulation results were derived from a series of empirical mathematical or physical equations and parameters this process can be generalized by the following schematic diagram where x 1 x 2 x n are the input data needed for model establishment i e attribute data such as observed flow and water quality data as well as spatial data such as digital elevation model dem y is the simulated results of the model 2 2 generating data series at different temporal scales using the tvmt method next the ranges and distributions of the model parameters are set which is very important for the following sa the ranges of parameters could be considered according to the model s manual or the results of local investigations meanwhile if specific prior information is lacking the parameter ranges could be defined to follow uniform normal log normal or other classic distributions for an effective search different parameter sets could be obtained using random sampling e g the monte carlo method based on the default parameter range and the related distribution set to 20 000 times to produce stable first order sensitivity indices werkhoven et al 2008 then the models with different parameter sets were run and calibrated at a fine time step and the sensitivity of the model performance metric was calculated by associating the sensitivity indices rosolem et al 2013 xie et al 2017 the root mean squared error rmse was chosen to evaluate the model performance because it is widely used to characterize the variance between the simulated and observed values specifically the rmse was adjusted as a scale dependent term by incorporating the sliding window approach as shown in eq 1 then the rmse was combined with the fast method cukier et al 1973 reusser et al 2011 to calculate the first sensitivity index of each parameter 1 rms e t w 1 w 1 i t 1 2 w i t 1 2 w s i obs s i sim 2 where w is the size of the sliding window and t is the time step for the temporal sa this is the section where it is important to show the temporal period with the window size w i represents the time step along the temporal period and the range is t w 2 to t w 2 s i obs represents the observed value of flow sediment or total phosphorus tp on day i and s i sim represents the simulated value of flow sediment or tp on day i the first order sensitivity indices can then be calculated under the combination of the proposed goodness of fit rmse and the moving window size finally the scaling temporal effects of parameter sensitivity can be obtained 2 3 generating data series at varying spatial scales using nested watershed idea based on geographic theory a watershed can be divided into a distinct stream network and a corresponding number of sub watersheds while the stream reaches can be outlined by the landscape cross section channel relief and the surrounding terrain thus a watershed can be divided as river tributaries while a nested relationship can be identified from upstream and downstream tributaries during this step the river network was extracted based on the dem and the flow direction was calculated as an indispensable part of the river network extraction jiang et al 2013 the d8 algorithm was used because of its operability and adaptability to terrain the basic idea is to traverse the dem after filling the depression using a moving 3 3 window from the upper left corner of the input image then the distance weighted drop p is calculated between the centre pixel and the eight adjacent grid elements finally the cell with max p was selected and the k value and the flow direction of the centre pixel dir were determined liu et al 2008 2 p h i h k h i h k 2 k 1 3 5 7 k 2 4 6 8 3 dir 2 k 1 where i j is the central pixel location hi represents its elevation value and hk indicates the elevation value of its neighbourhood grid k starts in the east and takes the value of 1 8 in the clockwise direction the dem elevation and flow value of one of the arithmetic windows are shown in fig 2 using the d8 algorithm the runoff on the surface grid was calculated with respect to the lowest elevation of the eight adjacent grids to the central grid then the grid to the solid line was connected as the river network according to the principle that the flow of water always flows to the lowlands after several drainage areas were identified based on the nested watershed idea the model could be run at different spatial scales and sensitive parameters were identified at different spatial scales then the spatial scaling effects could be quantified by identifying the sensitive parameters from the perspective of the nested watershed idea 2 4 using the gsa method to identify sensitive parameters to quantify the sensitive parameters the fast cukier et al 1973 reusser et al 2011 method was used as a typical gsa method the fast method is able to estimate parameter sensitivities for nonlinear complex models the fast method can be regarded as a variance decomposition method which decomposes the total variance of the model outputs into the variance contributions due to variations of single factors i e parameters and inputs it can be described as follows 4 v i n v i i n j i 1 n v ij i n j i 1 n k j 1 n v ijk v 12 n in eq 4 v indicates the total variance of the model outputs i j and k represent the parameters to be considered and n is the number of parameters vi and vij denote the variance that can be explained by parameter i first order variance and the variance that can be explained by parameter i second order variance and j respectively the high order variance represents the covariance caused by multiple parameters the first order sensitivity index si is the ratio of the total variance of the model output caused by a single parameter which can be calculated from the following formula 5 s i v i v the oscillation method was used to sample the parameter value spaces to cover the whole range of parameters as far as possible then the unique frequency ω i was distributed to an individual parameter i the searching function of the parameter group was derived from saltelli et al 1999 6 x i s 1 2 1 π arcsin sin ω i s where x i represents the value of parameter i and ω i represents the angular frequency of a concussion s is a mathematical parameter and represents the search curve the output of the oscillated model can be obtained after obtaining the fourier parameter set the variation can be simultaneously divided into the contributions of different frequencies they are the corresponding parameters using the fast method the sensitive parameters were found and compared at different temporal and spatial scales 2 5 the selection and description of a typical model in this study the swat which was developed by the united states department of agriculture agriculture research service usda ars was selected as the target tool the detailed information about the swat model can be found in the references arnold et al 1998 usda scs 1972 williams 1969 chen et al 2018a b kliment et al 2008 the amount of dissolved p transported to the main stream can be divided into two sections dissolved p attached to soil particles and to sediment they are calculated using the following eqs 7 and 8 respectively 7 p surf p solutionsurf q surf ρ d e p t h surf k d s u r f where p surf is the amount of dissolved p transported to the main stream in surface runoff kg p ha p solutionsurf is the amount of dissolved p in the top 10 mm of soil kg p metric ton soil q surf is the surface runoff generated on a given day mm ρ is the soil density of the top 10 mm of soil mg m3 dept h surf is the depth of soil mm and k d s u r f is the soil separation coefficient m3 mg 8 sed p surf 0 001 c o n c sedp q sed a hru ε p s e d where sed p surf is the amount of dissolved p attached to sediment kg p ha con c sedp is the concentration of dissolved p in the top 10 mm of soil attached to sediment kg p metric ton soil q sed is the sediment yield on a given day metric ton a hur is the area of hru ha and ε p s e d is the phosphorous enrichment ratio the semi automated method sufi2 of swat cup was used to calibrate the swat model abbaspour et al 2007a b calibration and sensitivity analyses were carried out and the sensitive parameters related to the runoff sediment and tp simulation were obtained and are shown in table 1 3 case study 3 1 study area description in this study the daning watershed which is located in the three gorges reservoir region tgrr of china fig 3 was chosen as the study area the upstream drainage area of the wuxi monitoring section 108 44 110 11 e 31 04 31 44 n was selected covering a total drainage area of 2422 km2 mountains and low hills account for more than 95 and less than 5 of the total area of the watershed respectively the mean annual temperature and precipitation were approximately 18 c and 1120 mm respectively while the rainy season april to october accounted for 90 of the yearly precipitation shen et al 2014 the measured daily flow and sediment were obtained from the changjiang water resources committee china while the monthly water quality data were obtained from the wuxi county environmental protection bureau the daily rainfall data from 2000 to 2015 were obtained from the meteorological bureau of wuxi county and the china national meteorological administration the dem data were obtained by the digitalization of raw data provided by the national fundamental geographic information center of china the land use map with a resolution of 1 100 000 and the soil type map with a resolution of 1 50 000 were obtained from the resources and environment science data center of the chinese sciences academy and the agricultural science committee of wuxi city moreover the soil physical properties which include soil density soil hydraulic conductivity field capacity and soil initial p content were obtained from the institute of soil science in nanjing china in this study the periods of 2000 2008 and 2009 2015 were selected as the calibration and validation periods respectively model calibration was performed at both daily and monthly scales while the monthly observed sediment and flow data were the average value of daily observations for the daily scale the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse values were quantified as 0 54 2000 2008 and 0 50 2009 2015 in the calibration and validation periods respectively while the nse values related to the flow simulation at the monthly step were 0 64 2000 2008 and 0 77 2009 2015 respectively fig 4 a d for sediment modelling the nse values for daily and monthly sediment were 0 35 and 0 39 fig 4e and f respectively the model performance at daily scales was slightly worse than those at monthly scales which was consistent with the results of previous studies the reason for this result was because the amount of data to be fitted increases with the decrease of time scale thus greater errors of the recession calculation might be obtained in the calibration and validation periods yang et al 2008 the nse values for the monthly tp during the calibration and validation periods were 0 52 2000 2008 and 0 59 2009 2015 respectively fig 4g and h compared to previous studies malagó et al 2017 the hydrological and nps simulation could be judged as satisfactory and acceptable respectively and the calibrated model at the daily scale could be used for the following analysis 3 2 temporal and spatial scaling effects of parameter sensitivity based on the sa results the target parameters shown in table 1 were selected to study the temporal and spatial scale effect of parameter sensitivity 3 2 1 temporal scaling effect of parameter sensitivity to elucidate the temporal scaling effect the window sizes were set at 10 30 90 and 300 days to obtain the sensitivity indices and evaluate the parameter sensitivity at the daily monthly seasonal and annual scales respectively the parameter sensitivity indices of the selected parameters for runoff sediment and tp output under different evaluation timescales are shown in figs 5 7 specifically the minimum value of the first order sensitivity index was close to 0 while the maximum value was close to 0 8 colour bars in figs 5 7 the value of approximately 0 8 indicates that approximately 80 of the observed variance of the model outputs can be explained by this parameter as shown in fig 5 for hydrological modelling alpha bf showed high sensitivity under different temporal scales throughout the entire simulation period with the sensitivity indices ranging from 0 1 to 0 8 the reason for this result was that the study region is dominated by mountains thus the correlation between groundwater and surface runoff was high zhai et al 2014 ch k and ch n showed certain sensitivity under the daily and monthly scales during the rainy season but they displayed little sensitivity during the dry season the reason was that swat model uses the tributary input path to calculate the transmission loss of the runoff into the main channel and ch k is the parameter to control the amount of transmission loss from surface runoff xie et al 2017 however with the further increasing temporal scale these two parameters presented sensitivity throughout the entire simulation period sol k and sol bd showed sensitivity during the rainy season but they were not sensitive during the dry season and the sensitivity index decreased with the increasing temporal scale which was opposite from ch k and ch n ch k and ch n were parameters that directly affected the runoff simulation and their sensitivity indexes were 0 07 0 05 and 0 34 0 21 respectively and were higher than those of sol k and sol bd indicating that these two parameters were more sensitive if the computation interval was set from the monthly to the seasonal scale this result was consistent with previous studies showing that channel geographic features had a great influence on runoff prediction over longer i e seasonal scales the reason for this result was that precipitation would cause seasonal erosion of the channel which would further affect the generation of runoff our results also showed that the soil factor mainly had sensitivity on a daily scale indicating that soil properties would affect the runoff process on a small temporal scale griensven et al 2006 for sediment modelling high sensitivity was observed in usle k usle p ch n and spcon fig 6 the parameters of ch n had high sensitivity with the sensitivity indices being 0 18 0 07 and 0 21 0 04 under the seasonal and annual scales respectively indicating that the channel characteristic parameters would control sediment routing for example spcon is the linear parameter used to calculate the maximum sediment load which was also related to the maximum velocity of the channel thus spcon would show greater sensitivity to sediment simulation during the rainy season at a large temporal scale abbaspour et al 2007a b at the daily and monthly scales the main sensitive parameters affecting the sediment output were usle k usle p and ch n the hydrological cycle which is both the driving force for the generation and the carrier of the sediment was influenced by the physical and chemical properties of the soil at small temporal scales while the channel and groundwater cycle became the main influencing factors at large temporal scales this result could be explained by the lag time between the land process and river response as well as the different concentration times of the direct runoff and groundwater therefore soil property parameters for small timescale simulations and parameters related to channel features for large timescale simulations should be focused on in the prediction of sediment loads as shown in fig 7 the sensitivity parameters in nps tp modelling contained erorgp usle k usle p sol bd and ch k which were slightly different from those of the runoff and sediment simulations at the annual scale erorgp usle k usle p and ch k showed higher sensitivity ch k had a direct influence on the runoff process simulation and the runoff gathering process would cause soluble p to dissolve in water and be transported with runoff erorgp represents the enrichment ratio of organic phosphorus in sediment transport which showed the effect of sediment was most significant in the process of tp transport at the annual scale as sediment was mainly transported by runoff reusser et al 2011 both usle k and usle p are the key parameters in the universal soil loss equation usle used to calculate the soil erosion amount thus the amount of adsorbed p changed with the changing amount of eroded sediment tang et al 2015 the inter annual heterogeneity of sediment output led to a varying tp output on the annual scale these parameters also showed certain sensitivity values at the seasonal scale and the sensitivity indices varied in different periods of the year at the daily and monthly scales the sensitivity parameters had relatively lower sensitivity indices which were consistent with those of the hydrologic and sediment simulations the erorgp parameter had a significant effect on the nps pollution and the hydrological parameters of the model also showed sensitivity in the nps pollution simulation in general the parameters related to soil physical and chemical properties were more sensitive to the model simulations under the daily and monthly scales however as the simulation scale increased the channel characteristic parameters viz ch k with a first order sensitivity index of 0 34 0 21 and ch n with a first order sensitivity index of 0 21 0 04 became the main sensitive parameters affecting the nps simulation 3 2 2 spatial scaling effect of parameter sensitivity using the d8 algorithm the watershed was divided into 22 sub basins by setting the threshold value of the catchment area as 50 km2 fig 8 based on the nested watershed idea jarvis 1976 eight river sections were selected from upstream to downstream reaches and the drainage area was divided into eight levels according to the decreasing nesting relation of the tributary as shown in fig 9 the outlets of sub basins nos 1 4 5 6 9 13 20 and 22 were numbered as grade 1 66 km2 grade 2 349 km2 grade 3 778 km2 grade 4 825 km2 grade 5 1485 km2 grade 6 2013 km2 grade 7 2378 km2 and grade 8 2422 km2 basins respectively the spatial scaling effects will be quantified on the basis of the above watershed classification the first order sensitivity indices of parameters at different spatial scales are shown in figs 10 and 11 as shown in fig 10a for hydrologic modelling the main sensitivity parameters were sol bd sol k ch k ch n and alpha bf which were relatively stable across all spatial scales the spatial scaling effect of two soil parameters in terms of sol k and sol bd on runoff simulation was obvious from 66 km2 to 825 km2 and the first order sensitivity of these two parameters decreased with the increase in the spatial scale this result showed that due to the regional variability of the physical and chemical properties the impact of key soil properties on runoff simulation decreased with the increasing spatial scale the first order sensitivity indices of ch k and alpha bf increased with the increasing spatial scale while the values were obviously higher from 1485 km2 to 2422 km2 than those from 66 km2 to 825 km2 due to the mountainous characteristics the hydraulic relationship between the groundwater and surface runoff could not be neglected in the runoff simulation shen et al 2008 these results also showed differences in hydrological balance processes at different spatial scales the sensitivity parameters were similar from 825 to 2422 km2 indicating specific similarity of the runoff process at these scales soil properties such as hydraulic conductivity and wet bulk density affect the hydrological balance process at small spatial scales while the channel features and factors affecting the groundwater component play more important roles at large spatial scales woldesenbet et al 2017 for sediment modelling fig 10b little difference could be observed in parameter sensitivity between different spatial scales while the sensitivity parameters affecting sediment simulation were ch n usle k and usle p as shown in fig 10c the variation of first order sensitivity indices was basically the same for the tp simulation and the key sensitive parameters were erorgp usle p usle k sol bd and ch k which were slightly different from those of the runoff simulation the first order sensitivity index of sol bd was as high as 0 3 at the spatial scale of 66 km2 which indicated that soil physical conditions have a certain effect on the nps simulation in those headstream watersheds the effects of sol bd on the nps simulation decreased at spatial scales from 349 km2 to 1485 km2 and then strengthened from 2013 km2 to 2422 km2 the usle p and usle k were identified as sensitivity parameters because they affected both the sediment and the nps tp simulations shen et al 2008 zhai et al 2014 the first order sensitivity index of ch k which was also sensitive to the runoff simulation increased with the increasing spatial scale as runoff is the driving force of pollutant migration erorgp was a specific sensitivity parameter that affected nps pollution simulation only due to its intent related to the pollutant calculation the spatial variation of the sensitivity parameters for runoff sediment and tp simulations at the annual scale is shown in fig 11 in general alpha bf ch k ch n and sol k were all identified as key parameters affecting the hydrological simulation at all spatial scales but their first order sensitivity indices were completely different fig 11a for example sol bd and sol k showed sensitivity in a specific time period at the spatial scale of 66 km2 but the two parameters did not show sensitivity from 349 to 2422 km2 this result indicated that the soil moisture conditions are key factors that influence the runoff generation of the headstream watershed as the spatial scales increased from 349 to 2422 km2 alpha bf ch k and ch n were identified as the sensitivity parameters and they showed high first order sensitivity indices throughout the study period the indices of alpha bf ch k and ch n were in the following descending order ch k alpha bf ch n indicating that the channel characteristics and groundwater had greater impacts on the flow simulation at different spatial scales the sensitivity parameters that affected the sediment simulation were identified as ch n at all spatial scales fig 11b which was consistent with the results of previous studies abbaspour et al 2007a b shen et al 2008 as one of the important parameters for hydrological simulation ch n would further affect the soil erosion and sediment simulations spcon which is the linear parameter for calculating the maximum sediment load in the model also showed certain sensitivity but the first order sensitivity index was relatively lower unlike hydrological and sediment modelling the parameters affecting the tp simulation were erorgp usle k and usle p fig 11c and the first order sensitivity indices of these three parameters were higher at the spatial scale of 66 km2 the sensitivity of ch k gradually increased when the spatial scale increased above 349 km2 and the ch k showed increasing impacts on tp outputs throughout the simulation period above a spatial scale of 778 km2 runoff is the driving force of sediment and pollutants and the dissolved p attached to sediment is also one of the sources of nps tp output therefore the parameters sensitive to sediment and hydrology simulation would indirectly influence the nps tp output in this study area usle k usle p and ch k were identified as the key parameters that influenced the sediment and runoff directly thus they were also key parameters for the prediction of tp griensven et al 2006 hong and purucker 2018 in addition to the parameters that were sensitive to sediment and hydrology specific parameters such as erorgp also influenced the nps p yield because this parameter controlled the p transport with sediment 4 conclusion and implications in this study the scaling effects of sensitive parameters were explored using the sliding window and the nested watershed idea in a typical watershed in the three gorges reservoir region china the results showed that channel related parameters in terms of alpha bf ch k and ch n showed greater sensitivity at larger spatial and temporal scales while soil properties such as sol k and sol bd were identified as key parameters at smaller scales specifically ch k showed sensitivity to tp output only above a spatial scale of 778 km2 different from hydrological simulation the ch n usle k usle p and erorgp were further identified as key sensitive parameters for the sediment and nps tp simulations sensitivity parameters need to be re recognized due to the differences in watershed characteristics as well as natural conditions it should also be noted that this integrated framework of the sa method could be a reference for studying the scale effect of parameter sensitivity and provide important information for the construction of the swat model in future studies the regional patterns of model parameters and the scale effect of parameter sensitivity may hence be worthwhile to analysis similarity more evaluation indicators should be studied to reduce the deviation of parameter sensitivity calculation with the results presented the sensitivity parameters had obvious spatial temporal scaling effects and the most sensitive parameters depended on the spatial temporal and event driven conditions at smaller spatial and temporal scales the parameters related to soil properties and the simulation objects themselves would show high sensitivity with increasing temporal scale the sensitivity of parameters related to channel characteristics increased gradually while the influence of parameters related to soil properties gradually weakened based on these results it was ensured that if the key parameters were accurately determined other parameters could be fixed to a predetermined value to reduce the simulation uncertainty moreover sa is not only a useful tool for model calibration but also helps to identify the key processes of the watershed human activities and lucc which have great impacts on soil properties would affect the generation and movement of nps pollutants thus the management of nps pollution could be achieved by changing soil properties and agricultural planting conditions in small scale headstream watersheds while the control of nps pollution in large scale watersheds could be performed by improving channel conditions as well as optimizing land use allocation declaration of interest statement the authors declare

6632,accurate long term estimates of precipitation at fine spatiotemporal resolution are vital for several applications ranging from hydrometeorology to climatology the availability of a good network of rain gauges and high precipitation variability associated with two annual monsoon systems and complex topography make india a suitable test bed to assess the performance of any satellite based

multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep iii sm2rain climate change initiative sm2rain cci and iv trmm multisatellite precipitation analysis tmpa across india using gauge based observations for the period of 1998 2015 at monthly scale these four multi satellite precipitation products are essentially based on different algorithms and input data sets among these multi satellite precipitation products sm2rain cci is the only product that does not use rain gauge observations for bias adjustment results indicate that chirps and tmpa are comparable to gauge based precipitation estimates at all india and sub regional scales followed by mswep estimates however sm2rain cci largely underestimates precipitation across the country as compared to gauge based observations the systematic error component in sm2rain cci dominates as compared to random error component which suggests the need of a suitable bias correction to sm2rain cci before integrating it in any application the overall results indicate that chirps data set could be used for long term precipitation analyses with rather higher confidence keywords precipitation multi satellite rain gauge soil moisture error decomposition 1 introduction precipitation is one of the most important atmospheric variables of the global energy and water cycle reliable long temporal record of global precipitation at fine spatiotemporal resolution is crucial for a wide range of applications such as for crop modeling hydrometeorology water resources management flood and drought monitoring and climatological applications although ground based rain gauge observations provide accurate measurement of precipitation locally their limited spatial representativeness and inhomogeneous distribution constraint its applicability at global scale kidd et al 2017 alternatively multi satellite precipitation estimates take relative advantages of contemporary constellation of precipitation related infrared and microwave satellite sensors and offer a unique opportunity to study the high spatiotemporal variability of precipitation at global scale kucera et al 2013 adler et al 2017 sun et al 2018 the satellite based precipitation estimation techniques improved substantially after the successful launch of the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm satellite and consequently several multi satellite precipitation products were developed at high spatial and temporal resolutions some of the popular trmm era high resolution multi satellite precipitation products are trmm multisatellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2010 climate prediction center cpc morphing cmorph joyce et al 2011 xie et al 2017 precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann sorooshian et al 2000 nguyen et al 2018 naval research laboratory blended nrl blended turk and miller 2005 and global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap ushio et al 2009 mega et al 2018 however a comprehensive evaluation of these multi satellite precipitation products at distinct spatial and temporal scales is essential for their use in practical applications behrangi et al 2016 gehne et al 2016 maggioni et al 2016 camici et al 2018 india receives substantial precipitation due to two large scale monsoon systems southwest june september and northeast october december monsoons every year which exhibit pronounced spatiotemporal precipitation variability associated with complex topography after the launch of kalpana 1 satellite in 2002 by the indian space research organisation several precipitation retrieval algorithms were developed for precipitation estimation over india and adjoining regions gairola et al 2014 these infrared based precipitation products were successfully utilized for monsoon rainfall monitoring and meteorological drought assessment across india mahesh et al 2014 patel et al 2015 bushair et al 2016 these precipitation retrieval algorithms were also implemented at insat 3d satellite measurements which provide improved precipitation estimates at finer spatial resolution as compared to kalpana 1 estimates mitra et al 2018 singh et al 2018 however infrared only satellite precipitation products underestimate orographic precipitation additionally india has an appreciably good network of rain gauges well spread across the country pai et al 2014 the trmm based multi satellite precipitation products were extensively evaluated across india using gauge based observations and better performance of tmpa product as compared to other trmm era multi satellite precipitation products were reported prakash et al 2014 2015a 2015c 2016b 2018b rana et al 2015 after the launch of the global precipitation measurement gpm core observatory in 2014 an advanced finer resolution multi satellite precipitation product namely integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg huffman et al 2018 has been released this multi satellite precipitation product takes the relative advantages of tmpa cmorph and persiann algorithms a preliminary assessment of this gpm based multi satellite precipitation product showed better performance than tmpa across india prakash et al 2016a 2018a 2018b as expected due to advancement in sensors and algorithm however the temporal record of imerg is limited due to its availability since 2014 trmm based multi satellite precipitation products are available since 1998 which limit their use for climatological applications only two multi satellite global precipitation products global precipitation climatology project gpcp adler et al 2003 and cpc merged analysis of precipitation cmap xie and arkin 1997 have temporal coverage beginning from 1979 however both products have rather coarser spatial 2 5 latitude 2 5 longitude and temporal monthly resolutions to bridge the gap of availability of high resolution global multi satellite precipitation products prior to 1998 the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep beck et al 2017a 2018 and climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps funk et al 2015 products were developed furthermore a new precipitation product sm2rain climate change initiative sm2rain cci ciabatta et al 2018 has been recently released which estimates precipitation directly from surface soil moisture observations for the first time hence it becomes essential to compare these three high resolution precipitation products with tmpa product and gauge based observations for their widest usage and applicability the objective of this study is to assess the performance of latest versions of chirps mswep sm2rain cci and tmpa products across india against gauge based observations even though imerg performs better than tmpa over india imerg is not considered in this study due to its limited temporal record the evaluation is performed at 0 25 spatial resolution and at a monthly scale due to available spatial resolution of gauge based gridded data set and differences in daily precipitation accumulation conventions among these products for the period of 1998 2015 it is to be noted that chirps mswep and tmpa products use gauge observations for bias adjustment whereas sm2rain cci does not incorporate any gauge based bias correction 2 data and methods 2 1 precipitation data sets for the assessment of satellite based precipitation estimates rain gauge derived gridded precipitation product at 0 25 spatial resolution pai et al 2014 has been used as reference this gridded gauge based daily precipitation product is developed by the india meteorological department imd using a reasonably good network of surface rain gauges across india and proven to be optimal for various hydrometeorological and climatological applications fig 1 shows the spatial distribution of imd rain gauges for the month of july 2014 it can be seen that the gauges are well spread across the country except over the northern and northeastern parts the number of reported gauges also varies at daily scale pai et al 2014 the other available gauge based global precipitation data sets use only a fraction of gauge observations across the country due to availability constraint imd uses 2000 3500 rain gauge observations for the preparation of gridded precipitation product for the period of 1998 2015 pai et al 2014 whereas tmpa and other gauge adjusted multi satellite precipitation products use 300 400 gauge observations over india prakash et al 2015d four multi satellite precipitation products namely chirps mswep sm2rain and tmpa for the period of 1998 2015 based on common period of availability of each precipitation data set have been used in this study the chirps is a quasi global 50 s 50 n long term precipitation data set developed by the united states geological survey usgs and climate hazards group chg for trend analysis and seasonal drought monitoring this gridded land only precipitation data set is developed by the synergistic use of satellite infrared cold cloud duration measurements and ground based rain gauge observations funk et al 2015 the latest version 2 0 v2 0 of this precipitation data set is available for 1981 2017 at 0 05 spatial resolution and at daily pentad and monthly time scales the mswep is a global historic precipitation data set available at 0 1 spatial resolution and at three hourly daily and monthly temporal resolutions this precipitation data set utilizes the relative merits of satellite infrared and microwave precipitation estimates rain gauge observations and reanalysis products beck et al 2017a 2018 version 2 1 v2 1 of this precipitation data set is available for 1979 2016 in a recent evaluation of 22 precipitation products at global scale using rain gauges and hydrological modeling mswep product was shown to be one of the best performer beck et al 2017b the sm2rain cci is a global daily precipitation data set available at 0 25 spatial resolution for the period of 1998 2015 ciabatta et al 2018 this precipitation product is developed from the european space agency esa climate change initiative combined active and passive microwave satellite soil moisture product dorigo et al 2017 through sm2rain algorithm sm2rain algorithm is a novel technique to directly estimate precipitation from surface soil moisture measurements through soil water balance equation brocca et al 2014 the tmpa is a quasi global 60 s 60 n precipitation data sets available at 0 25 spatial resolution and at three hourly daily and monthly temporal resolutions this precipitation product is available in near real time and delayed research modes the tmpa research version 7 v7 product used in this study uses satellite infrared and microwave precipitation estimates along with gauge observations over land huffman et al 2010 this precipitation product has been proven to be one of the best trmm era multi satellite precipitation estimates maggioni et al 2016 prakash et al 2018a tmpa precipitation product also showed potential for meteorological drought monitoring across india prakash 2018 2 2 methodology as chirps and mswep precipitation products are available at 0 05 and 0 1 spatial resolutions respectively both data sets have been re sampled at 0 25 spatial resolution similar to reference data for the comparison moreover imd accumulates daily precipitation ending at 0300utc which is quite different from the satellite daily precipitation accumulation convention there is a need of sub daily e g hourly three hourly satellite derived precipitation estimates for a meaningful comparison with the imd gauge based data across india at a daily scale prakash et al 2015a hence the assessment of multi satellite precipitation products was carried out at monthly scale for this purpose daily precipitation products were averaged to a monthly scale five state of the art continuous statistical metrics viz mean bias coefficient of variation cv pearson s correlation coefficient r and root mean square error rmse were computed at each grid across the country for the study period moreover systematic and random error components of the satellite derived precipitation products were assessed through a suitable error decomposition technique aghakouchak et al 2012 prakash et al 2015b a critical determination of these error components is crucial for the product developers and end users these error metrics are defined as 1 r i 1 n g i g s i s i 1 n g i g 2 i 1 n s i s 2 2 bias s o 3 cv i 1 n s i s 2 n s 100 4 rmse i 1 n s i g i 2 n 5 random err i 1 n s i s i

collocated observations the ideal values for bias rmse and error components are 0 and the perfect value of r is 1 in addition the modified kling gupta efficiency kge score was used to assess the performance of satellite derived precipitation data sets kge combines pearson s correlation coefficient bias and variability kling et al 2012 which is defined as 8 kge 1 r 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 9 with β s g a n d γ c v s c v g where β is the bias ratio and γ is the variability ratio the optimum values of kge β and γ are 1 furthermore an empirical cumulative distribution function cdf was also computed from each precipitation product to assess the potential of multi satellite products in estimation of different precipitation ranges the evaluation was performed at all india and sub regional scales as well through domain mean time series analysis and taylor diagram taylor 2001 three major sub regions within the country a west coast 8 n 20 n 72 5 e 77 5 e b central 17 5 n 27 5 n 78 e 88 e and c northeast india 22 n 30 n 90 e 98 e were considered for detailed analysis the west coast and northeast india are complex orographic sub regions whereas central india is rather a plain sub region all error metrics described above were also computed for all india and three sub regions 3 results and discussion fig 2 shows the spatial distributions of 18 year mean precipitation across india derived from monthly gauge based and four multi satellite products the well known precipitation features such as high precipitation areas situated along the west coast northeast and central india are captured realistically by the multi satellite products however there are differences in magnitudes among them the notable precipitation gradients along the west coast are well captured by the chirps and mswep products possibly due to their availability at higher native spatial resolutions sm2rain cci shows wider belts along the west coast getting high precipitation it is to be noted that sm2rain cci does not estimate precipitation over the frozen soil snow covered rainforest and high topographical areas through a static mask ciabatta et al 2018 additionally the daily global coverage is hampered by limited temporal sampling due to the use of active and passive microwave satellite sensors dorigo et al 2017 the gauge based data set shows all india mean precipitation as 3 01 mm day 1 whereas chirps mswep and tmpa overestimates and sm2rain cci underestimates all india mean precipitation values with respect to imd gauge based data fig 3 presents the bias in four multi satellite precipitation products over the country as compared to gauge based observations for the study period larger biases in these four multi satellite precipitation products are evident over the northeast india due to varied orography and complex precipitation processes the sign of bias shows an interesting feature along the west coast a considerable underestimation of precipitation along the windward side of the western ghats e g close to the west coast and overestimation along the leeward side is common to these multi satellite products all these four multi satellite products underestimate precipitation over the northern india e g jammu kashmir state the gauge based precipitation data set has also larger uncertainty over the northern india and northeast india due to low density of gauges over these regions prakash et al 2015b in order to assess the variability of monthly precipitation across india among these multi satellite products the spatial distributions of cv are illustrated in fig 4 the northwest india shows larger variability in monthly precipitation which is well depicted by chirps mswep and tmpa estimates however sm2rain cci is not able to represent the precipitation variability adequately across the country one of the reasons behind this discrepancy is that sm2rain algorithm is unable to estimate extreme precipitation in case of soil moisture saturation brocca et al 2014 although there are some differences in magnitudes of cv among imd chirps mswep and tmpa products they appear to be comparable qualitatively this analysis confirms that chirps and mswep products could be used for the study of long term precipitation variability with higher confidence the spatial distributions of correlation coefficient and rmse obtained after the quantitative comparison of four multi satellite precipitation products against gauge based data set for the 18 year period are shown in fig 5 chirps and tmpa show the largest correlation and smallest rmse across the country except over the northern india similar statistical performance of chirps and tmpa might be due to fact that chirps product is calibrated with tmpa 3b42 estimates funk et al 2015 sm2rain cci also shows reasonably high correlation and low rmse as compared to gauge based precipitation estimates mswep shows higher correlation over the high mean precipitation regions and lower correlation over the low mean precipitation areas in general mswep and sm2rain cci exhibit rather larger rmse than chirps and tmpa products moreover the spatial distributions of error components viz systematic and random errors in four multi satellite precipitation products across india are presented in fig 6 the knowledge of these error components is very important for implementing any statistical adjustments to these precipitation products before their integration in a specific application aghakouchak et al 2012 larger contributions of random error components as compared to systematic error components over the country are evident in chirps mswep and tmpa products however sm2rain cci shows larger contribution of systematic error components than random error components in general chirps and tmpa products are similar in terms of error characteristics and better than mswep product this analysis also reveals that sm2rain cci product needs a suitable bias adjustment before integrating it in any application among these four multi satellite precipitation products sm2rain cci is the only product that does not implement any gauge based bias correction chirps mswep and tmpa have rather smaller systematic errors due to gauge based bias correction fig 7 presents the spatial distributions of variability ratio and kge score in multi satellite precipitation products as compared to gauge based observations chirps mswep and tmpa are able to adequately capture the precipitation variability across the country except over the northern india however sm2rain cci largely underestimates the precipitation variability the kge score suggests that chirps is the best performer and comparable with tmpa product the smaller kge score over the northern india in all precipitation products might be due to uncertainty in gauge based estimates associated with sparse gauge density this analysis suggests that chirps product could be utilized for long term precipitation analysis over india with higher confidence fig 8 shows the comparison of empirical cdfs among gauge based and four multi satellite monthly precipitation products across the country and three selected sub regions viz west coast central and northeast india for the period of 1998 2015 this analysis would show the capabilities of each satellite based product in the estimation of different precipitation ranges as compared to ground based observations chirps mswep and tmpa show overall good agreement with gauge based estimates across the scale at all india and over the central india however they noticeably underestimate moderate precipitation over the northeast india sm2rain cci notably underestimates precipitation extremes and overestimates moderate precipitation this analysis again confirms that sm2rain cci needs further improvements to make it comparable to other multi satellite precipitation products additionally the four multi satellite precipitation products were compared against gauge based observations at domain mean scale for the 18 year period fig 9 shows the time series of monthly domain mean precipitation averaged over the entire country for the study period the corresponding taylor diagram is also shown to assess the error metrics of each satellite based precipitation product higher all india mean precipitation during the summer associated with the southwest monsoon is well captured by each product however sm2rain cci considerably underestimates the summer precipitation and overestimates precipitation for other seasons table 1 presents the different error characteristics of multi satellite precipitation as compared to gauge based data at all india scale the error metrics and taylor diagram clearly show that chirps and tmpa are the best multi satellite precipitation products followed by mswep whereas sm2rain cci largely underestimates the precipitation variability and essentially needs a suitable bias adjustment the time series of monthly domain mean precipitation averaged over the west coast central and northeast india for the study period is presented in fig 10 sm2rain cci largely underestimates the summer precipitation over the central and northeast india whereas mswep notably overestimates the summer precipitation over the northeast india table 2 presents the different error characteristics of multi satellite precipitation as compared to gauge based data for three sub regions of the country these error metrics and corresponding taylor diagrams e g fig 11 show tmpa and chirps are comparable to gauge based precipitation estimates over the three sub regions sm2rain cci underestimates precipitation variability consistently over the three sub regions however mswep considerably overestimates precipitation over the northeast india 4 conclusion in this study performance of latest versions of four multi satellite precipitation products chirps version 2 0 mswep version 2 1 sm2rain cci tmpa version 7 were extensively assessed across india using gauge based observations the assessment was done at all india and sub regional scales for the period of 1998 2015 at monthly scale results indicated that chirps and tmpa were better comparable to gauge based precipitation estimates than mswep estimates at all india and sub regional scales which was evident from higher correlation and kge score and lower bias and rmse with respect to gauge based precipitation data these multi satellite precipitation products were able to capture the precipitation gradients along the west coast of india however sm2rain cci largely underestimated precipitation variability across the country as compared to gauge based observations this surface soil moisture derived precipitation product notably underestimated the summer monsoon precipitation and overestimated precipitation for other seasons furthermore the systematic error component in sm2rain cci dominated than the random error component which suggested the need of a suitable bias correction to this precipitation product before integrating it in any application the overall results indicated better performance of chirps data set for long term precipitation analysis however there is a need to comprehensively evaluate these precipitation products along with gpm based imerg data set at daily time scale for hydrometeorological applications furthermore multi satellite precipitation products used to be reprocessed with some improvements eventually and updated version gets released which essentially needs to be comprehensively evaluated before integrating them to any

for the period of 1998 2015 at monthly scale these four multi satellite precipitation products are essentially based on different algorithms and input data sets among these multi satellite precipitation products sm2rain cci is the only product that does not use rain gauge observations for bias adjustment results indicate that chirps and tmpa are comparable to gauge based precipitation

decomposition 1 introduction precipitation is one of the most important atmospheric variables of the global energy and water cycle reliable long temporal record of global precipitation at fine spatiotemporal resolution is crucial for a wide range of applications such as for crop modeling hydrometeorology water resources management flood and drought monitoring and climatological applications although ground based rain gauge observations provide accurate measurement of precipitation locally their limited spatial representativeness and inhomogeneous distribution constraint its applicability at global scale kidd et al 2017 alternatively multi satellite precipitation estimates take relative advantages of contemporary constellation of precipitation related infrared and microwave satellite sensors and offer a unique opportunity to study the high spatiotemporal variability of precipitation at global scale kucera et al 2013 adler et al 2017 sun et al 2018 the satellite based precipitation estimation techniques improved substantially after the successful launch of the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm satellite and consequently several multi satellite precipitation products were

rainfall monitoring and meteorological drought assessment across india mahesh et al 2014 patel et al 2015 bushair et al 2016 these precipitation retrieval algorithms were also implemented at insat 3d satellite measurements which provide improved precipitation estimates at finer spatial resolution as compared to kalpana 1 estimates mitra et al 2018 singh et al 2018 however infrared only satellite

moderate precipitation over the northeast india sm2rain cci notably underestimates precipitation extremes and overestimates moderate precipitation this analysis again confirms that sm2rain cci needs further improvements to make it comparable to other multi satellite precipitation products additionally the four multi satellite precipitation products were compared against gauge based observations at domain mean scale for the 18 year period fig 9 shows the time series of monthly domain mean precipitation averaged over the entire country for the study period the corresponding taylor diagram is also shown to assess the error metrics of each satellite based precipitation product higher all india mean precipitation during the summer associated with the southwest monsoon is well captured by each product however sm2rain cci considerably underestimates the summer precipitation and overestimates precipitation for other seasons table 1 presents the different error characteristics of multi satellite precipitation as compared to gauge based data at all india scale the error metrics and taylor diagram clearly show that chirps and tmpa are the best multi satellite precipitation products followed by mswep whereas sm2rain cci largely underestimates the precipitation variability and essentially needs a suitable bias adjustment the time series of monthly domain mean precipitation averaged over the west coast central and northeast india for the study period is presented in fig 10 sm2rain cci largely underestimates the summer precipitation over the central and northeast india whereas mswep notably overestimates the summer precipitation over the northeast india table 2 presents the different error characteristics of multi satellite precipitation as compared to gauge based data for three sub regions of the country these error metrics and corresponding taylor diagrams e g fig 11 show tmpa and chirps are comparable to gauge based precipitation estimates over the three sub regions sm2rain cci underestimates precipitation variability consistently over the three sub regions however mswep considerably overestimates precipitation over the northeast india 4 conclusion in this study performance of latest versions of four multi satellite precipitation products chirps version 2 0 mswep version 2 1 sm2rain cci tmpa version 7 were extensively assessed across india using gauge based observations the assessment was done at all india and sub regional scales for the period of 1998 2015 at monthly scale results indicated that chirps and tmpa were better comparable to gauge based precipitation estimates than mswep estimates at all india and sub regional scales which was evident from higher correlation and kge score and lower bias and rmse with respect to gauge based precipitation data these multi satellite precipitation products were able to capture the precipitation gradients along the west coast of india however sm2rain cci largely underestimated precipitation variability across the country as compared to gauge based observations this surface soil moisture derived precipitation product notably underestimated the summer monsoon precipitation and overestimated precipitation for other seasons furthermore the systematic error component in sm2rain cci dominated than the random error component which suggested the need of a suitable bias correction to this precipitation product before integrating it in any application the overall results indicated better performance of chirps data set for long term precipitation analysis however there is a need to comprehensively evaluate these precipitation products along with gpm based imerg data set at daily time scale for hydrometeorological applications furthermore multi satellite precipitation products used to be reprocessed with some improvements eventually and updated version gets released which essentially needs to be comprehensively evaluated before integrating them to any

6633,in recent years thermal infrared tir cameras have improved in resolution and accuracy while their cost has declined by deploying a ground based tir camera to collect time lapse images it is now possible to acquire high resolution stream temperatures through both space and time however while ground based tir is useful for qualitatively identifying stream temperature differences acquisition of absolute stream temperatures remains difficult due to interference from reflected radiation therefore improved correction approaches are still needed to extract absolute stream temperatures from ground based time lapse tir imagery using 1100 tir images acquired every 10 minutes during two field seasons we assess two methods for correcting time lapse ground based tir stream temperature data 1 an analytical method derived from the literature that corrects for atmospheric transmissivity reflected temperatures and water surface emissivity which did not improve tir temperature accuracy and 2 an empirical approach that uses an offset correction created from in stream control point temperatures which reduced the mean absolute temperature difference between the tir and in situ stream temperatures examination of the analytical method revealed its sensitivity to reflected temperatures from the surrounding environment a problem that is particularly pronounced in ground based tir imagery due to the lower stream emissivity at more oblique viewing angles since reflected temperatures and stream surface emissivity can be difficult to quantify and are misrepresented in previous hydrologic literature the empirical correction approach offers an alternative method for extracting absolute stream temperatures from ground based tir imagery affected by these factors keywords infrared remote sensing stream temperature time lapse reflected radiation emissivity ground based 1 introduction satellites airborne sensors and ground based sensors are increasingly used to collect thermal infrared tir data for environmental applications in hydrology thermal data can be used to reveal stream temperature heterogeneities caused by groundwater inflows and seeps hyporheic exchange and geothermal inputs e g torgersen et al 2001 handcock et al 2012 hare et al 2015 eschbach et al 2016 mundy et al 2017 however the spatial resolution of satellite tir data is too coarse for all but the widest rivers handcock et al 2006 schuetz and weiler 2011 airborne tir data collection is inhibited by cost vatland et al 2015 and uav platforms are limited by battery life additionally satellite data are infrequent and taking high frequency airborne surveys from uavs or helicopters is difficult preventing the comparison of tir imagery to output from stream temperature models through time traditional in stream temperature sensors such as fibre optic technology and data logging thermocouples have limited spatial resolution particularly in 2d plan view torgersen et al 2001 cardenas et al 2011 time lapse ground based tir photography can potentially acquire large quantities of spatially and temporally detailed data revealing heterogeneities in river temperatures as never before while this data can be useful for qualitatively identifying stream temperature heterogeneities acquisition of accurate absolute stream temperatures remains difficult for ground based tir imagery due to interference from reflected radiation while many studies have used satellite airborne and ground based tir sensors for instantaneous observations of relative stream temperature differences few have attempted to use time lapse ground based tir to determine absolute temperatures through time three recent studies used this method to investigate environmental processes but none address the issue of reflections which are more pronounced when using ground based sensors due to the viewing angle aubry wake et al 2015 2018 used time lapse ground based infrared imaging to measure glacial surface temperatures and calculate the glacial energy budget however an 6 c offset correction was applied to the tir images after analytically correcting glacier temperatures cardenas et al 2014 compared time lapse ground based tir imagery to modeled stream temperatures and determined warm inflows were needed to model the observed tir stream temperature patterns however only one in stream control point that could not be directly viewed by the camera was reported cardenas et al 2014 our paper builds on these prior time lapse ground based tir studies by further investigating some strengths and limitations of this type of data particularly its sensitivity to reflected temperatures from the surrounding environment we assess two tir correction methods analytical and empirical and evaluate the effectiveness of time lapse ground based tir imagery for observing absolute stream temperatures drawing on best practices for tir sensing of sea surface temperatures sst we propose methodological changes to improve the accuracy of time lapse ground based tir stream temperatures when using the analytical method 2 methodology 2 1 thermal infrared science tir cameras record the intensity of surface radiation emitted by the top 0 1 mm of objects between frequencies of 7 5 and 14 μm and relate it to temperature using planck s law tir data must be corrected to isolate the surface

is affected by the distance between the camera and target object relative humidity and atmospheric temperature e g atwell et al 1971 torgersen et al 2001 kay et al 2005 previous studies correct for atmospheric radiation and transmissivity either using flir software which applies proprietary empirical formulas based on the lowtran atmospheric model e g bingham et al 2012 cardenas et al 2014 aubry wake et al 2015 or using modtran lowtran or other radiative transfer models e g torgersen et al 2001 kay et al 2005 fricke and baschek 2015 emissivity ε is the ratio of radiation an object emits compared to a black body at the same temperature buettner and kern 1965 for water emissivity typically ranges from 0 95 to 0 99 when viewing the surface at nadir and can be affected by viewing angle turbulence surface roughness e g due to high winds salinity turbidity and other factors zappa and jessup 1998 torgersen et al 2001 jessup and branch 2008 cardenas et al 2011 as surface emissivity decreases reflectivity increases according to the equation 2 ε r τ obj 1 where ε is the object s emissivity r is the object s reflectivity and τobj is the object s transmissivity this equation reduces to ε r 1 for water since it cannot transmit infrared radiation buettner and kern 1965 sidran 1981 salisbury and d aria 1992 as surface emissivity decreases a greater proportion of the radiation from the object is radiation reflected from the surrounding environment interfering with the desired thermal signal gillespie et al 1998 anderson et al 1995 torgersen et al 2001 kay et al 2005 puleo et al 2012 therefore tir images should be taken from near nadir to maintain high emissivity and reduce reflected radiation torgersen et al 2001 dugdale 2016 2 2 study site tir images were acquired of the quilcay stream in the quilcayhuanca valley located in the cordillera blanca peru 9 4656 s 77 3792 w the site experiences diurnal fluctuations in kinetic stream temperature relative humidity and wind speed these fluctuations are similar both from day to day within the dry season and similar from one dry season to another fig 1 peak incoming solar radiation often exceeds 900 w m2 the land surface of the valley bottom is 160 to 220 m across at the camera location at an elevation of 3930 m asl steep granodiorite valley walls extend to an elevation of over 5200 m asl the quilcay stream containing a gravel bar flows down the valley with the study reach traversing a meadow containing short grazed grasses and no overhanging vegetation stream width in the study reach varies from 3 to 14 m with a maximum depth of 0 47 m numerous small springs and tributaries flow into the stream 2 3 field methods time lapse ground based tir images of the quilcay stream were acquired using a jenoptik variocam high definition tir camera table s1 during two field periods july 2015 august 2016 table 1 tir and visual images of the stream were acquired every 10 min fig 2 a d during 2015 we positioned the camera on the south east valley wall 110 m above the stream we recorded 707 time lapse images of a 500 m stream reach with a spatial resolution of 50 cm fig 2c the image center was viewed at 77 from vertical with the upstream edge viewed at 82 and the downstream edge at 72 during 2016 we collected 441 images of a sub reach of the 2015 reach with a resolution of 10 cm we deployed the camera on the north west valley wall 51 m above the stream with a view containing an 80 m stream reach fig 2d the viewing angle of the camera was 70 from vertical failure of the tir camera s backup battery resulted in a data gap during the 2016 field period table 1 thermochron ibutton sensors table s1 directly recorded in stream kinetic water temperatures every 5 min serving as control points for the tir stream temperatures in 2015 these in stream sensors were deployed at 17 locations fig 3 a and in 2016 they were deployed at 13 locations fig 3b in 2015 we also installed three in stream stakes each with ibutton sensors at three depths to obtain water column temperature profiles to confirm the stream was thermally well mixed ensuring tir temperatures are representative of water column temperatures ibutton sensors were also installed in the surrounding environment during both field periods to record ground temperatures every 5 min ground control points were buried about a centimeter below the surface in a variety of surface types including within wet areas of the meadow dry areas of the meadow and the gravel bar ten ground control points were deployed in 2015 and three were deployed in 2016 in both years meteorological data air temperature relative humidity wind speed and incoming solar radiation were recorded every 10 min using a vantage pro2 weather station centrally located in the study reach fig 3 fig 1 at the camera location a lascar sensor also recorded air temperature and relative humidity every 5 min 2 4 image processing and corrections two methods were assessed for correcting the radiant stream temperatures fig 4 the first was the analytical method which used planck s law and eq 1 to correct radiant temperatures for atmospheric transmissivity τ reflected temperature trefl and stream surface emissivity ε cardenas et al 2011 cardenas et al 2014 aubry wake et al 2015 the second was an empirical method which used an offset correction to account for errors due to reflected radiation prior to the application of either correction approach images were aligned using functions within matlab s image processing toolbox although the camera was securely anchored the field of view occasionally shifted slightly while changing batteries and downloading data blurred images due to camera vibrations from the wind were removed 3 removed in 2015 5 removed in 2016 the downstream distance of each pixel was measured in arcmap stream reaches with widths spanned by fewer than 8 pixels were excluded from the analysis to minimize thermal contamination from the stream banks torgersen et al 2001 handcock et al 2006 7 and 10 control points from 2015 and 2016 were located in reaches with enough pixel coverage for analysis for the analytical correction method planck s law was used to calculate the radiance measured by the camera atwell et al 1971 torgersen et al 2001 the measured radiance was corrected for stream surface emissivity atmospheric transmissivity and reflected and atmospheric radiation using eq 1 cardenas et al 2011 cardenas et al 2014 aubry wake et al 2015 reflected and atmospheric radiation were calculated using planck s law and air temperatures recorded at the camera and weather station aubry wake et al 2015 finally corrected radiances were converted back to temperatures aubry wake et al 2015 τ values were determined using flir tools for a range of air temperature relative humidity and distance combinations and used within eq 1 the air temperature and relative humidity for the atmospheric transmissivity correction were obtained from the weather station the distance to the ground surface from the tir camera was measured in google earth pro using the 3d path measuring tool at 40 control points in the image these distance points were then linearly interpolated in matlab to calculate a distance to each pixel water ε values over a range of viewing angles were compiled sidran 1981 masuda et al 1988 sobrino and cuenca 1999 tir temperatures were corrected assuming emissivities based on camera angle while wind speed can also affect water surface emissivity we did not vary emissivity as a function of changing winds for simplicity the variation in ε as a function of wind speed was relatively small for the two field periods 0 804 0 m s to 0 853 15 m s for 2015 and 0 879 0 m s to 0 889 15 m s for 2016 masuda et al 1988 reflected temperatures were initially assumed to equal air temperatures similar to previous time lapse ground based tir studies cardenas et al 2014 aubry wake et al 2015 an empirical correction method was developed to determine if it provides a more effective way to correct for reflected radiation when performing ground based infrared surveys this method used a temperature adjustment based on the average difference between kinetic and radiant stream temperatures for a subset of three control points control points 20 26 and 32 were used for 2015 and control points 1 7 and 12 were used for 2016 these control points are located approximately at the center and edges of each set of images the uncorrected radiant temperature at each control point was calculated as the average of a cluster of 9 pixels extracted from the center of the stream the average residual of the three control point locations at each time was used to adjust radiant stream temperatures throughout each image empirically adjusted radiant temperatures were compared to kinetic temperatures to assess the effectiveness of the method pixels along the midline of the stream were extracted to analyze longitudinal temperature patterns within the empirically corrected images vatland et al 2015 2 5 estimation of reflected temperatures in the analytical correction approach reflected temperatures are assumed to equal air temperatures based on the methods from previous studies that used time lapse ground based tir imagery cardenas et al 2014 aubry wake et al 2015 to assess whether this was an accurate assumption we calculated the reflected temperatures needed for tir temperatures tmeas corrected using eq 1 to equal the in stream temperatures measured by the ibutton sensors we estimated these reflected temperatures by assuming the radiant temperature of the stream tsurface equaled the kinetic temperature recorded by the ibutton sensors and solving for the reflected temperatures trefl through time using eqs 1 and 2 constant emissivity and calculated atmospheric transmissivity values 2 6 reflected temperature experiment to assess whether these estimated reflected temperatures are reasonable and the range of possible reflected radiant sky temperatures under different conditions tir images of 0 92 0 92 m cardboard covered in crumpled aluminum foil were taken in the center of the syracuse university quad 43 0376 n 76 1340 w away from buildings or overhanging vegetation we recorded tir images at different times over several days using a flir one camera aluminum foil has an emissivity of zero 0 03 0 07 lillesand et al 2015 so all radiant energy from the foil is reflected from the environment rather than related to the temperature of the foil images were taken under different sky conditions clear scattered clouds cloudy concurrent weather data were downloaded from the syracuse university meteorological station https onondaga weatherstem com syracuse 43 0382 n 76 1334 w the radiant temperatures of the foil pixels were then analyzed to determine the range in reflected sky temperatures to determine the effect reflected temperatures have on tir data accuracy eq 1 τ 1 was used to calculate theoretical measured radiant temperatures of specific kinetic temperatures for a range of reflected temperatures and water surface emissivity values the relationship between the reflected temperature and water surface emissivity along with the measured reflected sky temperatures were used to assess the estimated reflected temperatures for the tir images of the quilcay stream 3 results and discussion 3 1 uncorrected thermal infrared stream temperatures the uncorrected tir images do not provide accurate stream temperature data the maximum minimum and mean radiant temperatures from clusters of 9 pixels at each control point show similar temperatures and so the mean was used fig 5 uncorrected radiant stream temperatures have mean absolute errors of 5 67 c 2015 and 3 53 c 2016 with radiant temperatures typically colder than kinetic temperatures fig 5a b this difference between the in stream sensors and tir images is not due to thermal stratification because the three stream temperature profiles never differ by 0 32 c and two profiles never differ by 0 12 c in addition this error is too large to be from the presence of a thermal boundary layer skin temperature which is typically only 0 1 0 5 c less than the bulk water temperature zappa and jessup 1998 minnet et al 2001 jessup and branch 2008 and would be disrupted and mixed within the turbulent stream while tir errors vary through time errors at any given time are similar for all control points morning radiant stream temperatures rise prior to in stream temperatures fig 5a b in another study tir glacial temperatures rose prior to direct glacial surface temperatures which was attributed to reflected radiation aubry wake et al 2015 we believe the premature morning warming of radiant stream temperatures in the current study is due to reflected radiation from solar heating of the cliffs and banks which warm earlier than the stream on the valley floor puleo et al 2012 two periods during 2015 exhibit tir temperatures out of phase with the diurnal temperature signal fig 5a unlike the 2015 data all 2016 tir data follow the correct diurnal pattern the weather data from the two field periods are very similar fig 1 and so we do not believe these out of phase periods are due to changes in air temperature or relative humidity that affect the atmospheric transmissivity therefore these out of phase periods may result from the more oblique 2015 viewing angle and therefore more reflection or be due to interference from some atmospheric or surficial phenomena we failed to record overall the differences between the radiant and kinetic temperatures seem mainly the result of the interaction between reflected temperatures from the surrounding environment and water surface emissivity with the influence of reflection stronger in 2015 due to the more oblique viewing angle puleo et al 2012 3 2 analytically corrected tir stream temperatures tir stream temperatures were analytically corrected for atmospheric transmissivity τ stream surface emissivity ε and reflected temperatures trefl using eq 1 for this analytical correction method emissivity was first assumed to equal 0 96 according to previous hydrologic time lapse ground based tir studies cardenas et al 2011 cardenas et al 2014 the analytical correction resulted in mean absolute temperatures differences of 6 27 c and 3 79 c for 2015 and 2016 fig 5c d viewing angle based emissivity values of 0 80 75 and 0 88 70 were then used to correct the raw 2015 and 2016 tir data masuda et al 1988 producing mean absolute differences of 8 24 c and 4 00 c fig 5c d even if we had incorporated changing emissivity due to variations in wind speed at these viewing angles daytime tir stream temperatures which occurred during periods of high wind would only be slightly warmer than when emissivity was held constant according to the viewing angle 1 5 c warmer ε 0 853 with wind of 15 m s in 2015 and 0 5 c warmer ε 0 889 with wind of 15 m s in 2016 masuda et al 1988 therefore regardless of the emissivity value used corrected stream temperatures from the analytical method were colder than the uncorrected tir data and further from the kinetic stream temperatures the two variables in eq 1 with the greatest uncertainty are emissivity and reflected temperature the values of these variables are assumed while the rest are either measured or calculated since corrected radiant temperatures remain too cold when emissivity is decreased we conclude it is incorrect to assume the reflected temperatures equal the air temperatures 3 3 relationship between emissivity and reflected temperature since water surface emissivity varies with viewing angle fig 4a sidran 1981 masuda et al 1988 sobrino and cuenca 1999 we plotted the temperature difference between a kinetic stream temperature of 7 c and the measured radiant temperature resulting from a range of emissivity values and reflected temperatures fig 6 b when emissivity is 1 radiant temperatures measured by the camera equal kinetic temperatures regardless of the reflected temperature as emissivity decreases the reflected temperature has a greater influence on the measured tir temperature if the reflected temperature is warmer than the stream trefl tactual 0 measured radiant temperatures will exceed kinetic temperatures tmeas tactual 0 if the reflected temperature is colder than the stream trefl tactual 0 measured radiant temperatures will be colder than kinetic temperatures tmeas tactual 0 fig 6b saunders 1967 if the kinetic stream temperature is 7 c and emissivity equals 0 8 with reflected temperatures 10 c colder than the stream tir camera measurements will have an error of 1 9 c compared to the 0 4 c error when emissivity equals 0 96 fig 4b points x y even from nadir views ε 0 985 studies measuring ocean temperatures found reflections on days with clear skies could result in uncorrected temperatures up to 0 5 c colder than reality zappa and jessup 1998 therefore it is important to correctly determine the emissivity and reflected temperatures to accurately correct radiant stream temperatures while accurate surface emissivity values and reflected temperatures are important for absolute temperature corrections they are also important for comparing relative temperatures this is especially important if a stream is viewed obliquely as emissivity will vary along the stream due to viewing angle variation if a stream has a homogenous temperature of 7 c but is viewed obliquely the portion of the reach viewed at a lower angle 75 has an emissivity of 0 8 and a tir error of 3 2 c if reflected temperatures are 17 c colder than the stream fig 6b point w meanwhile the portion viewed at a less oblique angle 70 has an emissivity of 0 88 and a tir error of 1 9 c fig 6b point z this results in a 1 3 c temperature difference along the reach due to viewing angle differences rather than from actual temperature differences as emissivity decreases and the reflected temperatures become increasingly different from the stream temperatures tir errors increase this problem becomes more complex if the reflected temperature from the surrounding environment varies along the reach 3 4 estimated reflected temperatures of quilcay stream imagery we estimated the reflected temperature needed for the analytically corrected tir data to equal the temperatures recorded by the in stream sensors at our study site by assuming tsurface equaled the in stream temperature we solved for the reflected temperature through time using planck s law and eq 1 with constant emissivity and calculated atmospheric transmissivity calculated estimates of reflected temperatures for the quilcay stream data typically ranged from about 50 to 21 c for 2015 and from 60 to 18 c for 2016 fig s1 for both datasets estimated reflected temperatures were typically warmer during the day than night though sometimes cold reflected temperatures occurred during the day particularly during 2015 the reflected temperatures required to generate the observed radiant temperatures are not consistent with the assumption that the reflected temperature is well represented by observed air temperatures cardenas et al 2011 cardenas et al 2014 aubry wake et al 2015 3 5 observed reflected radiant sky temperatures to assess whether these inferred reflected temperatures are reasonable we measured reflected radiant sky temperatures under a range of conditions and times of day since the sky was the likeliest source of the cold reflected temperatures we estimated our observations show average reflected sky temperatures were colder than corresponding air temperatures and minimum reflected temperatures were as cold as approximately 40 c fig s2 similarly chen and zhang 1989 measured average reflected sky temperatures of 9 12 c and found sky temperatures were often 30 c cooler than ground temperatures other studies also cite radiant reflected clear sky temperatures of 18 c zappa and jessup 1998 and 20 to 50 c depending on location jessup and branch 2008 our measurements along with results from previous studies indicate the reflected sky temperatures are generally colder under clear skies and warmer under cloudy conditions fig 7 fig s3 saunders 1967 zappa and jessup 1998 under scattered clouds reflected sky temperatures exhibit more variability due to patches of sky with and without clouds fig 7 different cloud types located at different heights will emit different radiative temperatures donlon et al 2008 since the sky is a main source of the reflected temperature emitted from the environment at the field site in this study the range in tir temperatures that the sky exhibits influences the measurement of radiant stream temperatures for the quilcay site reflected temperatures could be even colder than those measured in syracuse since reflected sky temperatures are colder at higher elevation due to the thinner drier overlying atmosphere smith et al 1996 minnet et al 2001 other objects in the surrounding environment also produce reflected temperature errors especially during the day under clear sky conditions marruedo et al 2018 other sources of reflections are the cliffs and gravel banks which can sometimes emit the highest radiative temperatures tonolla et al 2010 during the day temperatures of the gravel bar and dry areas of the meadow can exceed 30 c based on ibutton data while at night ground temperatures can drop below 5 c therefore the range of reflected temperatures we estimated for the quilcay site are reasonable and typically not equal to air temperatures furthermore when surface roughness is low such as under low winds and calm water surfaces reflections are pronounced such reflections are less discernable under high winds and rough water surfaces zappa and jessup 1998 this could also explain why the measured nighttime stream temperatures which occur when the wind speed drops exhibit tir errors that are colder than daytime errors estimated daytime reflected temperatures may also be warmer than estimated nighttime reflected temperatures due to the mix of sky reflections with reflections from the cliffs and surrounding land surface which emit warm radiative temperatures during the day and cooler radiative temperatures at night while the sky was the main source of reflected radiation in our study other sources could be more important at sites with different characteristics for example on a stream mostly blocked by trees with minimal view of the sky the reflected temperature would mainly come from the surrounding trees and vegetation often resulting in warmer reflected temperatures than those from the sky 3 6 empirically corrected tir temperatures since the analytical correction method can be inaccurate due to errors estimating water surface emissivity and reflected temperature we also explored an empirical correction method three control points were used to determine the offset value of the stream temperatures from each tir image through time the remaining control points n 4 in 2015 and n 7 in 2016 were then used to assess the resulting error of empirically corrected stream temperatures the mean absolute temperature differences of the control points not used to determine the offset correction were 0 30 c and 0 16 c for 2015 and 2016 fig 5e f the empirical method reduced radiant stream temperature errors but certain time periods are more error prone particularly mornings in 2015 fig 5g h this empirical correction likely worked better in 2016 than in 2015 because the 2016 reach was shorter and so had less spatial variation in the reflected temperature and viewing angle making errors more consistent at any time overall the empirical correction improved ground based radiant temperatures more than the analytical correction similar to findings from aerial studies that used calibrations based on direct water temperature measurements wawrzyniak et al 2013 while the empirical correction method is more effective at reducing the tir stream temperature error limitations remain the empirical method does well correcting image scale reflections e g sky and cliff reflections but it cannot correct smaller scale reflections including those from patchy cloud cover objects such as trees and tall vegetation near the stream edge or rocky stream banks that emit large amount of radiant energy that interfere with the stream s thermal signal puleo et al 2012 in places where an insufficient number of pixels span the stream errors occur due to mixed pixels or thermal contamination from bank reflections previous work shows at least 10 pixels should span the stream to obtain uncontaminated temperatures torgersen et al 2001 here we limited our results to locations where there are 8 or more pixels spanning the width of the stream a final drawback of the empirical method is that the offset correction is unique to each data set and tir image and the correction factor changes through time due to factors such as weather conditions and site characteristics therefore direct temperature measurements must be made to create the offset correction applied to each tir image additionally if you are interested in measuring the tir temperature of multiple surface types e g water rock in an image you must apply a different correction factor to each surface type because their errors will be different due to their differing emissivities 3 7 tir stream temperature patterns kinetic temperature measurements show that quilcay stream temperatures are fairly uniform spatially despite the inflow of small tributaries movie s1 movie s2 however corrected radiant temperatures sometimes show warmer and cooler spots that are unsupported by the in stream measurements particularly problematic times occur when temperatures are rising or falling especially near where the stream narrows movie s1 upstream of control point 27 movie s2 control points 2 5 stream segments not spanned by at least 8 pixels have larger temperature anomalies during these periods likely due to thermal contamination from the stream bank additionally the reach between control points 10 and 11 sometimes shows artificially fast warming in the mornings due to thermal contamination from the adjacent gravel banks movie s2 while longitudinal stream temperatures typically show minor noise 0 5 c some periods during 2015 exhibit increased noise e g july 22 from 3 00 6 00 july 24 at 14 50 due to reflections caused by the oblique viewing angle puleo et al 2012 overall false temperature anomalies are more prevalent for 2015 than 2016 likely due to the more oblique viewing angle that decreases water surface emissivity and due to fewer buffer pixels between the stream banks and stream midline allowing for more contamination from bank reflections 3 8 comparison to previous time lapse ground based studies few studies have used time lapse ground based tir imagery to obtain kinetic stream surface temperatures but these studies have demonstrated similar tir temperature correction issues data from a time lapse ground based tir study assessing glacial surface temperatures also exhibits periods when the radiant and kinetic temperatures are out of phase and radiant temperatures warm in the morning prior to warming of kinetic temperatures aubry wake et al 2015 tir data from the study were adjusted using a 5 96 c offset correction after the analytical correction was applied εsnow 0 98 εice 0 97 trefl air temperature indicating the inputs used in the analytical method did not account for reflected temperatures that were colder than air temperatures and lower emissivity due to variations in the glacial surface another study used time lapse ground based tir imagery to analyze radiant stream temperature data over 24 h cardenas et al 2014 similarly morning radiant temperatures rose more quickly than kinetic in stream temperatures the study has a viewing angle comparable to our 2015 images with an oblique view that varies along the stream length and prevents numerous pixels from spanning the stream this could result in erroneous stream temperatures due to thermal contamination and assumptions about emissivity and reflected temperature values ε 0 96 and trefl air temperatures since the viewing angle varies 65 85 in these images with more oblique views of the upstream and downstream portions of the reach since the study only has one control point which is obscured from the camera s view it is uncertain whether observed upstream and downstream warming was due to warm inflows as the authors concluded or due to lower upstream and downstream water surface emissivity values enabling a greater proportion of the surrounding land temperatures which were always warmer than the stream to reflect off the stream thereby making these regions appear warmer 3 9 proposed methodological changes previous time lapse ground based tir studies have made incorrect generalizing assumptions about stream surface emissivity and reflected temperature values ε 0 96 and trefl air temperatures leading to applications of the analytical method that produced tir temperatures that may be incorrect or correct for the wrong reasons for example errors due to incorrectly high emissivity values at oblique viewing angles may be hidden if reflected temperatures are close in value to the temperature of the target object zappa and jessup 1998 experimental design should also be carefully considered to achieve high viewing angles and avoid designs where the viewing angle of the stream varies across the image altering the emissivity if the hydrologic community continues to use time lapse ground based tir imagery for extracting accurate stream temperatures e g for comparison to stream temperature energy balance model output then methodological changes must be considered one possible methodological change is implementation of the empirical approach instead of the analytical correction approach such that results do not rely on accurate values of emissivity and reflected temperature especially in environments where these variables are difficult to obtain another possibility is to draw on methodological best practices for tir sensing of sea surface temperature sst prior work in this area has demonstrated that accurate emissivity and reflected temperature values must be known to make accurate temperature corrections using the analytical method e g smith et al 1996 zappa and jessup 1998 minnet et al 2001 jessup and branch 2008 donlon et al 2008 to measure reflected temperatures prior investigators have used either multiple radiometers positioned at the same viewing angle to the sea and sky smith et al 1996 zappa and jessup 1998 minnet et al 2001 jessup and branch 2008 or dual port radiometers one radiometer with a rotating mirror that alternately directs sky and surface radiance into the detector donlon et al 2008 while the methods for tir sensing of sst still have limitations e g time of sky and sea measurement must be the same rough water surfaces with various orientations can receive different reflections greater spatial variability in reflected temperatures under scattered cloud conditions jessup and branch 2008 donlon et al 2008 they provide a methodology that may be an improvement from the incorrect assumptions often made when using the analytical approach for sensing stream and surface water temperatures 4 conclusions improvements in the accuracy and cost effectiveness of tir temperature sensing present an opportunity to obtain high resolution temperature records of streams and surface water through space and time such data can be used to map thermal heterogeneities in streams and to inform model simulations of stream temperatures however accurate tir sensing of stream and surface water temperatures remains a challenge due to the complexities surrounding correction of time lapse ground based tir imagery analytical corrections of tir temperatures that rely on assumed values of water emissivity and reflected temperatures are often ineffective because it is difficult to obtain a near zenith view of a stream from the ground this leads to uncertainty in the emissivity values along stream reaches due to the non linear relationship between emissivity and viewing angle as emissivity decreases correct quantification of reflected temperatures becomes increasingly important and cannot be assumed to equal air temperature however it is difficult to measure reflected temperatures along an entire stream reach as they can vary both spatially and temporally though measurement of reflected temperatures could be improved by using multiple or dual port radiometers empirical corrections based on the observed offset between in situ sensors and tir radiant temperatures are partially effective at correcting radiant stream temperatures as this method corrects image scale reflections without needing the emissivity and reflected temperature values to be known however neither method corrects for small scale reflections that can occur such as those from localized gravel bars or overhanging vegetation both methods have greater error when the viewing angle varies along the stream reach and when too few pixels span the stream width allowing thermal contamination from the banks due to uncertainty in reflected temperatures and emissivity values it may be difficult to accurately measure absolute stream temperatures and temperature differences along a reach using ground based tir sensing therefore while ground based tir remains informative for identifying locations of relative stream temperature difference caution should be taken when drawing conclusions about environmental processes from absolute tir temperature data conflict of interest the authors declared that there is no conflict of interest

6633,in recent years thermal infrared tir cameras have improved in resolution and accuracy while their cost has declined by deploying a ground based tir camera to collect time lapse images it is now possible to acquire high resolution stream temperatures through both space and time however while ground based tir is useful for qualitatively identifying stream temperature differences acquisition of absolute stream temperatures remains difficult due to interference from reflected radiation therefore improved correction approaches are still needed to extract absolute stream temperatures from ground based time lapse tir imagery using 1100 tir images acquired every 10 minutes during two field seasons we assess two methods for correcting time lapse ground based tir stream temperature data 1 an analytical method derived from the literature that corrects for atmospheric transmissivity reflected temperatures and water surface emissivity which did not improve tir temperature accuracy and 2 an empirical approach that uses an offset correction created from in stream control point temperatures which reduced the mean absolute temperature difference between the tir and in situ stream temperatures examination of the analytical method revealed its sensitivity to reflected temperatures from the surrounding environment a problem that is particularly pronounced in ground based tir imagery due to the lower stream emissivity at more oblique viewing angles since reflected temperatures and stream surface emissivity can be difficult to quantify and are misrepresented in previous hydrologic literature the empirical correction approach offers an alternative method for extracting absolute stream temperatures from ground based tir imagery affected by these factors keywords infrared remote sensing stream temperature time lapse reflected radiation emissivity ground based 1 introduction satellites airborne sensors and ground based sensors are increasingly used to collect thermal infrared tir data for environmental applications in hydrology thermal data can be used to reveal stream temperature heterogeneities caused by groundwater inflows and seeps hyporheic exchange and geothermal inputs e g torgersen et al 2001 handcock et al 2012 hare et al 2015 eschbach et al 2016 mundy et al 2017 however the spatial resolution of satellite tir data is too coarse for all but the widest rivers handcock et al 2006 schuetz and weiler 2011 airborne tir data collection is inhibited by cost vatland et al 2015 and uav platforms are limited by battery life additionally satellite data are infrequent and taking high frequency airborne surveys from uavs or helicopters is difficult preventing the comparison of tir imagery to output from stream temperature models through time traditional in stream temperature sensors such as fibre optic technology and data logging thermocouples have limited spatial resolution particularly in 2d plan view torgersen et al 2001 cardenas et al 2011 time lapse ground based tir photography can potentially acquire large quantities of spatially and temporally detailed data revealing heterogeneities in river temperatures as never before while this data can be useful for qualitatively identifying stream temperature heterogeneities acquisition of accurate absolute stream temperatures remains difficult for ground based tir imagery due to interference from reflected radiation while many studies have used satellite airborne and ground based tir sensors for instantaneous observations of relative stream temperature differences few have attempted to use time lapse ground based tir to determine absolute temperatures through time three recent studies used this method to investigate environmental processes but none address the issue of reflections which are more pronounced when using ground based sensors due to the viewing angle aubry wake et al 2015 2018 used time lapse ground based infrared imaging to measure glacial surface temperatures and calculate the glacial energy budget however an 6 c offset correction was applied to the tir images after analytically correcting glacier temperatures cardenas et al 2014 compared time lapse ground based tir imagery to modeled stream temperatures and determined warm inflows were needed to model the observed tir stream temperature patterns however only one in stream control point that could not be directly viewed by the camera was reported cardenas et al 2014 our paper builds on these prior time lapse ground based tir studies by further investigating some strengths and limitations of this type of data particularly its sensitivity to reflected temperatures from the surrounding environment we assess two tir correction methods analytical and empirical and evaluate the effectiveness of time lapse ground based tir imagery for observing absolute stream temperatures drawing on best practices for tir sensing of sea surface temperatures sst we propose methodological changes to improve the accuracy of time lapse ground based tir stream temperatures when using the analytical method 2 methodology 2 1 thermal infrared science tir cameras record the intensity of surface radiation emitted by the top 0 1 mm of objects between frequencies of 7 5 and 14 μm and relate it to temperature using planck s law tir data must be corrected to isolate the surface

is affected by the distance between the camera and target object relative humidity and atmospheric temperature e g atwell et al 1971 torgersen et al 2001 kay et al 2005 previous studies correct for atmospheric radiation and transmissivity either using flir software which applies proprietary empirical formulas based on the lowtran atmospheric model e g bingham et al 2012 cardenas et al 2014 aubry wake et al 2015 or using modtran lowtran or other radiative transfer models e g torgersen et al 2001 kay et al 2005 fricke and baschek 2015 emissivity ε is the ratio of radiation an object emits compared to a black body at the same temperature buettner and kern 1965 for water emissivity typically ranges from 0 95 to 0 99 when viewing the surface at nadir and can be affected by viewing angle turbulence surface roughness e g due to high winds salinity turbidity and other factors zappa and jessup 1998 torgersen et al 2001 jessup and branch 2008 cardenas et al 2011 as surface emissivity decreases reflectivity increases according to the equation 2 ε r τ obj 1 where ε is the object s emissivity r is the object s reflectivity and τobj is the object s transmissivity this equation reduces to ε r 1 for water since it cannot transmit infrared radiation buettner and kern 1965 sidran 1981 salisbury and d aria 1992 as surface emissivity decreases a greater proportion of the radiation from the object is radiation reflected from the surrounding environment interfering with the desired thermal signal gillespie et al 1998 anderson et al 1995 torgersen et al 2001 kay et al 2005 puleo et al 2012 therefore tir images should be taken from near nadir to maintain high emissivity and reduce reflected radiation torgersen et al 2001 dugdale 2016 2 2 study site tir images were acquired of the quilcay stream in the quilcayhuanca valley located in the cordillera blanca peru 9 4656 s 77 3792 w the site experiences diurnal fluctuations in kinetic stream temperature relative humidity and wind speed these fluctuations are similar both from day to day within the dry season and similar from one dry season to another fig 1 peak incoming solar radiation often exceeds 900 w m2 the land surface of the valley bottom is 160 to 220 m across at the camera location at an elevation of 3930 m asl steep granodiorite valley walls extend to an elevation of over 5200 m asl the quilcay stream containing a gravel bar flows down the valley with the study reach traversing a meadow containing short grazed grasses and no overhanging vegetation stream width in the study reach varies from 3 to 14 m with a maximum depth of 0 47 m numerous small springs and tributaries flow into the stream 2 3 field methods time lapse ground based tir images of the quilcay stream were acquired using a jenoptik variocam high definition tir camera table s1 during two field periods july 2015 august 2016 table 1 tir and visual images of the stream were acquired every 10 min fig 2 a d during 2015 we positioned the camera on the south east valley wall 110 m above the stream we recorded 707 time lapse images of a 500 m stream reach with a spatial resolution of 50 cm fig 2c the image center was viewed at 77 from vertical with the upstream edge viewed at 82 and the downstream edge at 72 during 2016 we collected 441 images of a sub reach of the 2015 reach with a resolution of 10 cm we deployed the camera on the north west valley wall 51 m above the stream with a view containing an 80 m stream reach fig 2d the viewing angle of the camera was 70 from vertical failure of the tir camera s backup battery resulted in a data gap during the 2016 field period table 1 thermochron ibutton sensors table s1 directly recorded in stream kinetic water temperatures every 5 min serving as control points for the tir stream temperatures in 2015 these in stream sensors were deployed at 17 locations fig 3 a and in 2016 they were deployed at 13 locations fig 3b in 2015 we also installed three in stream stakes each with ibutton sensors at three depths to obtain water column temperature profiles to confirm the stream was thermally well mixed ensuring tir temperatures are representative of water column temperatures ibutton sensors were also installed in the surrounding environment during both field periods to record ground temperatures every 5 min ground control points were buried about a centimeter below the surface in a variety of surface types including within wet areas of the meadow dry areas of the meadow and the gravel bar ten ground control points were deployed in 2015 and three were deployed in 2016 in both years meteorological data air temperature relative humidity wind speed and incoming solar radiation were recorded every 10 min using a vantage pro2 weather station centrally located in the study reach fig 3 fig 1 at the camera location a lascar sensor also recorded air temperature and relative humidity every 5 min 2 4 image processing and corrections two methods were assessed for correcting the radiant stream temperatures fig 4 the first was the analytical method which used planck s law and eq 1 to correct radiant temperatures for atmospheric transmissivity τ reflected temperature trefl and stream surface emissivity ε cardenas et al 2011 cardenas et al 2014 aubry wake et al 2015 the second was an empirical method which used an offset correction to account for errors due to reflected radiation prior to the application of either correction approach images were aligned using functions within matlab s image processing toolbox although the camera was securely anchored the field of view occasionally shifted slightly while changing batteries and downloading data blurred images due to camera vibrations from the wind were removed 3 removed in 2015 5 removed in 2016 the downstream distance of each pixel was measured in arcmap stream reaches with widths spanned by fewer than 8 pixels were excluded from the analysis to minimize thermal contamination from the stream banks torgersen et al 2001 handcock et al 2006 7 and 10 control points from 2015 and 2016 were located in reaches with enough pixel coverage for analysis for the analytical correction method planck s law was used to calculate the radiance measured by the camera atwell et al 1971 torgersen et al 2001 the measured radiance was corrected for stream surface emissivity atmospheric transmissivity and reflected and atmospheric radiation using eq 1 cardenas et al 2011 cardenas et al 2014 aubry wake et al 2015 reflected and atmospheric radiation were calculated using planck s law and air temperatures recorded at the camera and weather station aubry wake et al 2015 finally corrected radiances were converted back to temperatures aubry wake et al 2015 τ values were determined using flir tools for a range of air temperature relative humidity and distance combinations and used within eq 1 the air temperature and relative humidity for the atmospheric transmissivity correction were obtained from the weather station the distance to the ground surface from the tir camera was measured in google earth pro using the 3d path measuring tool at 40 control points in the image these distance points were then linearly interpolated in matlab to calculate a distance to each pixel water ε values over a range of viewing angles were compiled sidran 1981 masuda et al 1988 sobrino and cuenca 1999 tir temperatures were corrected assuming emissivities based on camera angle while wind speed can also affect water surface emissivity we did not vary emissivity as a function of changing winds for simplicity the variation in ε as a function of wind speed was relatively small for the two field periods 0 804 0 m s to 0 853 15 m s for 2015 and 0 879 0 m s to 0 889 15 m s for 2016 masuda et al 1988 reflected temperatures were initially assumed to equal air temperatures similar to previous time lapse ground based tir studies cardenas et al 2014 aubry wake et al 2015 an empirical correction method was developed to determine if it provides a more effective way to correct for reflected radiation when performing ground based infrared surveys this method used a temperature adjustment based on the average difference between kinetic and radiant stream temperatures for a subset of three control points control points 20 26 and 32 were used for 2015 and control points 1 7 and 12 were used for 2016 these control points are located approximately at the center and edges of each set of images the uncorrected radiant temperature at each control point was calculated as the average of a cluster of 9 pixels extracted from the center of the stream the average residual of the three control point locations at each time was used to adjust radiant stream temperatures throughout each image empirically adjusted radiant temperatures were compared to kinetic temperatures to assess the effectiveness of the method pixels along the midline of the stream were extracted to analyze longitudinal temperature patterns within the empirically corrected images vatland et al 2015 2 5 estimation of reflected temperatures in the analytical correction approach reflected temperatures are assumed to equal air temperatures based on the methods from previous studies that used time lapse ground based tir imagery cardenas et al 2014 aubry wake et al 2015 to assess whether this was an accurate assumption we calculated the reflected temperatures needed for tir temperatures tmeas corrected using eq 1 to equal the in stream temperatures measured by the ibutton sensors we estimated these reflected temperatures by assuming the radiant temperature of the stream tsurface equaled the kinetic temperature recorded by the ibutton sensors and solving for the reflected temperatures trefl through time using eqs 1 and 2 constant emissivity and calculated atmospheric transmissivity values 2 6 reflected temperature experiment to assess whether these estimated reflected temperatures are reasonable and the range of possible reflected radiant sky temperatures under different conditions tir images of 0 92 0 92 m cardboard covered in crumpled aluminum foil were taken in the center of the syracuse university quad 43 0376 n 76 1340 w away from buildings or overhanging vegetation we recorded tir images at different times over several days using a flir one camera aluminum foil has an emissivity of zero 0 03 0 07 lillesand et al 2015 so all radiant energy from the foil is reflected from the environment rather than related to the temperature of the foil images were taken under different sky conditions clear scattered clouds cloudy concurrent weather data were downloaded from the syracuse university meteorological station https onondaga weatherstem com syracuse 43 0382 n 76 1334 w the radiant temperatures of the foil pixels were then analyzed to determine the range in reflected sky temperatures to determine the effect reflected temperatures have on tir data accuracy eq 1 τ 1 was used to calculate theoretical measured radiant temperatures of specific kinetic temperatures for a range of reflected temperatures and water surface emissivity values the relationship between the reflected temperature and water surface emissivity along with the measured reflected sky temperatures were used to assess the estimated reflected temperatures for the tir images of the quilcay stream 3 results and discussion 3 1 uncorrected thermal infrared stream temperatures the uncorrected tir images do not provide accurate stream temperature data the maximum minimum and mean radiant temperatures from clusters of 9 pixels at each control point show similar temperatures and so the mean was used fig 5 uncorrected radiant stream temperatures have mean absolute errors of 5 67 c 2015 and 3 53 c 2016 with radiant temperatures typically colder than kinetic temperatures fig 5a b this difference between the in stream sensors and tir images is not due to thermal stratification because the three stream temperature profiles never differ by 0 32 c and two profiles never differ by 0 12 c in addition this error is too large to be from the presence of a thermal boundary layer skin temperature which is typically only 0 1 0 5 c less than the bulk water temperature zappa and jessup 1998 minnet et al 2001 jessup and branch 2008 and would be disrupted and mixed within the turbulent stream while tir errors vary through time errors at any given time are similar for all control points morning radiant stream temperatures rise prior to in stream temperatures fig 5a b in another study tir glacial temperatures rose prior to direct glacial surface temperatures which was attributed to reflected radiation aubry wake et al 2015 we believe the premature morning warming of radiant stream temperatures in the current study is due to reflected radiation from solar heating of the cliffs and banks which warm earlier than the stream on the valley floor puleo et al 2012 two periods during 2015 exhibit tir temperatures out of phase with the diurnal temperature signal fig 5a unlike the 2015 data all 2016 tir data follow the correct diurnal pattern the weather data from the two field periods are very similar fig 1 and so we do not believe these out of phase periods are due to changes in air temperature or relative humidity that affect the atmospheric transmissivity therefore these out of phase periods may result from the more oblique 2015 viewing angle and therefore more reflection or be due to interference from some atmospheric or surficial phenomena we failed to record overall the differences between the radiant and kinetic temperatures seem mainly the result of the interaction between reflected temperatures from the surrounding environment and water surface emissivity with the influence of reflection stronger in 2015 due to the more oblique viewing angle puleo et al 2012 3 2 analytically corrected tir stream temperatures tir stream temperatures were analytically corrected for atmospheric transmissivity τ stream surface emissivity ε and reflected temperatures trefl using eq 1 for this analytical correction method emissivity was first assumed to equal 0 96 according to previous hydrologic time lapse ground based tir studies cardenas et al 2011 cardenas et al 2014 the analytical correction resulted in mean absolute temperatures differences of 6 27 c and 3 79 c for 2015 and 2016 fig 5c d viewing angle based emissivity values of 0 80 75 and 0 88 70 were then used to correct the raw 2015 and 2016 tir data masuda et al 1988 producing mean absolute differences of 8 24 c and 4 00 c fig 5c d even if we had incorporated changing emissivity due to variations in wind speed at these viewing angles daytime tir stream temperatures which occurred during periods of high wind would only be slightly warmer than when emissivity was held constant according to the viewing angle 1 5 c warmer ε 0 853 with wind of 15 m s in 2015 and 0 5 c warmer ε 0 889 with wind of 15 m s in 2016 masuda et al 1988 therefore regardless of the emissivity value used corrected stream temperatures from the analytical method were colder than the uncorrected tir data and further from the kinetic stream temperatures the two variables in eq 1 with the greatest uncertainty are emissivity and reflected temperature the values of these variables are assumed while the rest are either measured or calculated since corrected radiant temperatures remain too cold when emissivity is decreased we conclude it is incorrect to assume the reflected temperatures equal the air temperatures 3 3 relationship between emissivity and reflected temperature since water surface emissivity varies with viewing angle fig 4a sidran 1981 masuda et al 1988 sobrino and cuenca 1999 we plotted the temperature difference between a kinetic stream temperature of 7 c and the measured radiant temperature resulting from a range of emissivity values and reflected temperatures fig 6 b when emissivity is 1 radiant temperatures measured by the camera equal kinetic temperatures regardless of the reflected temperature as emissivity decreases the reflected temperature has a greater influence on the measured tir temperature if the reflected temperature is warmer than the stream trefl tactual 0 measured radiant temperatures will exceed kinetic temperatures tmeas tactual 0 if the reflected temperature is colder than the stream trefl tactual 0 measured radiant temperatures will be colder than kinetic temperatures tmeas tactual 0 fig 6b saunders 1967 if the kinetic stream temperature is 7 c and emissivity equals 0 8 with reflected temperatures 10 c colder than the stream tir camera measurements will have an error of 1 9 c compared to the 0 4 c error when emissivity equals 0 96 fig 4b points x y even from nadir views ε 0 985 studies measuring ocean temperatures found reflections on days with clear skies could result in uncorrected temperatures up to 0 5 c colder than reality zappa and jessup 1998 therefore it is important to correctly determine the emissivity and reflected temperatures to accurately correct radiant stream temperatures while accurate surface emissivity values and reflected temperatures are important for absolute temperature corrections they are also important for comparing relative temperatures this is especially important if a stream is viewed obliquely as emissivity will vary along the stream due to viewing angle variation if a stream has a homogenous temperature of 7 c but is viewed obliquely the portion of the reach viewed at a lower angle 75 has an emissivity of 0 8 and a tir error of 3 2 c if reflected temperatures are 17 c colder than the stream fig 6b point w meanwhile the portion viewed at a less oblique angle 70 has an emissivity of 0 88 and a tir error of 1 9 c fig 6b point z this results in a 1 3 c temperature difference along the reach due to viewing angle differences rather than from actual temperature differences as emissivity decreases and the reflected temperatures become increasingly different from the stream temperatures tir errors increase this problem becomes more complex if the reflected temperature from the surrounding environment varies along the reach 3 4 estimated reflected temperatures of quilcay stream imagery we estimated the reflected temperature needed for the analytically corrected tir data to equal the temperatures recorded by the in stream sensors at our study site by assuming tsurface equaled the in stream temperature we solved for the reflected temperature through time using planck s law and eq 1 with constant emissivity and calculated atmospheric transmissivity calculated estimates of reflected temperatures for the quilcay stream data typically ranged from about 50 to 21 c for 2015 and from 60 to 18 c for 2016 fig s1 for both datasets estimated reflected temperatures were typically warmer during the day than night though sometimes cold reflected temperatures occurred during the day particularly during 2015 the reflected temperatures required to generate the observed radiant temperatures are not consistent with the assumption that the reflected temperature is well represented by observed air temperatures cardenas et al 2011 cardenas et al 2014 aubry wake et al 2015 3 5 observed reflected radiant sky temperatures to assess whether these inferred reflected temperatures are reasonable we measured reflected radiant sky temperatures under a range of conditions and times of day since the sky was the likeliest source of the cold reflected temperatures we estimated our observations show average reflected sky temperatures were colder than corresponding air temperatures and minimum reflected temperatures were as cold as approximately 40 c fig s2 similarly chen and zhang 1989 measured average reflected sky temperatures of 9 12 c and found sky temperatures were often 30 c cooler than ground temperatures other studies also cite radiant reflected clear sky temperatures of 18 c zappa and jessup 1998 and 20 to 50 c depending on location jessup and branch 2008 our measurements along with results from previous studies indicate the reflected sky temperatures are generally colder under clear skies and warmer under cloudy conditions fig 7 fig s3 saunders 1967 zappa and jessup 1998 under scattered clouds reflected sky temperatures exhibit more variability due to patches of sky with and without clouds fig 7 different cloud types located at different heights will emit different radiative temperatures donlon et al 2008 since the sky is a main source of the reflected temperature emitted from the environment at the field site in this study the range in tir temperatures that the sky exhibits influences the measurement of radiant stream temperatures for the quilcay site reflected temperatures could be even colder than those measured in syracuse since reflected sky temperatures are colder at higher elevation due to the thinner drier overlying atmosphere smith et al 1996 minnet et al 2001 other objects in the surrounding environment also produce reflected temperature errors especially during the day under clear sky conditions marruedo et al 2018 other sources of reflections are the cliffs and gravel banks which can sometimes emit the highest radiative temperatures tonolla et al 2010 during the day temperatures of the gravel bar and dry areas of the meadow can exceed 30 c based on ibutton data while at night ground temperatures can drop below 5 c therefore the range of reflected temperatures we estimated for the quilcay site are reasonable and typically not equal to air temperatures furthermore when surface roughness is low such as under low winds and calm water surfaces reflections are pronounced such reflections are less discernable under high winds and rough water surfaces zappa and jessup 1998 this could also explain why the measured nighttime stream temperatures which occur when the wind speed drops exhibit tir errors that are colder than daytime errors estimated daytime reflected temperatures may also be warmer than estimated nighttime reflected temperatures due to the mix of sky reflections with reflections from the cliffs and surrounding land surface which emit warm radiative temperatures during the day and cooler radiative temperatures at night while the sky was the main source of reflected radiation in our study other sources could be more important at sites with different characteristics for example on a stream mostly blocked by trees with minimal view of the sky the reflected temperature would mainly come from the surrounding trees and vegetation often resulting in warmer reflected temperatures than those from the sky 3 6 empirically corrected tir temperatures since the analytical correction method can be inaccurate due to errors estimating water surface emissivity and reflected temperature we also explored an empirical correction method three control points were used to determine the offset value of the stream temperatures from each tir image through time the remaining control points n 4 in 2015 and n 7 in 2016 were then used to assess the resulting error of empirically corrected stream temperatures the mean absolute temperature differences of the control points not used to determine the offset correction were 0 30 c and 0 16 c for 2015 and 2016 fig 5e f the empirical method reduced radiant stream temperature errors but certain time periods are more error prone particularly mornings in 2015 fig 5g h this empirical correction likely worked better in 2016 than in 2015 because the 2016 reach was shorter and so had less spatial variation in the reflected temperature and viewing angle making errors more consistent at any time overall the empirical correction improved ground based radiant temperatures more than the analytical correction similar to findings from aerial studies that used calibrations based on direct water temperature measurements wawrzyniak et al 2013 while the empirical correction method is more effective at reducing the tir stream temperature error limitations remain the empirical method does well correcting image scale reflections e g sky and cliff reflections but it cannot correct smaller scale reflections including those from patchy cloud cover objects such as trees and tall vegetation near the stream edge or rocky stream banks that emit large amount of radiant energy that interfere with the stream s thermal signal puleo et al 2012 in places where an insufficient number of pixels span the stream errors occur due to mixed pixels or thermal contamination from bank reflections previous work shows at least 10 pixels should span the stream to obtain uncontaminated temperatures torgersen et al 2001 here we limited our results to locations where there are 8 or more pixels spanning the width of the stream a final drawback of the empirical method is that the offset correction is unique to each data set and tir image and the correction factor changes through time due to factors such as weather conditions and site characteristics therefore direct temperature measurements must be made to create the offset correction applied to each tir image additionally if you are interested in measuring the tir temperature of multiple surface types e g water rock in an image you must apply a different correction factor to each surface type because their errors will be different due to their differing emissivities 3 7 tir stream temperature patterns kinetic temperature measurements show that quilcay stream temperatures are fairly uniform spatially despite the inflow of small tributaries movie s1 movie s2 however corrected radiant temperatures sometimes show warmer and cooler spots that are unsupported by the in stream measurements particularly problematic times occur when temperatures are rising or falling especially near where the stream narrows movie s1 upstream of control point 27 movie s2 control points 2 5 stream segments not spanned by at least 8 pixels have larger temperature anomalies during these periods likely due to thermal contamination from the stream bank additionally the reach between control points 10 and 11 sometimes shows artificially fast warming in the mornings due to thermal contamination from the adjacent gravel banks movie s2 while longitudinal stream temperatures typically show minor noise 0 5 c some periods during 2015 exhibit increased noise e g july 22 from 3 00 6 00 july 24 at 14 50 due to reflections caused by the oblique viewing angle puleo et al 2012 overall false temperature anomalies are more prevalent for 2015 than 2016 likely due to the more oblique viewing angle that decreases water surface emissivity and due to fewer buffer pixels between the stream banks and stream midline allowing for more contamination from bank reflections 3 8 comparison to previous time lapse ground based studies few studies have used time lapse ground based tir imagery to obtain kinetic stream surface temperatures but these studies have demonstrated similar tir temperature correction issues data from a time lapse ground based tir study assessing glacial surface temperatures also exhibits periods when the radiant and kinetic temperatures are out of phase and radiant temperatures warm in the morning prior to warming of kinetic temperatures aubry wake et al 2015 tir data from the study were adjusted using a 5 96 c offset correction after the analytical correction was applied εsnow 0 98 εice 0 97 trefl air temperature indicating the inputs used in the analytical method did not account for reflected temperatures that were colder than air temperatures and lower emissivity due to variations in the glacial surface another study used time lapse ground based tir imagery to analyze radiant stream temperature data over 24 h cardenas et al 2014 similarly morning radiant temperatures rose more quickly than kinetic in stream temperatures the study has a viewing angle comparable to our 2015 images with an oblique view that varies along the stream length and prevents numerous pixels from spanning the stream this could result in erroneous stream temperatures due to thermal contamination and assumptions about emissivity and reflected temperature values ε 0 96 and trefl air temperatures since the viewing angle varies 65 85 in these images with more oblique views of the upstream and downstream portions of the reach since the study only has one control point which is obscured from the camera s view it is uncertain whether observed upstream and downstream warming was due to warm inflows as the authors concluded or due to lower upstream and downstream water surface emissivity values enabling a greater proportion of the surrounding land temperatures which were always warmer than the stream to reflect off the stream thereby making these regions appear warmer 3 9 proposed methodological changes previous time lapse ground based tir studies have made incorrect generalizing assumptions about stream surface emissivity and reflected temperature values ε 0 96 and trefl air temperatures leading to applications of the analytical method that produced tir temperatures that may be incorrect or correct for the wrong reasons for example errors due to incorrectly high emissivity values at oblique viewing angles may be hidden if reflected temperatures are close in value to the temperature of the target object zappa and jessup 1998 experimental design should also be carefully considered to achieve high viewing angles and avoid designs where the viewing angle of the stream varies across the image altering the emissivity if the hydrologic community continues to use time lapse ground based tir imagery for extracting accurate stream temperatures e g for comparison to stream temperature energy balance model output then methodological changes must be considered one possible methodological change is implementation of the empirical approach instead of the analytical correction approach such that results do not rely on accurate values of emissivity and reflected temperature especially in environments where these variables are difficult to obtain another possibility is to draw on methodological best practices for tir sensing of sea surface temperature sst prior work in this area has demonstrated that accurate emissivity and reflected temperature values must be known to make accurate temperature corrections using the analytical method e g smith et al 1996 zappa and jessup 1998 minnet et al 2001 jessup and branch 2008 donlon et al 2008 to measure reflected temperatures prior investigators have used either multiple radiometers positioned at the same viewing angle to the sea and sky smith et al 1996 zappa and jessup 1998 minnet et al 2001 jessup and branch 2008 or dual port radiometers one radiometer with a rotating mirror that alternately directs sky and surface radiance into the detector donlon et al 2008 while the methods for tir sensing of sst still have limitations e g time of sky and sea measurement must be the same rough water surfaces with various orientations can receive different reflections greater spatial variability in reflected temperatures under scattered cloud conditions jessup and branch 2008 donlon et al 2008 they provide a methodology that may be an improvement from the incorrect assumptions often made when using the analytical approach for sensing stream and surface water temperatures 4 conclusions improvements in the accuracy and cost effectiveness of tir temperature sensing present an opportunity to obtain high resolution temperature records of streams and surface water through space and time such data can be used to map thermal heterogeneities in streams and to inform model simulations of stream temperatures however accurate tir sensing of stream and surface water temperatures remains a challenge due to the complexities surrounding correction of time lapse ground based tir imagery analytical corrections of tir temperatures that rely on assumed values of water emissivity and reflected temperatures are often ineffective because it is difficult to obtain a near zenith view of a stream from the ground this leads to uncertainty in the emissivity values along stream reaches due to the non linear relationship between emissivity and viewing angle as emissivity decreases correct quantification of reflected temperatures becomes increasingly important and cannot be assumed to equal air temperature however it is difficult to measure reflected temperatures along an entire stream reach as they can vary both spatially and temporally though measurement of reflected temperatures could be improved by using multiple or dual port radiometers empirical corrections based on the observed offset between in situ sensors and tir radiant temperatures are partially effective at correcting radiant stream temperatures as this method corrects image scale reflections without needing the emissivity and reflected temperature values to be known however neither method corrects for small scale reflections that can occur such as those from localized gravel bars or overhanging vegetation both methods have greater error when the viewing angle varies along the stream reach and when too few pixels span the stream width allowing thermal contamination from the banks due to uncertainty in reflected temperatures and emissivity values it may be difficult to accurately measure absolute stream temperatures and temperature differences along a reach using ground based tir sensing therefore while ground based tir remains informative for identifying locations of relative stream temperature difference caution should be taken when drawing conclusions about environmental processes from absolute tir temperature data conflict of interest the authors declared that there is no conflict of interest

6634,soil erosion accelerates the degradation of semiarid ecosystems how to explain the erosion processes is increasingly attracting scientists and practitioners attention in this study we hypothesized the intensity and uncertainty of runoff and sediment events as the ecological function of soil erosion by using structural equation modeling sem and integrated observed influencing factors to represent the ecological structure of soil erosion we further assessed the interactions of ecological structures and functions in four typical patch covers containing bare patch b type andropogon patch g type artemisia coparia patch h type and spiraea pubescens patch j type in the loess plateau over three rainy seasons we found that 1 the highest and lowest probabilities of runoff approaching to 0 37 and 0 22 and sediment approaching to 0 27 and 0 03 events were in b and j types respectively b type produced the highest runoff coefficients 0 004 and yielded 2 3 times more sediment than other three vegetation patch covers 2 antecedent soil moisture and crown width were two relative more crucial indicators to simultaneously affect the uncertainty and intensity of soil erosion in different patch cover patterns 3 soil saturated hydraulic conductivity connected the soil and plant latent variables to indicate the complexity of ecological structure 4 the measurement error of sediment yield became the main source of system error of the soil erosion assessment by sem these results suggest that the uncertainty of runoff and sediment event was an important descriptor to improve the interpretation of ecological function of soil erosion the logistic regression and sem form a new analysis framework to explore the interaction between ecological structure and function of soil erosion this framework could enhance the understanding of erosion processes and be beneficial to managing the restoration vegetation and utilizing the available water and soil resources in semiarid environment keywords structural equation modeling logistic regression patch cover restoration soil erosion ecological structure and function 1 introduction soil erosion is one of most urgent global environmental problems leading to the soil deterioration land productivity reduction and ecosystem function degradation bowker et al 2008 portenga and bierman 2011 especially affected by climate change and negative anthropogenic activities the erosion processes have been accelerated raclot et al 2018 erosive precipitation accelerates soil and water loess whereas vegetation patches obstruct runoff and sediment that increases vegetation growth ludwig et al 2005 puigdefábregas 2005 the interactive effects of these influencing factors are tightly coupled and form various erosive patterns impacting on ecosystem s health and service ludwig et al 2006 therefore several researchers have developed methods to explore the mechanism of runoff and sediment generation arnau rosalen et al 2008 kumar and kushwaha 2013 and also have proposed models to simulate the effectiveness of erosive processes contributors kinnell 2010 puigdefábregas 2005 however due to complex interactions between rainfall soil and vegetation coupling with ecological and hydrological processes ludwig et al 2005 it is still a challenge to comprehensively understand the erosion phenomenon and to evaluate the effect of erosive processes ecological structures and functions constitute the ecological integrity to be used to describe some specific ecological processes analyze interactions between complex ecological components and evaluate the capacity of ecosystems to support resources capmourteres and anand 2016 sutton grier et al 2010 in ecosystems soil erosion is one of typical ecological process dominating the runoff and sediment processes ecological structures and functions of soil erosion are reshaped by some excessive or accumulative erosive process bautista et al 2007 puigdefábregas 2005 and finally constitute the integrity of soil erosion from perspective of ecosystem integrity sutton grier et al 2010 the ecological structure components of soil erosion include ecosystems physical conditions i e precipitation vegetation and soil forming the background and precondition of runoff and sediment events generation the study of the ecological structure of soil erosion concentrated on how uncertainty of the raindrop distributions are to trigger sediment transferring kinnell 2005 salles et al 2000 how variability of the vegetation patterns are to structure erosion fluxes bautista et al 2007 eldridge et al 2010 wainwright et al 2000 and how diversity of the soil inherent structural stabilities are to infiltrate overflow bowker et al 2008 chamizo et al 2012 rodríguez caballero et al 2014 these evidences manifest that the complexity of ecological structure of soil erosion results in the variability of hydrological behaviors causing different erosive processes meanwhile with the view of ecological integrity capmourteres and anand 2016 the ecological function of soil erosion represent the transferring of erosive energy and migration of soil water material through the whole erosive processes these erosive energy and materials are generally quantified by runoff production and sediment yield to indicate the hydrological effect of erosive processes on ecosystems many studies also focused on ecological functions of soil erosion which includes the investigating the effects of kinetic energy and size distribution of raindrops on the overflow production and sediment transport fernandez raga et al 2017 li et al 2000 salles et al 2000 wang et al 2014 modeling the roles of plant canopy and litter layer on reducing the rainfall and runoff energy and soil particles detachment and transportation to prevent splash and rill gully erosion patterns frasson and krajewski 2013 liu et al 2018 nanko et al 2008 as well as assessing the soil erodibility and suspended sediment disposability to explore the soil erosion mechanism and corresponding conservation practices miao et al 2016 ding and huang 2017 keller and hakansson 2010 martinez mena et al 2002 slattery and burt 1997 these reports imply that the diversity of ecological function of soil erosion could be generalized as the intensity of soil erosion event containing various energy exchange patterns and material circulation types forming the crucial driving force to affect the stability of ecosystems consequently it is essential to illuminate the ecological structure function relationships for soil erosion some typical methods i e revised universal soil loess equation rusle empirical models bowker et al 2008 trigger transfer reserve pulse ttrp conceptual framework ludwig et al 2005 and erosive source sink landscape theory de vente et al 2016 xu et al 2017 were applied to explore how the structure contributors of erosion generation determined function magnitude of erosion energies and materials during erosive process in different ecosystems these methods connect the ecological structure and function related to erosive processes forming some effective frameworks to assess the integrity of soil erosion however there also exist an insufficiency of studying on the integrity of soil erosion firstly it is need to integrate the intensity and uncertainty of soil erosion events to comprehensively describe the ecological function of soil erosion on which however was insufficient for ecological and hydrological studies the uncertainty of soil erosion events is an important factor for describing the integrity of soil erosion zhou et al 2017 it characterizes how the stochasticity of random signal torri et al 1997 sidorchuk 2009 rather than the energy and material crave and davy 2001 moore 2007 sidorchuk 2009 of driving force transmit to the whole erosive processes on event scale in different ecosystems angulo martinez and barros 2015 goebes et al 2015 therefore the uncertainty of soil erosion event could be another important component of ecological function secondly few studies concentrated on the interactive effects of erosive ecological structures on the uncertainty and intensity of soil erosion bowker et al 2008 chamizo et al 2012 zhou et al 2016 specifically the complex interactions between rainfall vegetation and soil during erosion processes could probably increase the uncertainty of runoff and sediment generation consequently it is need to augment the indicators to more effectively identify the integrity of soil erosion to further explore the interaction between erosive ecological structures and functions which could be benefit for more compressively interpreting the erosion phenomenon with the view of ecology and hydrology in this study we aim to improve the identification of ecological structure and function of soil erosion analyze the relationship between erosive ecological structure function and assess the integrity of erosion in different patch covers in the loess plateau in this typical semiarid environment we have conducted systematic long term field experiments and studies on the ecohydrological processes i e the investigation of ecological and hydrological response of runoff and sediment at runoff plots liu et al 2012 zhu et al 2015 the analysis of soil moisture dynamics in different restoration vegetation wang et al 2013 zhou et al 2015 as well as the assessment of ecosystem service in this typical water limited environment fu et al 2011 thus the hypothesis of this research was that 1 the stochasticity and intensity of erosion events constitute relative complete ecological function of soil erosion which was exerted by erosive ecological structure 2 and both of the function and structure finally form the soil erosion intensity therefore we have set three specific objectives and applied general linear regression and structural equation modeling to test this hypothesis in the study including 1 to quantify the characteristics of randomness and intensity of soil erosion event in different patch covers 2 to analyze the factors influencing uncertainty and intensity of erosion event and the differences between the contributions of corresponding factors 3 and to integrate the erosion stochasticity and intensity into erosion phenomenon according to interrelationships between contributing factors 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area the study was conducted in the yangjuangou catchment 36 42 n 109 31 e 2 02 km2 which is located in the hilly gully region of the loess plateau in yan an of china fig 1 a a semi arid climate in the study area is mainly affected by north china monsoon and the average temporature is 9 5 degree the rainy season spans from june to september and the annual average precipitation reaches approximately 533 mm indicating significant inter annual varability in this typical semi arid environment the soil type in this area is calcaric cambisol soil fao unesco 1974 with weak physical structures being vulnerable to water erosion liu et al 2012 the erosive precipiation souring the high erodibility soil lead to the serious soil and water losses casuing the ecosystem degradtion in the loess plateau before the 1980s miao et al 2010 wang et al 2015 subsequently the grain for green project was extensively implemented in the loess plateau to prevent the water erosion numerous steep sloped corplands were abandoned restored or naturally recovered through the development of shrub and herbaceous plants to gradually maintain soil and water resources cao et al 2009 in the yangjuangou catchment land covers on hillslopes are mainly dominated by restoration plants and natural recovery vegetation such as andropogon artemisia coparia spiraea pubescens armeniaca sibirica robinia pseudoacacia linn lespedeza davurica aspicilia fruticose and some bare patches are also distributed along hillslopes 2 2 experimental design in this study we designed microplot systems fig 1d to represent four typical patch covers containing the bare patch cover b type andropogon patch cover g type artemisia coparia patch cover h type and spiraea pubescens patch cover j type fig 1e for each patch cover four closed microplots were distributed on a southwest facing hillslope with a 26 8 aspect and the boundaries of each microplot were perpendicularly fenced into 50 cm depth soil by using some impervious polyvinylchloride pvc sheets the collection transmission system in each microplot 60 60 cm consisted of a collection trough and a storage bucket fig 1d we took a model 2800 k1 guelph permeameter fig 1b soilmoisture equipment corp santa barbara ca usa to determine the average soil saturated hydraulic conductivity shc and applied the s smc m005 soil moisture probes decagon devices inc pullman wa usa to monitor the real time dynamic of soil moisture at 10 min intervals all the soil moisture data collected by hobo weather station logger fig 1c represent the average antecedent soil moisture asm before each rainfall event we also measured the average crown diameter cro plant height hig and litter layer thickness tll of each vegetation microplot bonham 1989 for 12 times over the three rainy seasons which reflect the basic morphological properties of the three different vegetation patch cover types meanwhile we monitored the natural rainfall processes by using tipping bucket rain collector davis instruments diablo hayward ca usa with accuracy being 0 2 mm next to these microplots we totally recorded 73 rainfall events over three rainy seasons from 2011 to 2013 calculated the precipitation prec and intensity int of each rainfall event finally based on the former study to define the random events about soil erosion and precipitation zhou et al 2017 we recorded the times of runoff and sediment random event generation in each microplot system over each rainy season and the detail information was showed in results we gathered the runoff and sediment in collecting bottles fig 1d separated the runoff and sediment by setting the collecting bottles for 24 h dried at 105 c for 8 h and then calculated the runoff coefficient run c and weighed the sediment yield sed y the main physical and hydrological properties of soil samples in different patch covers were collected and measured table 1 2 3 data analysis in this study we employed the one way analysis of variance anova to estimate the significant difference of soil erosion intensity and performed regression analysis to estimate the effect of influencing factors on intensity and uncertainty of soil erosion firstly based on the log transformation for the data of runoff coefficient run c and sediment yield sed y to satisfy the normality we performed multiple stepwise linear regression analysis against all independent variables related to rainfall soil and vegetation to runoff coefficient and sediment yield in four patch covers secondly we applied multiple logistic regression analysis on estimating the effect of rainfall soil and vegetation on the randomness of runoff events run e and sediment events sed e generating in different patch covers specifically when a runoff or sediment random event was generated by a single erosive rainfall random event the value of run e or sed e was assigned to 1 and if the erosion event was not triggered by a rainfall event the value of run e or sed e equals 0 and finally we made probabilistic assessments of the effect of soil rainfall and vegetation on the stochastic of runoff and sediment generation the detailed algorithm of logistic regression analysis on soil erosion random events was deduced by former study zhou et al 2017 based on the results of the stepwise linear regression and logistic regression we determined the influencing factors that have a significant relationship with these independent variables and further evaluated the relative importance of these influencing factors on the intensity and uncertainty of soil erosion in the study the anova data transformation multiple regression analysis relative importance evaluation as well as dealing with missing data of soil moisture due to the technique problem were depended on the statsr https cran r project org web packages statsr index html multcomp https cran r project org web packages multcomp index html and car https cran r project org web packages car index html packages of r program 2 4 structural equation modeling the structural equation modeling sem is a problem oriented theoretical model to combine concrete a priori knowledge with statistical analysis which can deal with complete body of specific and available knowledge grace 2006 moreover sem can specifically determine the causal relationships between potential independent and dependent variables and systematically testify the interactive effects of complex contributing factors of responsive results grace 2006 therefore based on these advantages of sem it has been applied to deal with many challenging problems in ecological studies austin 2007 larson and grace 2004 texeira et al 2012 we employed the sem to integrate intensity and uncertainty of erosion event and to further evaluate the interactive effects of ecological structure function related to soil erosion the priori sem model related to soil erosion was described by fig 2 in this model the observed variables squares in fig 2 can be directly measured in the field observation the latent variables circles in fig 2 however represent some comprehensive concepts or complex phenomena that cannot be directly measured the casual and correlative relationships among the two types of variables were connected by the single arrows and two way arrows respectively additionally a typical sem contains two important components one is the confirmatory factor analysis cfa to estimate the relation between observed variables and latent variables and the other is structural equation seq to quantify the relationships between latent variables according to the description statistics of vegetation soil rainfall and antecedent soil moisture properties we graded the observed variables to meet the requirement of the sem construction table 2 on the one hand we connected the measurable intensity and uncertainty of soil erosion with the immeasurable soil erosion phenomenon to test whether the stochasiticity of erosion event could be another crucial indicator to implement and represent the ecological function of soil erosion meanwhile we generalized the latent variables including soil soil vegetation plant and precipitation rain to characterize ecological structure related to the soil erosion on the other hand we linked the latent variables to test how the ecological structure affects the ecological function of soil erosion the algorithm of prior sem model of soil erosion was described in appendix a finally we determined the mean and variance adjusted weighed least square wlsmv to estimate the prior model and employed the goodness of fit index gfi tucker lewis index tli and root mean square error of approximation rmsea to estimate the fitness of this prior model we combined modification indices mis with soil erosion theories to drive the creation of a series of modified sems to meet the requirement of the variables validity and sem s reliability the sem model evaluation and modification was completed by using mplus 7 0 statistical program geiser 2010 table 3 summarized the algorithmic properties of logistic regression and sem 3 results 3 1 the erosive uncertainty in different patch covers there were 73 random rainfall events occurred during three rainy seasons from 2011 to 2013 the times of random runoff and sediment events generation in 16 microplots over four patch cover types were recorded in fig 3 a and b respectively the average times of random soil erosion events generation in each microplot of bare patch cover b type including b1 b4 microplots was maximum with the average probability of random runoff and sediment events reaching to 0 37 and 0 27 respectively fig 3c and d from b type to j type the times of random soil erosion events gradually reduce with the minimum average probability of random runoff and sediment events in j type including j1 j4 microplot only approaching to 0 22 and 0 03 respectively furthermore table 4 concluded the values and significances of log odds ration regression coefficients to evaluate the probabilistic effects of environmental factors on the randomness of soil erosion events in different patch covers firstly for all patch cover pattern precipitation prec p 0 001 and p 0 01 plant crown width grade cro p 0 001 and p 0 001 antecedent soil moisture asm p 0 05 and p 0 001 and soil saturated hydraulic conductivity shc p 0 05 and p 0 01 exerted significant effect on the probability of runoff and sediment events occurrence respectively when other independent variables are unchanged every one grade of shc or cro increase and the odds ratio of random runoff events 0 79 odds p 0 05 for shc and 0 15 odds p 0 01 for cro and sediment events 0 46 odds p 0 01 for shc and 0 17odds p 0 001 for cro could reduce which implied that the increasing grades of shc or cro could have significant negative effect on the probability of random soil erosion events in different extents however the increasing grades of precipitation prec or antecedent soil moisture asm exerted significant positive effect on the occurrence of random runoff and sediment events secondly the average crown width grade cro in vegetation patch cover patterns was a significant negative influencing factor in stochastic of soil erosion 0 14 odds and p 0 001 for runoff events 0 11 odds and p 0 001 for sediment events prec and asm were two important significant positive influencing factors to affect the uncertainty of random runoff event in individual patch covers 3 2 the erosive intensity in different patch covers the erosive intensity was measured by runoff coefficient run c and sediment yield sed y as showed in fig 4 a and c the average runoff coefficient in bare patch cover b type including b1 b4 microplot was significant highest approaching 0 004 p 0 001 than other three patch covers under the same rainfall event the average runoff coefficient produced in high shrub patch cover j type including j1 j4 was significant lower approaching 0 0001 p 0 05 than grass patch cover g type including g1 g4 approaching 0 002 meanwhile fig 4b and d showed that the sediment yield sed y in bare patch was nearly 2 3 times larger than vegetation patch covers however there was no significant different p 0 1 between the sediment yield in three vegetation patch covers in the same random rainfall events additionally table 5 indicated the multiple regression coefficients and their significant properties to analyze the effects of environmental factors on the erosion intensity in different patch cover patterns four indicators including precipitation average crown width grade cro antecedent soil moisture asm and soil saturated hydraulic conductivity shc have significant effects on the runoff coefficient and sediment yield in all patch cover pattern specifically when other independent variables are unchanged the increasing of precipitation and antecedent soil moisture could increase the runoff coefficient and sediment yield however the average crown width grade cro and average soil saturated hydraulic connectivity shc reveal negative effects on the intensity of runoff and sediment in different patch cover patterns the stepwise multiple linear regression models for explanation of runoff coefficient and sediment yield variability ranged from 16 to 59 and from 31 to 73 respectively 3 3 the relative importance of significant factors to soil erosion according to the above generalized linear regression analysis we further described the relative importance of precipitation antecedent soil moisture average crown width grade and average soil saturated hydraulic connectivity to soil erosion by comparing the contribution of different grades of the four factors table 2 to the uncertainty and intensity of soil erosion in patch cover patterns figs 5 8 as to all patch cover pattern figs 5 and 6 when the grades increased from minimum to maximum the probability increasing rate of random runoff from 0 029 to 1 and sediment from 0 036 to 0 903 event generation for precipitation were similar with the increasing rate of probability of random runoff from 0 217 to 0 427 and sediment 0 031 to 0 466 event generation for antecedent soil moisture these probabilistic increasing rates were more significant higher than the increasing rate of runoff coefficients and sediment yield as the same precipitation and antecedent soil moisture grade increasing meanwhile the effect of the increasing of average plant crown width from low to extreme grade on the decreasing of probability of random runoff from 0 925 to 0 033 and sediment from 0 764 to 0 006 events generation is significant higher than that of the increasing of soil saturated hydraulic conductivity grade from low to extreme grade that lead to the probability of random runoff and sediment event generation to decrease from 0 253 to 0 175 and from 0 159 to 0 039 respectively as to the vegetation patch cover pattern figs 7 and 8 when the grades increased from minimum to maximum the probability increasing rate of random runoff event from 0 020 to 1 and sediment event generation from 0 028 to 0 755 for precipitation were significant higher than the increasing rates of probability of random runoff from 0 209 to 0 497 and sediment generation from 0 039 to 0 077 for antecedent soil moisture moreover the increasing of average plant crown width from mid to extreme grade significantly decreased the probability of random runoff from 0 464 to 0 021 and sediment event from 0 140 to 0 005 generation respectively but with the increasing of soil saturated hydraulic conductivity grade from mid to high grade the decreased rates of probability of random runoff from 0 183 to 0 135 and sediment from 0 069 to 0 061 event were not obvious so were the decreased rate of runoff coefficient from 0 0011 to 0 001 and sediment yield from 1 26 to 0 98 g in the supplementary material we further compared the contribution of grade differences of the precipitation and antecedent soil moisture to the uncertainty and intensity of soil erosion in individual patch cover table s1 and s2 consequently provided other variables unchanged the average crown width grade was a relative more important indicator to affect both of erosive uncertainty and intensity the uncertainty of soil erosion is more sensitive to the changing of precipitation and antecedent soil moisture grades than that of intensity of soil erosion but the soil saturated hydraulic connectivity indicated relative less importance for the randomness and intensity of erosion events in different patch cover patterns 3 4 the integrity of soil erosion in sem as to all patch cover pattern fig 9 a the uncertainty run e sed e and intensity run c sed y of soil erosion were integrated into two exogenous latent variables run sed to conceptualize the ecological function of soil erosion the uncertainty of soil erosion run e and sed e with loading factor being 1 479 and 1 159 respectively p 0 001 was seem to exert significant higher effect on the ecological function of soil erosion than that of the intensity of soil erosion did run c and sed y with loading factor being 0 574 and 0 792 respectively p 0 001 other observed indicators were integrated into three endogenous latent variables plant soil rain to conceptualize the ecological structure related to soil erosion the precipitation grade prec l and antecedent soil moisture grade asm l may characterize the main ecological structure probably triggering the soil erosion due to the two observed indicators with the highest loading factors of the endogenous latent variables plant and soil respectively moreover the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity grade shc l was the common indicator of plant and soil latent variables with it having the different loading factors 0 848 for plant 0 421 for soil both of the two endogenous latent variables soil and rain have a significant positive effect on the exogenous latent variable sed with the path coefficients being 0 653 p 0 01 and 0 385 p 0 01 respectively the path coefficient between the latent variable plant and sed was 0 316 p 0 01 the whole sem could explain the 67 5 variance of sed more statistical information of loading factors in all patch cover pattern was indicated in table s3 of supplementary material as to vegetation patch cover pattern in fig 9b the endogenous latent variable r s short for rain and soil was integrated by six observed indicators of the rainfall and soil properties r s exerted significant positive effect on the run and sed with the path coefficients being 1 594 p 0 05 and 1 084 p 0 05 respectively the endogenous latent variable plant however have significant negative effect on the run and sed with the path coefficients indicating 0 853 p 0 001 and 0 669 p 0 05 respectively the sem explained the 55 8 variance of run and 58 1 variance of sed table s4 indicated the statistical property of all loading factors in vegetation patch cover pattern finally the sem of individual patch cover and corresponding statistical property of loading factors were concluded in supporting information fig s1 tables s5 s8 4 discussion 4 1 integrating the ecological function related to soil erosion the logistic and multiple regression analysis constitute a generalized linear modeling to describe how the random signals and energies of rainfall events transmit into runoff and sediment events under different soil and plant conditions the result suggested that there probably exist distinct trigger mechanisms for the randomness and intensity of soil erosion events due to the different sensitivities of the randomness and intensity of soil erosion to the increasing grades of precipitation antecedent soil moisture and morphological structure of vegetation figs 5 8 specifically the logistic regression that combined the probability theory and logistic function hosmer et al 2013 systematically explored the stochastic mechanism of runoff and sediment events zhou et al 2017 depending on long term observational data and reasonable probabilistic assumptions in fact as an event based probabilistic analysis logistic regression estimated the probability of erosion generation based on random event scale to suggest that the stochasticity of runoff and sediment generation was another crucial component of ecological function related to soil erosion especially under the background of climate change that probably lead to increase the occurrence probability of rainfall events with extreme erosivity this data driven stochastic method is an important supplement to previous those concept driven stochastic methods that concentrate on various water balance principle or complex hydraulic mechanisms of overland flow to understand the probabilistic property of soil erosion laio et al 2001 moore 2007 rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 on the other hand sem further proved that the randomness and intensity of runoff and sediment can be integrated to describe the complex erosion processes in the study the loading factors of uncertainty of erosion event even exceed the loading factors of intensity of erosion event in different patch cover patterns figs 9 and s1 this result suggests that to some extent in the field experiment adding the uncertainty information of erosion generation into the traditional recording the intensity of soil erosion is probably more important and necessary to comprehensively describe the erosion phenomenon some researchers applied the sem to evaluate the comprehensive effects of multiple influencing factors i e slope soil types plant patterns etc on the intensity of erosion processes which stressed that the both of runoff production and sediment yield were important indicators to describe the ecological function related to soil erosion chamizo et al 2012 hu et al 2014 zhou et al 2016 however the sem applied in this study illuminated that the randomness of runoff and sediment event generation was another necessary indicator to describe the uncertainty of erosion processes from stochastic perspective as well as an important predictor to interpret the ecological function related to soil erosion therefore the intensity and uncertainty of random runoff and sediment events were combined in sem to characterize the ecological function related to soil erosion which improve the understanding of the erosion phenomenon 4 2 evaluating the ecological function structure relationship the sem fig 9 indicated that the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity become the common component of the plant morphology and soil properties both of which were two important ecological structures affecting soil erosion in this study area as to the essential of soil matrix the soil hydraulic connectivity is an indispensable index to quantify soil physical property to affect the infiltration processes occurring in soil surface or subsurface smith et al 2002 the weak soil structure with less micro or macropores could prevent the overland flow or interflow from transporting into deep layer or moving out of soil layer system schluter et al 2018 the inhibiting effects of infiltration capacity on contribution of runoff and sediment generation was actually verified and quantified by the path coefficients between latent variables in sem some studies puigdefábregas 2005 rodríguez caballero et al 2014 zhou et al 2017 have pointed out that at the beginning stage of overland generation on the slope the soil layer with higher hydraulic connectivity have reinfiltration function that leads to single overland flows with different flow directions have less opportunity to converge on slope to gather enough erosive energy therefore this reinfiltration function changes the overland flow pattern from runoff to runon and finally reduces the risks of runoff generation and the required energy of sediment transportation as to the plant morphology soil hydraulic connectivity is an important index to imply the property of plant root system the root system can redistribute the size and density of soil pore and change the mechanical and hydrological mechanism of soil structure which improve the anti erosive capabilities of the soil matrix de baets et al 2007 gyssels et al 2005 li et al 2017 in particular the macrospores formed by the root system of soil layer could increase the soil hydraulic connectivity to significantly raise the intensity and frequency of the reinfiltration generation of overland flow therefore the soil hydraulic properties can link soil and plant properties that act key roles on infiltrating overland flow and on reducing sediment transportation sems in the study manifest the complexity of ecological structure of soil erosion through a relative simplified data driven modeling and offer a more comprehensive view of improvement of the infiltration capacities to conserves more water inputs and effectively inhibit soil erosion the sem in the study also further connected latent variables to quantify the negative and positive effects of vegetation and precipitation on the soil erosion respectively this result was consistent with several previous studies bautista et al 2007 descheemaeker et al 2006 jost et al 2012 zhu et al 2015 essentially the result explored how the ecological structure determines the ecological function associated with soil erosion processes these structure function interactions mainly contained that the interception of rainfall by crown structure above the topsoil muzylo et al 2009 the throughfall absorption by the litter layer on soil surface leys et al 2010 and the reinfiltration runoff by root system in deep soil layer puigdefábregas 2005 the ecological structure reshaped the vertical distribution of rainfall and established a complex soil and water conservation system to indirectly transform the stochastic signal and energy of rainfall into overland flows through the accumulation and infiltration of water inputs in terms of the antecedent soil moisture and soil hydraulic connectivity indicators of sems meanwhile this indirect transformation could prevent precipitation from directly producing overland flows and ultimately reduce the significance of causal relationships between properties of rainfall and runoff in sems sem also can evaluate the measurement error that is neglected by the traditional linear regression statistical method wang 2012 in the study the main source of measurement error of soil erosion evaluation came from the sediment yield collection figs 9 and s1 the more complicated the plant canopy structure is from g to j type the larger the measurement error of corresponding sediment yield became fig s1 this result suggests that in plot scale the different vegetation patch cover patterns could cause different extents of erosion measurement error in fact the complex morphological properties of vegetation patch can diversify the vertical redistribution pattern of rainfall increase the uncertainty of the effect of splash erosion in plot scale and finally introduce more inevitable uncontrolled and systematic errors into the whole ecohydrological and erosion processes which ultimately increase measurement error of soil erosion boix fayos et al 2007 systematically reviewed the sources of variations in soil erosion measurements at the field scale and pointed out that the complexity and diversity of ecosystems spatiotemporal scale cause the main source of measuring error of soil erosion this discovery in sem indicate that the complexity of the ecological structure could be another important source of variation in soil erosion measurements and could be another important supplement to the former studies boix fayos et al 2006 2007 4 3 contributions of multiple modeling to understanding soil erosion in the study the data driven generalized linear regression and theory driven sem could constitute a new strategy for evaluating soil erosion behavior because on the one hand the logistic regression in this strategy stressed the importance of randomness of runoff and sediment events for describing erosion processes it could be a convenient and applicable tool for assessing the impact of crucial factors on the uncertainty of soil erosion under complex conditions zhou et al 2017 and it also enrich the implication of ecologcial function related to soil erosion and probably serves as a meaningful guide for soil erosion monitoring and selection of restoration vegetation to improve the risk management of soil erosion in the water limited environment on the anther hand the sem in the strategy compared the relative importance of factors affecting the runoff and sediment events to summarize the complexity of ecological structure related to soil erosion especially the error evaluation and confirmatory factor analysis in sem suggest researchers to take more careful consideration of the systematic error during erosion measurement and to probably explore to inclusion of additional factors to improve the describing and predicting of ecological structure of soil erosion moreover this strategy introduced the latent variables into sem to further test the hypothesis about the interaction relationship between ecological structure and function of soil erosion as well as to systematically assess the integrity of soil erosion in fact according to the principles of sem the application of latent variables represents two most important essence of sem theoretical innovation and practical exploration grace 2006 however the relatively complex process of modifying sems to satisfy the validity and reliability testing complicated the application of sem analysis framework with latent variables which lead to the sem with latent variables is rarely used to address the complex ecological and hydrological researches therefore the latent variable employed in this study was different from previous studies that only based on observed indicators in sem chamizo et al 2012 eldridge et al 2010 verheyen and hermy 2001 zhou et al 2016 which finally developed the predictive level of comprehending soil erosion in the table 6 we summaries the main representative sem methods applying on ecological and hydrological studies and illustrates the developments in the integrated assessment of soil erosion however there also need to necessary activities to improve the integrated assessment method it could be include the developing a more reasonable classification system of observation variables and designing more accurate measurement approaches to evaluate soil erosion under precipitation varied by different regions sun et al 2018 in the loess plateau restoration vegetation has deeply affected soil erosion generation in typical water limited environments characterized by complex ecohydrological condition fu et al 2011 furthermore given the accumulation of experimental data in this area data and theory driven integrated assessment could serve as powerful tools for studying soil erosion in this area ultimately providing useful information for the management of restoration vegetation to more effectively utilize the available water and soil resources 5 conclusion in the study we applied the generalized regression and sem to analyze the characteristics and interactions of ecological structure and function related to soil erosion of different patch covers in semi arid environment the bare patch cover has the highest probability of runoff 0 37 and sediment generation 0 27 the lowest probability of runoff 0 22 and sediment 0 03 generation were in high shrub patch cover the average runoff coefficient was highest 0 004 in bare patch cover which produced 2 to 3 times more sediment than other vegetation patch cover on the one hand the generalized regression is a convenient and applicable method to illuminate that the morphological properties of vegetation patches are more relative important factors to affect the uncertainty and intensity of soil erosion event than that of precipitation and soil moisture on the other hand the sem is an innovative theory driven analysis method to integrate the uncertainty and intensity of runoff and sediment to enrich the ecological function of soil erosion it also manifests that the soil hydraulic conductivity can link soil to plant properties to describe the complexity of ecological structure of soil erosion sem further explores that sediment measurement error is the main source of system variation and finally constructs the effect of ecological structure on ecological function of soil erosion in different patch cover patterns in the study the generalized regression and sem constitutes a new strategy that can systematically assess the effects of rainfall soil and vegetation on erosion processes from perspective of stochasticity and energy the strategy

6634,soil erosion accelerates the degradation of semiarid ecosystems how to explain the erosion processes is increasingly attracting scientists and practitioners attention in this study we hypothesized the intensity and uncertainty of runoff and sediment events as the ecological function of soil erosion by using structural equation modeling sem and integrated observed influencing factors to represent the ecological structure of soil erosion we further assessed the interactions of ecological structures and functions in four typical patch covers containing bare patch b type andropogon patch g type artemisia coparia patch h type and spiraea pubescens patch j type in the loess plateau over three rainy seasons we found that 1 the highest and lowest probabilities of runoff approaching to 0 37 and 0 22 and sediment approaching to 0 27 and 0 03 events were in b and j types respectively b type produced the highest runoff coefficients 0 004 and yielded 2 3 times more sediment than other three vegetation patch covers 2 antecedent soil moisture and crown width were two relative more crucial indicators to simultaneously affect the uncertainty and intensity of soil erosion in different patch cover patterns 3 soil saturated hydraulic conductivity connected the soil and plant latent variables to indicate the complexity of ecological structure 4 the measurement error of sediment yield became the main source of system error of the soil erosion assessment by sem these results suggest that the uncertainty of runoff and sediment event was an important descriptor to improve the interpretation of ecological function of soil erosion the logistic regression and sem form a new analysis framework to explore the interaction between ecological structure and function of soil erosion this framework could enhance the understanding of erosion processes and be beneficial to managing the restoration vegetation and utilizing the available water and soil resources in semiarid environment keywords structural equation modeling logistic regression patch cover restoration soil erosion ecological structure and function 1 introduction soil erosion is one of most urgent global environmental problems leading to the soil deterioration land productivity reduction and ecosystem function degradation bowker et al 2008 portenga and bierman 2011 especially affected by climate change and negative anthropogenic activities the erosion processes have been accelerated raclot et al 2018 erosive precipitation accelerates soil and water loess whereas vegetation patches obstruct runoff and sediment that increases vegetation growth ludwig et al 2005 puigdefábregas 2005 the interactive effects of these influencing factors are tightly coupled and form various erosive patterns impacting on ecosystem s health and service ludwig et al 2006 therefore several researchers have developed methods to explore the mechanism of runoff and sediment generation arnau rosalen et al 2008 kumar and kushwaha 2013 and also have proposed models to simulate the effectiveness of erosive processes contributors kinnell 2010 puigdefábregas 2005 however due to complex interactions between rainfall soil and vegetation coupling with ecological and hydrological processes ludwig et al 2005 it is still a challenge to comprehensively understand the erosion phenomenon and to evaluate the effect of erosive processes ecological structures and functions constitute the ecological integrity to be used to describe some specific ecological processes analyze interactions between complex ecological components and evaluate the capacity of ecosystems to support resources capmourteres and anand 2016 sutton grier et al 2010 in ecosystems soil erosion is one of typical ecological process dominating the runoff and sediment processes ecological structures and functions of soil erosion are reshaped by some excessive or accumulative erosive process bautista et al 2007 puigdefábregas 2005 and finally constitute the integrity of soil erosion from perspective of ecosystem integrity sutton grier et al 2010 the ecological structure components of soil erosion include ecosystems physical conditions i e precipitation vegetation and soil forming the background and precondition of runoff and sediment events generation the study of the ecological structure of soil erosion concentrated on how uncertainty of the raindrop distributions are to trigger sediment transferring kinnell 2005 salles et al 2000 how variability of the vegetation patterns are to structure erosion fluxes bautista et al 2007 eldridge et al 2010 wainwright et al 2000 and how diversity of the soil inherent structural stabilities are to infiltrate overflow bowker et al 2008 chamizo et al 2012 rodríguez caballero et al 2014 these evidences manifest that the complexity of ecological structure of soil erosion results in the variability of hydrological behaviors causing different erosive processes meanwhile with the view of ecological integrity capmourteres and anand 2016 the ecological function of soil erosion represent the transferring of erosive energy and migration of soil water material through the whole erosive processes these erosive energy and materials are generally quantified by runoff production and sediment yield to indicate the hydrological effect of erosive processes on ecosystems many studies also focused on ecological functions of soil erosion which includes the investigating the effects of kinetic energy and size distribution of raindrops on the overflow production and sediment transport fernandez raga et al 2017 li et al 2000 salles et al 2000 wang et al 2014 modeling the roles of plant canopy and litter layer on reducing the rainfall and runoff energy and soil particles detachment and transportation to prevent splash and rill gully erosion patterns frasson and krajewski 2013 liu et al 2018 nanko et al 2008 as well as assessing the soil erodibility and suspended sediment disposability to explore the soil erosion mechanism and corresponding conservation practices miao et al 2016 ding and huang 2017 keller and hakansson 2010 martinez mena et al 2002 slattery and burt 1997 these reports imply that the diversity of ecological function of soil erosion could be generalized as the intensity of soil erosion event containing various energy exchange patterns and material circulation types forming the crucial driving force to affect the stability of ecosystems consequently it is essential to illuminate the ecological structure function relationships for soil erosion some typical methods i e revised universal soil loess equation rusle empirical models bowker et al 2008 trigger transfer reserve pulse ttrp conceptual framework ludwig et al 2005 and erosive source sink landscape theory de vente et al 2016 xu et al 2017 were applied to explore how the structure contributors of erosion generation determined function magnitude of erosion energies and materials during erosive process in different ecosystems these methods connect the ecological structure and function related to erosive processes forming some effective frameworks to assess the integrity of soil erosion however there also exist an insufficiency of studying on the integrity of soil erosion firstly it is need to integrate the intensity and uncertainty of soil erosion events to comprehensively describe the ecological function of soil erosion on which however was insufficient for ecological and hydrological studies the uncertainty of soil erosion events is an important factor for describing the integrity of soil erosion zhou et al 2017 it characterizes how the stochasticity of random signal torri et al 1997 sidorchuk 2009 rather than the energy and material crave and davy 2001 moore 2007 sidorchuk 2009 of driving force transmit to the whole erosive processes on event scale in different ecosystems angulo martinez and barros 2015 goebes et al 2015 therefore the uncertainty of soil erosion event could be another important component of ecological function secondly few studies concentrated on the interactive effects of erosive ecological structures on the uncertainty and intensity of soil erosion bowker et al 2008 chamizo et al 2012 zhou et al 2016 specifically the complex interactions between rainfall vegetation and soil during erosion processes could probably increase the uncertainty of runoff and sediment generation consequently it is need to augment the indicators to more effectively identify the integrity of soil erosion to further explore the interaction between erosive ecological structures and functions which could be benefit for more compressively interpreting the erosion phenomenon with the view of ecology and hydrology in this study we aim to improve the identification of ecological structure and function of soil erosion analyze the relationship between erosive ecological structure function and assess the integrity of erosion in different patch covers in the loess plateau in this typical semiarid environment we have conducted systematic long term field experiments and studies on the ecohydrological processes i e the investigation of ecological and hydrological response of runoff and sediment at runoff plots liu et al 2012 zhu et al 2015 the analysis of soil moisture dynamics in different restoration vegetation wang et al 2013 zhou et al 2015 as well as the assessment of ecosystem service in this typical water limited environment fu et al 2011 thus the hypothesis of this research was that 1 the stochasticity and intensity of erosion events constitute relative complete ecological function of soil erosion which was exerted by erosive ecological structure 2 and both of the function and structure finally form the soil erosion intensity therefore we have set three specific objectives and applied general linear regression and structural equation modeling to test this hypothesis in the study including 1 to quantify the characteristics of randomness and intensity of soil erosion event in different patch covers 2 to analyze the factors influencing uncertainty and intensity of erosion event and the differences between the contributions of corresponding factors 3 and to integrate the erosion stochasticity and intensity into erosion phenomenon according to interrelationships between contributing factors 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area the study was conducted in the yangjuangou catchment 36 42 n 109 31 e 2 02 km2 which is located in the hilly gully region of the loess plateau in yan an of china fig 1 a a semi arid climate in the study area is mainly affected by north china monsoon and the average temporature is 9 5 degree the rainy season spans from june to september and the annual average precipitation reaches approximately 533 mm indicating significant inter annual varability in this typical semi arid environment the soil type in this area is calcaric cambisol soil fao unesco 1974 with weak physical structures being vulnerable to water erosion liu et al 2012 the erosive precipiation souring the high erodibility soil lead to the serious soil and water losses casuing the ecosystem degradtion in the loess plateau before the 1980s miao et al 2010 wang et al 2015 subsequently the grain for green project was extensively implemented in the loess plateau to prevent the water erosion numerous steep sloped corplands were abandoned restored or naturally recovered through the development of shrub and herbaceous plants to gradually maintain soil and water resources cao et al 2009 in the yangjuangou catchment land covers on hillslopes are mainly dominated by restoration plants and natural recovery vegetation such as andropogon artemisia coparia spiraea pubescens armeniaca sibirica robinia pseudoacacia linn lespedeza davurica aspicilia fruticose and some bare patches are also distributed along hillslopes 2 2 experimental design in this study we designed microplot systems fig 1d to represent four typical patch covers containing the bare patch cover b type andropogon patch cover g type artemisia coparia patch cover h type and spiraea pubescens patch cover j type fig 1e for each patch cover four closed microplots were distributed on a southwest facing hillslope with a 26 8 aspect and the boundaries of each microplot were perpendicularly fenced into 50 cm depth soil by using some impervious polyvinylchloride pvc sheets the collection transmission system in each microplot 60 60 cm consisted of a collection trough and a storage bucket fig 1d we took a model 2800 k1 guelph permeameter fig 1b soilmoisture equipment corp santa barbara ca usa to determine the average soil saturated hydraulic conductivity shc and applied the s smc m005 soil moisture probes decagon devices inc pullman wa usa to monitor the real time dynamic of soil moisture at 10 min intervals all the soil moisture data collected by hobo weather station logger fig 1c represent the average antecedent soil moisture asm before each rainfall event we also measured the average crown diameter cro plant height hig and litter layer thickness tll of each vegetation microplot bonham 1989 for 12 times over the three rainy seasons which reflect the basic morphological properties of the three different vegetation patch cover types meanwhile we monitored the natural rainfall processes by using tipping bucket rain collector davis instruments diablo hayward ca usa with accuracy being 0 2 mm next to these microplots we totally recorded 73 rainfall events over three rainy seasons from 2011 to 2013 calculated the precipitation prec and intensity int of each rainfall event finally based on the former study to define the random events about soil erosion and precipitation zhou et al 2017 we recorded the times of runoff and sediment random event generation in each microplot system over each rainy season and the detail information was showed in results we gathered the runoff and sediment in collecting bottles fig 1d separated the runoff and sediment by setting the collecting bottles for 24 h dried at 105 c for 8 h and then calculated the runoff coefficient run c and weighed the sediment yield sed y the main physical and hydrological properties of soil samples in different patch covers were collected and measured table 1 2 3 data analysis in this study we employed the one way analysis of variance anova to estimate the significant difference of soil erosion intensity and performed regression analysis to estimate the effect of influencing factors on intensity and uncertainty of soil erosion firstly based on the log transformation for the data of runoff coefficient run c and sediment yield sed y to satisfy the normality we performed multiple stepwise linear regression analysis against all independent variables related to rainfall soil and vegetation to runoff coefficient and sediment yield in four patch covers secondly we applied multiple logistic regression analysis on estimating the effect of rainfall soil and vegetation on the randomness of runoff events run e and sediment events sed e generating in different patch covers specifically when a runoff or sediment random event was generated by a single erosive rainfall random event the value of run e or sed e was assigned to 1 and if the erosion event was not triggered by a rainfall event the value of run e or sed e equals 0 and finally we made probabilistic assessments of the effect of soil rainfall and vegetation on the stochastic of runoff and sediment generation the detailed algorithm of logistic regression analysis on soil erosion random events was deduced by former study zhou et al 2017 based on the results of the stepwise linear regression and logistic regression we determined the influencing factors that have a significant relationship with these independent variables and further evaluated the relative importance of these influencing factors on the intensity and uncertainty of soil erosion in the study the anova data transformation multiple regression analysis relative importance evaluation as well as dealing with missing data of soil moisture due to the technique problem were depended on the statsr https cran r project org web packages statsr index html multcomp https cran r project org web packages multcomp index html and car https cran r project org web packages car index html packages of r program 2 4 structural equation modeling the structural equation modeling sem is a problem oriented theoretical model to combine concrete a priori knowledge with statistical analysis which can deal with complete body of specific and available knowledge grace 2006 moreover sem can specifically determine the causal relationships between potential independent and dependent variables and systematically testify the interactive effects of complex contributing factors of responsive results grace 2006 therefore based on these advantages of sem it has been applied to deal with many challenging problems in ecological studies austin 2007 larson and grace 2004 texeira et al 2012 we employed the sem to integrate intensity and uncertainty of erosion event and to further evaluate the interactive effects of ecological structure function related to soil erosion the priori sem model related to soil erosion was described by fig 2 in this model the observed variables squares in fig 2 can be directly measured in the field observation the latent variables circles in fig 2 however represent some comprehensive concepts or complex phenomena that cannot be directly measured the casual and correlative relationships among the two types of variables were connected by the single arrows and two way arrows respectively additionally a typical sem contains two important components one is the confirmatory factor analysis cfa to estimate the relation between observed variables and latent variables and the other is structural equation seq to quantify the relationships between latent variables according to the description statistics of vegetation soil rainfall and antecedent soil moisture properties we graded the observed variables to meet the requirement of the sem construction table 2 on the one hand we connected the measurable intensity and uncertainty of soil erosion with the immeasurable soil erosion phenomenon to test whether the stochasiticity of erosion event could be another crucial indicator to implement and represent the ecological function of soil erosion meanwhile we generalized the latent variables including soil soil vegetation plant and precipitation rain to characterize ecological structure related to the soil erosion on the other hand we linked the latent variables to test how the ecological structure affects the ecological function of soil erosion the algorithm of prior sem model of soil erosion was described in appendix a finally we determined the mean and variance adjusted weighed least square wlsmv to estimate the prior model and employed the goodness of fit index gfi tucker lewis index tli and root mean square error of approximation rmsea to estimate the fitness of this prior model we combined modification indices mis with soil erosion theories to drive the creation of a series of modified sems to meet the requirement of the variables validity and sem s reliability the sem model evaluation and modification was completed by using mplus 7 0 statistical program geiser 2010 table 3 summarized the algorithmic properties of logistic regression and sem 3 results 3 1 the erosive uncertainty in different patch covers there were 73 random rainfall events occurred during three rainy seasons from 2011 to 2013 the times of random runoff and sediment events generation in 16 microplots over four patch cover types were recorded in fig 3 a and b respectively the average times of random soil erosion events generation in each microplot of bare patch cover b type including b1 b4 microplots was maximum with the average probability of random runoff and sediment events reaching to 0 37 and 0 27 respectively fig 3c and d from b type to j type the times of random soil erosion events gradually reduce with the minimum average probability of random runoff and sediment events in j type including j1 j4 microplot only approaching to 0 22 and 0 03 respectively furthermore table 4 concluded the values and significances of log odds ration regression coefficients to evaluate the probabilistic effects of environmental factors on the randomness of soil erosion events in different patch covers firstly for all patch cover pattern precipitation prec p 0 001 and p 0 01 plant crown width grade cro p 0 001 and p 0 001 antecedent soil moisture asm p 0 05 and p 0 001 and soil saturated hydraulic conductivity shc p 0 05 and p 0 01 exerted significant effect on the probability of runoff and sediment events occurrence respectively when other independent variables are unchanged every one grade of shc or cro increase and the odds ratio of random runoff events 0 79 odds p 0 05 for shc and 0 15 odds p 0 01 for cro and sediment events 0 46 odds p 0 01 for shc and 0 17odds p 0 001 for cro could reduce which implied that the increasing grades of shc or cro could have significant negative effect on the probability of random soil erosion events in different extents however the increasing grades of precipitation prec or antecedent soil moisture asm exerted significant positive effect on the occurrence of random runoff and sediment events secondly the average crown width grade cro in vegetation patch cover patterns was a significant negative influencing factor in stochastic of soil erosion 0 14 odds and p 0 001 for runoff events 0 11 odds and p 0 001 for sediment events prec and asm were two important significant positive influencing factors to affect the uncertainty of random runoff event in individual patch covers 3 2 the erosive intensity in different patch covers the erosive intensity was measured by runoff coefficient run c and sediment yield sed y as showed in fig 4 a and c the average runoff coefficient in bare patch cover b type including b1 b4 microplot was significant highest approaching 0 004 p 0 001 than other three patch covers under the same rainfall event the average runoff coefficient produced in high shrub patch cover j type including j1 j4 was significant lower approaching 0 0001 p 0 05 than grass patch cover g type including g1 g4 approaching 0 002 meanwhile fig 4b and d showed that the sediment yield sed y in bare patch was nearly 2 3 times larger than vegetation patch covers however there was no significant different p 0 1 between the sediment yield in three vegetation patch covers in the same random rainfall events additionally table 5 indicated the multiple regression coefficients and their significant properties to analyze the effects of environmental factors on the erosion intensity in different patch cover patterns four indicators including precipitation average crown width grade cro antecedent soil moisture asm and soil saturated hydraulic conductivity shc have significant effects on the runoff coefficient and sediment yield in all patch cover pattern specifically when other independent variables are unchanged the increasing of precipitation and antecedent soil moisture could increase the runoff coefficient and sediment yield however the average crown width grade cro and average soil saturated hydraulic connectivity shc reveal negative effects on the intensity of runoff and sediment in different patch cover patterns the stepwise multiple linear regression models for explanation of runoff coefficient and sediment yield variability ranged from 16 to 59 and from 31 to 73 respectively 3 3 the relative importance of significant factors to soil erosion according to the above generalized linear regression analysis we further described the relative importance of precipitation antecedent soil moisture average crown width grade and average soil saturated hydraulic connectivity to soil erosion by comparing the contribution of different grades of the four factors table 2 to the uncertainty and intensity of soil erosion in patch cover patterns figs 5 8 as to all patch cover pattern figs 5 and 6 when the grades increased from minimum to maximum the probability increasing rate of random runoff from 0 029 to 1 and sediment from 0 036 to 0 903 event generation for precipitation were similar with the increasing rate of probability of random runoff from 0 217 to 0 427 and sediment 0 031 to 0 466 event generation for antecedent soil moisture these probabilistic increasing rates were more significant higher than the increasing rate of runoff coefficients and sediment yield as the same precipitation and antecedent soil moisture grade increasing meanwhile the effect of the increasing of average plant crown width from low to extreme grade on the decreasing of probability of random runoff from 0 925 to 0 033 and sediment from 0 764 to 0 006 events generation is significant higher than that of the increasing of soil saturated hydraulic conductivity grade from low to extreme grade that lead to the probability of random runoff and sediment event generation to decrease from 0 253 to 0 175 and from 0 159 to 0 039 respectively as to the vegetation patch cover pattern figs 7 and 8 when the grades increased from minimum to maximum the probability increasing rate of random runoff event from 0 020 to 1 and sediment event generation from 0 028 to 0 755 for precipitation were significant higher than the increasing rates of probability of random runoff from 0 209 to 0 497 and sediment generation from 0 039 to 0 077 for antecedent soil moisture moreover the increasing of average plant crown width from mid to extreme grade significantly decreased the probability of random runoff from 0 464 to 0 021 and sediment event from 0 140 to 0 005 generation respectively but with the increasing of soil saturated hydraulic conductivity grade from mid to high grade the decreased rates of probability of random runoff from 0 183 to 0 135 and sediment from 0 069 to 0 061 event were not obvious so were the decreased rate of runoff coefficient from 0 0011 to 0 001 and sediment yield from 1 26 to 0 98 g in the supplementary material we further compared the contribution of grade differences of the precipitation and antecedent soil moisture to the uncertainty and intensity of soil erosion in individual patch cover table s1 and s2 consequently provided other variables unchanged the average crown width grade was a relative more important indicator to affect both of erosive uncertainty and intensity the uncertainty of soil erosion is more sensitive to the changing of precipitation and antecedent soil moisture grades than that of intensity of soil erosion but the soil saturated hydraulic connectivity indicated relative less importance for the randomness and intensity of erosion events in different patch cover patterns 3 4 the integrity of soil erosion in sem as to all patch cover pattern fig 9 a the uncertainty run e sed e and intensity run c sed y of soil erosion were integrated into two exogenous latent variables run sed to conceptualize the ecological function of soil erosion the uncertainty of soil erosion run e and sed e with loading factor being 1 479 and 1 159 respectively p 0 001 was seem to exert significant higher effect on the ecological function of soil erosion than that of the intensity of soil erosion did run c and sed y with loading factor being 0 574 and 0 792 respectively p 0 001 other observed indicators were integrated into three endogenous latent variables plant soil rain to conceptualize the ecological structure related to soil erosion the precipitation grade prec l and antecedent soil moisture grade asm l may characterize the main ecological structure probably triggering the soil erosion due to the two observed indicators with the highest loading factors of the endogenous latent variables plant and soil respectively moreover the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity grade shc l was the common indicator of plant and soil latent variables with it having the different loading factors 0 848 for plant 0 421 for soil both of the two endogenous latent variables soil and rain have a significant positive effect on the exogenous latent variable sed with the path coefficients being 0 653 p 0 01 and 0 385 p 0 01 respectively the path coefficient between the latent variable plant and sed was 0 316 p 0 01 the whole sem could explain the 67 5 variance of sed more statistical information of loading factors in all patch cover pattern was indicated in table s3 of supplementary material as to vegetation patch cover pattern in fig 9b the endogenous latent variable r s short for rain and soil was integrated by six observed indicators of the rainfall and soil properties r s exerted significant positive effect on the run and sed with the path coefficients being 1 594 p 0 05 and 1 084 p 0 05 respectively the endogenous latent variable plant however have significant negative effect on the run and sed with the path coefficients indicating 0 853 p 0 001 and 0 669 p 0 05 respectively the sem explained the 55 8 variance of run and 58 1 variance of sed table s4 indicated the statistical property of all loading factors in vegetation patch cover pattern finally the sem of individual patch cover and corresponding statistical property of loading factors were concluded in supporting information fig s1 tables s5 s8 4 discussion 4 1 integrating the ecological function related to soil erosion the logistic and multiple regression analysis constitute a generalized linear modeling to describe how the random signals and energies of rainfall events transmit into runoff and sediment events under different soil and plant conditions the result suggested that there probably exist distinct trigger mechanisms for the randomness and intensity of soil erosion events due to the different sensitivities of the randomness and intensity of soil erosion to the increasing grades of precipitation antecedent soil moisture and morphological structure of vegetation figs 5 8 specifically the logistic regression that combined the probability theory and logistic function hosmer et al 2013 systematically explored the stochastic mechanism of runoff and sediment events zhou et al 2017 depending on long term observational data and reasonable probabilistic assumptions in fact as an event based probabilistic analysis logistic regression estimated the probability of erosion generation based on random event scale to suggest that the stochasticity of runoff and sediment generation was another crucial component of ecological function related to soil erosion especially under the background of climate change that probably lead to increase the occurrence probability of rainfall events with extreme erosivity this data driven stochastic method is an important supplement to previous those concept driven stochastic methods that concentrate on various water balance principle or complex hydraulic mechanisms of overland flow to understand the probabilistic property of soil erosion laio et al 2001 moore 2007 rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 on the other hand sem further proved that the randomness and intensity of runoff and sediment can be integrated to describe the complex erosion processes in the study the loading factors of uncertainty of erosion event even exceed the loading factors of intensity of erosion event in different patch cover patterns figs 9 and s1 this result suggests that to some extent in the field experiment adding the uncertainty information of erosion generation into the traditional recording the intensity of soil erosion is probably more important and necessary to comprehensively describe the erosion phenomenon some researchers applied the sem to evaluate the comprehensive effects of multiple influencing factors i e slope soil types plant patterns etc on the intensity of erosion processes which stressed that the both of runoff production and sediment yield were important indicators to describe the ecological function related to soil erosion chamizo et al 2012 hu et al 2014 zhou et al 2016 however the sem applied in this study illuminated that the randomness of runoff and sediment event generation was another necessary indicator to describe the uncertainty of erosion processes from stochastic perspective as well as an important predictor to interpret the ecological function related to soil erosion therefore the intensity and uncertainty of random runoff and sediment events were combined in sem to characterize the ecological function related to soil erosion which improve the understanding of the erosion phenomenon 4 2 evaluating the ecological function structure relationship the sem fig 9 indicated that the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity become the common component of the plant morphology and soil properties both of which were two important ecological structures affecting soil erosion in this study area as to the essential of soil matrix the soil hydraulic connectivity is an indispensable index to quantify soil physical property to affect the infiltration processes occurring in soil surface or subsurface smith et al 2002 the weak soil structure with less micro or macropores could prevent the overland flow or interflow from transporting into deep layer or moving out of soil layer system schluter et al 2018 the inhibiting effects of infiltration capacity on contribution of runoff and sediment generation was actually verified and quantified by the path coefficients between latent variables in sem some studies puigdefábregas 2005 rodríguez caballero et al 2014 zhou et al 2017 have pointed out that at the beginning stage of overland generation on the slope the soil layer with higher hydraulic connectivity have reinfiltration function that leads to single overland flows with different flow directions have less opportunity to converge on slope to gather enough erosive energy therefore this reinfiltration function changes the overland flow pattern from runoff to runon and finally reduces the risks of runoff generation and the required energy of sediment transportation as to the plant morphology soil hydraulic connectivity is an important index to imply the property of plant root system the root system can redistribute the size and density of soil pore and change the mechanical and hydrological mechanism of soil structure which improve the anti erosive capabilities of the soil matrix de baets et al 2007 gyssels et al 2005 li et al 2017 in particular the macrospores formed by the root system of soil layer could increase the soil hydraulic connectivity to significantly raise the intensity and frequency of the reinfiltration generation of overland flow therefore the soil hydraulic properties can link soil and plant properties that act key roles on infiltrating overland flow and on reducing sediment transportation sems in the study manifest the complexity of ecological structure of soil erosion through a relative simplified data driven modeling and offer a more comprehensive view of improvement of the infiltration capacities to conserves more water inputs and effectively inhibit soil erosion the sem in the study also further connected latent variables to quantify the negative and positive effects of vegetation and precipitation on the soil erosion respectively this result was consistent with several previous studies bautista et al 2007 descheemaeker et al 2006 jost et al 2012 zhu et al 2015 essentially the result explored how the ecological structure determines the ecological function associated with soil erosion processes these structure function interactions mainly contained that the interception of rainfall by crown structure above the topsoil muzylo et al 2009 the throughfall absorption by the litter layer on soil surface leys et al 2010 and the reinfiltration runoff by root system in deep soil layer puigdefábregas 2005 the ecological structure reshaped the vertical distribution of rainfall and established a complex soil and water conservation system to indirectly transform the stochastic signal and energy of rainfall into overland flows through the accumulation and infiltration of water inputs in terms of the antecedent soil moisture and soil hydraulic connectivity indicators of sems meanwhile this indirect transformation could prevent precipitation from directly producing overland flows and ultimately reduce the significance of causal relationships between properties of rainfall and runoff in sems sem also can evaluate the measurement error that is neglected by the traditional linear regression statistical method wang 2012 in the study the main source of measurement error of soil erosion evaluation came from the sediment yield collection figs 9 and s1 the more complicated the plant canopy structure is from g to j type the larger the measurement error of corresponding sediment yield became fig s1 this result suggests that in plot scale the different vegetation patch cover patterns could cause different extents of erosion measurement error in fact the complex morphological properties of vegetation patch can diversify the vertical redistribution pattern of rainfall increase the uncertainty of the effect of splash erosion in plot scale and finally introduce more inevitable uncontrolled and systematic errors into the whole ecohydrological and erosion processes which ultimately increase measurement error of soil erosion boix fayos et al 2007 systematically reviewed the sources of variations in soil erosion measurements at the field scale and pointed out that the complexity and diversity of ecosystems spatiotemporal scale cause the main source of measuring error of soil erosion this discovery in sem indicate that the complexity of the ecological structure could be another important source of variation in soil erosion measurements and could be another important supplement to the former studies boix fayos et al 2006 2007 4 3 contributions of multiple modeling to understanding soil erosion in the study the data driven generalized linear regression and theory driven sem could constitute a new strategy for evaluating soil erosion behavior because on the one hand the logistic regression in this strategy stressed the importance of randomness of runoff and sediment events for describing erosion processes it could be a convenient and applicable tool for assessing the impact of crucial factors on the uncertainty of soil erosion under complex conditions zhou et al 2017 and it also enrich the implication of ecologcial function related to soil erosion and probably serves as a meaningful guide for soil erosion monitoring and selection of restoration vegetation to improve the risk management of soil erosion in the water limited environment on the anther hand the sem in the strategy compared the relative importance of factors affecting the runoff and sediment events to summarize the complexity of ecological structure related to soil erosion especially the error evaluation and confirmatory factor analysis in sem suggest researchers to take more careful consideration of the systematic error during erosion measurement and to probably explore to inclusion of additional factors to improve the describing and predicting of ecological structure of soil erosion moreover this strategy introduced the latent variables into sem to further test the hypothesis about the interaction relationship between ecological structure and function of soil erosion as well as to systematically assess the integrity of soil erosion in fact according to the principles of sem the application of latent variables represents two most important essence of sem theoretical innovation and practical exploration grace 2006 however the relatively complex process of modifying sems to satisfy the validity and reliability testing complicated the application of sem analysis framework with latent variables which lead to the sem with latent variables is rarely used to address the complex ecological and hydrological researches therefore the latent variable employed in this study was different from previous studies that only based on observed indicators in sem chamizo et al 2012 eldridge et al 2010 verheyen and hermy 2001 zhou et al 2016 which finally developed the predictive level of comprehending soil erosion in the table 6 we summaries the main representative sem methods applying on ecological and hydrological studies and illustrates the developments in the integrated assessment of soil erosion however there also need to necessary activities to improve the integrated assessment method it could be include the developing a more reasonable classification system of observation variables and designing more accurate measurement approaches to evaluate soil erosion under precipitation varied by different regions sun et al 2018 in the loess plateau restoration vegetation has deeply affected soil erosion generation in typical water limited environments characterized by complex ecohydrological condition fu et al 2011 furthermore given the accumulation of experimental data in this area data and theory driven integrated assessment could serve as powerful tools for studying soil erosion in this area ultimately providing useful information for the management of restoration vegetation to more effectively utilize the available water and soil resources 5 conclusion in the study we applied the generalized regression and sem to analyze the characteristics and interactions of ecological structure and function related to soil erosion of different patch covers in semi arid environment the bare patch cover has the highest probability of runoff 0 37 and sediment generation 0 27 the lowest probability of runoff 0 22 and sediment 0 03 generation were in high shrub patch cover the average runoff coefficient was highest 0 004 in bare patch cover which produced 2 to 3 times more sediment than other vegetation patch cover on the one hand the generalized regression is a convenient and applicable method to illuminate that the morphological properties of vegetation patches are more relative important factors to affect the uncertainty and intensity of soil erosion event than that of precipitation and soil moisture on the other hand the sem is an innovative theory driven analysis method to integrate the uncertainty and intensity of runoff and sediment to enrich the ecological function of soil erosion it also manifests that the soil hydraulic conductivity can link soil to plant properties to describe the complexity of ecological structure of soil erosion sem further explores that sediment measurement error is the main source of system variation and finally constructs the effect of ecological structure on ecological function of soil erosion in different patch cover patterns in the study the generalized regression and sem constitutes a new strategy that can systematically assess the effects of rainfall soil and vegetation on erosion processes from perspective of stochasticity and energy the strategy could enhance the understanding of integrity of soil erosion and be beneficial to effectively restoration management and available water and soil resource utilization acknowledgement this work was
