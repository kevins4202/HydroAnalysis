4885,the capability of hydrologic models to spatially simulate the changes in hydrologic processes like precipitation is an important consideration in capturing the impacts of these processes on sediment prediction across the domain radar derived precipitation rdp provides an enhanced detail of rainfall characteristics in time and space compared to estimates from rain gauge precipitation rgp commonly used in hydrologic modeling however the impacts of these datasets on sediment fate and transport depend on how sediment sources were conceptualized in the model this paper developed a modeling framework to simulate sediment transport from upland to the stream and to the outlet of the watershed based on a gridded conceptualization and to examine the impacts of rgp and rdp with different types of sediment sources on sediment prediction the water erosion prediction project wepp model was used to estimate daily sediment sources in a semi distributed and fully distributed manner using the hydrologic model mike she and mike 11 model comparison was performed in a watershed in illinois characterized by a dominant agricultural landscape the results indicated that the use of rdp only ensured better model performance for sediment yield with the fully distributed sediment source that is combining both the ability of the rdp to capture the spatial variability of rainfall across the watershed and assessing sediment production at higher resolution improved the accuracy of predictions in sediment yield while decreasing uncertainties associated with sediment simulations advancing modeling capabilities will require the development of new modeling platforms that aim to seamlessly integrate large scale distributed simulations and environmental input data at finer spatial resolutions keywords sediment modeling distributed model sediment source radar rainfall soil erosion sediment yield 1 introduction it is widely known that the integration of the spatio temporal characteristics of precipitation in distributed hydrologic models is fundamental to advance the predictions of flow and transport phenomena at a watershed scale rainfall is a crucial variable in hydrologic modeling and its misrepresentation in time and space may result in the inaccurate convolution of subsequent processes related to water quantity and quality chaplot et al 2005 wei et al 2009 as an example sediment load and its associated transport of organic and inorganic compounds are source dependent syvitski et al 2000 highlighting the importance of the distributed simulation of the major drivers controlling soil erosion in particular detailed rainfall characteristics across a watershed may help improve the capacity of hydrologic models to represent better sediment sources surface routing and the expected suspended load in streams chaplot et al 2005 usón and ramos 2001 however the capability of hydrologic models to spatially simulate the changes in hydrologic processes like precipitation is an important consideration in capturing the impacts of these changes on sediment prediction across the domain above all simulating sediment production and transport using distributed models to fully capture precipitation s spatial variability is crucial in developing a holistic sediment prediction scheme it is apparent that the spatial variability of precipitation and sediment production poses a challenge in predicting sediment transport due in part to the uncertainties brought by how these two processes are represented in space and their complex interactions there have been previous research efforts to improve sediment predictions from lumped or semi distributed models using spatially varied precipitation as an example radar derived precipitation rdp has been used in predicting soil loss using either the universal soil loss equation usle wischmeier and smith 1978 or the water erosion prediction project wepp model flanagan and nearing 1995 fischer et al 2018 utilized rdp in the usle model to minimize the error arising from input data however the disagreements from the prediction were still observed due mainly to parameterization in that the parameters such as management factors do not reflect inter annual variations to reflect realistic field conditions rdp and remotely sensed parameters were used in predicting soil loss using the water erosion prediction project wepp model gelder et al 2018 however soil loss in this study was reported only as average annual hillslope erosion or sediment yield sheet rill not including ephemeral gully soil erosion at a sub catchment scale 90 k m 2 and sediment transport between the sub catchments was not considered and thus the validation of the model could not be provided in addition to capture the spatial variability of rainfall rdp had been used to estimate areal precipitation in the semi distributed models e g swat model for predicting sediment yield di luzio and arnold 2004 gao et al 2017 kalin and hantush 2006 however the impacts of the use of rdp in semi distributed models for sediment predictions were not discussed to better represent the spatial distribution of eroded soil and its transport soil erosion should be evaluated at a finer scale that can reflect fine resolution input data used in the model that is the use of rdp does not guarantee a better sediment prediction if the soil loss was predicted at a coarser level however none of the current studies evaluated the impacts of the use of rdp on sediment prediction in fully distributed settings in this study we hypothesized that distributed precipitation will improve sediment prediction only if sediment sources are spatially distributed specifically we explored the following hypotheses to examine the impacts of distributed and semi distributed sediment sources on sediment predictions under rdp and rain gauge precipitation rgp 1 the improved streamflow predictions that stemmed directly from rdp would improve sediment transport and yield predictions 2 the spatial variations in precipitation would improve sediment transport predictions regardless of streamflow predictions 3 the use of rdp would improve sediment predictions only where sediment sources are spatially distributed we developed four models to simulate sediment transport from upland to the stream and to the outlet of the watershed using gauged and radar precipitation in combination with a gridded conceptualization distributed and sub catchments level discretization semi distributed sediment sources the simulation results based on these four models were compared and examined to test each hypothesis 2 methodology 2 1 model description the study area is an intensively managed agricultural watershed in central illinois with an area of approximately 660 km 2 fig 1 the watershed is located in a temperate climate zone receiving a total annual average rainfall of 1 000 mm iepa 2007 the topography of the watershed is relatively flat with an average slope of 1 and most of the land is used for row crops 90 in this watershed the four separate models were developed for continuous multiannual simulations in an agricultural watershed to incorporate the three hypotheses to determine whether hypotheses 1 and 2 are acceptable the rdp and rgp were separately assigned as radar and gauge table 1 the rdp was assigned based on the national weather service national centers for environmental prediction nws ncep stage iv qpe lin 2011 while the rgp was simulated based entirely on precipitation from rain gauges rantoul and normal using thiessen polygon fig 1a note that the ncep stage iv product is a conus qpe 4 km grid precipitation collected from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa river forecast centers to determine whether hypothesis 3 is valid the sediment source across the watershed was estimated using the wepp model and the semi distributed and distributed sediment sources were estimated at sub catchment and grid levels respectively the watershed was discretized into 300 m grid cells and 49 sub catchments fig 1b in the distributed and semi distributed models respectively for sediment sources table 1 to simulate the fate and transport of sediment across the watershed the fully distributed hydrologic model mike she coupled with the one dimensional hydrodynamic river model mike 11 refsgaard and storm 1995 was used 2 1 1 precipitation impacts to determine whether or not spatially varied precipitation can improve sediment predictions hypothesis 1 and 2 two sets of precipitation data were used to quantify the differences of simulation results in streamflow and sediment discharges the hydrologic models commonly represent precipitation as time dependent areal variables in which precipitation is linked to the nearest station based observation this variable is commonly interpolated from neighboring stations statistically estimated using intensity durationfrequency curves or defined as an areal partition using thiessen polygons also known as the dirichlet voronoi polygons the use of areal precipitation estimates may result in the misrepresentation of sediment prediction on a mesoscale analysis hr day and 2 2000 km distance orlanski 1975 due to the coarse granularity of available gauge networks pathak and teegavarapu 2018 rdp provides an enhanced detail of rainfall characteristics across space compared to observations from rgp commonly used in hydrologic modeling however rainfall estimates based on stand alone radar systems are subject to several potential issues such as radar beam blockage nelson et al 2010 bright band enhancement smith et al 1996 anomalous propagation krajewski and vignal 2001 and uncertainty of microphysical parameters of z r relationships smith et al 1996 vasiloff et al 2007 to provide better precipitation estimates multiple sensors such as radars and rain gauges were fused to quantitatively enhance precipitation estimates qpe across the mesoscale pathak and teegavarapu 2018 to assess hypotheses 1 and 2 two sets of daily precipitation inputs were created one was based on the multi sensor qpe ncep stage iv analysis and the other was based entirely on ground based observations the closest to the watershed being the normal and rantoul stations fig 1a the spatial discretization of the modeled processes across the watershed was set to 300 300 m for a total of 7 303 grid cells to assign distributed precipitation at each grid cell the stage iv data were linearly resampled to 300 m hereafter called radar in contrast the gauged precipitation was determined using the thiessen polygon method and then resampled to a 300 m spatial resolution hereafter called gauge note that the thiessen polygon is a common practice in hydrologic modeling where ground based observations are used to represent the homogenous precipitation across large areas the spatial variation of the averaged total annual precipitation 2013 2019 estimated by radar ranged from 1 062 mm year 1 to 1 177 mm year 1 fig 1a in contrast precipitation at the rantoul and normal weather stations gauged precipitation was 1 043 mm year 1 and 1 035 mm year 1 respectively the radar was on average higher for the watershed than the gauge over seven years resulting in an annual total average of 1 138 mm year 1 and 1 038 mm year 1 for radar and gauge respectively a point pair comparison of the radar and gauge based precipitation was conducted by comparing the rainfall observations at rantoul and normal stations fig 1a and the radar estimates in their nearest neighboring grid cells where the rain gauges were located this was performed to determine how the two types of precipitation varied in terms of annual precipitation total monthly precipitation average and rain day frequency from 2013 to 2019 for the rain day frequency analysis the daily precipitation 0 1 mm was assumed as a non rainy day and the rain day was classified for light precipitation 0 1 p 4 mm day 1 moderate precipitation 4 p 20 mm day 1 and heavy precipitation p 20 mm day 1 arnone et al 2013 daily precipitation for each class was randomly sampled with replacement using bootstrapping to calculate the average rain day frequency for each class with 95 confidence intervals 2 1 2 sediment source impacts to examine hypothesis 3 whether or not the semi and distributed sediment sources would impact the sediment predictions the wepp model flanagan and nearing 1995 was used to provide the sediment source in two different modes semi distributed and distributed modes the wepp model is a continuous process based model that predicts soil loss and sediment deposition along hillslopes as well as in small agricultural watersheds in this study we utilized only the hillslope erosion component of wepp it simulates sheet and rill erosion at a field scale based on the raindrop impacts surface runoff generation hydraulic shear stress and sediment load in the flow the model was known to be applicable to a broad range of soil and climate conditions laflen et al 2004 tiwari et al 2000 zhang et al 1996 for distributed sediment sources the watershed was discretized into 300 m grid cells for a total of 7 303 cells across the watershed each grid cell was conceptualized as a single hillslope with a unique combination of climate topography soil and land use thus the time series of sediment sources in each grid have different values of sediment production throughout the watershed on the other hand for semi distributed sediment sources the watershed was divided into 49 sub catchments fig 1b and each grid in one sub catchment is assumed to have the same properties of slope soil land use the average slope was used for each sub catchment and dominant soil properties and land use were extracted from a corresponding sub catchment therefore 49 wepp simulations were performed for all sub catchments at the same scale as in the distributed model and assigned the equivalent time series within each sub catchment for precipitation inputs observed precipitation were used depending on the types of precipitation inputs table 1 for the simulation period the land uses were determined from the national agricultural statistics service nass usda 2016 and the following management practices were considered for the analysis based on survey data conducted by illinois department of agriculture idoa 2018 1 no till 2 mulch till 3 reduced till and 4 conventional tillage a more detailed description of land use and tillage systems for this watershed can be found in the paper of lee et al 2021 for both inputs the simulation results of sediment leaving the hillslope predicted from the wepp model were inserted as sediment sources in the distributed hydrologic model to transport the eroded soil across the watershed 2 1 3 water movement the hydrologic processes across the watershed and in the river were simulated by a physically based distributed model mike she and a 1d hydrodynamic model mike 11 respectively the mike she model simulated the overland unsaturated and saturated flows while mike 11 simulated the propagation of the hydrograph once the water reaches the river the hydrologic components in the coupled model included 1 d richard equation for the unsaturated flow kristensen and jensen method 1975 for the actual evapotranspiration 2 d diffusive wave approximation for the overland flow 1 d saint venant equations for the main channel and kinematic wave approximation for upstream tributaries and 3 d darcy s law for the saturated flow a detailed description of the mike she model can be found in refsgaard and storm 1995 the parameters of mike she being a physically based model are measurable in the field and thus input data were directly extracted from observation data the average slope of the watershed was approximately 1 obtained from the 30 m digital elevation model dem usgs 2016 the soil properties were extracted from the soil survey geographic database ssurgo usda 2017 and the land cover information was obtained from the cropland data layer cdl usda 2016 mostly occupied by corn 48 and soybeans 40 however due to the spatial variability of some parameters that were not adequately sampled calibration was performed to properly account for these variabilities subsurface drainage through tile drains was conceptualized by a linear reservoir model as a function of a drain level and a time constant and these two parameters were calibrated by comparing streamflow discharge at fisher station fig 1b botero acosta et al 2019 2 1 4 sediment movement the mike she and mike 11 models were used to transport sediment from the surface to the river network and to the outlet of the watershed through the rivers the fate and transport of sediment in the watershed were simulated by 1 d and 2 d advection dispersion equations ade with sink and source terms for sediment transport in rivers and overland flow respectively assuming the suspended sediment is completely mixed over the depth of water in the overland flow sediment production for each grid estimated by the wepp model was added as a source term in the ade while the rate of deposition s d and erosion s e as sink and source terms in the ade in the rivers can be expressed by 1 s d wc h 1 τ τ cr f o r τ τ cr where c is the sediment concentration w is the mean fall velocity of suspended particles h is the mean depth that the particles settle τ is shear stress of bed and τ cr is the critical shear stress deposition along the stream occurs when τ is less than τ cr 2 s e m h τ τ cr 1 b f o r τ τ cr where m is the erodibility of the bed h is the flow depth and b is the erosion exponent erosion along the river only occurs when τ is greater than or equal to τ cr note that the erosion rate is affected by the local hydraulic conditions and the deposition rate is affected by both local hydraulic conditions and sediment concentration 2 2 model performance four combinations of precipitation and sediment source data were used to simulate the streamflow and sediment load at the outlet of the watershed the fisher station fig 1b located at the outlet of the watershed was used as an assessment endpoint of the combinations of input datasets to evaluate the performance of the models in simulating streamflow and sediment the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the mean absolute difference mad and root mean square error rmse between simulations s and observations o were used eqs 3 5 note that the nse ranges from to 1 where nse equal to 1 means a perfect match between the simulated and observed variables while mad and rmse decrease with increasing model accuracy 3 nse 1 s i o i 2 o i o 2 4 mad s i o i n 5 rmse s i o i 2 n 2 3 sediment rating curve due to the lack of continuous sediment data within the simulation period a sediment rating curve was used to estimate the sediment discharge as the power law equation azadi et al 2020 syvitski et al 2000 tfwala and wang 2016 6 q s a q w b where q s is the suspended load q w is the flow discharge and a and b are the sediment rating coefficient and exponent respectively the 153 sediment grab samples collected from the fisher station from 1979 to 1997 were used to derive the rating curve considering that the main source of sediment in this watershed is from agricultural production rhoads et al 2016 the total number of samples was divided into the growing season may october and non growing season november april groups fig 2 these two groups showed distinguishable patterns in terms of sediment load at low to moderate flow generating higher sediment load in the growing season than in the non growing season to apply the rating curves to the simulation period it was assumed that the relationship between sediment and streamflow discharge remains constant over time this assumption was based on the channelization at a large portion of the streams and no significant changes in land use since the 1940 s mostly occupied by agriculture rhoads et al 2016 urban and rhoads 2003 in addition the two years of survey data 2017 2018 conducted by the illinois department of agriculture idoa 2018 showed that conventional tillage is still dominantly used and the rate of conservation practices such as no till is low in this watershed therefore it was inferred that changes in management practices were also not significant furthermore the watershed response to rainfall was examined based on the annual runoff coefficient using the rainfall at rantoul station and streamflow discharge at fisher station from 1979 to 2019 the spearman s rank correlation coefficient r indicated that there were no significant changes in the watershed response to rainfall over the period of record r 0 18 with this assumption the two sediment rating curves were separately applied to estimate the daily sediment load for the growing and non growing seasons based on the observed streamflow discharge for the simulation periods hereafter the predicted sediment discharge based on the sediment rating curve was called observed sediment note that streambank erosion is an important driver in sediment transport that must be included in future research aimed at including unaccounted processes to advance model prediction 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration the calibration was performed in a previous study lee et al 2021 that the hydrologic model was set up and tested in two periods 1995 1999 and 2009 2013 and showed good agreements with the measured data with nse values of 0 57 and 0 50 respectively fig 3 a and 3b since wepp and mike she mike 11 models are physically based models with inputs and parameters that are directly measurable from the field no calibration is supposed to be needed however effective hydraulic conductivities in wepp model and measurements of the parameters of the sink and source terms in the ade table 2 for the study area were not available and thus calibrated by comparing the simulation results with the measured sediment samples at the fisher station from 1992 to 1996 a comparison of the measured and simulated sediment load using the calibrated parameters table 2 resulted in an nse equal to 0 59 fig 3c and 3d note that during the calibration period the rdp data were not available and thus the calibration values were determined based entirely on the gauge network the calibrated parameters were then used for the simulation period 2013 2019 with the first two years used for the initialization of the model 3 2 point pair comparisons of precipitation to better understand the impacts of using radar rainfall as opposed to the gauged rainfall a comparison between the daily precipitation at the rantoul and normal stations and the radar in their nearest neighboring grid cells was conducted the two point pairs were analyzed in terms of the annual precipitation total monthly precipitation average and rain day frequency for average annuals radar precipitation was higher than the gauge precipitation but not significantly different based on the t test p 0 05 table 3 this is also in line with the results for the average areal precipitation for the watershed where the areal radar based rainfall was higher than the gauge based rainfall fig 1 in general however both sites showed similar patterns in terms of precipitation depth for yearly and monthly precipitation and noticeable differences between the two datasets were not observed fig 4 the radar at both sites showed higher rain day frequencies for light precipitation and lower frequencies for heavy precipitation compared to the frequencies of gauge table 3 the underestimation of moderate and heavy precipitation frequency can be due in part to the attenuation of radar signal with heavy rainfall range fade i e beam overshoots the rainfall as the beam elevation above ground increases with increasing distance from the radar site pathak and teegavarapu 2018 and the occurrence of smoothing when the data were gridded ensor and robeson 2008 despite the similarities in the two datasets it was hypothesized that the traditional statistical descriptors e g annual total and monthly average precipitation may not have captured the differences in these datasets since these descriptors cannot quantify the spatial variability of precipitation the influences of the spatial distributions of rainfall estimates throughout the watershed were therefore evaluated in terms of their impacts on streamflow and sediment discharge 3 3 impacts of improved streamflow to determine whether or not the improvement in sediment prediction was driven by the improvement in streamflow prediction due to the use of radar precipitation hypothesis 1 sediment yield from 2015 to 2019 were quantified using three objective functions the nse mad and rmse table 4 in addition monthly simulation results of areal mean precipitation across the watershed streamflow and sediment discharge at fisher station for the entire simulation period are shown in fig 5 note that precipitation and streamflow discharge are the same between the semi distributed and distributed models so that only d r and d g results were included in fig 5a and 5b the simulation results indicated that using the radar improved the streamflow simulations compared to the observed streamflow discharge at fisher station table 1 and fig 5b however it was proven that improved flow predictions did not necessarily improve the sediment yield predictions the two models with radar inputs d r and s r indicated that even though the streamflow discharge prediction improved by radar when semi distributed sediment sources were provided the reliable prediction for sediment yield cannot be guaranteed s r in table 4 therefore the hypothesis that the improved streamflow would improve sediment transport and yield predictions did not hold in this case 3 4 impacts of spatial variations in precipitation hypothesis 2 is an alternative scenario for hypothesis 1 that the sediment predictions are still improved without noticeable improvements observed in streamflow to examine this hypothesis two peaks observed in the simulation period were selected there were remarkable differences for sediment yield between d r and d g at high peaks such as in december 2015 and in october 2018 fig 5c even if streamflow differences in these periods were not noticeable fig 5b for these reasons these two events estimated by d r and d g were further examined to evaluate hypothesis 2 the heaviest rain events that occurred in december 2015 captured by radar and gauge are shown in fig 6 based on both observations we can infer that the heaviest rainfall was developed from the southeast of the watershed where the rantoul station was located and moved to the northwest of the watershed fig 6a 6c and fig 6d 6f the radar showed the spatial variations of precipitation throughout the watershed however since rainfall estimates by the gauge networks were based entirely on the point observations this created significant discrepancies between the two products for instance the rainfall estimates on the last day of the rain event reported zero value for the rantoul station fig 6f while the radar showed some variations from 36 mm to 49 mm for the corresponding area fig 6c the underestimation of rainfall especially on the last day of the event fig 6c and 6f resulted in the underestimation of sediment yield in december 2015 in other words zero precipitation was reported at rantoul station on the last day of the event assigning zero precipitation for most of the watershed this resulted in a misrepresentation of the highest peaks of sediment discharge during the simulation period when the gauge was used fig 5c in contrast to the december 2015 event the differences between the rainfall estimates between d r and d g across the watershed were not noticeable in october 2018 fig 5a despite the fact that the amounts of streamflow were almost the same fig 5b the gauge produced a peak in sediment load in october 2018 that was not observed in the radar fig 5c to understand the discrepancies the daily simulation results for the areal mean precipitation total soil loss sediment source streamflow and sediment yield at fisher station were examined in detail fig 7 the three largest peaks for soil loss estimations by gauge were observed on july 6 august 7 and september 7 in 2018 fig 7b and the peaks of rain events estimated by the gauge network yielded extreme peaks for sediment sources throughout the watershed even though large amounts of sediment production were generated the majority of sediment were deposited along their way because of the dry conditions i e flow depth in overland flow and streamflow were too small to carry the suspended sediment fig 7c and thus sediment yield at the fisher station was relatively low compared to the peak in october fig 7d the peak of sediment yield in october occurred as the flowing water detached the deposited soil particles throughout the watershed and transported the soil particles downstream in contrast to the flood peak that occurred in september precipitation at the normal site reported relatively heavy rain 54 mm on october 8 2018 this rain event along with the higher antecedent moisture conditions detached and transported the deposited sediment for most parts of the watershed resulting in the high peak of sediment yield at the outlet in october fig 7d from the simulation results only a few peaks of rainfall estimated in the past can have a critical impact on predicting sediment discharge even several months later the total rainfall estimated for the entire watershed for the three dates that generated soil loss peaks in 2018 were 71 mm and 204 mm for d r and d g respectively fig 8 the radar estimates reported extreme rainfall rates only for the small portion of the watershed i e clusters and the rest of the watershed received relatively small amounts of rain for these three dates fig 8a 8c generating relatively small amounts of soil loss and streamflow compared to the d g simulation in terms of soil loss and streamflow discharge in october both d r and d g simulations showed similar results since the precipitation rates were similar throughout the watershed fig 7a 7c however the consequences of overestimating the rainfall in the past dates fig 8d 8f resulted in completely different estimations of sediment yield in october fig 5d hence based on the discrepancies investigated in the simulated sediment peaks in 2015 and 2018 misestimating a few heavy rainfall events can result in unreasonable predictions of sediment yield in both short and long term predictions therefore we concluded that sediment transport process is driven by rainfall as threshold like processes across the watershed and thus resolving spatial variations in precipitation would improve sediment predictions at high peaks in other words we accepted hypothesis 2 that the use of rdp would improve sediment transport predictions regardless of streamflow predictions 3 5 impacts of semi and distributed sediment sources to evaluate hypothesis 3 that the use of rdp can improve the sediment predictions only when spatially distributed sediment sources are provided the simulation results using the semi distributed sediment source s r and s g were examined both results did not correspond with the observations well table 4 and failed to capture the high peaks in the simulation period fig 5c regardless of the precipitation inputs both s r and s g results showed the underestimation of sediment yield by averaging the values of the input data such as slope and soil properties in the semi distributed model fig 9 a the contributions from the most vulnerable areas to soil erosion where the rate of soil loss was significant were not properly represented these misrepresentations of the main forcing variables resulted in misestimating soil loss distribution across the watershed failing to capture most of the peaks observed in distributed mode fig 9b therefore we accepted hypothesis 3 that the use of rdp would improve sediment predictions only where sediment sources are spatially distributed based on the experiments for the three hypotheses using the four models we found that distributed precipitation such as rdp can improve sediment predictions only if sediment sources are spatially distributed sediment transport processes rely on co located rainfall events and sediment sources therefore modeling one without the other means that the combined effects of extreme precipitation and vulnerable areas are not conceptualized properly hence improved sediment predictions are only guaranteed when the spatial characteristics of both rainfall and sediment sources are addressed at a finer scale overall the simulation results indicated that the use of both finer resolution precipitation and soil loss could improve the representation of systemic responses of distributed hydrologic models for sediment discharge if sediment production were estimated using semi distributed models the local input characteristics such as slope and soil properties may be lumped together ignoring the contributions from the most vulnerable areas and this may cause the failure of capturing the high peaks or underestimation of sediment prediction fig 9 similarly the most important advantage of radar derived rainfall was its ability to capture the spatial variations of rainfall i e pattern and intensity across the watershed this is especially crucial if rainfall events characterized by the development of rainfall clusters across the watershed can result in significant localized sediment production and transport the use of gauge networks may under or over estimate sediment loads as a function of the distance from the rainfall clusters even if the simulated streamflow is not significantly different from the radar simulation this is expected to be exacerbated in agricultural fields which are the major sediment source around the world because of the unevenly distributed gauge stations with a bias towards mountain valleys and populated areas ensor and robeson 2008 liebmann and allured 2005 this study has confirmed that the full potential of using a radar derived rainfall in predicting sediment production and delivery can only be achieved when using a distributed sediment transport model thus the seamless integration of high resolution input data to distributed hydrologic models can result in better predictive power especially for the fate and transport phenomena including sediment where the spatio temporal characteristics of precipitation and sediment production at finer resolution is essential 4 summary and conclusions this study evaluated the impacts of using a semi distributed and a distributed sediment source model with gauged and radar based precipitation on sediment predictions an intensively managed agricultural watershed in central illinois that typically represents the agricultural landscape across the midwest was selected as a study area the hillslope erosion model wepp integrated with the physically based hydrologic model mike she was used to estimate daily flow and sediment sources in either semi distributed or fully distributed spatial discretization four models rain gauge based and radar rainfall based models with two types of sediment sources were evaluated based on their capability to simulate streamflow sediment production and sediment transport the multi annual simulation results were compared to the observed discharge and daily sediment discharge estimated by the sediment rating curves all of the three objective functions nse mad and rmse indicated that the model prediction improved with the use of rdp in a distributed sediment source setting the results with the semi distributed sediment source showed significant disagreement with the observed data for sediment yield regardless of precipitation inputs for the use of distributed sediment sources the significant discrepancies of sediment discharge were observed at high peaks between the radar and gauge based simulations that were mainly due to the lack of spatial variability in the gauged precipitation considering the distances between the watershed and the gauged stations in this study the gauge network failed to capture the occurrences of local precipitation events and thus could not account for sediment production and transport the use of radar derived rainfall however can eliminate this concern by improving the spatial discretization of precipitation across the watershed and hence resulted in a better predictive power of the streamflow and sediment transport models the traditional methods such as thiessen polygons for assigning precipitation based on gauge networks can result in a critical misrepresentation of precipitation variability including missing data and the irregular distribution of gauges with a bias towards the mountainous valley and densely populated areas the lack of certain periods of data and spatial bias issues can lead to poor simulation results in particular since agricultural fields are major sources of sediment bias and errors may even worsen for sediment prediction if the rain gauges were not densely installed the use of thiessen polygon with two gauge stations may be a worst case scenario and thus if gauge network is only available other methods such as linear interpolation should be carefully considered to assign precipitation across the watershed to improve the model performance in addition evaluating soil loss at a larger scale can result in misrepresentation of spatial characteristics across the watershed and thus the use of rain gauge network in lumped or semi distributed sediment models cannot represent actual field conditions and the consequences of the spatial distribution of soil erosion the integration of the spatial characteristics of rainfall and soil loss at a finer scale is essential particularly in simulating fate and transport phenomena that are directly driven by rain drop impacts and flowing water the findings in the present study indicated that enhancing distributed models by seamlessly integrating higher resolution precipitation and sediment production inputs is critical to advance the prediction of sediment transport and yield in both short and long term simulations in this paper daily time step and field scale spatial resolution were used due to the model s limitations in managing large datasets the use of finer resolution input data is expected to improve the model performance and thus a tool that can seamlessly integrate these datasets should be developed in contrast the lumped or semi distributed soil loss models can lead to unreliable simulation results as they can wipe out the vulnerable area to soil erosion resulting in missing high peaks of sediment source across the watershed in addition the use of rdp may not significantly impact the hydrologic response of the system in terms of streamflow however in terms of the sediment predictions the radar rainfall based simulation enhanced model performance only with the distributed sediment sources while the gauge simulations failed to capture localized rain events that can significantly impact the fate and transport processes of sediment in particular the spatial misrepresentation of high intensity rainfall events resulted in the exacerbation of the discrepancies of sediment prediction compared to the streamflow prediction this is due in part to sediment prediction being driven not only by precipitation but also by the subsequent convolution of the hydrologic and transport processes that can further enhance the uncertainties from precipitation the use of rdp data with fully distributed settings in hydrologic and environmental models is expected to improve the predictions of systemic responses resulting in a better understanding of transport processes that are crucial for

4885,the capability of hydrologic models to spatially simulate the changes in hydrologic processes like precipitation is an important consideration in capturing the impacts of these processes on sediment prediction across the domain radar derived precipitation rdp provides an enhanced detail of rainfall characteristics in time and space compared to estimates from rain gauge precipitation rgp commonly used in hydrologic modeling however the impacts of these datasets on sediment fate and transport depend on how sediment sources were conceptualized in the model this paper developed a modeling framework to simulate sediment transport from upland to the stream and to the outlet of the watershed based on a gridded conceptualization and to examine the impacts of rgp and rdp with different types of sediment sources on sediment prediction the water erosion prediction project wepp model was used to estimate daily sediment sources in a semi distributed and fully distributed manner using the hydrologic model mike she and mike 11 model comparison was performed in a watershed in illinois characterized by a dominant agricultural landscape the results indicated that the use of rdp only ensured better model performance for sediment yield with the fully distributed sediment source that is combining both the ability of the rdp to capture the spatial variability of rainfall across the watershed and assessing sediment production at higher resolution improved the accuracy of predictions in sediment yield while decreasing uncertainties associated with sediment simulations advancing modeling capabilities will require the development of new modeling platforms that aim to seamlessly integrate large scale distributed simulations and environmental input data at finer spatial resolutions keywords sediment modeling distributed model sediment source radar rainfall soil erosion sediment yield 1 introduction it is widely known that the integration of the spatio temporal characteristics of precipitation in distributed hydrologic models is fundamental to advance the predictions of flow and transport phenomena at a watershed scale rainfall is a crucial variable in hydrologic modeling and its misrepresentation in time and space may result in the inaccurate convolution of subsequent processes related to water quantity and quality chaplot et al 2005 wei et al 2009 as an example sediment load and its associated transport of organic and inorganic compounds are source dependent syvitski et al 2000 highlighting the importance of the distributed simulation of the major drivers controlling soil erosion in particular detailed rainfall characteristics across a watershed may help improve the capacity of hydrologic models to represent better sediment sources surface routing and the expected suspended load in streams chaplot et al 2005 usón and ramos 2001 however the capability of hydrologic models to spatially simulate the changes in hydrologic processes like precipitation is an important consideration in capturing the impacts of these changes on sediment prediction across the domain above all simulating sediment production and transport using distributed models to fully capture precipitation s spatial variability is crucial in developing a holistic sediment prediction scheme it is apparent that the spatial variability of precipitation and sediment production poses a challenge in predicting sediment transport due in part to the uncertainties brought by how these two processes are represented in space and their complex interactions there have been previous research efforts to improve sediment predictions from lumped or semi distributed models using spatially varied precipitation as an example radar derived precipitation rdp has been used in predicting soil loss using either the universal soil loss equation usle wischmeier and smith 1978 or the water erosion prediction project wepp model flanagan and nearing 1995 fischer et al 2018 utilized rdp in the usle model to minimize the error arising from input data however the disagreements from the prediction were still observed due mainly to parameterization in that the parameters such as management factors do not reflect inter annual variations to reflect realistic field conditions rdp and remotely sensed parameters were used in predicting soil loss using the water erosion prediction project wepp model gelder et al 2018 however soil loss in this study was reported only as average annual hillslope erosion or sediment yield sheet rill not including ephemeral gully soil erosion at a sub catchment scale 90 k m 2 and sediment transport between the sub catchments was not considered and thus the validation of the model could not be provided in addition to capture the spatial variability of rainfall rdp had been used to estimate areal precipitation in the semi distributed models e g swat model for predicting sediment yield di luzio and arnold 2004 gao et al 2017 kalin and hantush 2006 however the impacts of the use of rdp in semi distributed models for sediment predictions were not discussed to better represent the spatial distribution of eroded soil and its transport soil erosion should be evaluated at a finer scale that can reflect fine resolution input data used in the model that is the use of rdp does not guarantee a better sediment prediction if the soil loss was predicted at a coarser level however none of the current studies evaluated the impacts of the use of rdp on sediment prediction in fully distributed settings in this study we hypothesized that distributed precipitation will improve sediment prediction only if sediment sources are spatially distributed specifically we explored the following hypotheses to examine the impacts of distributed and semi distributed sediment sources on sediment predictions under rdp and rain gauge precipitation rgp 1 the improved streamflow predictions that stemmed directly from rdp would improve sediment transport and yield predictions 2 the spatial variations in precipitation would improve sediment transport predictions regardless of streamflow predictions 3 the use of rdp would improve sediment predictions only where sediment sources are spatially distributed we developed four models to simulate sediment transport from upland to the stream and to the outlet of the watershed using gauged and radar precipitation in combination with a gridded conceptualization distributed and sub catchments level discretization semi distributed sediment sources the simulation results based on these four models were compared and examined to test each hypothesis 2 methodology 2 1 model description the study area is an intensively managed agricultural watershed in central illinois with an area of approximately 660 km 2 fig 1 the watershed is located in a temperate climate zone receiving a total annual average rainfall of 1 000 mm iepa 2007 the topography of the watershed is relatively flat with an average slope of 1 and most of the land is used for row crops 90 in this watershed the four separate models were developed for continuous multiannual simulations in an agricultural watershed to incorporate the three hypotheses to determine whether hypotheses 1 and 2 are acceptable the rdp and rgp were separately assigned as radar and gauge table 1 the rdp was assigned based on the national weather service national centers for environmental prediction nws ncep stage iv qpe lin 2011 while the rgp was simulated based entirely on precipitation from rain gauges rantoul and normal using thiessen polygon fig 1a note that the ncep stage iv product is a conus qpe 4 km grid precipitation collected from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa river forecast centers to determine whether hypothesis 3 is valid the sediment source across the watershed was estimated using the wepp model and the semi distributed and distributed sediment sources were estimated at sub catchment and grid levels respectively the watershed was discretized into 300 m grid cells and 49 sub catchments fig 1b in the distributed and semi distributed models respectively for sediment sources table 1 to simulate the fate and transport of sediment across the watershed the fully distributed hydrologic model mike she coupled with the one dimensional hydrodynamic river model mike 11 refsgaard and storm 1995 was used 2 1 1 precipitation impacts to determine whether or not spatially varied precipitation can improve sediment predictions hypothesis 1 and 2 two sets of precipitation data were used to quantify the differences of simulation results in streamflow and sediment discharges the hydrologic models commonly represent precipitation as time dependent areal variables in which precipitation is linked to the nearest station based observation this variable is commonly interpolated from neighboring stations statistically estimated using intensity durationfrequency curves or defined as an areal partition using thiessen polygons also known as the dirichlet voronoi polygons the use of areal precipitation estimates may result in the misrepresentation of sediment prediction on a mesoscale analysis hr day and 2 2000 km distance orlanski 1975 due to the coarse granularity of available gauge networks pathak and teegavarapu 2018 rdp provides an enhanced detail of rainfall characteristics across space compared to observations from rgp commonly used in hydrologic modeling however rainfall estimates based on stand alone radar systems are subject to several potential issues such as radar beam blockage nelson et al 2010 bright band enhancement smith et al 1996 anomalous propagation krajewski and vignal 2001 and uncertainty of microphysical parameters of z r relationships smith et al 1996 vasiloff et al 2007 to provide better precipitation estimates multiple sensors such as radars and rain gauges were fused to quantitatively enhance precipitation estimates qpe across the mesoscale pathak and teegavarapu 2018 to assess hypotheses 1 and 2 two sets of daily precipitation inputs were created one was based on the multi sensor qpe ncep stage iv analysis and the other was based entirely on ground based observations the closest to the watershed being the normal and rantoul stations fig 1a the spatial discretization of the modeled processes across the watershed was set to 300 300 m for a total of 7 303 grid cells to assign distributed precipitation at each grid cell the stage iv data were linearly resampled to 300 m hereafter called radar in contrast the gauged precipitation was determined using the thiessen polygon method and then resampled to a 300 m spatial resolution hereafter called gauge note that the thiessen polygon is a common practice in hydrologic modeling where ground based observations are used to represent the homogenous precipitation across large areas the spatial variation of the averaged total annual precipitation 2013 2019 estimated by radar ranged from 1 062 mm year 1 to 1 177 mm year 1 fig 1a in contrast precipitation at the rantoul and normal weather stations gauged precipitation was 1 043 mm year 1 and 1 035 mm year 1 respectively the radar was on average higher for the watershed than the gauge over seven years resulting in an annual total average of 1 138 mm year 1 and 1 038 mm year 1 for radar and gauge respectively a point pair comparison of the radar and gauge based precipitation was conducted by comparing the rainfall observations at rantoul and normal stations fig 1a and the radar estimates in their nearest neighboring grid cells where the rain gauges were located this was performed to determine how the two types of precipitation varied in terms of annual precipitation total monthly precipitation average and rain day frequency from 2013 to 2019 for the rain day frequency analysis the daily precipitation 0 1 mm was assumed as a non rainy day and the rain day was classified for light precipitation 0 1 p 4 mm day 1 moderate precipitation 4 p 20 mm day 1 and heavy precipitation p 20 mm day 1 arnone et al 2013 daily precipitation for each class was randomly sampled with replacement using bootstrapping to calculate the average rain day frequency for each class with 95 confidence intervals 2 1 2 sediment source impacts to examine hypothesis 3 whether or not the semi and distributed sediment sources would impact the sediment predictions the wepp model flanagan and nearing 1995 was used to provide the sediment source in two different modes semi distributed and distributed modes the wepp model is a continuous process based model that predicts soil loss and sediment deposition along hillslopes as well as in small agricultural watersheds in this study we utilized only the hillslope erosion component of wepp it simulates sheet and rill erosion at a field scale based on the raindrop impacts surface runoff generation hydraulic shear stress and sediment load in the flow the model was known to be applicable to a broad range of soil and climate conditions laflen et al 2004 tiwari et al 2000 zhang et al 1996 for distributed sediment sources the watershed was discretized into 300 m grid cells for a total of 7 303 cells across the watershed each grid cell was conceptualized as a single hillslope with a unique combination of climate topography soil and land use thus the time series of sediment sources in each grid have different values of sediment production throughout the watershed on the other hand for semi distributed sediment sources the watershed was divided into 49 sub catchments fig 1b and each grid in one sub catchment is assumed to have the same properties of slope soil land use the average slope was used for each sub catchment and dominant soil properties and land use were extracted from a corresponding sub catchment therefore 49 wepp simulations were performed for all sub catchments at the same scale as in the distributed model and assigned the equivalent time series within each sub catchment for precipitation inputs observed precipitation were used depending on the types of precipitation inputs table 1 for the simulation period the land uses were determined from the national agricultural statistics service nass usda 2016 and the following management practices were considered for the analysis based on survey data conducted by illinois department of agriculture idoa 2018 1 no till 2 mulch till 3 reduced till and 4 conventional tillage a more detailed description of land use and tillage systems for this watershed can be found in the paper of lee et al 2021 for both inputs the simulation results of sediment leaving the hillslope predicted from the wepp model were inserted as sediment sources in the distributed hydrologic model to transport the eroded soil across the watershed 2 1 3 water movement the hydrologic processes across the watershed and in the river were simulated by a physically based distributed model mike she and a 1d hydrodynamic model mike 11 respectively the mike she model simulated the overland unsaturated and saturated flows while mike 11 simulated the propagation of the hydrograph once the water reaches the river the hydrologic components in the coupled model included 1 d richard equation for the unsaturated flow kristensen and jensen method 1975 for the actual evapotranspiration 2 d diffusive wave approximation for the overland flow 1 d saint venant equations for the main channel and kinematic wave approximation for upstream tributaries and 3 d darcy s law for the saturated flow a detailed description of the mike she model can be found in refsgaard and storm 1995 the parameters of mike she being a physically based model are measurable in the field and thus input data were directly extracted from observation data the average slope of the watershed was approximately 1 obtained from the 30 m digital elevation model dem usgs 2016 the soil properties were extracted from the soil survey geographic database ssurgo usda 2017 and the land cover information was obtained from the cropland data layer cdl usda 2016 mostly occupied by corn 48 and soybeans 40 however due to the spatial variability of some parameters that were not adequately sampled calibration was performed to properly account for these variabilities subsurface drainage through tile drains was conceptualized by a linear reservoir model as a function of a drain level and a time constant and these two parameters were calibrated by comparing streamflow discharge at fisher station fig 1b botero acosta et al 2019 2 1 4 sediment movement the mike she and mike 11 models were used to transport sediment from the surface to the river network and to the outlet of the watershed through the rivers the fate and transport of sediment in the watershed were simulated by 1 d and 2 d advection dispersion equations ade with sink and source terms for sediment transport in rivers and overland flow respectively assuming the suspended sediment is completely mixed over the depth of water in the overland flow sediment production for each grid estimated by the wepp model was added as a source term in the ade while the rate of deposition s d and erosion s e as sink and source terms in the ade in the rivers can be expressed by 1 s d wc h 1 τ τ cr f o r τ τ cr where c is the sediment concentration w is the mean fall velocity of suspended particles h is the mean depth that the particles settle τ is shear stress of bed and τ cr is the critical shear stress deposition along the stream occurs when τ is less than τ cr 2 s e m h τ τ cr 1 b f o r τ τ cr where m is the erodibility of the bed h is the flow depth and b is the erosion exponent erosion along the river only occurs when τ is greater than or equal to τ cr note that the erosion rate is affected by the local hydraulic conditions and the deposition rate is affected by both local hydraulic conditions and sediment concentration 2 2 model performance four combinations of precipitation and sediment source data were used to simulate the streamflow and sediment load at the outlet of the watershed the fisher station fig 1b located at the outlet of the watershed was used as an assessment endpoint of the combinations of input datasets to evaluate the performance of the models in simulating streamflow and sediment the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the mean absolute difference mad and root mean square error rmse between simulations s and observations o were used eqs 3 5 note that the nse ranges from to 1 where nse equal to 1 means a perfect match between the simulated and observed variables while mad and rmse decrease with increasing model accuracy 3 nse 1 s i o i 2 o i o 2 4 mad s i o i n 5 rmse s i o i 2 n 2 3 sediment rating curve due to the lack of continuous sediment data within the simulation period a sediment rating curve was used to estimate the sediment discharge as the power law equation azadi et al 2020 syvitski et al 2000 tfwala and wang 2016 6 q s a q w b where q s is the suspended load q w is the flow discharge and a and b are the sediment rating coefficient and exponent respectively the 153 sediment grab samples collected from the fisher station from 1979 to 1997 were used to derive the rating curve considering that the main source of sediment in this watershed is from agricultural production rhoads et al 2016 the total number of samples was divided into the growing season may october and non growing season november april groups fig 2 these two groups showed distinguishable patterns in terms of sediment load at low to moderate flow generating higher sediment load in the growing season than in the non growing season to apply the rating curves to the simulation period it was assumed that the relationship between sediment and streamflow discharge remains constant over time this assumption was based on the channelization at a large portion of the streams and no significant changes in land use since the 1940 s mostly occupied by agriculture rhoads et al 2016 urban and rhoads 2003 in addition the two years of survey data 2017 2018 conducted by the illinois department of agriculture idoa 2018 showed that conventional tillage is still dominantly used and the rate of conservation practices such as no till is low in this watershed therefore it was inferred that changes in management practices were also not significant furthermore the watershed response to rainfall was examined based on the annual runoff coefficient using the rainfall at rantoul station and streamflow discharge at fisher station from 1979 to 2019 the spearman s rank correlation coefficient r indicated that there were no significant changes in the watershed response to rainfall over the period of record r 0 18 with this assumption the two sediment rating curves were separately applied to estimate the daily sediment load for the growing and non growing seasons based on the observed streamflow discharge for the simulation periods hereafter the predicted sediment discharge based on the sediment rating curve was called observed sediment note that streambank erosion is an important driver in sediment transport that must be included in future research aimed at including unaccounted processes to advance model prediction 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration the calibration was performed in a previous study lee et al 2021 that the hydrologic model was set up and tested in two periods 1995 1999 and 2009 2013 and showed good agreements with the measured data with nse values of 0 57 and 0 50 respectively fig 3 a and 3b since wepp and mike she mike 11 models are physically based models with inputs and parameters that are directly measurable from the field no calibration is supposed to be needed however effective hydraulic conductivities in wepp model and measurements of the parameters of the sink and source terms in the ade table 2 for the study area were not available and thus calibrated by comparing the simulation results with the measured sediment samples at the fisher station from 1992 to 1996 a comparison of the measured and simulated sediment load using the calibrated parameters table 2 resulted in an nse equal to 0 59 fig 3c and 3d note that during the calibration period the rdp data were not available and thus the calibration values were determined based entirely on the gauge network the calibrated parameters were then used for the simulation period 2013 2019 with the first two years used for the initialization of the model 3 2 point pair comparisons of precipitation to better understand the impacts of using radar rainfall as opposed to the gauged rainfall a comparison between the daily precipitation at the rantoul and normal stations and the radar in their nearest neighboring grid cells was conducted the two point pairs were analyzed in terms of the annual precipitation total monthly precipitation average and rain day frequency for average annuals radar precipitation was higher than the gauge precipitation but not significantly different based on the t test p 0 05 table 3 this is also in line with the results for the average areal precipitation for the watershed where the areal radar based rainfall was higher than the gauge based rainfall fig 1 in general however both sites showed similar patterns in terms of precipitation depth for yearly and monthly precipitation and noticeable differences between the two datasets were not observed fig 4 the radar at both sites showed higher rain day frequencies for light precipitation and lower frequencies for heavy precipitation compared to the frequencies of gauge table 3 the underestimation of moderate and heavy precipitation frequency can be due in part to the attenuation of radar signal with heavy rainfall range fade i e beam overshoots the rainfall as the beam elevation above ground increases with increasing distance from the radar site pathak and teegavarapu 2018 and the occurrence of smoothing when the data were gridded ensor and robeson 2008 despite the similarities in the two datasets it was hypothesized that the traditional statistical descriptors e g annual total and monthly average precipitation may not have captured the differences in these datasets since these descriptors cannot quantify the spatial variability of precipitation the influences of the spatial distributions of rainfall estimates throughout the watershed were therefore evaluated in terms of their impacts on streamflow and sediment discharge 3 3 impacts of improved streamflow to determine whether or not the improvement in sediment prediction was driven by the improvement in streamflow prediction due to the use of radar precipitation hypothesis 1 sediment yield from 2015 to 2019 were quantified using three objective functions the nse mad and rmse table 4 in addition monthly simulation results of areal mean precipitation across the watershed streamflow and sediment discharge at fisher station for the entire simulation period are shown in fig 5 note that precipitation and streamflow discharge are the same between the semi distributed and distributed models so that only d r and d g results were included in fig 5a and 5b the simulation results indicated that using the radar improved the streamflow simulations compared to the observed streamflow discharge at fisher station table 1 and fig 5b however it was proven that improved flow predictions did not necessarily improve the sediment yield predictions the two models with radar inputs d r and s r indicated that even though the streamflow discharge prediction improved by radar when semi distributed sediment sources were provided the reliable prediction for sediment yield cannot be guaranteed s r in table 4 therefore the hypothesis that the improved streamflow would improve sediment transport and yield predictions did not hold in this case 3 4 impacts of spatial variations in precipitation hypothesis 2 is an alternative scenario for hypothesis 1 that the sediment predictions are still improved without noticeable improvements observed in streamflow to examine this hypothesis two peaks observed in the simulation period were selected there were remarkable differences for sediment yield between d r and d g at high peaks such as in december 2015 and in october 2018 fig 5c even if streamflow differences in these periods were not noticeable fig 5b for these reasons these two events estimated by d r and d g were further examined to evaluate hypothesis 2 the heaviest rain events that occurred in december 2015 captured by radar and gauge are shown in fig 6 based on both observations we can infer that the heaviest rainfall was developed from the southeast of the watershed where the rantoul station was located and moved to the northwest of the watershed fig 6a 6c and fig 6d 6f the radar showed the spatial variations of precipitation throughout the watershed however since rainfall estimates by the gauge networks were based entirely on the point observations this created significant discrepancies between the two products for instance the rainfall estimates on the last day of the rain event reported zero value for the rantoul station fig 6f while the radar showed some variations from 36 mm to 49 mm for the corresponding area fig 6c the underestimation of rainfall especially on the last day of the event fig 6c and 6f resulted in the underestimation of sediment yield in december 2015 in other words zero precipitation was reported at rantoul station on the last day of the event assigning zero precipitation for most of the watershed this resulted in a misrepresentation of the highest peaks of sediment discharge during the simulation period when the gauge was used fig 5c in contrast to the december 2015 event the differences between the rainfall estimates between d r and d g across the watershed were not noticeable in october 2018 fig 5a despite the fact that the amounts of streamflow were almost the same fig 5b the gauge produced a peak in sediment load in october 2018 that was not observed in the radar fig 5c to understand the discrepancies the daily simulation results for the areal mean precipitation total soil loss sediment source streamflow and sediment yield at fisher station were examined in detail fig 7 the three largest peaks for soil loss estimations by gauge were observed on july 6 august 7 and september 7 in 2018 fig 7b and the peaks of rain events estimated by the gauge network yielded extreme peaks for sediment sources throughout the watershed even though large amounts of sediment production were generated the majority of sediment were deposited along their way because of the dry conditions i e flow depth in overland flow and streamflow were too small to carry the suspended sediment fig 7c and thus sediment yield at the fisher station was relatively low compared to the peak in october fig 7d the peak of sediment yield in october occurred as the flowing water detached the deposited soil particles throughout the watershed and transported the soil particles downstream in contrast to the flood peak that occurred in september precipitation at the normal site reported relatively heavy rain 54 mm on october 8 2018 this rain event along with the higher antecedent moisture conditions detached and transported the deposited sediment for most parts of the watershed resulting in the high peak of sediment yield at the outlet in october fig 7d from the simulation results only a few peaks of rainfall estimated in the past can have a critical impact on predicting sediment discharge even several months later the total rainfall estimated for the entire watershed for the three dates that generated soil loss peaks in 2018 were 71 mm and 204 mm for d r and d g respectively fig 8 the radar estimates reported extreme rainfall rates only for the small portion of the watershed i e clusters and the rest of the watershed received relatively small amounts of rain for these three dates fig 8a 8c generating relatively small amounts of soil loss and streamflow compared to the d g simulation in terms of soil loss and streamflow discharge in october both d r and d g simulations showed similar results since the precipitation rates were similar throughout the watershed fig 7a 7c however the consequences of overestimating the rainfall in the past dates fig 8d 8f resulted in completely different estimations of sediment yield in october fig 5d hence based on the discrepancies investigated in the simulated sediment peaks in 2015 and 2018 misestimating a few heavy rainfall events can result in unreasonable predictions of sediment yield in both short and long term predictions therefore we concluded that sediment transport process is driven by rainfall as threshold like processes across the watershed and thus resolving spatial variations in precipitation would improve sediment predictions at high peaks in other words we accepted hypothesis 2 that the use of rdp would improve sediment transport predictions regardless of streamflow predictions 3 5 impacts of semi and distributed sediment sources to evaluate hypothesis 3 that the use of rdp can improve the sediment predictions only when spatially distributed sediment sources are provided the simulation results using the semi distributed sediment source s r and s g were examined both results did not correspond with the observations well table 4 and failed to capture the high peaks in the simulation period fig 5c regardless of the precipitation inputs both s r and s g results showed the underestimation of sediment yield by averaging the values of the input data such as slope and soil properties in the semi distributed model fig 9 a the contributions from the most vulnerable areas to soil erosion where the rate of soil loss was significant were not properly represented these misrepresentations of the main forcing variables resulted in misestimating soil loss distribution across the watershed failing to capture most of the peaks observed in distributed mode fig 9b therefore we accepted hypothesis 3 that the use of rdp would improve sediment predictions only where sediment sources are spatially distributed based on the experiments for the three hypotheses using the four models we found that distributed precipitation such as rdp can improve sediment predictions only if sediment sources are spatially distributed sediment transport processes rely on co located rainfall events and sediment sources therefore modeling one without the other means that the combined effects of extreme precipitation and vulnerable areas are not conceptualized properly hence improved sediment predictions are only guaranteed when the spatial characteristics of both rainfall and sediment sources are addressed at a finer scale overall the simulation results indicated that the use of both finer resolution precipitation and soil loss could improve the representation of systemic responses of distributed hydrologic models for sediment discharge if sediment production were estimated using semi distributed models the local input characteristics such as slope and soil properties may be lumped together ignoring the contributions from the most vulnerable areas and this may cause the failure of capturing the high peaks or underestimation of sediment prediction fig 9 similarly the most important advantage of radar derived rainfall was its ability to capture the spatial variations of rainfall i e pattern and intensity across the watershed this is especially crucial if rainfall events characterized by the development of rainfall clusters across the watershed can result in significant localized sediment production and transport the use of gauge networks may under or over estimate sediment loads as a function of the distance from the rainfall clusters even if the simulated streamflow is not significantly different from the radar simulation this is expected to be exacerbated in agricultural fields which are the major sediment source around the world because of the unevenly distributed gauge stations with a bias towards mountain valleys and populated areas ensor and robeson 2008 liebmann and allured 2005 this study has confirmed that the full potential of using a radar derived rainfall in predicting sediment production and delivery can only be achieved when using a distributed sediment transport model thus the seamless integration of high resolution input data to distributed hydrologic models can result in better predictive power especially for the fate and transport phenomena including sediment where the spatio temporal characteristics of precipitation and sediment production at finer resolution is essential 4 summary and conclusions this study evaluated the impacts of using a semi distributed and a distributed sediment source model with gauged and radar based precipitation on sediment predictions an intensively managed agricultural watershed in central illinois that typically represents the agricultural landscape across the midwest was selected as a study area the hillslope erosion model wepp integrated with the physically based hydrologic model mike she was used to estimate daily flow and sediment sources in either semi distributed or fully distributed spatial discretization four models rain gauge based and radar rainfall based models with two types of sediment sources were evaluated based on their capability to simulate streamflow sediment production and sediment transport the multi annual simulation results were compared to the observed discharge and daily sediment discharge estimated by the sediment rating curves all of the three objective functions nse mad and rmse indicated that the model prediction improved with the use of rdp in a distributed sediment source setting the results with the semi distributed sediment source showed significant disagreement with the observed data for sediment yield regardless of precipitation inputs for the use of distributed sediment sources the significant discrepancies of sediment discharge were observed at high peaks between the radar and gauge based simulations that were mainly due to the lack of spatial variability in the gauged precipitation considering the distances between the watershed and the gauged stations in this study the gauge network failed to capture the occurrences of local precipitation events and thus could not account for sediment production and transport the use of radar derived rainfall however can eliminate this concern by improving the spatial discretization of precipitation across the watershed and hence resulted in a better predictive power of the streamflow and sediment transport models the traditional methods such as thiessen polygons for assigning precipitation based on gauge networks can result in a critical misrepresentation of precipitation variability including missing data and the irregular distribution of gauges with a bias towards the mountainous valley and densely populated areas the lack of certain periods of data and spatial bias issues can lead to poor simulation results in particular since agricultural fields are major sources of sediment bias and errors may even worsen for sediment prediction if the rain gauges were not densely installed the use of thiessen polygon with two gauge stations may be a worst case scenario and thus if gauge network is only available other methods such as linear interpolation should be carefully considered to assign precipitation across the watershed to improve the model performance in addition evaluating soil loss at a larger scale can result in misrepresentation of spatial characteristics across the watershed and thus the use of rain gauge network in lumped or semi distributed sediment models cannot represent actual field conditions and the consequences of the spatial distribution of soil erosion the integration of the spatial characteristics of rainfall and soil loss at a finer scale is essential particularly in simulating fate and transport phenomena that are directly driven by rain drop impacts and flowing water the findings in the present study indicated that enhancing distributed models by seamlessly integrating higher resolution precipitation and sediment production inputs is critical to advance the prediction of sediment transport and yield in both short and long term simulations in this paper daily time step and field scale spatial resolution were used due to the model s limitations in managing large datasets the use of finer resolution input data is expected to improve the model performance and thus a tool that can seamlessly integrate these datasets should be developed in contrast the lumped or semi distributed soil loss models can lead to unreliable simulation results as they can wipe out the vulnerable area to soil erosion resulting in missing high peaks of sediment source across the watershed in addition the use of rdp may not significantly impact the hydrologic response of the system in terms of streamflow however in terms of the sediment predictions the radar rainfall based simulation enhanced model performance only with the distributed sediment sources while the gauge simulations failed to capture localized rain events that can significantly impact the fate and transport processes of sediment in particular the spatial misrepresentation of high intensity rainfall events resulted in the exacerbation of the discrepancies of sediment prediction compared to the streamflow prediction this is due in part to sediment prediction being driven not only by precipitation but also by the subsequent convolution of the hydrologic and transport processes that can further enhance the uncertainties from precipitation the use of rdp data with fully distributed settings in hydrologic and environmental models is expected to improve the predictions of systemic responses resulting in a better understanding of transport processes that are crucial for

4886,quantifying rainfall recharge thresholds including their spatial and temporal heterogeneity is of fundamental importance to better understand recharge processes and improving estimation of recharge rates caves provide a unique observatory into the percolation of water from the surface to the water table at the timescale of individual rainfall recharge events here we monitor nine infiltration sites over six years at a montane cave site in south eastern australia six of the drip hydrology time series have up to 100 hydrograph responses to rainfall over the monitoring period three sites do not respond to rainfall events we use two approaches to quantify rainfall recharge thresholds at an annual timescale for all nine drip sites the total annual percolation water volume was determined for each year of data daily rainfall recharge thresholds were then determined by maximising the correlation of annual percolation water volume and total precipitation above a variable daily threshold value the annual recharge amount methodology produced rainfall recharge thresholds for seven sites where high and significant correlations rank correlations 0 75 occur for daily precipitation thresholds between 6 mm and 38 mm day no rainfall recharge thresholds could be obtained from one site which had a low and constant annual drip amount and from one site which exhibited underflow behaviour at an event timescale for the six sites which had a hydrograph response to rainfall the 7 day antecedent rainfall amounts were determined minimum 7 day precipitation amounts prior to a hydrograph response for specific drip sites were in the range 13 28 mm and 75 of all recharge events had a 7 day antecedent precipitation between 20 7 and 38 1 mm combining all drip water monitoring sites and analysing the data by month identifies a seasonal variability in the minimum 7 day antecedent precipitation necessary to generate potential recharge from 15 to 25 mm in winter to 50 mm in february and march we apply a simple water budget model driven by p and et and optimised to the observed potential recharge events to infer a whole cave soil and epikarst storage capacity this storage capacity is between 50 mm using potential evapotranspiration 92 of events simulated successfully to 60 mm using actual evapotranspiration 79 of events simulated successfully modelling of individual drip sites identifies spatial heterogeneity in soil and epikarst storage capacities our approach using multiple methodologies allows the comparison between both daily and weekly rainfall recharge thresholds and modelled soil and epikarst storage for the first time keywords groundwater rainfall recharge karst hydrology cave drip water bucket models 1 introduction groundwater recharge is the downward flow of water reaching the water table adding to groundwater storage healy 2010 recharge is diffuse precipitation generated infiltration through the unsaturated zone occurring over large areas or focused from losing or leaking rivers wetlands and lakes and the base of closed depressions in karst areas scanlon et al 2002 the rainfall recharge threshold is the amount of precipitation that is required to overcome a combination of evapotranspiration losses and sub surface moisture deficits which control the initiation of vertical drainage of water downward water movement to the groundwater is therefore only possible at precipitation amounts above the range of recharge thresholds that can occur at any one location depending on spatial heterogeneity of soil and bedrock and antecedent climate conditions many techniques are available to quantify recharge thresholds for example using water isotopes water table fluctuations chlorine mass balance crosbie et al 2010 jasechko 2019 in general these are limited to monthly or lower resolution with uncertainty in both the source and timing of groundwater recharge caves situated in the unsaturated zone can be used as observatories for the movement of water from the surface to the aquifer uniquely at the temporal resolution of individual recharge events they can provide evidence of the infiltration of water at the ground surface and its subsurface movement towards the aquifer as potential recharge and can do so at spatially discrete locations within and between caves high temporal frequency continuous discharge time series of drip water infiltrating into caves was recently demonstrated for the first time as an unsaturated zone physical method healy 2010 that can identify rainfall recharge thresholds baker et al 2020 in a subtropical karst region over a five year monitoring period thirty one recharge events identified by increases in drip discharge were compared to surface precipitation records and a simple water balance model to quantify rainfall recharge thresholds and soil and karst storage capacity however due to the heterogeneity of water movement through karstified limestone not all cave percolation waters exhibit an increase in drip discharge after recharge generating precipitation events for example waters percolating from well mixed large volume karst water stores may have low variability in discharge rate over time other percolation waters may be generated from overflow underflow or bypass flow behaviour as karst water stores fill and overflow are bypassed or are drained in these cases it would be advantageous to have alternative methodologies to determine recharge thresholds and their spatiotemporal heterogeneity to investigate this further in this study we analyse nine drip water time series from the montane south glory cave in the snowy mountains of new south wales australia the recharge sites have been monitored from 2013 to 2019 with near continuous time series data gaps in the hydrology time series are infilled using a resampling method based on multiple point geostatistics see section 3 the first application to cave drip water time series we consider two methods to determine rainfall recharge thresholds for the first following barron et al 2012 the total annual recharge amount is compared to total annual precipitation for a range of specific daily rainfall thresholds using correlation analysis this approach is now applied for the first time due to the possibility of using the data infilling methodology the second method follows that of baker et al 2020 where recharge events recorded in hydrology time series are compared to the antecedent 7 day cumulative rainfall amount to obtain a 7 day rainfall recharge threshold the large number of recharge events identified over the 6 year monitoring period allows the quantification of monthly variability in rainfall recharge thresholds for drip water hydrology time series for the first time this is second application of cave drip water hydrology times series to determine rainfall recharge thresholds and the first for a montane climate we apply a simple water budget model driven by p and et and optimised to the observed recharge events to infer a whole cave soil and epikarst storage capacity observed rainfall recharge threshold amounts using two methods are compared to modelled soil and karst water storage amounts the first comparison between modelling and two rainfall recharge threshold methodologies the spatial heterogeneity of both recharge thresholds and modelled soil and karst water storage is quantified 2 site description south glory cave is one of the two glory hole caves of yarrangobilly caves in the snowy mountains of new south wales australia fig 1 located at 35 43 29 3 s 148 29 14 9 e and an elevation of 980 m australian height datum and within the kosciuszko national park the snowy mountains form part of the great dividing range a mountainous region along the eastern seaboard of australia the climate is classified as temperate montane with mild summers and no dry season köppen climate classification cfb peel et al 2007 the region experiences bushfires most notably the canberra 2003 fire and in 2020 during the monitoring period a low intensity hazard reduction burn was undertaken in 2015 hydrological monitoring of percolation water at south glory cave has the potential to inform other research at yarrangobilly caves which has predominantly focussed on understanding the potential paleoclimate record contained in cave drip waters markowska et al 2015 campbell et al 2017 tadros et al 2016 2019 and speleothems mcgowan et al 2018 glory hole cave is 243 m in length and is 100 m at its widest point the cave extends to more than 40 m below the surface in the unsaturated zone of west sloping ridge formed from limestone bedrock fig 2 a the ridge is approximately 700 m wide bounded to the south by an e w orientated valley and to the north by a ne sw orientated valley the local topographic high for the ridge is 1 4 km to the ne both bounding valleys have streams rules creek mill creek that sink to the east of the cave dye tracing has shown a recharge pathway for both creeks through to cave streams in river cave and federation cave spate et al 1977 caves located close to the yarrangobilly river fig 2b the estimated contributing catchment for south glory cave comprises the overlying limestone and possibly also the higher topography to the ne by lateral flow the cave is situated within limestone of silurian age highly fractured and marbleised with little primary porosity overlying the cave is a sub alpine open snow gum woodland with eucalyptus pauciflora subsp pauciflora and black sallee e stelullata coleborn et al 2016 soil cover at yarrangobilly is discontinuous and varies with slope and karstification and includes red clay sequences with a and b horizons of up to 30 cm depth and thin loose soils with a single horizon baker et al 2019 the extent of the epikarst is unknown long term drip water monitoring in three sections of the cave designated lr g m was established in 2012 and is ongoing in the early monitoring period diurnal variability in drip water percolation rate was observed at some locations most commonly in late summer with decreased drip rates in late afternoon and evening and attributed to tree water use coleborn et al 2016 drip water major ion trace element and isotope geochemistry analyses at the same long term monitoring locations identified well mixed waters with negligible water stable isotope variability over time and no impact from the 2015 hazard reduction burn coleborn et al 2018 2019 nine monitoring sites were selected for analysis g3 g6 g8 g10 lr1 m1 m4 m13 m14 these sites had the most continuous hydrological time series and are a subset of the twelve sites previously analysed for diurnal variability coleborn et al 2016 all monitoring sites were supersaturated with respect to calcium carbonate and had associated speleothem formations the type of speleothem can inform on the hydrological flow regime with stalagmites likely to have lower or less variable water fluxes amounts compared to flowstones percolating waters at m1 and m4 were precipitating stalagmites all other monitored percolation waters were precipitating flowstones monitoring sites m13 and m14 are less than 2 m apart the flowstone associated with site lr1 is notably brown in colour fig 1d in contrast to the white colour of the speleothems associated with the other monitoring sites for example fig 1c the brown coloration likely indicates the presence of chromophoric organic substances and associated organic bound metals and a greater soil connectivity compared to other monitoring sites 3 methodology daily precipitation data was obtained from the australian bureau of meteorology station located at yarrangobilly caves id 072141 data available at bom gov au climate data percolating drip water was monitored using stalagmate loggers collister and mattey 2008 the number of drips in 15 min was recorded with logger memory allowing recording 11 months of data data was downloaded from the loggers every 6 11 months with data gaps occurring due to logger failure logger dislocation or inability to access the caves missing data are present for 6 9 of the drip time series occurring in continuous gaps up to months long corresponding to temporary logger failures the gaps are infilled using a multiple point statistics mps technique mps already used to simulate and infill hydrological time series oriani et al 2014 2016 dembele et al 2019 is a stochastic simulation approach that generates random data patterns by mimicking the ones present in a training dataset which in this case is constituted by the available data from the same time series in particular a recent mps algorithm is used here called quicksampling qs gravey and mariethoz 2020 which generates the missing data with a simple resampling scheme the data in the neighbourhood of a missing target time step are retrieved and a similar data pattern is searched in the same time series a random pattern among the most similar k ones found is then chosen and the datum at its centre is assigned to the target time step the procedure is repeated for all missing data in a random order until the time series is complete in this way the generated data patterns preserve a realistic structure in continuity to their neighbour data in addition to the cited previous works that demonstrate the efficacy of the approach in this kind of application preliminary cross validation experiments have been performed on the present dataset for more details about the setup chosen and its validation see supplemental information methods including figures s1 and s2 total annual percolation water amount is determined for all nine drip water monitoring sites for the period 2013 2019 we recognise that caves form part of a preferential flow system through the limestone and it is difficult to relate the percolation volume observed in the cave to that which might occur in the wider karst system visual inspection of the drip rate time series showed that the hydrological year starts in april with an increase in drip rates occurring in all years after a late summer drip recharge minimum therefore total annual percolation water amount was determined from the 1st of april to the 31st of march annual amount in litres is compared to total annual precipitation amount in mm for different daily total precipitation thresholds 0 mm to 50 mm day a spearman s correlation matrix is used to determine the daily precipitation threshold with the strongest correlation to total annual percolation water amount visual inspection of the drip hydrology time series showed that six of the nine monitoring sites exhibited a hydrograph response as opposed to the other three sites which had relatively smoothed and temporally autocorrelated drip rate time series for these sites the timing of hydrograph response was compared to the 7 day antecedent precipitation following the methodology of baker et al 2020 to determine rainfall recharge thresholds the 7 day antecedent precipitation was determined for the days prior to and including the day of recharge this approach accounts for the effect of a prolonged rainfall period on recharge barron et al 2012 and allows for potential retardation of water flow through epikarst water stores the antecedent precipitation over timescale great than 7 day was not considered as the majority of precipitation events have a duration of 1 4 days and frequency of precipitation events associated with frontal systems associated with the mid latitude westerly zonal circulation is 7 14 days in winter potential recharge events were defined as occurring whenever 1 drip rates first increase from a baseline rate and 2 the drip water response has the properties typical of a karst hydrological response e g rapid increase in drip rates with varied patterns of drip rate decrease we excluded mps infilled sections of the timeseries for this analysis since caves form part of a preferential flow network in karst systems we expect that the rainfall recharge thresholds determined by this method will be lower than those experienced outside of zones of preferential flow descriptive statistics for the rainfall recharge thresholds for each drip water recharge sites and for all sites for each month of the year were derived daily precipitation and evapotranspiration data were used as input of a simple soil and karst water budget model which was used to quantify the soil and karst water storage capacity the model is described in detail in baker et al 2020 and is available at github com karsthub simple water budget model where the model structure is also presented the model is forced on a daily time step with daily precipitation p mm day and daily evapotranspiration mm day for comparison we use both actual aet or potential pet evapotranspiration mm day as model inputs due to uncertainties associated with aet data actual and potential evapotranspiration are obtained from the australian water resources assessment landscape model awra l version 6 0 viney et al 2015 frost et al 2018 awra l is a daily distributed water balance model at 0 05 5 5 km resolution which simulates water flow through vegetation upper and lower soil moisture stores and a groundwater store with model outputs which include actual and potential evapotranspiration runoff and deep drainage frost and wright 2018 actual evapotranspiration is estimated from 1 water evaporated directly from the canopy interception the upper soil water store and the groundwater store 2 water loss by transpiration from the lower soil water store the deep soil water store and the groundwater store in our simple water budget model two free parameters have to be determined the overflow capacity mm and a drainage parameter mm day the overflow represents the threshold that initiates fast and concentrated recharge mm day to the cave after field capacity of the soil and epikarst has been reached the two free parameters are optimised on the observation of recharge within a 7 day window of a precipitation event to minimise the difference between observed recharge events and modelled concentrated recharge a 7 day window was allowed as the timing of recharge at the different monitoring sites was observed to vary by several days likely due to the time taken for karst water stores to fill and overflow the window length of seven days was found most suitable by a trial and error procedure using windows lengths up to 10 days modelled estimates of the overflow capacity and drainage parameters are returned for this optimised solution the model was optimised to simulate the observed recharge events for a the whole cave for all recharge events identified at the cave obtain an overall soil and epikarst storage amount and also b for each individual monitoring site to quantify heterogeneity in modelled soil and epikarst storage capacity 4 results in the following section we will examine the considered drip site time series together with the associated weather record we present the estimation of rainfall recharge thresholds and the water budget model of the site fig 3 presents a comparison of time series for precipitation fig 3a modelled aet fig 3b cumulative p aet fig 3c precipitation events that are associated with drip recharge events are highlighted fig 3a the site shows that cumulative p aet increases over the six years of monitoring fig 3c with an average increase of 330 mm yr 01 04 2013 31 03 2019 as we use both aet and pet as input terms to our karst water budget model we also used modelled pet to calculate the cumulative p pet p pet had a negative trend of 180 mm yr over the same time period the drip hydrology time series are presented in fig 3d site lr1 and fig 3e all other drips and time series for all individual drip sites including infilled sections in figure s1 drip site lr1 is presented separately as visual inspection of the time series identified many more increases in drip rates at drip site lr1 compared to all the other monitored percolation sites several of the drip monitoring sites can be characterised as being flashy with rapid increases in drip rate from a baseline lr1 m4 m13 m14 drip monitoring site g10 has a smooth annual variability in drip rate with a rapid increase in drip rate at the start of each hydrological year which occurs in late autumn april may sites m1 g3 and g6 have a smooth seasonal variability in drip rate with no rapid increases in drip rate at the start of the year site m1 has low drip rates and a relatively invariant drip rate compared to the other sites sites g3 and g6 have flashy drip rate increases predominantly during periods of increased drip rate superimposed on the seasonal signal drip water monitoring site g8 has a contrasting time series to others with relatively consistent drip rates which are more variable during higher drip rate periods the total annual percolation water amount for each of the drip sites is presented in table 1 a with drips summed for the hydrological year starting april and converted to a volume assuming a constant drip volume of 0 15 ml drip 4 1 daily rainfall recharge thresholds determined using the annual percolation water amount threshold precipitation correlation method seven of the nine drip sites have statistically significant and positive correlations with annual precipitation above a specific daily precipitation threshold amount fig 4 table 1b only one drip site lr1 has statistically significant correlation between total annual precipitation and percolation water amount spearman s rank correlation rs 0 77 significant at 95 confidence level this site has a higher correlation between total annual percolation water amount and precipitation for a daily precipitation recharge threshold of 20 mm rs 0 94 significant at 99 confidence level fig 4 for these seven sites high and significant correlations all rs 0 75 significant at a 95 confidence level occur for daily precipitation thresholds which range from a minimum of between 6 mm m4 m14 and 38 mm g6 m13 and up to a maximum of 46 50 mm g8 m4 fig 4 table 1b the results from these seven sites suggest that 6 38 mm is the range of minimum recharge thresholds for daily precipitation at south glory cave supplementary figure s3 shows the relationship between annual percolation water amount and annual precipitation above the threshold value for the best correlation threshold value for each drip water monitoring site one site m1 has no significant correlations between annual percolation water amount and precipitation at any recharge amount site m1 has the lowest annual percolation water amount 10 l year one order of magnitude lower than the next highest annual percolation water amount with very little inter annual variability range 13 3 to 22 3 l site g10 has a significant negative correlation with precipitation for daily precipitation thresholds over 28 mm with the strongest correlation with a daily precipitation threshold of 34 mm rs 0 89 this site is distinguished by its relatively smooth time series with no flashy drip rate increases and we interpret its recharge response to precipitation as underflow behaviour from a karst store 4 2 7 day rainfall recharge thresholds using hydrograph response methodology over the six year period individual drip sites had between 21 site g10 and 102 site lr1 hydrograph responses and inferred potential recharge event averaging between 3 5 and 17 recharge events a year table 2 the greatest number of hydrograph responses are found at the four sites characterised by flashy increases in drip recharge lr1 m4 m13 and m14 with most events for the lr1 drip water precipitating the brown coloured flowstone the colour indicative of a significant soil water connectivity minimum 7 day precipitation amounts prior to a hydrograph response for specific drip recharge sites were in the range 13 3 lr1 to 28 2 mm g10 and 75 of all recharge events had a 7 day antecedent precipitation between 20 7 lr1 and 38 1 mm g3 fig 5 combining all recharge sites and analysis by month of hydrograph response shows a seasonal variability in the minimum 7 day antecedent precipitation necessary to generate potential recharge events from 15 to 25 mm in winter to 50 mm in february fig 6 no potential recharge to stalagmite drips was observed over the monitoring period in march with an inferred minimum 7 day precipitation threshold of 81 mm based on the maximum 7 day precipitation total over our monitoring period overall the 7 day rainfall recharge minimum thresholds of between 13 3 and 28 2 mm varying between sites correspond well to the amount and variability in the daily rainfall recharge thresholds of between 6 and 38 mm however monthly variability in 7 day rainfall recharge thresholds is greater than that observed between sites for the annual average 7 day rainfall recharge threshold 4 3 water budget modelling to quantify soil and karst storage water balance modelling was applied using both p and aet and p and pet as input data optimising the model to generate overflow from the soil and epikarst store to agree with observed occurrence of cave drip water recharge events to understand the general cave hydrological characteristics we undertook modelling of a combined observed cave drip water dataset for any occasion where recharge was observed at any of the monitoring sites excluding lr1 we also undertook modelling for each individual drip site fig 7 shows the timeseries of observed recharge events for the combined drip water dataset model input parameters and simulated recharge events showing fit and misfits to the model model fit to the combined recharge events shows that similar results are obtained using either aet or pet as an input parameter this is because at the daily timescale there is little difference in pet and aet in winter when the majority of recharge events occur and for recharge inducing events in summer daily aet can also approach pet due to the extra moisture available for transpiration the overflow capacity of the soil and epikarst varies from 50 mm using pet 92 of events simulated successfully to 60 mm using aet 79 of events simulated successfully these values are slightly greater in amount than the hydrograph derived 1 day average and 7 day minimum rainfall recharge thresholds indicating that the model is more representative of a larger diffuse recharge component than is captured by the cave monitoring a summary of the fit and misfits between the combined drip water observed recharge and simulated recharge is provided in table s1 investigation of this data provides further insights into the recharge processes occurring at the site the simulated recharge events occurred mostly after the observed recharge for 9 of 14 events and outside the 7 day window applied in the model this suggests that percolation waters can arrive rapidly at the cave via a pathway that by passes the soil and karst store for example this could be generated by quick run off from intense rainfall events which can activate by pass recharge pathways for 2 out of the 14 events recharge was simulated but observed only at the site lr1 the final 3 occasions where recharge was simulated and not observed occur during april june 2015 around the time of the first recharge events of the hydrological year and suggest the model misfits are due to uncertainties in model input terms or model structure as it reaches overflow capacity for the first time six observed recharge events were not simulated and for most of these events recharge was only observed at one site m4 this suggests a different recharge pathway at this site potentially from a by pass flow contribution or a smaller soil and epikarst water storage or drainage term than the other sites individual sites were also modelled modelled overflow capacity and drainage terms are presented for the simulations using aet in fig 8 and the time series of observed and simulated recharge events are shown in supplementary figure s4 we see a poorer model fit for individual sites compared to the combined dataset but despite this our analyses elucidate a spatial heterogeneity in overflow capacity this is most notable for drip site lr1 which has lower modelled overflow capacity in agreement with the lower rainfall recharge threshold for this site modelling suggests the absence of a significant karst water store and a lower overflow capacity and this would agree with the interpretation of the associated brown coloured flowstone indicating the dominance of the soil water store drip site g10 has the lowest model fit an optimum solution cannot clearly be selected model results did not change significantly with different drainage or overflow capacity values although compared with the other sites rather high drainage values are emphasised site m4 has a similar model optimum solution to other sites suggesting the failure to simulate some recharge event at this site is due to the model over simplifying the recharge process for example by pass flow that routes some water past the soil and epikarst store to the cave 5 discussion we apply two different methodologies on the same dataset to quantify daily rainfall recharge thresholds in both methodologies we cannot determine the surface catchment area for the potential recharge that we observe as cave percolation waters which would require the use of tracer tests in addition as cave systems form part of preferential flow pathways through karst we note that the recharge thresholds we determine best relate to the preferential flow pathways the annual percolation water volume amount methodology has the advantage that it can be applied to all drip water hydrology time series including those with little or no hydrograph response to recharge events and that it can generate a daily rainfall recharge threshold value for multiple percolation sites we hypothesise that percolation waters with relatively smoothed hydrographs would become more common in deeper caves where percolation waters would have a greater potential to have previously experienced storage and mixing and that this approach would be of utility however at this stage of development the technique is limited to annual average daily recharge threshold value when it is expected that this threshold will vary sub annually with antecedent climate conditions in addition the technique requires long term monitoring datasets here a minimum of six years is shown to be sufficient but longer time series would be advantageous the mps approach used to infill the missing data in the water drip time series is demonstrated to be a convenient technique to obtain a continuous signal from incomplete but representative records however the application on very large data gaps typically larger than the correlation length of the time series see the sample autocorrelation function supplementary figure s5 or very patchy datasets should be carefully considered since the technique can only use the data patterns present in the same time series in those cases it may not reconstruct the data structure reliably or generate long recurrence time events for the latter purpose models focussed on extreme events may be a more reliable approach the annual recharge amount methodology only produced rainfall recharge thresholds in 7 out of 9 cases and could not be applied to one site with low annual drip amount and low drip rate variability site m1 and one drip hydrograph with high autocorrelation g10 figure s5 with an inferred underflow behaviour the range of annual average daily rainfall recharge thresholds from 6 to 38 mm determined from this methodology agrees with the 7 day minimum rainfall recharge thresholds determined using the hydrograph response methodology 13 3 to 28 2 mm annual average ranging from 15 to 25 mm in winter to 50 mm in late summer the comparison of hydrograph responses to antecedent 7 day precipitation requires sufficient recharge events to produce a large enough dataset of antecedent conditions to reliably determine a minimum precipitation amount at our montane climate site this was achieved over a six year monitoring period however long monitoring times might be necessary at more water limited sites with less frequent recharge events with sufficient hydrograph responses monthly or higher resolution variations in recharge thresholds can be elucidated as well as differences in recharge thresholds between drips and the quantification of the percentage of sites where potential recharge is observed for each month the methodology can only work at drip sites where there is a hydrograph response here just six of the nine monitoring sites and we infer that this methodology is best suited to shallow caves where mixing and storage of water in the unsaturated zone is relatively limited at south glory cave the methodology was applied with a temporal resolution of 7 day antecedent precipitation as this best accounted for the different lag times of individual drip site hydrograph responses to precipitation and timing of precipitation within the 24 hour reporting period here the minimum 7 day precipitation is 50 mm in late summer due to high daily evapotranspiration rates which lead to greater rainfall amounts needed to reach soil field capacity and generate infiltration to the karst system in winter the minimum 7 day precipitation is 10 20 mm and in agreement with daily thresholds determined from annual recharge amount methodology 6 to 38 mm in these cooler months with low daily evapotranspiration we infer the soil moisture content is higher and less rainfall is needed for the soil to reach field capacity and for infiltration to the karst to occur after imposing the rainfall recharge thresholds on the rainfall time series of the study area the corresponding infiltrated water amount has been estimated we can compare our rainfall recharge thresholds these can be used as a secondary evaluation of our physical model of the soil and karst overflow capacity using a simple water budget equation that requires just precipitation and evapotranspiration as inputs optimised on the basis of simulating the recharge timings as closely as possible the soil and epikarst overflow capacity and drainage terms are quantifiable the modelled soil and epikarst overflow capacity of 50 60 mm combined with a daily drainage of between 0 and 6 4 mm is physically plausible at the event scale when compared to the observed 1 day average 6 38 mm and 7 day minimum 15 25 mm in winter 50 mm in summer rainfall recharge thresholds it also agrees with the observed little or no recharge in late summer when et is highest and the soil moisture deficit greatest analysis of the misfits between model and observations suggest that a rapid by pass flow can occasionally generate potential recharge in the cave this is a similar finding to our application of the same model to potential recharge observed in the macleay karst new south wales baker et al 2020 combined with the results from previous studies of karst drip water hydrology and its relationship to recharge our results help improve our understanding of karst water movement from the surface to the groundwater at different scales at a local scale the recharge thresholds determined here agree well to those estimated from comparison of soil moisture saturation and drip hydrology times series at the adjacent harrie wood cave 13 0 31 4 mm day markowska et al 2015 at south glory cave our observation that recharge is unlikely in late summer due to larger moisture storage deficits driven by increased evapotranspiration matches the timing of our observations of tree water use from karst stores and fractures these were also only observed in late summer evidenced through diurnal drip rate variations and indicative of trees accessing unsaturated zone water stores during periods of water stress coleborn et al 2016 in a national context two contrasting karst regions have now been investigated using the same methodology the minimum 7 day antecedent precipitation thresholds at the montane karst of south glory cave 13 3 to 28 2 mm are lower than at those observed in caves in the macleay valley mid north coastal new south wales lower macleay 33 3 mm upper macleay 30 1 mm baker et al 2020 the macleay valley is a warmer sub tropical region which experiences its greatest rainfall amount in late summer with water percolation into the caves often observed in march due to rainfall associated with the southernmost extension of the summer monsoon trough the macleay cave monitoring sites also contrast to south glory cave in that they typified by thin to absent soil cover and subtropical rainforest vegetation despite different climatology soil cover and vegetation type modelled soil and karst water storage amount are comparatively similar at both sites 50 60 mm at south glory cave 65 mm at lower macleay 80 mm at upper macleay this highlights the importance of the karst water store component of the soil karst water stores our south glory cave results fall at the lower end of the range of storage capacities reported globally from other applications of simple bucket type models 82 98 mm in spain hartmann et al 2013 87 mm in nsw australia cuthbert et al 2014 70 190 mm in jordan schmidt et al 2014 and 70 mm in texas usa heilman et al 2014 comparison between the number and timing of hydrograph responses in our cave percolation waters indicative of potential recharge with modelled deep drainage from the australian landscape water balance alwb australian water resources assessment landscape model awra l model is also possible this model is a small catchment scale gridded distributed water balance model with three soil water layers upper lower and deep with deep drainage the flux from the bottom of the deep soil layer 6 m into the groundwater this shows no relationship between observed recharge events and alwb modelled deep drainage which indicates a smooth sinusoidal variability in deep drainage with a summer minimum and winter maximum data not shown this is similar to observations at the macleay and further confirms the lack of utility of modelled deep drainage to karst systems that permit rapid water movement through preferential flow routes the extent to which represents deep drainage in karst systems away from preferential flow zones requires further investigation for example through water level analysis of boreholes or springs e g using observed spring hydrographs provided through the wokas database wokas olarinoye et al 2020 in a global context we can compare our results to investigations of cave percolation drip hydrology our observation of a drip recharge response within 7 days of rainfall is similar to that in caves with a depth less than 30 m below surface tooth and fairchild 2003 observe a maximum 3 day lag in drip water recharge response at the 20 m deep crag cave ireland and at 27 m below ground surface at mount carmel israel percolation waters were shown to respond within hours with a peak hydrograph up to three days after rainfall arbel et al 2010 in contrast at 61 m to 250 m below land surface williams 1983 reports drip hydrology responses up to 5 weeks after rainfall at carlsbad caverns usa rainfall recharge thresholds for cave percolation waters have been less widely reported our rainfall recharge thresholds at south glory cave are lower than those determined for the arid mount carmel karst of israel where lange et al 2010 report an irrigation experiment where 70 mm over 7 hours was not enough to generate recharge we can also compare our data to that of genty and deflandre 1998 who monitored one drip for five years from a belgian cave system and who showed a strong linear relationship r 0 97 between total recharge and annual water excess defined as p pet for a drip site with similar characteristics and total recharge amount to south glory cave conversely from a similar analysis we find spearman s rs correlations between 0 81 and 0 38 median rs 0 23 for our drip sites demonstrating that the heterogeneity of karst drip hydrology can lead to a more complex relationship between water excess and recharge amount this complexity also motivates a more in depth analytical approach as the one introduced in this study our approach can also be used to hindcast drip recharge amounts this would assist researchers investigating the water oxygen isotope record for example as a possible groundwater recharge indicator or as the drip water source for speleothem isotope archives a hindcast recharge amount record could then be compared to drip water δ18o at sites where this has been measured to hindcast monthly and annual drip water δ 18o over time or using measured rainfall δ 18o at a site at sites where this has been measured could be used to produce a hindcast of recharge weighted δ 18o finally at the yarrangobilly caves our observation of no recharge occurring in march suggests there will be an annual decoupling of stored and infiltrating waters this could lead to an annual geochemical signature in recharge water e g zn k na as observed in the adjacent harrie wood cave tadros et al 2019 our cave drip water monitoring programme was carried out throughout a period of positive southern annular mode which generally brings wetter than average summers hendon et al 2007 this suggests that the lack of march recharge is even more likely in a negative phase sam an annual flush of soil derived elements in the first recharge events of the hydrological year april would be of use for geochronological applications if preserved in speleothems smith et al 2009 6 conclusions we have investigated the relationship between rainfall amount and cave percolation water time series characteristics at the glory cave karst system yarrangobilly caves new south wales to determine rainfall recharge threshold amounts and through simple water budget modelling to determine soil and karst water storage volumes the study is based on a novel multidisciplinary approach composed of the following steps first the percolation water entering the cave is measured at different points using multiple water drip loggers secondly the obtained dataset is completed using a latest generation statistical algorithm based on data pattern reconstruction to have a gap free multivariate drip rate time series the final dataset shows different seasonal patterns and a detailed picture of the spatial heterogeneity of potential recharge inside the cave the percolation water times series characteristics are used to determine rainfall recharge thresholds at various timescales using two different methodologies total annual percolation water volume hydrograph response this estimation of rainfall recharge thresholds daily and 7 day annual average and monthly average has been corroborated by the estimation of the storage capacity of the karst system quantified with a simple water budget model the proposed approach relying on low cost instrumentation and limited modelling efforts has the potential of allowing a detailed observation of the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of potential recharge observed as water percolating into cave environments future applications include a more accurate estimation of the recharge by means of remote sensing tools once the distribution of the relationship between annual recharge amount and precipitation above threshold value has been quantified for sufficient drip waters upscaling using lidar mapping can quantify the total number of drip sources mahmud et al 2016 this would allow a more reliable annual water balance estimation based on the joint statistical

4886,quantifying rainfall recharge thresholds including their spatial and temporal heterogeneity is of fundamental importance to better understand recharge processes and improving estimation of recharge rates caves provide a unique observatory into the percolation of water from the surface to the water table at the timescale of individual rainfall recharge events here we monitor nine infiltration sites over six years at a montane cave site in south eastern australia six of the drip hydrology time series have up to 100 hydrograph responses to rainfall over the monitoring period three sites do not respond to rainfall events we use two approaches to quantify rainfall recharge thresholds at an annual timescale for all nine drip sites the total annual percolation water volume was determined for each year of data daily rainfall recharge thresholds were then determined by maximising the correlation of annual percolation water volume and total precipitation above a variable daily threshold value the annual recharge amount methodology produced rainfall recharge thresholds for seven sites where high and significant correlations rank correlations 0 75 occur for daily precipitation thresholds between 6 mm and 38 mm day no rainfall recharge thresholds could be obtained from one site which had a low and constant annual drip amount and from one site which exhibited underflow behaviour at an event timescale for the six sites which had a hydrograph response to rainfall the 7 day antecedent rainfall amounts were determined minimum 7 day precipitation amounts prior to a hydrograph response for specific drip sites were in the range 13 28 mm and 75 of all recharge events had a 7 day antecedent precipitation between 20 7 and 38 1 mm combining all drip water monitoring sites and analysing the data by month identifies a seasonal variability in the minimum 7 day antecedent precipitation necessary to generate potential recharge from 15 to 25 mm in winter to 50 mm in february and march we apply a simple water budget model driven by p and et and optimised to the observed potential recharge events to infer a whole cave soil and epikarst storage capacity this storage capacity is between 50 mm using potential evapotranspiration 92 of events simulated successfully to 60 mm using actual evapotranspiration 79 of events simulated successfully modelling of individual drip sites identifies spatial heterogeneity in soil and epikarst storage capacities our approach using multiple methodologies allows the comparison between both daily and weekly rainfall recharge thresholds and modelled soil and epikarst storage for the first time keywords groundwater rainfall recharge karst hydrology cave drip water bucket models 1 introduction groundwater recharge is the downward flow of water reaching the water table adding to groundwater storage healy 2010 recharge is diffuse precipitation generated infiltration through the unsaturated zone occurring over large areas or focused from losing or leaking rivers wetlands and lakes and the base of closed depressions in karst areas scanlon et al 2002 the rainfall recharge threshold is the amount of precipitation that is required to overcome a combination of evapotranspiration losses and sub surface moisture deficits which control the initiation of vertical drainage of water downward water movement to the groundwater is therefore only possible at precipitation amounts above the range of recharge thresholds that can occur at any one location depending on spatial heterogeneity of soil and bedrock and antecedent climate conditions many techniques are available to quantify recharge thresholds for example using water isotopes water table fluctuations chlorine mass balance crosbie et al 2010 jasechko 2019 in general these are limited to monthly or lower resolution with uncertainty in both the source and timing of groundwater recharge caves situated in the unsaturated zone can be used as observatories for the movement of water from the surface to the aquifer uniquely at the temporal resolution of individual recharge events they can provide evidence of the infiltration of water at the ground surface and its subsurface movement towards the aquifer as potential recharge and can do so at spatially discrete locations within and between caves high temporal frequency continuous discharge time series of drip water infiltrating into caves was recently demonstrated for the first time as an unsaturated zone physical method healy 2010 that can identify rainfall recharge thresholds baker et al 2020 in a subtropical karst region over a five year monitoring period thirty one recharge events identified by increases in drip discharge were compared to surface precipitation records and a simple water balance model to quantify rainfall recharge thresholds and soil and karst storage capacity however due to the heterogeneity of water movement through karstified limestone not all cave percolation waters exhibit an increase in drip discharge after recharge generating precipitation events for example waters percolating from well mixed large volume karst water stores may have low variability in discharge rate over time other percolation waters may be generated from overflow underflow or bypass flow behaviour as karst water stores fill and overflow are bypassed or are drained in these cases it would be advantageous to have alternative methodologies to determine recharge thresholds and their spatiotemporal heterogeneity to investigate this further in this study we analyse nine drip water time series from the montane south glory cave in the snowy mountains of new south wales australia the recharge sites have been monitored from 2013 to 2019 with near continuous time series data gaps in the hydrology time series are infilled using a resampling method based on multiple point geostatistics see section 3 the first application to cave drip water time series we consider two methods to determine rainfall recharge thresholds for the first following barron et al 2012 the total annual recharge amount is compared to total annual precipitation for a range of specific daily rainfall thresholds using correlation analysis this approach is now applied for the first time due to the possibility of using the data infilling methodology the second method follows that of baker et al 2020 where recharge events recorded in hydrology time series are compared to the antecedent 7 day cumulative rainfall amount to obtain a 7 day rainfall recharge threshold the large number of recharge events identified over the 6 year monitoring period allows the quantification of monthly variability in rainfall recharge thresholds for drip water hydrology time series for the first time this is second application of cave drip water hydrology times series to determine rainfall recharge thresholds and the first for a montane climate we apply a simple water budget model driven by p and et and optimised to the observed recharge events to infer a whole cave soil and epikarst storage capacity observed rainfall recharge threshold amounts using two methods are compared to modelled soil and karst water storage amounts the first comparison between modelling and two rainfall recharge threshold methodologies the spatial heterogeneity of both recharge thresholds and modelled soil and karst water storage is quantified 2 site description south glory cave is one of the two glory hole caves of yarrangobilly caves in the snowy mountains of new south wales australia fig 1 located at 35 43 29 3 s 148 29 14 9 e and an elevation of 980 m australian height datum and within the kosciuszko national park the snowy mountains form part of the great dividing range a mountainous region along the eastern seaboard of australia the climate is classified as temperate montane with mild summers and no dry season köppen climate classification cfb peel et al 2007 the region experiences bushfires most notably the canberra 2003 fire and in 2020 during the monitoring period a low intensity hazard reduction burn was undertaken in 2015 hydrological monitoring of percolation water at south glory cave has the potential to inform other research at yarrangobilly caves which has predominantly focussed on understanding the potential paleoclimate record contained in cave drip waters markowska et al 2015 campbell et al 2017 tadros et al 2016 2019 and speleothems mcgowan et al 2018 glory hole cave is 243 m in length and is 100 m at its widest point the cave extends to more than 40 m below the surface in the unsaturated zone of west sloping ridge formed from limestone bedrock fig 2 a the ridge is approximately 700 m wide bounded to the south by an e w orientated valley and to the north by a ne sw orientated valley the local topographic high for the ridge is 1 4 km to the ne both bounding valleys have streams rules creek mill creek that sink to the east of the cave dye tracing has shown a recharge pathway for both creeks through to cave streams in river cave and federation cave spate et al 1977 caves located close to the yarrangobilly river fig 2b the estimated contributing catchment for south glory cave comprises the overlying limestone and possibly also the higher topography to the ne by lateral flow the cave is situated within limestone of silurian age highly fractured and marbleised with little primary porosity overlying the cave is a sub alpine open snow gum woodland with eucalyptus pauciflora subsp pauciflora and black sallee e stelullata coleborn et al 2016 soil cover at yarrangobilly is discontinuous and varies with slope and karstification and includes red clay sequences with a and b horizons of up to 30 cm depth and thin loose soils with a single horizon baker et al 2019 the extent of the epikarst is unknown long term drip water monitoring in three sections of the cave designated lr g m was established in 2012 and is ongoing in the early monitoring period diurnal variability in drip water percolation rate was observed at some locations most commonly in late summer with decreased drip rates in late afternoon and evening and attributed to tree water use coleborn et al 2016 drip water major ion trace element and isotope geochemistry analyses at the same long term monitoring locations identified well mixed waters with negligible water stable isotope variability over time and no impact from the 2015 hazard reduction burn coleborn et al 2018 2019 nine monitoring sites were selected for analysis g3 g6 g8 g10 lr1 m1 m4 m13 m14 these sites had the most continuous hydrological time series and are a subset of the twelve sites previously analysed for diurnal variability coleborn et al 2016 all monitoring sites were supersaturated with respect to calcium carbonate and had associated speleothem formations the type of speleothem can inform on the hydrological flow regime with stalagmites likely to have lower or less variable water fluxes amounts compared to flowstones percolating waters at m1 and m4 were precipitating stalagmites all other monitored percolation waters were precipitating flowstones monitoring sites m13 and m14 are less than 2 m apart the flowstone associated with site lr1 is notably brown in colour fig 1d in contrast to the white colour of the speleothems associated with the other monitoring sites for example fig 1c the brown coloration likely indicates the presence of chromophoric organic substances and associated organic bound metals and a greater soil connectivity compared to other monitoring sites 3 methodology daily precipitation data was obtained from the australian bureau of meteorology station located at yarrangobilly caves id 072141 data available at bom gov au climate data percolating drip water was monitored using stalagmate loggers collister and mattey 2008 the number of drips in 15 min was recorded with logger memory allowing recording 11 months of data data was downloaded from the loggers every 6 11 months with data gaps occurring due to logger failure logger dislocation or inability to access the caves missing data are present for 6 9 of the drip time series occurring in continuous gaps up to months long corresponding to temporary logger failures the gaps are infilled using a multiple point statistics mps technique mps already used to simulate and infill hydrological time series oriani et al 2014 2016 dembele et al 2019 is a stochastic simulation approach that generates random data patterns by mimicking the ones present in a training dataset which in this case is constituted by the available data from the same time series in particular a recent mps algorithm is used here called quicksampling qs gravey and mariethoz 2020 which generates the missing data with a simple resampling scheme the data in the neighbourhood of a missing target time step are retrieved and a similar data pattern is searched in the same time series a random pattern among the most similar k ones found is then chosen and the datum at its centre is assigned to the target time step the procedure is repeated for all missing data in a random order until the time series is complete in this way the generated data patterns preserve a realistic structure in continuity to their neighbour data in addition to the cited previous works that demonstrate the efficacy of the approach in this kind of application preliminary cross validation experiments have been performed on the present dataset for more details about the setup chosen and its validation see supplemental information methods including figures s1 and s2 total annual percolation water amount is determined for all nine drip water monitoring sites for the period 2013 2019 we recognise that caves form part of a preferential flow system through the limestone and it is difficult to relate the percolation volume observed in the cave to that which might occur in the wider karst system visual inspection of the drip rate time series showed that the hydrological year starts in april with an increase in drip rates occurring in all years after a late summer drip recharge minimum therefore total annual percolation water amount was determined from the 1st of april to the 31st of march annual amount in litres is compared to total annual precipitation amount in mm for different daily total precipitation thresholds 0 mm to 50 mm day a spearman s correlation matrix is used to determine the daily precipitation threshold with the strongest correlation to total annual percolation water amount visual inspection of the drip hydrology time series showed that six of the nine monitoring sites exhibited a hydrograph response as opposed to the other three sites which had relatively smoothed and temporally autocorrelated drip rate time series for these sites the timing of hydrograph response was compared to the 7 day antecedent precipitation following the methodology of baker et al 2020 to determine rainfall recharge thresholds the 7 day antecedent precipitation was determined for the days prior to and including the day of recharge this approach accounts for the effect of a prolonged rainfall period on recharge barron et al 2012 and allows for potential retardation of water flow through epikarst water stores the antecedent precipitation over timescale great than 7 day was not considered as the majority of precipitation events have a duration of 1 4 days and frequency of precipitation events associated with frontal systems associated with the mid latitude westerly zonal circulation is 7 14 days in winter potential recharge events were defined as occurring whenever 1 drip rates first increase from a baseline rate and 2 the drip water response has the properties typical of a karst hydrological response e g rapid increase in drip rates with varied patterns of drip rate decrease we excluded mps infilled sections of the timeseries for this analysis since caves form part of a preferential flow network in karst systems we expect that the rainfall recharge thresholds determined by this method will be lower than those experienced outside of zones of preferential flow descriptive statistics for the rainfall recharge thresholds for each drip water recharge sites and for all sites for each month of the year were derived daily precipitation and evapotranspiration data were used as input of a simple soil and karst water budget model which was used to quantify the soil and karst water storage capacity the model is described in detail in baker et al 2020 and is available at github com karsthub simple water budget model where the model structure is also presented the model is forced on a daily time step with daily precipitation p mm day and daily evapotranspiration mm day for comparison we use both actual aet or potential pet evapotranspiration mm day as model inputs due to uncertainties associated with aet data actual and potential evapotranspiration are obtained from the australian water resources assessment landscape model awra l version 6 0 viney et al 2015 frost et al 2018 awra l is a daily distributed water balance model at 0 05 5 5 km resolution which simulates water flow through vegetation upper and lower soil moisture stores and a groundwater store with model outputs which include actual and potential evapotranspiration runoff and deep drainage frost and wright 2018 actual evapotranspiration is estimated from 1 water evaporated directly from the canopy interception the upper soil water store and the groundwater store 2 water loss by transpiration from the lower soil water store the deep soil water store and the groundwater store in our simple water budget model two free parameters have to be determined the overflow capacity mm and a drainage parameter mm day the overflow represents the threshold that initiates fast and concentrated recharge mm day to the cave after field capacity of the soil and epikarst has been reached the two free parameters are optimised on the observation of recharge within a 7 day window of a precipitation event to minimise the difference between observed recharge events and modelled concentrated recharge a 7 day window was allowed as the timing of recharge at the different monitoring sites was observed to vary by several days likely due to the time taken for karst water stores to fill and overflow the window length of seven days was found most suitable by a trial and error procedure using windows lengths up to 10 days modelled estimates of the overflow capacity and drainage parameters are returned for this optimised solution the model was optimised to simulate the observed recharge events for a the whole cave for all recharge events identified at the cave obtain an overall soil and epikarst storage amount and also b for each individual monitoring site to quantify heterogeneity in modelled soil and epikarst storage capacity 4 results in the following section we will examine the considered drip site time series together with the associated weather record we present the estimation of rainfall recharge thresholds and the water budget model of the site fig 3 presents a comparison of time series for precipitation fig 3a modelled aet fig 3b cumulative p aet fig 3c precipitation events that are associated with drip recharge events are highlighted fig 3a the site shows that cumulative p aet increases over the six years of monitoring fig 3c with an average increase of 330 mm yr 01 04 2013 31 03 2019 as we use both aet and pet as input terms to our karst water budget model we also used modelled pet to calculate the cumulative p pet p pet had a negative trend of 180 mm yr over the same time period the drip hydrology time series are presented in fig 3d site lr1 and fig 3e all other drips and time series for all individual drip sites including infilled sections in figure s1 drip site lr1 is presented separately as visual inspection of the time series identified many more increases in drip rates at drip site lr1 compared to all the other monitored percolation sites several of the drip monitoring sites can be characterised as being flashy with rapid increases in drip rate from a baseline lr1 m4 m13 m14 drip monitoring site g10 has a smooth annual variability in drip rate with a rapid increase in drip rate at the start of each hydrological year which occurs in late autumn april may sites m1 g3 and g6 have a smooth seasonal variability in drip rate with no rapid increases in drip rate at the start of the year site m1 has low drip rates and a relatively invariant drip rate compared to the other sites sites g3 and g6 have flashy drip rate increases predominantly during periods of increased drip rate superimposed on the seasonal signal drip water monitoring site g8 has a contrasting time series to others with relatively consistent drip rates which are more variable during higher drip rate periods the total annual percolation water amount for each of the drip sites is presented in table 1 a with drips summed for the hydrological year starting april and converted to a volume assuming a constant drip volume of 0 15 ml drip 4 1 daily rainfall recharge thresholds determined using the annual percolation water amount threshold precipitation correlation method seven of the nine drip sites have statistically significant and positive correlations with annual precipitation above a specific daily precipitation threshold amount fig 4 table 1b only one drip site lr1 has statistically significant correlation between total annual precipitation and percolation water amount spearman s rank correlation rs 0 77 significant at 95 confidence level this site has a higher correlation between total annual percolation water amount and precipitation for a daily precipitation recharge threshold of 20 mm rs 0 94 significant at 99 confidence level fig 4 for these seven sites high and significant correlations all rs 0 75 significant at a 95 confidence level occur for daily precipitation thresholds which range from a minimum of between 6 mm m4 m14 and 38 mm g6 m13 and up to a maximum of 46 50 mm g8 m4 fig 4 table 1b the results from these seven sites suggest that 6 38 mm is the range of minimum recharge thresholds for daily precipitation at south glory cave supplementary figure s3 shows the relationship between annual percolation water amount and annual precipitation above the threshold value for the best correlation threshold value for each drip water monitoring site one site m1 has no significant correlations between annual percolation water amount and precipitation at any recharge amount site m1 has the lowest annual percolation water amount 10 l year one order of magnitude lower than the next highest annual percolation water amount with very little inter annual variability range 13 3 to 22 3 l site g10 has a significant negative correlation with precipitation for daily precipitation thresholds over 28 mm with the strongest correlation with a daily precipitation threshold of 34 mm rs 0 89 this site is distinguished by its relatively smooth time series with no flashy drip rate increases and we interpret its recharge response to precipitation as underflow behaviour from a karst store 4 2 7 day rainfall recharge thresholds using hydrograph response methodology over the six year period individual drip sites had between 21 site g10 and 102 site lr1 hydrograph responses and inferred potential recharge event averaging between 3 5 and 17 recharge events a year table 2 the greatest number of hydrograph responses are found at the four sites characterised by flashy increases in drip recharge lr1 m4 m13 and m14 with most events for the lr1 drip water precipitating the brown coloured flowstone the colour indicative of a significant soil water connectivity minimum 7 day precipitation amounts prior to a hydrograph response for specific drip recharge sites were in the range 13 3 lr1 to 28 2 mm g10 and 75 of all recharge events had a 7 day antecedent precipitation between 20 7 lr1 and 38 1 mm g3 fig 5 combining all recharge sites and analysis by month of hydrograph response shows a seasonal variability in the minimum 7 day antecedent precipitation necessary to generate potential recharge events from 15 to 25 mm in winter to 50 mm in february fig 6 no potential recharge to stalagmite drips was observed over the monitoring period in march with an inferred minimum 7 day precipitation threshold of 81 mm based on the maximum 7 day precipitation total over our monitoring period overall the 7 day rainfall recharge minimum thresholds of between 13 3 and 28 2 mm varying between sites correspond well to the amount and variability in the daily rainfall recharge thresholds of between 6 and 38 mm however monthly variability in 7 day rainfall recharge thresholds is greater than that observed between sites for the annual average 7 day rainfall recharge threshold 4 3 water budget modelling to quantify soil and karst storage water balance modelling was applied using both p and aet and p and pet as input data optimising the model to generate overflow from the soil and epikarst store to agree with observed occurrence of cave drip water recharge events to understand the general cave hydrological characteristics we undertook modelling of a combined observed cave drip water dataset for any occasion where recharge was observed at any of the monitoring sites excluding lr1 we also undertook modelling for each individual drip site fig 7 shows the timeseries of observed recharge events for the combined drip water dataset model input parameters and simulated recharge events showing fit and misfits to the model model fit to the combined recharge events shows that similar results are obtained using either aet or pet as an input parameter this is because at the daily timescale there is little difference in pet and aet in winter when the majority of recharge events occur and for recharge inducing events in summer daily aet can also approach pet due to the extra moisture available for transpiration the overflow capacity of the soil and epikarst varies from 50 mm using pet 92 of events simulated successfully to 60 mm using aet 79 of events simulated successfully these values are slightly greater in amount than the hydrograph derived 1 day average and 7 day minimum rainfall recharge thresholds indicating that the model is more representative of a larger diffuse recharge component than is captured by the cave monitoring a summary of the fit and misfits between the combined drip water observed recharge and simulated recharge is provided in table s1 investigation of this data provides further insights into the recharge processes occurring at the site the simulated recharge events occurred mostly after the observed recharge for 9 of 14 events and outside the 7 day window applied in the model this suggests that percolation waters can arrive rapidly at the cave via a pathway that by passes the soil and karst store for example this could be generated by quick run off from intense rainfall events which can activate by pass recharge pathways for 2 out of the 14 events recharge was simulated but observed only at the site lr1 the final 3 occasions where recharge was simulated and not observed occur during april june 2015 around the time of the first recharge events of the hydrological year and suggest the model misfits are due to uncertainties in model input terms or model structure as it reaches overflow capacity for the first time six observed recharge events were not simulated and for most of these events recharge was only observed at one site m4 this suggests a different recharge pathway at this site potentially from a by pass flow contribution or a smaller soil and epikarst water storage or drainage term than the other sites individual sites were also modelled modelled overflow capacity and drainage terms are presented for the simulations using aet in fig 8 and the time series of observed and simulated recharge events are shown in supplementary figure s4 we see a poorer model fit for individual sites compared to the combined dataset but despite this our analyses elucidate a spatial heterogeneity in overflow capacity this is most notable for drip site lr1 which has lower modelled overflow capacity in agreement with the lower rainfall recharge threshold for this site modelling suggests the absence of a significant karst water store and a lower overflow capacity and this would agree with the interpretation of the associated brown coloured flowstone indicating the dominance of the soil water store drip site g10 has the lowest model fit an optimum solution cannot clearly be selected model results did not change significantly with different drainage or overflow capacity values although compared with the other sites rather high drainage values are emphasised site m4 has a similar model optimum solution to other sites suggesting the failure to simulate some recharge event at this site is due to the model over simplifying the recharge process for example by pass flow that routes some water past the soil and epikarst store to the cave 5 discussion we apply two different methodologies on the same dataset to quantify daily rainfall recharge thresholds in both methodologies we cannot determine the surface catchment area for the potential recharge that we observe as cave percolation waters which would require the use of tracer tests in addition as cave systems form part of preferential flow pathways through karst we note that the recharge thresholds we determine best relate to the preferential flow pathways the annual percolation water volume amount methodology has the advantage that it can be applied to all drip water hydrology time series including those with little or no hydrograph response to recharge events and that it can generate a daily rainfall recharge threshold value for multiple percolation sites we hypothesise that percolation waters with relatively smoothed hydrographs would become more common in deeper caves where percolation waters would have a greater potential to have previously experienced storage and mixing and that this approach would be of utility however at this stage of development the technique is limited to annual average daily recharge threshold value when it is expected that this threshold will vary sub annually with antecedent climate conditions in addition the technique requires long term monitoring datasets here a minimum of six years is shown to be sufficient but longer time series would be advantageous the mps approach used to infill the missing data in the water drip time series is demonstrated to be a convenient technique to obtain a continuous signal from incomplete but representative records however the application on very large data gaps typically larger than the correlation length of the time series see the sample autocorrelation function supplementary figure s5 or very patchy datasets should be carefully considered since the technique can only use the data patterns present in the same time series in those cases it may not reconstruct the data structure reliably or generate long recurrence time events for the latter purpose models focussed on extreme events may be a more reliable approach the annual recharge amount methodology only produced rainfall recharge thresholds in 7 out of 9 cases and could not be applied to one site with low annual drip amount and low drip rate variability site m1 and one drip hydrograph with high autocorrelation g10 figure s5 with an inferred underflow behaviour the range of annual average daily rainfall recharge thresholds from 6 to 38 mm determined from this methodology agrees with the 7 day minimum rainfall recharge thresholds determined using the hydrograph response methodology 13 3 to 28 2 mm annual average ranging from 15 to 25 mm in winter to 50 mm in late summer the comparison of hydrograph responses to antecedent 7 day precipitation requires sufficient recharge events to produce a large enough dataset of antecedent conditions to reliably determine a minimum precipitation amount at our montane climate site this was achieved over a six year monitoring period however long monitoring times might be necessary at more water limited sites with less frequent recharge events with sufficient hydrograph responses monthly or higher resolution variations in recharge thresholds can be elucidated as well as differences in recharge thresholds between drips and the quantification of the percentage of sites where potential recharge is observed for each month the methodology can only work at drip sites where there is a hydrograph response here just six of the nine monitoring sites and we infer that this methodology is best suited to shallow caves where mixing and storage of water in the unsaturated zone is relatively limited at south glory cave the methodology was applied with a temporal resolution of 7 day antecedent precipitation as this best accounted for the different lag times of individual drip site hydrograph responses to precipitation and timing of precipitation within the 24 hour reporting period here the minimum 7 day precipitation is 50 mm in late summer due to high daily evapotranspiration rates which lead to greater rainfall amounts needed to reach soil field capacity and generate infiltration to the karst system in winter the minimum 7 day precipitation is 10 20 mm and in agreement with daily thresholds determined from annual recharge amount methodology 6 to 38 mm in these cooler months with low daily evapotranspiration we infer the soil moisture content is higher and less rainfall is needed for the soil to reach field capacity and for infiltration to the karst to occur after imposing the rainfall recharge thresholds on the rainfall time series of the study area the corresponding infiltrated water amount has been estimated we can compare our rainfall recharge thresholds these can be used as a secondary evaluation of our physical model of the soil and karst overflow capacity using a simple water budget equation that requires just precipitation and evapotranspiration as inputs optimised on the basis of simulating the recharge timings as closely as possible the soil and epikarst overflow capacity and drainage terms are quantifiable the modelled soil and epikarst overflow capacity of 50 60 mm combined with a daily drainage of between 0 and 6 4 mm is physically plausible at the event scale when compared to the observed 1 day average 6 38 mm and 7 day minimum 15 25 mm in winter 50 mm in summer rainfall recharge thresholds it also agrees with the observed little or no recharge in late summer when et is highest and the soil moisture deficit greatest analysis of the misfits between model and observations suggest that a rapid by pass flow can occasionally generate potential recharge in the cave this is a similar finding to our application of the same model to potential recharge observed in the macleay karst new south wales baker et al 2020 combined with the results from previous studies of karst drip water hydrology and its relationship to recharge our results help improve our understanding of karst water movement from the surface to the groundwater at different scales at a local scale the recharge thresholds determined here agree well to those estimated from comparison of soil moisture saturation and drip hydrology times series at the adjacent harrie wood cave 13 0 31 4 mm day markowska et al 2015 at south glory cave our observation that recharge is unlikely in late summer due to larger moisture storage deficits driven by increased evapotranspiration matches the timing of our observations of tree water use from karst stores and fractures these were also only observed in late summer evidenced through diurnal drip rate variations and indicative of trees accessing unsaturated zone water stores during periods of water stress coleborn et al 2016 in a national context two contrasting karst regions have now been investigated using the same methodology the minimum 7 day antecedent precipitation thresholds at the montane karst of south glory cave 13 3 to 28 2 mm are lower than at those observed in caves in the macleay valley mid north coastal new south wales lower macleay 33 3 mm upper macleay 30 1 mm baker et al 2020 the macleay valley is a warmer sub tropical region which experiences its greatest rainfall amount in late summer with water percolation into the caves often observed in march due to rainfall associated with the southernmost extension of the summer monsoon trough the macleay cave monitoring sites also contrast to south glory cave in that they typified by thin to absent soil cover and subtropical rainforest vegetation despite different climatology soil cover and vegetation type modelled soil and karst water storage amount are comparatively similar at both sites 50 60 mm at south glory cave 65 mm at lower macleay 80 mm at upper macleay this highlights the importance of the karst water store component of the soil karst water stores our south glory cave results fall at the lower end of the range of storage capacities reported globally from other applications of simple bucket type models 82 98 mm in spain hartmann et al 2013 87 mm in nsw australia cuthbert et al 2014 70 190 mm in jordan schmidt et al 2014 and 70 mm in texas usa heilman et al 2014 comparison between the number and timing of hydrograph responses in our cave percolation waters indicative of potential recharge with modelled deep drainage from the australian landscape water balance alwb australian water resources assessment landscape model awra l model is also possible this model is a small catchment scale gridded distributed water balance model with three soil water layers upper lower and deep with deep drainage the flux from the bottom of the deep soil layer 6 m into the groundwater this shows no relationship between observed recharge events and alwb modelled deep drainage which indicates a smooth sinusoidal variability in deep drainage with a summer minimum and winter maximum data not shown this is similar to observations at the macleay and further confirms the lack of utility of modelled deep drainage to karst systems that permit rapid water movement through preferential flow routes the extent to which represents deep drainage in karst systems away from preferential flow zones requires further investigation for example through water level analysis of boreholes or springs e g using observed spring hydrographs provided through the wokas database wokas olarinoye et al 2020 in a global context we can compare our results to investigations of cave percolation drip hydrology our observation of a drip recharge response within 7 days of rainfall is similar to that in caves with a depth less than 30 m below surface tooth and fairchild 2003 observe a maximum 3 day lag in drip water recharge response at the 20 m deep crag cave ireland and at 27 m below ground surface at mount carmel israel percolation waters were shown to respond within hours with a peak hydrograph up to three days after rainfall arbel et al 2010 in contrast at 61 m to 250 m below land surface williams 1983 reports drip hydrology responses up to 5 weeks after rainfall at carlsbad caverns usa rainfall recharge thresholds for cave percolation waters have been less widely reported our rainfall recharge thresholds at south glory cave are lower than those determined for the arid mount carmel karst of israel where lange et al 2010 report an irrigation experiment where 70 mm over 7 hours was not enough to generate recharge we can also compare our data to that of genty and deflandre 1998 who monitored one drip for five years from a belgian cave system and who showed a strong linear relationship r 0 97 between total recharge and annual water excess defined as p pet for a drip site with similar characteristics and total recharge amount to south glory cave conversely from a similar analysis we find spearman s rs correlations between 0 81 and 0 38 median rs 0 23 for our drip sites demonstrating that the heterogeneity of karst drip hydrology can lead to a more complex relationship between water excess and recharge amount this complexity also motivates a more in depth analytical approach as the one introduced in this study our approach can also be used to hindcast drip recharge amounts this would assist researchers investigating the water oxygen isotope record for example as a possible groundwater recharge indicator or as the drip water source for speleothem isotope archives a hindcast recharge amount record could then be compared to drip water δ18o at sites where this has been measured to hindcast monthly and annual drip water δ 18o over time or using measured rainfall δ 18o at a site at sites where this has been measured could be used to produce a hindcast of recharge weighted δ 18o finally at the yarrangobilly caves our observation of no recharge occurring in march suggests there will be an annual decoupling of stored and infiltrating waters this could lead to an annual geochemical signature in recharge water e g zn k na as observed in the adjacent harrie wood cave tadros et al 2019 our cave drip water monitoring programme was carried out throughout a period of positive southern annular mode which generally brings wetter than average summers hendon et al 2007 this suggests that the lack of march recharge is even more likely in a negative phase sam an annual flush of soil derived elements in the first recharge events of the hydrological year april would be of use for geochronological applications if preserved in speleothems smith et al 2009 6 conclusions we have investigated the relationship between rainfall amount and cave percolation water time series characteristics at the glory cave karst system yarrangobilly caves new south wales to determine rainfall recharge threshold amounts and through simple water budget modelling to determine soil and karst water storage volumes the study is based on a novel multidisciplinary approach composed of the following steps first the percolation water entering the cave is measured at different points using multiple water drip loggers secondly the obtained dataset is completed using a latest generation statistical algorithm based on data pattern reconstruction to have a gap free multivariate drip rate time series the final dataset shows different seasonal patterns and a detailed picture of the spatial heterogeneity of potential recharge inside the cave the percolation water times series characteristics are used to determine rainfall recharge thresholds at various timescales using two different methodologies total annual percolation water volume hydrograph response this estimation of rainfall recharge thresholds daily and 7 day annual average and monthly average has been corroborated by the estimation of the storage capacity of the karst system quantified with a simple water budget model the proposed approach relying on low cost instrumentation and limited modelling efforts has the potential of allowing a detailed observation of the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of potential recharge observed as water percolating into cave environments future applications include a more accurate estimation of the recharge by means of remote sensing tools once the distribution of the relationship between annual recharge amount and precipitation above threshold value has been quantified for sufficient drip waters upscaling using lidar mapping can quantify the total number of drip sources mahmud et al 2016 this would allow a more reliable annual water balance estimation based on the joint statistical analysis of rainfall and discharge time series with the only requirement of a sufficiently long multiple year observation period credit authorship contribution statement andy baker conceptualization

4887,with the increasing impact of drought and anthropogenic c activities middle and high latitude lakes are increasingly facing exacerbated eutrophication the sister lakes hulun lake and buir lake the former located in the hulunbuir grassland in northeast china and the latter shared by china and mongolia have been exposed to outbreaks of harmful algal blooms habs of varying degrees in this study multi source remote sensing technologies were utilized to explore the essential factors causing hab occurrences in the hulun basin first a simplified adjusted floating algae index afai algorithm was applied to invert the hab sequence from 1984 to 2019 the results show that large scale habs were detected in both lakes on or close to the same days in 1984 1999 and 2013 from a long term perspective the hab events of hulun lake are more serious and intractable than those of buir lake in terms of outbreak frequency duration and scale furthermore the effects of meteorological and hydrological conditions were evaluated quantitatively in situ sampling of the two lakes highlights the limiting effect of nutrients on the algae flooding in buir lake with perennial outflow in contrast hulun lake turned into an internal flow lake without outlets from 2000 to 2012 and the decreasing water volume stimulated the accumulation of total nitrogen tn and phosphorus tp with averages of 2 36 and 0 21 mg l respectively analysis of the comprehensive driving factors demonstrates that the level of exogenous nutrients caused a difference in the severity of the hab event between the sister lakes which are largely determined by drought and eco unfriendly anthropogenic activities our work emphasizes the pivotal role of substantial increases of nutrient loads and stricter regulations are necessary to curb further deterioration of this situation keywords hulun lake buir lake multi source remote sensing harmful algal blooms habs drought anthropogenic activities 1 introduction droughts caused by global warming and anthropogenic pollution are universally known to be responsible for the destruction of the world s precious freshwater resources davidson et al 2016 as the specific manifestation of eutrophication outbreaks of harmful algal bloom hab events are detrimental to regional developments such as irrigation and aquaculture fishery and even tourism ho et al 2019 paerl et al 2016 in addition potentially lethal toxins in certain plankton algae such as microcystis and anabaena may cause substantial damage to the liver or nervous system of animals and even humans through direct drinking or food chain intake posing a severe threat to the natural ecosystem and public health tan et al 2017 therefore to understand the complicated factors responsible for the dynamic expansion of algae communities has become a significant global concern due to the variability and complexity of their formation mechanism the real time monitoring of complete hab events from the sudden emergence to the outbreak to the final extinction is difficult to achieve cannizzaro and carder 2006 shen et al 2019 field based monitoring methods can provide specific phytoplankton information e g genus or species category cell density but they are often time consuming laborious and unsuitable for macro scale recording of large scale hab events rantajarvi et al 1998 in contrast modern remote sensing technologies are an attractive alternative owing to the advantages of wide range high timeliness and low cost collecting remotely sensed images of habs every day or even every hour hu 2009 huang et al 2015 yip et al 2015 remote sensing algorithms for monitoring habs have made great achievements based on continuous data from both optical and microwave based techniques ha et al 2017 smith et al 2018 tan et al 2017 although synthetic aperture radar sar belonging to the latter group is characterized by superior high resolution all day operation and not being affected by bad weather in the study of wu et al 2018 hab monitoring based on sentinel 1c band sar data is only qualitative multispectral images are rich in band color information and the reflectivity between features in the same spectral band is different which facilitates the inversion of chlorophyll a chla concentrations to evaluate algae biomass matthews et al 2010 shi et al 2019 therefore the mainstream algorithms are based on numerous optical sensors that provide a wide range of data for target recognition including the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis medium resolution imaging spectrometer meris sea viewing wide field sensor seawifs and sentinel 3 ocean and land colour instrument olci landsat series karki et al 2018 malahlela et al 2018 moses et al 2009 shanmugam et al 2008 smith et al 2018 based on the spectral absorption characteristics of the phytoplankton community two different absorption peaks can be identified at the blue near 440 nm and red near 670 nm wavelengths suslin churilova 2016 xue et al 2017 the blue peak is the result of the strong reflectivity in the blue of the cyanobacterial pigments while the narrower red peak is caused by the selective absorption of chla lorenzoni et al 2015 zhang et al 2009 a less obvious peak at 620 nm is also present and is due to the absorption of phycocyanin pc following over 30 years of development and innovation based on the above spectral characteristics hab remote sensing can be divided into chla based and pc based duan et al 2012 sojawoźniak et al 2017 in chla based hab remote sensing the empirical spectral band ratio method is the most popular and widely used in the detection of bloom distribution changes in various large inland lakes odermatt et al 2012 universal research utilize in situ data to fit and predict chla based on the reflectance near its absorption peak in the red and near infrared nir spectral regions and several band ratio indices have been developed including the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi enhanced vegetation index evi normalized difference chlorophyll a index ndci and floating algae index fai hu 2009 shi wang 2009 zhang et al 2014 in addition semi empirical methods are proposed to combine the former and select the appropriate research band by following certain physical or optical characteristics of the algae pigments gons et al 2008 the pc based approach for hab recognition is challenging because of the special and inconspicuous nature of the absorption peak near 620 nm the pc concentration can be estimated by analyzing the shape of the spectral reflectance r rs s r 1 characteristic curve and regressing the correlation between the reflectance ratio and the pc absorption measured in situ li et al 2012 single band and band ratio indices such as r rs 595 r rs 660 and r r s 625 r r s 650 have been shown to be successful in pc based inversion algorithms ogashawara et al 2013 however the accuracy of the inversion results is greatly affected by a high absorption of chla total suspended matter tsm and colored dissolved organic matter cdom in certain study areas resulting in a reduced applicability and limitations of the approach for specific waters to make up for these shortcomings a semi empirical algorithm named pc index pci was proposed by qi et al 2014 that proved to be highly applicable in studies between lake taihu and lake dianchi with different local bio optical conditions over the past 50 years extensive research has been carried out on inland lakes in southern china in low latitude humid climates to explore the driving factors of natural conditions such as climate precipitation topography soil and anthropogenic activities on the stability of aquatic ecosystems cao et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 zhao fu 2019 however with increasing eutrophication and aggravated droughts lakes in northeastern china are also facing ecological imbalance cai et al 2016 since 2000 hulun lake has experienced water area shrinkage water level decline and has been highly trophic for a historically long period liang et al 2016 yuan et al 2019 meanwhile few studies have been carried out on buir lake a sister lake in the same water system as hulun lake to figure out how it is affected by an increased nutrient load in this study we conducted a series of experiments using multi source data on this semi arid lake group the study area is sparsely populated which is essential to determine the internal factors leading to frequent large scale hab events in hulun lake and provide inspiration for scientific control measures the objective of this study is to investigate the temporal and spatial variability of habs and the corresponding determinatefactors in the sister lakes hulun lake and buir lake this paper is organized as follows 1 inversion of the hab distribution sequence from 1984 to 2019 using multi source satellite data e g landsat series sentinel 2 2 discussion of the driving effects of meteorological conditions temperature wind speed air pressure sunshine hours and water level changes on hab events and 3 comprehensive consideration of the aquatic environment in the hulun basin as well as further studies of related cases of anthropogenic industrial development 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area hulun lake located in hulunbuir city in the northeast of china s inner mongolia autonomous region between the city of xin barag right banner and manzhouli 117 00 10 to 117 41 40 e 48 30 40 to 49 20 40 n is the fifth largest lake in china fig 1 a its shape is an irregular oblique rectangle with a long axis from southwest to northeast an average water depth of 5 75 m a water storage capacity of 13 85 billion m3 and a lake area of 2 339 km2 li et al 2013 zheng et al 2016 besides direct precipitation its water mainly originates from groundwater recharge and surface runoff the water supplying rivers include the krerlen river in the southwest and the orxon river in the east the xinkai river in the northeastern part has been cut off since 1998 liang et al 2017 turning hulun lake into a closed lake without outlets in addition to solve the problem of the decreased water level of hulun lake in recent years the local government redirected part of a river into the lake by building a diversion ditch from the hailar river that can supply up 0 75 billion m3 of water every year unfortunately although this has helped alleviate the drop of water level water pollution has not been markedly improved known as the sister lake and located about 80 km southeast of hulun lake buir lake covers an area of about 600 km2 with an average depth of 8 m and water storage capacity of 5 5 billion m3 buir lake is mainly fed water by the halaha river in the southeast the vast majority of buir lake is in mongolia with only 40 26 km2 of the lake surface in the northwest belonging to china hulun lake and buir lake are part of the same river system and are connected by the orxon river considering the similar geographic location and terrain conditions the freezing period of the two lakes probably occurs between early november of the current year to mid may of the following year both lakes play a significant role in protecting the regional ecological environment and are important to maintain the biodiversity and enriching the animal and plant resources of the hulunbuir grassland liu et al 2014 2 2 experimental data 2 2 1 multispectral data to expand the spatiotemporal analysis field of hab monitoring two different series of optical satellites were selected for lake water environment research one of which is nasa s landsat landsat data from four instruments are discussed namely the multispectral scanner mss thematic mapper tm enhanced thematic mapper plus etm and operational land imager oli zhang et al 2017 mss sensor data was collected by five satellites landsat 1 5 due to excessive cloud cover and image quality limitations landsat 1 2 3 mss data was discarded for this study the level 1 landsat data with cloud covers of less than 30 are all available on the united states geological survey usgs global visualization viewer https www usgs gov and the fmask algorithm was used for cloud masking qiu et al 2019 specific parameters for the experimental data used in this study are presented in table 1 the sentinel 2 mission is the first mission developed by the european space agency esa for the copernicus programme that launched twin satellites sentinel 2a and sentinel 2b equipped with multispectral instrument msi sensors due to the 5 day global revisit periodicity of sentinel 2 its data in recent years is more comprehensive than that of landsat 8 oli skakun et al 2017 and can be downloaded from the copernicus open access hub https scihub copernicus eu level 1c images from august 2015 to august 2019 were used and cloud masking was performed based on the bit flags of the qa bands zhang et al 2019b 2 2 2 sar data alos is the earth observation satellite launched by japan on january 24 2006 and is equipped with a phased array l band sar palsar palsar is an active microwave sensor and can be used for all weather observations throughout the day rosenqvist et al 2007 in this study radiometrically and terrain corrected rtc geocoded hh hv level 1 5 fbd palsar products from 2007 were used to retrieve the distribution of human settlements in the hulun basin which is available at https eocat esa int gaofen 3 gf 3 was launched by the china aerospace technology research institute cast on august 10 2016 and has been in operation since january 2017 it is china s first c band multi polarization sar imaging satellite with a resolution of 1 m http www zj view com gf3 it can be implemented in a wide range of applications including marine observations disaster mitigation water conservancy meteorology and many other fields chen et al 2019 shao et al 2017 gf 3 qpsi mode data is available at the national satellite ocean

contain 254 tracks in which all elevation data is stored according to geographic location among them track 27 passes through the edge of hulun lake and track 36 traverses the center of the lake therefore we chose track 36 of the jason 1 geophysical data record gdr c and jason 2 gdr d data for the time period 2002 to july and august 2016 respectively the specific water level is calculated using the following formula 1 gh h ell d i s mea c o r err h geo where gh is the standard height of the lake water level h ell is the elliptical height of the altimeter di s mea is the observation distance of the altimeter co r err is the correction of the measurement error and h geo is the height based on the geodetic datum relative to the reference ellipsoid li et al 2019 provide further details and discussion on the related parameters 2 2 4 luminous remote sensing data the visible infrared imaging radiometer suite viirs is one of the key instruments onboard the suomi national polar orbiting partnership suomi npp spacecraft which was successfully launched on october 28 2011 it has 16 medium resolution bands m bands each with 16 detectors with a spatial resolution of 750 m five imaging resolution bands i bands each with 32 detectors with a spatial resolution of 375 m and one full color day night band dnb with a spatial resolution of approximately 750 m throughout the scan bennett and smith 2017 after all the viirs pixels with dim night time lights ntl radiances 0 10 9 w c m 2 s r 1 were excluded to reduce background noise the monthly version 1 viirs dnb nighttime light images from december 2018 were used to determine the initial human settlement distribution in the hulun basin 2 2 5 meteorological and various economic data meteorological data for hulun lake and buir lake were obtained from the the xin barag right banner weather station 48 67 n 116 82 e and the xin barag left banner weather station 48 22 n 118 27 e and is available to download from the national greenhouse data system http data sheshiyuanyi com daily precipitation values were acquired from the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc becker et al 2013 which provides the gridded gauge analysis products derived from quality controlled station data https climatedataguide ucar edu various economic data of related industries from 2005 to 2016 is available from the hulunbuir statistics bureau http tjj hlbe gov cn and covers the development of industry agriculture animal husbandry tourism and specific sources of external nutrient input 2 3 field observations in situ hulun lake water quality data collected from august 2006 to august 2015 can be found in liang et al 2016 and contains the average concentrations of chla tn and tp to ensure randomness in sampling and considering the water supplied by the river a total of 11 sampling points was selected in the estuaries and the center of hulun lake correspondingly two sampling points were selected within the chinese territory of buir lake and one at the estuary of the halaha river the only water supplying river of buir lake daily sampling of chla tn and tp was conducted in the summer of 2016 16 24 july and 2017 8 15 august and the data were used to characterize the water properties of the two lakes each sampling point is accompanied by precise gps position data fig 1b all water samples were collected at approximately 0 25 m below the water surface filtered using whatman gf f filters and stored in a refrigerator until laboratory analysis the concentration of in situ chla was obtained by spectrophotometry using acetone as the extraction solvent siswanto et al 2013 according to chinese national standards hj 636 2012 and gb 11893 1989 tn was determined by performing alkaline potassium persulfate digestion uv spectrophotometry and tp was measured by ammonium molybdate spectrophotometry after acid digestion baird et al 2017 wang et al 2009 xu et al 2019 2 4 image pre processing for landsat series and sentinel 2 data the digital number dn was calibrated to the top of atmosphere toa reflectance ρ as follows 2 ρ π d 2 l esun cos θ s where d represents the earth sun distance θ s is the solar azimuth angle esun is the mean solar exoatmospheric spectral irradiance which is derived by applying sensor specific relative spectral response rsr functions to the thuillier solar spectrum and l is derived from the calibrated dns by using the parameters included in the metadata after the radiometric calibration for the landsat series data two band kaufman tanre model was selected for aerosol inversion in the atmospheric correction operation frantz et al 2016 the above preprocessing process was performed using the envi 5 3 software for sentinel 2 using the sen2cor official preprocessing plug in ansper and alikas 2018 9 band l2a data with a resolution of 20 m was generated the time period of which covered august 2015 to august 2019 as for the polarized sar polsar data the pre processing of gf 3 qpsi mode products included radiometric calibration complex data conversion multi look processing with a parameter of 3 3 refined lee filtering and geocoding the rtc level 1 5 product of alos palsar required none of the above steps the main part of this paper is shown in fig 2 2 5 algorithm for hab hierarchical extraction compared with the traditional single band threshold and two band ratio water indices carvalho et al 2010 gower 1994 the fai proposed by hu 2009 is less sensitive to environmental changes and thus has very stable extraction results with the further addition of a short wave infrared swir band it can also correct the complex atmosphere and eliminate a number of adverse effects of the atmospheric and thin clouds shi et al 2019 so far the fai has been an effective method for hab monitoring oyama et al 2015 and is defined by the following equation 3 fai r rc n i r r rc n i r r rc n i r r rc r e d r rc s w i r r rc r e d λ nir λ red λ swir λ red where r rc r e d r rc n i r r rc r e d are the surface reflectance of the red nir and swir bands respectively r rc n i r represents the reflectance linearly interpolated based on the red and swir bands and λ red λ nir λ swir are the central wavelengths of the corresponding bands respectively fang et al 2018a simplified the fai proposing a variation in their study on hulun lake the so called adjusted fai afai which is defined by equation 4 4 afai r rc n i r r rc r e d r rc s w i r r rc r e d orde r nir o r d e r red orde r swir o r d e r red where order represents the serial number of the corresponding band for different sensors table 2 the main reason for the simplification of the formula is that the spectra of the blooms have a similar waveform therefore although the center wavelengths of different data sources in the red nir and swir bands are different as long as the band range is wide enough the final extraction results will not be affected excessively shi et al 2019 by using a baseline reflectivity structure similar to that of the fai to reduce the difference between the nir and swir bands the afai highlights the characteristics of the reflection peak in the nir band the afai threshold determination for habs was conducted using the following steps first the initial afai threshold for the boundary between water and habs was set to 0 01 secondly the initial hab regions were expanded to reach twice their original size so that the histogram curve of the afai in the expanded area shows two peaks which represent the concentrated area of clear water pixels and habs pixels respectively finally starting from the minimum afai value the sum of the left and right standard deviations of the value were calculated the value corresponding to the minimum value of this sum is the optimal threshold fang et al 2018b after a series of tests it was found that the range of 0 02 to 0 03 is relatively stable in order to eliminate the atmospheric impact of a few images as much as possible which is necessary for a more precise segmentation of habs the initial threshold needs to be adjusted separately by visual interpretation shi et al 2019 regarding the threshold problem of concentration grading since the afai value does not truly reflect the concentration of chla fang et al 2018b we simplified it by performing hab classification algorithm based on experience value li et al 2011 zhang et al 2016b according to the hab characteristic of a considerable dynamic range of the reflectivity in the nir and green bands the average reflectivity of the pixels are calculated based on the pixel statistics window which are then divided into each level using the experience value by comparing the pixel values of landsat 8 oli and sentinel 2 afai images collected on the same day august 24 2019 we also developed a set of equivalent afai division standards for hab map extraction based on sentinel 2 data 2 6 water level prediction previous studies have shown that the rise of water level can reduce the algae biomass either directly by a dilution effect or indirectly by changing the limnological conditions of the aquatic environment with complicated mechanisms braga becker 2020 ji et al 2017 yang et al 2016 since the temporal resolution of the jason series satellites is 10 days and they only provide water level data until 2017 to obtain as much water level data as possible during the transit of the multispectral satellite and build a set of models predicting the water level through water surface area to weigh the impact of the water level of hulun lake on frequent habs we perform simple linear regression polynomial regression and tree regression based on existing data to obtain the optimal regression model the water area was calculated using the modified normalized difference water index mndwi water mask du et al 2016 which is defined by the following formula 5 mndwi r rc g r e e n r rc s w i r r rc g r e e n r rc s w i r where r rc g r e e n and r rc s w i r represent the toa reflectance of the green and swir bands respectively polynomial regression and tree regression were conducted to compare the model s performance li et al 2016 mutanga et al 2012 prasad et al 2006 due to the small amount of data for the water area and water level the data sets were divided into a training set and a test set at the 7 3 ratio commonly used in machine learning algorithms the accuracy evaluation indicators are represented by r2 and rmse as expressed by eqs 6 and 7 respectively 6 r 2 i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n x i x 2 1 i 1 n x i x i 2 i 1 n x i x 2 7 rmse 1 n i 1 n x i x i 2 where x i is the measured data x i represents the data obtained from the regression models and x is the mean of the x set 2 7 human settlement extraction the variation of the area and spatial distribution of surrounding human settlements can indirectly reflect the impact of urbanization on the ecological stability of lakes with regard to the identification of human settlements the high resolution polsar system combines different polarizations in its images to achieve a more comprehensive detection of features which can be applied in the classification target recognition and ground parameter inversion de et al 2018 zhang et al 2016a the most popular polsar scattering power decomposition schemes are derived from the initial study of freeman and durden and the yamaguchi four component method freeman and durden 1998 sato et al 2012 the freeman durden decomposition yields three scattering components surface double bounce and volume scattering an important assumption of the theory that the target has reflective symmetry increases the ratio of the cross polarized hv component in polsar observations causing oblique buildings or other man made structures to be easily confused with vegetation due to volume scattering mainly influenced by the hv component to reduce the proportion of volume scattering and the adverse effects caused by the large hv component in processing yamaguchi et al 2005 introduced helical scattering as the fourth component and the coherency matrix decomposition can be expressed as equation 8 8 t f s t s f d t d f v t v f c t c where f s f d f v and f c represent the coefficients of the corresponding physical scatterings t surface t double t volume and t helix are the expansion matrices considering the need to balance the hv channel power the power formulas of the four components are expressed by eqs 9 12 9 p c f c 2 im s hv s hh s vv 10 p v f v 4 t 33 2 p c 8 s hv 2 2 p c 11 p s f s 1 β 2 12 p d f d 1 α 2 where s hh s hv and s vv represent elements of the scattering matrix and s hv is the conjugation of s hv t 33 is an element of the corresponding coherency matrix which contributes significantly to p v α and β are unknowns to be calculated later sato et al 2012 rotated the coherency matrix by an angle to reduce the correlation of each component in relative azimuth as in eq 13 13 t θ t 11 θ t 12 θ t 13 θ t 21 θ t 22 θ t 23 θ t 31 θ t 32 θ t 33 θ r p θ t r p θ where means complex conjugation and transposition and r p θ is the rotation matrix represented in eq 14 14 r p θ 1 0 0 0 cos 2 θ sin 2 θ 0 sin 2 θ cos 2 θ then various branching conditions are set up to distinguish the scattering mechanism and the final decomposition framework can be expressed by equation 15 15 t f s t s f d t d f c t c f v t v dipole for c 1 0 f vd t v dihedral for c 1 0 where c 1 2 re f s β f d α t 11 t 12 1 2 f c t 11 and t 12 are elements of the rotation coherency matrix f s f d f c f v and f vd represent the coefficients t v dipole and t v dihedral represent the volume scattering matrix under the conditions of average distribution of dipole and directional dihedral target respectively in the experiments a total of 11 regions with available palsar and gf 3 data were selected for area change analysis through the npp viirs data the first six regions were chosen to perform the accuracy assessment based on high resolution google images as ground truth zhou et al 2017 evaluation indices are divided into overall accuracy oa commission error ce and omission error oe 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal change of habs in total 430 scenes of landsat images and 98 scenes of sentinel 2 images were downloaded separately to invert the dynamic changes of habs from 1984 to 2019 after processing and statistical analysis of the afai data 61 scenes with habs were detected afai grading maps with hab areas of over 100 km2 are summarized in fig 3 and show that the spatial distribution pattern of the hab occurrences is relatively random which may be closely related to both wind speed and direction at the time the satellite transited jing et al 2019 meanwhile the hab area has fluctuated significantly with the relative change rate between adjacent area values ranging from 97 93 to 2457 29 fig 4 in addition from july 15 to july 16 1999 the area decreased by 317 27 km2 with the relative change rate of 79 69 in just one day which further confirms that there is a certain contingency and variability in the occurrence of habs some periods of severe hab events in hulun lake can be identified the first peak is observed for the mid 1980 s during three consecutive years from 1984 to 1986 a large scale hab event broke out from the end of july to the beginning of august in this period the hab area reached a historical peak of 911 81 km2 on august 4 1986 the second largest outbreak occurred in the late 1990 s with an area of 458 27 km2 however during the next decade the water level continued to decline and hulun lake experienced hab events for 6 years that were characterized by a small area and low afai value the most recent period of continuous outbreaks started in 2013 when the water level began to rise again the introduction of sentinel 2 images after 2015 has exposed the frequency and persistence of hab events the outbreaks of almost every midsummer show a sparse distribution but long duration due to the limitations posed by the temporal resolution of the source data and cloud covers due to colder weather conditions no such phenomenon was observed in related years including 1987 1988 2001 2005 in general late july and early august are the time periods with peaks of disruptive hab events however in recent years the events have continued until mid september which corresponds to increased climate effects and worsened water quality conditions compared with hulun lake hab events in buir lake are shown to be rare by the multi source remote sensing hab monitoring carried out in this study a total of 413 available landsat series and 96 sentinel 2 images were evaluated but only 9 images with hab were found fig 5 accounting for only 1 76 of the total number of images at the time of the hab events the conditions of the two lakes are very similar and 1984 1999 and 2013 are also the time periods with large scale hab events in buir lake this suggests that in these years the conditions favorable for algae flooding were met including increased temperatures reduced precipitation and nutrient inflow into lakes the freezing periods of hulun lake and buir lake occur between early november of the current year to mid may of the following year during this time the extremely low temperatures greatly inhibits the photosynthesis and expansion of cyanobacteria previous studies have shown that the composition of planktonic algae of hulun lake during the freezing period is made up predominantly of harmless green algae 52 5 followed by diatom algae 29 8 while cyanobacteria the most important hab forming algae account for only 10 5 wang et al 2019 this failure of cyanobacteria to become the dominant community at low temperatures is the reason that hab events in hulun lake and buir lake are not as persistent and seasonal as those in lakes of southern china such as taihu lake and chaohu lake and due to the different geographical conditions at middle and high latitudes 3 2 variations in driving factors 3 2 1 meteorological conditions to further explore the important role played by meteorological conditions in a specific hab event the hab area monitored by remote sensing and the meteorological conditions on the day of satellite transit were analyzed using correlation analysis under the assumption that the hab area represents the volume of the algae biomass zhang et al 2019a four common meteorological indicators namely daily average temperature wind speed air pressure and maximum sunshine hours were correlated with the detected area since the relevant meteorological data is only available until 2018 56 sample points corresponding to satellite data were evaluated as shown in fig 6 a highly significant positive correlation was observed between hab area and temperature which demonstrates that the multiplication and expansion of dominant algae is closely related to the local temperature since water temperatures of 25 to 30 are suitable for the germination of algae cysts microcystis and other algae groups can quickly gain a competitive advantage in this temperature range accelerating the production of photosynthetic pigments to reach community expansion the rapid increase in temperature is an important determinate factor for the occurrence of large scale hab outbreaks ndong et al 2014 in terms of wind speed the statistical analysis shows a relatively small negative correlation but no obvious relationship with the local average daily pressure could be determined p greater than 0 05 studies have shown that the stability of water bodies is one of the necessary conditions for the formation of habs gentle wind and waves promote the algal expansion while wind speeds greater than 3 m s can submerge surface blooms ma et al 2013 as for the temperature there is a positive correlation between the maximum sunshine hours and hab area in addition we conducted multiple linear regression to comprehensively consider the driving effects of meteorological factors on hab the results show that the above factors explain 51 9 r² 0 519 p 0 000 n 56 of the hab area again confirming the leading role of meteorological conditions in hab events evaluating the effect of precipitation on the hab events in hulun lake however may prove difficult because precipitation can not only reverse the recharge relationship between rivers and lakes by changing the water volume supplied by the river but also increase the impact of surface runoff on exogenous nutrient input eventually causing a dual relationship with the hab event therefore in order to measure the effect of precipitation conditions laterally we retrieved the data of annual water level changes of hulun lake and of the runoff of the water supplying river 3 2 2 water surface area and water level water surface area and water level reflect changes in the water volume and are important indicators for the comprehensive consideration of various driving factors of habs in semi arid areas the performance of different water level prediction regression models is shown in fig 7 a given the small number of data samples the test set performance of the models after the 2 degree polynomial model tends to deteriorate it indicated that based on the performance of each model on the training set and test set the 2 degree polynomial model can achieve the optimal results in the description of the relationship between water level and water surface area for hulun lake without overfitting the r2 and rmse of which reached 0 989 and 0 025 for the test set respectively in addition the water level of training samples and test samples were respectively predicted based on the 2 degree polynomial model and the linear regression model of predicted water level and measured water level is shown in fig 7b the two straight lines almost overlap which once again verifies the superiority of the 2 degree polynomial model regression therefore it was chosen to predict the water level elevation using the existing water surface area fig 7c it can be seen that the average water level of hulun lake during the flood season shows a sharp downward trend from 1999 to 2012 after that it rose rapidly from 1984 to 2019 the surface area obtained from the water mask fluctuated between 1758 51 km2 to 2105 42 km2 in contrast buir lake the throughput lake between the orxon and the halaha river was characterized by extremely low surface area fluctuation from 1984 to 2019 ranging between 604 21 km2 and 611 12 km2 which corresponds to approximately one third of the hulun lake area based on the prediction of the water level at the occurrence of the hab event by the 2 degree polynomial model the correlation diagram between the water level and the hab area can be finally obtained as shown in fig 7d significantly negative correlation was found between the two indicators for hulun lake r² 0 39 p 0 002 n 61 3 2 3 nutrient concentration and chla the average nutrient and chla concentrations of hulun lake of recent years are shown in fig 8 and show an overall upward trend for both tn and tp concentrations from 2006 to 2011 in 2012 the average concentration of both decreased significantly with the relative change rate of 40 12 and 48 41 respectively which may be related to the slowing of the drought effect in 2012 and the beginning of the rising water level following this significant drop the concentrations began to stabilize liang et al 2016 with the average tn and tp concentrations of 2 36 mg l and 0 21 mg l respectively however these concentrations far exceed the lake eutrophication assessment standard threshold values of tn 0 20 mg l and tp 0 02 mg l ji et al 2014 this also indicates that the average concentration of tn and tp in hulun lake in the past ten years has reached more than 10 times the corresponding requirements of eutrophic lakes the corresponding tn tp ratio was high and stable except in 2007 and 2008 as for chla the direct indicator to measure habs it decreased at first and then increased reaching its peak in recent years during the analyzed time period all of the above indicators exceeded even the corresponding values of lakes in southern china such as taihu lake lü et al 2017 indicating that almost annual large scale hab outbreaks in hulun lake occur with sufficient nutrients available thus contributing to the continuing deterioration of the situation in addition our results show that the corresponding concentrations in buir lake are much lower with the range of chla tn and tp being 3 12 4 03 mg m3 0 46 0 79 mg l and 0 019 0 057 mg l respectively this is consistent with the absence of large scale hab events in buir lake since 2013 with the low concentrations of exogenous nutrients most likely limiting hab growth in order to constrain the source of the high nutrient concentrations in hulun lake the water from the inlets of the two water supplying rivers was sampled the trends of tn and tp over time shown in fig 9 indicate that the nutrient concentrations in the two estuaries are very similar and vary significantly resulting in an unstable lake environment the tn concentrations range between 1 81 3 03 mg l the tp concentrations between 0 09 0 54 mg l and they both reached their local minimum in 2012 in addition the increase in river runoff into the lake since 2012 further promoted the accumulation of nutrients 3 3 spatial distribution and area of human settlements as is shown in fig 1a the human settlements in hulun basin are mainly concentrated along the hailar river in the north of hulun lake and around the kherlen river in the southwest the extraction result of the human settlements is shown in fig 10 a and the accuracy assessment for human settlement extraction shows the oa of the gf 3 data generally higher than that of palsar table 3 moreover the roads were wrongly recognized as towns for regions c d e and f resulting in a generally high ce and thus a reduced oa further mountain shadows were misclassified in regions b and d causing the ce value to be higher than 15 in contrast the most accurate results were obtained for region a where the above problems were avoided with an oa of 91 62 and 95 32 for palsar and gf 3 data respectively overall the extraction algorithm can identify the scattering characteristics of human settlement regions as much as achievable the distribution of human settlements is denser after 10 years of regional urbanization showing an expansion trend of the surrounding areas fig 10 the relative change rate of the area of the selected regions ranges from 13 69 to 204 88 among them hulunbuir in the lower reaches of the hailar river has experienced the most significant changes from 25 61 km2 to 78 08 km2 combined with the long term hab frequency map shown in fig 11 for analysis the high frequency outbreak areas are mainly concentrated on the northeastern edge of hulun lake and the southwest part of the lake while hab events are less frequent in the east and southeast for the former there are densely distributed urban areas near the northeast edge such as manzhouli dalai nur district with relative change rate of 149 31 and 51 16 respectively the latter is close to the estuaries of kherlen river which flows through xin barag right banner with an area growth rate of 13 69 it indicated that from a long term perspective the distribution and expansion of human settlements have a potential positive impact on the spatial distribution of habs in hulun basin 4 discussions the size of the lake determines to a certain extent the self purification ability and stability of the lake ecosystem kane et al 2009 mooij et al 2010 xu et al 2005 over the past 20 years the sister lakes analyzed in this study exhibitedcertaindifferences in water quality hulun lake is lightly to moderately eutrophic in summer and lightly eutrophic in autumn and winter chuai et al 2012 jiang et al 2011 which poses a serious threat to the water security of the hulunbuir area however while mainstream optical remote sensing has not detected large scale hab events in buir lake since 2014 the nutrient concentration which is much lower than that of hulun lake still reached the threshold of lake eutrophication therefore this paper aims to highlight the similarities and differences in terms of meteorological and hydrological conditions and anthropogenic activities to further explore why the water quality problem of hulun lake has remained unsolved for such a long period of time 4 1 strengths and weaknesses of hab remote sensing in the hab remote sensing it is not easy work to realize real time monitoring of habs from the beginning of eutrophication of the water body to the rapid reproduction and expansion of cyanobacteria as the dominant species and eventually to the gradual extinction shen et al 2019 the rapid dynamics in the temporal and spatial distribution of habs also make it difficult to achieve accurate correspondence between transit satellite images and real time sampling for example on july 24 2015 severe outbreaks of habs were observed in the southwest of hulun lake 116 58 31 2 e 48 50 31 8 n and water samples were collected at various points in the sampling experiments fig 12 a b the field measurement was also carried out at the sampling points of buir lake and no obvious habs were observed visually however on july 28 when landsat 8 transited and captured images the habs monitored by the satellite mainly gathered in the north of hulun lake fig 3 a similar situation occurred at the end of july 2016 due to the fluidity of water the spatial and concentration distribution of algae in the lake change significantly with the wind direction and wind speed in addition there is also a huge difference between the spatial resolution of remote sensing image acquisition and the spatial scale of sampling which ultimately lead to a large difference between the location of hab events monitored by the satellite and the field sampling results near the satellite transit date this also shows a major challenge in the study of hab remote sensing large scale remote sensing interpretation and accurate field measurement have their own characteristics the two are complementary and cannot be replaced by each other based on the classic fai method the afai formula for band index is simplified and it can also correct the complex atmosphere and eliminate some adverse effects of the atmospheric and thin clouds a series of experiments by fang et al 2018a highlighted the effectiveness and reliability of afai and developed a set of threshold determination programs through the large scale remote sensing method in time and space the study for the dynamic changes of hab in long time series has been conducted and some findings can be observed in the rapidly changing hab phenomenon the hab events in hulun lake had not been significantly improved in the last 36 years but its scope and harmfulness has become more extensive in the context of climate warming 4 2 comparison of meteorological and hydrological conditions between sister lakes the annual meteorological data from 2005 to 2018 were collected by nearby weather stations fig 13 the average annual temperature trends of hulun lake and buir lake are similar with freezing periods between 170 and 180 days although the altitudes of the two lakes are approximately 642 m and 554 2 m respectively the temperature variations over the years are only up to 1 c the warmer climate of hulun lake is more suitable for the mass reproduction of algae the average precipitation gap between the two lakes for this time period derived from gpcc data is only 36 08 mm from 2005 to 2012 the average annual precipitation of hulun lake was less than 200 mm and continuous low runoff from the kherlen river and the orxon river contributed to the rapid shrinkage of the lake surface coupled with the impact of the structure of the inner lake liang et al 2016 the nutrients deposited in the lake also increase with the falling water level both lakes reached the average annual precipitation peak in 2013 the excessive precipitation in the face of a low water level promoted surface runoff and water exchange with the supply river which carried excessive nutrients into the two lakes and may have led to the simultaneously occurring large scale hab outbreaks on july 30 2013 fig 3 fig 5 it also shows that the probability of large scale habs in drought years is greatly increased fig 7 fig 13 in terms of the wind speed inhibiting the spatial expansion of habs the average annual wind speed of hulun lake is generally higher than that of buir lake and the gap has increased dramatically in recent years therefore wind speed cannot explain the difference in water quality between the two lakes in addition no significant correlation was found between air pressure and hab area fig 6 indicating that the difference of 10 hpa over the years does not account for the differences in water quality based on the above analysis it can be concluded that the prolonged drought and sudden heavy rainfall indirectly led to a rise of the internal nutrient concentration and the external nutrient input for the two lakes respectively which in turn increased the risk of large scale habs 4 3 analysis of anthropogenic impacts in general habs are characterized using the covered area and algae biomass which are mainly affected by meteorological factors and eutrophication zhang et al 2019a studies have shown extensive human activities can adversely affect the stability and balance of the aquatic ecosystems chislock et al 2019 chuai et al 2012 since a distinct contrast between the nighttime lights around hulun lake and buir lake was identified fig 1 it is necessary to evaluate the environmental impacts of anthropogenic activities on frequent habs using economic data table 4 the gross domestic product gdp growth rate of hulunbuir calculated by the expenditure approach has been slowing down from 2005 to 2018 the industrial production follows a similar trend after fluctuating during the first six years the gdp growth rate steadily declined until finally registering the first negative growth of 1 40 in 2017 which may result from economic transformation operations for the regulation and suppression of large polluting enterprises including fur processing plants and nitrate mining in the upper reaches of the kherlen river in addition smelters coal mining companies and cement plants are concentrated in the hailar district and heavy chemical industry bases tanneries and paper mills are located along the northeast of hulun lake table 5 the detailed data show that these heavily polluting industries grew rapidly until the government started to gradually reduce their proportion in 2015 as a result vast amount of industrial wastewater accumulated over the years and was discharged into the corresponding rivers as surface runoff thus inevitably reaching hulun lake which may explain the high frequency regional distribution characteristics of hab occurrence fig 11 meanwhile excessive grazing caused a degradation of the pastures that led to severe soil erosion in summers withabundant precipitation chen et al 2012 and is likely responsible for the first large scale hab events from 1984 to 1986 fig 3 fig 5 after the chinese government implemented the household responsibility system in 1983 an agriculture production system that allowed households to contract land machinery and other facilities from collective organizations herdsmen with a single production mode contracted the grassland around hulun lake and buir lake this resulted in a significant increase in livestock breeding and thus increased animal waste in the sister lakes fig 12c it directly led to the sharp increase of tn and tp in the aquatic ecosystem providing rich nutrient conditions for the occurrence of habs the application of chemical fertilizers in farmland along the two water supplying rivers had similar consequences unlike the variable changes in industrial output agriculture and animal husbandry have maintained relatively slight growth with an output value in 2018 three times that of 2005 the implementation of large scale farming operations has almost halved the number of livestock however animal husbandry has maintained a steady growth rate in most years generally speaking because animal husbandry is a traditional industry in hulunbuir the impact of irregular grazing behavior cannot be underestimated and is the primary factor leading to lake eutrophication the results listed in table 4 highlight the rapid development of tourism the second peak period of the hab sequence in 1999 may have been caused by the combination of a vigorously developed tourism industry after the expansion of the hulun lake nature reserve in 1996 and the closure of the xinkai river in 1998 when hulun lake became a closed lake the hulun lake tourist resort in the northeast and the gold coast tourist attractions in the southwest attract nearly 10 million visitors every year which drives the surrounding catering and service industry fig 12d tourism revenues have grown dramatically with a relative change rate of 18 31 and a share in total gdp of 54 69 in 2018 far exceeding both industrial enterprises and agriculture and animal husbandry mentioned above the local economy is clearly increasingly dependent on the income of tourism related industries however catering waste water food waste and uncivilized behavior of tourists also seriously burden the ecological balance of hulun lake the tourist attractions are located very close to areas with high incidence of habs which also indicates the important driving effect of tourism pollution 4 4 implication for enhanced lake ecological supervision based on the above economic data and the hab sequence from 1984 to 2019 we conclude that the deterioration of the water quality in hulun lake and buir lake is not only related to drought and less precipitation in general but also to the intensified human activity and relevant government policies since the 1980s the rapid increase of extensive animal husbandry has led to a higher nutrient base level in both lakes high economic returns were achieved by extensive production at the cost of the natural environment to restore the balance of trace elements simply by the annual water exchange of the lakes with the water supplying rivers and the evaporation of rainfall is difficult besides the tourism industry was strongly encouraged after 1996 and a number of grasslands were restored to protect tourism the local government implemented a series of governance policies and invested billions of yuan into improvement of the lake ecology after 2015 however the high concentration of nutrients in hulun lake that accumulated over the years has made these efforts a mere drop in the bucket and the corresponding beneficial effects have been greatly reduced the reason buir lake was able to maintain a relatively good water quality in recent years is that the random grazing by the lake was brought under control and the areas surrounding buir lake and upstream of halaha river are sparsely populated hence the impact of anthropicfactors such as overexploitation on buir lake is low which further confirms the necessity of enhanced ecological supervision the reduction of nutrient input through ecological management of the kherlen and orxon rivers is the most scientific and feasible method to reduce the frequency of habs in hulun lake paerl otten 2013 purifying the wastewater at sewage outlets can very effectively reduce water pollution furthermore strengthening controls on livestock grazing and metabolite emissions is also essential for the ecological restoration of the hulunbuir grassland in addition stricter enforcement of regulations should also be considered for curbing environmental damage in nature reserves huo et al 2019 5 conclusions hab outbreaks are a global problem and have caused economic losses on the order of billions of dollars furthermore they pose a huge challenge to the self purification capacity of freshwater ecosystems in addition to simplifying the traditional spectral index extraction of hab maps we conducted a series of experiments in a pair of sister lakes to constrain the driving factors of hab outbreaks our results show that drought and unreasonable anthropogenic activities have caused a continuous accumulation of tn and tp in hulun lake with average concentrations of 2 34 and 0 19 mg l respectively that resulted in ungovernable water pollution for the last 36 years the cause of the shrinkage of the semi arid hulun lake and its impact on the water quality were analyzed furthermore the deeper influence of human activities was also investigated in detail from 2007 to 2018 the human settlements in the hulunbuir grassland have grown as much as 3 fold and more frequent economic activity boosted the local gdp from 31 92 billion yuan in 2005 to 125 29 billion in 2018 high pollution industrial production developed animal husbandry and soaring tourism brought extensive economic benefits but also made hulun lake a major sewage accumulation point our results show that a warmer climate less rainfall and excessive anthropogenic development have a significant impact on the lake s ecosystem in contrast to previous studies we provide a new perspective to understand the anthropic factors that contribute to the eutrophication of semi arid lake groups despite insufficient sample numbers for the statistical analysis due to the remoteness of the study area and the multiple factors driving habs we discussed the dynamics of these potential factors and have attempted to constrain the mechanism using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods with the help of field measurements hab frequency map and existing statistical data based on the nighttime light remote sensing data urban extraction can help determine the variation of human settlements with time supplemented by economic statistics and compared with buir lake a semi quantitative analysis of the impact of various industries on the deteriorated water quality in hulun lake was conducted under the general trend of global warming the contribution of meteorological conditions to the reproduction and expansion of habs have become less stringent therefore actively taking appropriate measures to reduce the accumulated nutrients and restore the ecological balance of hulun lake is an urgent issue the local government needs to address credit authorship contribution statement jiaqi

4887,with the increasing impact of drought and anthropogenic c activities middle and high latitude lakes are increasingly facing exacerbated eutrophication the sister lakes hulun lake and buir lake the former located in the hulunbuir grassland in northeast china and the latter shared by china and mongolia have been exposed to outbreaks of harmful algal blooms habs of varying degrees in this study multi source remote sensing technologies were utilized to explore the essential factors causing hab occurrences in the hulun basin first a simplified adjusted floating algae index afai algorithm was applied to invert the hab sequence from 1984 to 2019 the results show that large scale habs were detected in both lakes on or close to the same days in 1984 1999 and 2013 from a long term perspective the hab events of hulun lake are more serious and intractable than those of buir lake in terms of outbreak frequency duration and scale furthermore the effects of meteorological and hydrological conditions were evaluated quantitatively in situ sampling of the two lakes highlights the limiting effect of nutrients on the algae flooding in buir lake with perennial outflow in contrast hulun lake turned into an internal flow lake without outlets from 2000 to 2012 and the decreasing water volume stimulated the accumulation of total nitrogen tn and phosphorus tp with averages of 2 36 and 0 21 mg l respectively analysis of the comprehensive driving factors demonstrates that the level of exogenous nutrients caused a difference in the severity of the hab event between the sister lakes which are largely determined by drought and eco unfriendly anthropogenic activities our work emphasizes the pivotal role of substantial increases of nutrient loads and stricter regulations are necessary to curb further deterioration of this situation keywords hulun lake buir lake multi source remote sensing harmful algal blooms habs drought anthropogenic activities 1 introduction droughts caused by global warming and anthropogenic pollution are universally known to be responsible for the destruction of the world s precious freshwater resources davidson et al 2016 as the specific manifestation of eutrophication outbreaks of harmful algal bloom hab events are detrimental to regional developments such as irrigation and aquaculture fishery and even tourism ho et al 2019 paerl et al 2016 in addition potentially lethal toxins in certain plankton algae such as microcystis and anabaena may cause substantial damage to the liver or nervous system of animals and even humans through direct drinking or food chain intake posing a severe threat to the natural ecosystem and public health tan et al 2017 therefore to understand the complicated factors responsible for the dynamic expansion of algae communities has become a significant global concern due to the variability and complexity of their formation mechanism the real time monitoring of complete hab events from the sudden emergence to the outbreak to the final extinction is difficult to achieve cannizzaro and carder 2006 shen et al 2019 field based monitoring methods can provide specific phytoplankton information e g genus or species category cell density but they are often time consuming laborious and unsuitable for macro scale recording of large scale hab events rantajarvi et al 1998 in contrast modern remote sensing technologies are an attractive alternative owing to the advantages of wide range high timeliness and low cost collecting remotely sensed images of habs every day or even every hour hu 2009 huang et al 2015 yip et al 2015 remote sensing algorithms for monitoring habs have made great achievements based on continuous data from both optical and microwave based techniques ha et al 2017 smith et al 2018 tan et al 2017 although synthetic aperture radar sar belonging to the latter group is characterized by superior high resolution all day operation and not being affected by bad weather in the study of wu et al 2018 hab monitoring based on sentinel 1c band sar data is only qualitative multispectral images are rich in band color information and the reflectivity between features in the same spectral band is different which facilitates the inversion of chlorophyll a chla concentrations to evaluate algae biomass matthews et al 2010 shi et al 2019 therefore the mainstream algorithms are based on numerous optical sensors that provide a wide range of data for target recognition including the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis medium resolution imaging spectrometer meris sea viewing wide field sensor seawifs and sentinel 3 ocean and land colour instrument olci landsat series karki et al 2018 malahlela et al 2018 moses et al 2009 shanmugam et al 2008 smith et al 2018 based on the spectral absorption characteristics of the phytoplankton community two different absorption peaks can be identified at the blue near 440 nm and red near 670 nm wavelengths suslin churilova 2016 xue et al 2017 the blue peak is the result of the strong reflectivity in the blue of the cyanobacterial pigments while the narrower red peak is caused by the selective absorption of chla lorenzoni et al 2015 zhang et al 2009 a less obvious peak at 620 nm is also present and is due to the absorption of phycocyanin pc following over 30 years of development and innovation based on the above spectral characteristics hab remote sensing can be divided into chla based and pc based duan et al 2012 sojawoźniak et al 2017 in chla based hab remote sensing the empirical spectral band ratio method is the most popular and widely used in the detection of bloom distribution changes in various large inland lakes odermatt et al 2012 universal research utilize in situ data to fit and predict chla based on the reflectance near its absorption peak in the red and near infrared nir spectral regions and several band ratio indices have been developed including the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi enhanced vegetation index evi normalized difference chlorophyll a index ndci and floating algae index fai hu 2009 shi wang 2009 zhang et al 2014 in addition semi empirical methods are proposed to combine the former and select the appropriate research band by following certain physical or optical characteristics of the algae pigments gons et al 2008 the pc based approach for hab recognition is challenging because of the special and inconspicuous nature of the absorption peak near 620 nm the pc concentration can be estimated by analyzing the shape of the spectral reflectance r rs s r 1 characteristic curve and regressing the correlation between the reflectance ratio and the pc absorption measured in situ li et al 2012 single band and band ratio indices such as r rs 595 r rs 660 and r r s 625 r r s 650 have been shown to be successful in pc based inversion algorithms ogashawara et al 2013 however the accuracy of the inversion results is greatly affected by a high absorption of chla total suspended matter tsm and colored dissolved organic matter cdom in certain study areas resulting in a reduced applicability and limitations of the approach for specific waters to make up for these shortcomings a semi empirical algorithm named pc index pci was proposed by qi et al 2014 that proved to be highly applicable in studies between lake taihu and lake dianchi with different local bio optical conditions over the past 50 years extensive research has been carried out on inland lakes in southern china in low latitude humid climates to explore the driving factors of natural conditions such as climate precipitation topography soil and anthropogenic activities on the stability of aquatic ecosystems cao et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 zhao fu 2019 however with increasing eutrophication and aggravated droughts lakes in northeastern china are also facing ecological imbalance cai et al 2016 since 2000 hulun lake has experienced water area shrinkage water level decline and has been highly trophic for a historically long period liang et al 2016 yuan et al 2019 meanwhile few studies have been carried out on buir lake a sister lake in the same water system as hulun lake to figure out how it is affected by an increased nutrient load in this study we conducted a series of experiments using multi source data on this semi arid lake group the study area is sparsely populated which is essential to determine the internal factors leading to frequent large scale hab events in hulun lake and provide inspiration for scientific control measures the objective of this study is to investigate the temporal and spatial variability of habs and the corresponding determinatefactors in the sister lakes hulun lake and buir lake this paper is organized as follows 1 inversion of the hab distribution sequence from 1984 to 2019 using multi source satellite data e g landsat series sentinel 2 2 discussion of the driving effects of meteorological conditions temperature wind speed air pressure sunshine hours and water level changes on hab events and 3 comprehensive consideration of the aquatic environment in the hulun basin as well as further studies of related cases of anthropogenic industrial development 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area hulun lake located in hulunbuir city in the northeast of china s inner mongolia autonomous region between the city of xin barag right banner and manzhouli 117 00 10 to 117 41 40 e 48 30 40 to 49 20 40 n is the fifth largest lake in china fig 1 a its shape is an irregular oblique rectangle with a long axis from southwest to northeast an average water depth of 5 75 m a water storage capacity of 13 85 billion m3 and a lake area of 2 339 km2 li et al 2013 zheng et al 2016 besides direct precipitation its water mainly originates from groundwater recharge and surface runoff the water supplying rivers include the krerlen river in the southwest and the orxon river in the east the xinkai river in the northeastern part has been cut off since 1998 liang et al 2017 turning hulun lake into a closed lake without outlets in addition to solve the problem of the decreased water level of hulun lake in recent years the local government redirected part of a river into the lake by building a diversion ditch from the hailar river that can supply up 0 75 billion m3 of water every year unfortunately although this has helped alleviate the drop of water level water pollution has not been markedly improved known as the sister lake and located about 80 km southeast of hulun lake buir lake covers an area of about 600 km2 with an average depth of 8 m and water storage capacity of 5 5 billion m3 buir lake is mainly fed water by the halaha river in the southeast the vast majority of buir lake is in mongolia with only 40 26 km2 of the lake surface in the northwest belonging to china hulun lake and buir lake are part of the same river system and are connected by the orxon river considering the similar geographic location and terrain conditions the freezing period of the two lakes probably occurs between early november of the current year to mid may of the following year both lakes play a significant role in protecting the regional ecological environment and are important to maintain the biodiversity and enriching the animal and plant resources of the hulunbuir grassland liu et al 2014 2 2 experimental data 2 2 1 multispectral data to expand the spatiotemporal analysis field of hab monitoring two different series of optical satellites were selected

plus etm and operational land imager oli zhang et al 2017 mss sensor data was collected by five satellites landsat 1 5 due to excessive cloud cover and image quality limitations landsat 1 2 3 mss data was discarded for this study the level 1 landsat data with cloud covers of less than 30 are all available on the united states geological survey usgs global visualization viewer https www usgs gov and the fmask algorithm was used for cloud masking qiu et al 2019 specific parameters for the experimental data used in this study are presented in table 1 the sentinel 2 mission is the first mission developed by the european space agency esa for the copernicus programme that launched twin satellites sentinel 2a and sentinel 2b equipped with multispectral instrument msi sensors due to the 5 day

contain 254 tracks in which all elevation data is stored according to geographic location among them track 27 passes through the edge of hulun lake and track 36 traverses the center of the lake

distance of the altimeter co r err is the correction of the measurement error and h geo is the height based on the geodetic datum relative to the reference ellipsoid li et al 2019 provide further details and discussion on the related parameters 2 2 4 luminous remote sensing data the visible infrared imaging radiometer suite viirs is one of the key instruments onboard the suomi national polar orbiting partnership suomi npp spacecraft which was successfully launched on october 28 2011 it has 16 medium resolution bands m bands each with 16 detectors with a spatial resolution of 750 m five

bureau http tjj hlbe gov cn and covers the development of industry agriculture animal husbandry tourism and specific sources of external nutrient input 2 3 field observations in situ hulun lake water quality data collected from august 2006 to august 2015 can be found in liang et al 2016 and contains the average concentrations of chla tn and tp to ensure randomness in sampling and considering the water supplied by the river a total of 11 sampling points was selected in the estuaries and the center of hulun lake correspondingly two sampling points were selected within the chinese territory of buir lake and one at the estuary of the halaha river the only water supplying river of buir lake daily sampling of chla tn and tp was conducted in the summer of 2016 16 24 july and 2017 8 15 august and the data were used to characterize the water properties of the two lakes each sampling point is accompanied by precise gps position data fig 1b all water samples were collected at approximately 0 25 m below the water surface filtered using whatman gf f filters and stored in a refrigerator until laboratory analysis the concentration of in situ chla was obtained by spectrophotometry using acetone as the extraction solvent siswanto et al 2013 according to chinese national standards hj 636 2012 and gb 11893 1989 tn was determined by performing alkaline potassium persulfate digestion uv spectrophotometry and tp was measured by ammonium molybdate spectrophotometry after acid digestion baird et al 2017 wang et al 2009 xu et al 2019 2 4 image pre processing for landsat series and sentinel 2 data the digital number dn was calibrated to the top of atmosphere toa reflectance ρ as follows 2 ρ π d 2 l esun cos θ s where d represents the earth sun distance θ s is the solar azimuth angle esun is the mean solar exoatmospheric spectral irradiance which is derived by applying sensor specific relative spectral response rsr functions to the thuillier solar spectrum and l is derived from the calibrated dns by using the parameters included in the metadata after the radiometric calibration for the landsat series data two band kaufman tanre model was selected for aerosol inversion in the atmospheric correction operation frantz et al 2016 the above preprocessing process was performed using the envi 5 3 software for sentinel 2 using the sen2cor official preprocessing plug in ansper and alikas 2018 9 band l2a data with a resolution of 20 m was generated the time period of which covered august 2015 to august 2019 as for the polarized sar polsar data the pre processing of gf 3 qpsi mode products included radiometric calibration complex data conversion multi look processing with a parameter of 3 3 refined lee filtering and geocoding the rtc level 1 5 product of alos palsar required none of the above steps the main part of this paper is shown in fig 2 2 5 algorithm for hab hierarchical extraction compared with the traditional single band threshold and two band ratio water indices carvalho et al 2010 gower 1994 the fai proposed by hu 2009 is less sensitive to environmental changes and thus has very stable extraction results with the further addition of a short wave infrared swir band it can also correct the complex atmosphere and eliminate a number of adverse effects of the atmospheric and thin clouds shi et al 2019 so far the fai has been an effective method for hab monitoring oyama et al 2015 and is defined by the following equation 3 fai r rc n i r r rc n i r r rc n i r r rc r e d r rc s w i r r rc r e d λ nir λ red λ swir λ red where r rc r e d r rc n i r r rc r e d are the surface reflectance of the red nir and swir bands respectively r rc n i r represents the reflectance linearly interpolated based on the red and swir bands and λ red λ nir λ swir are the central wavelengths of the corresponding bands respectively fang et al 2018a simplified the fai proposing a variation in their study on hulun lake the so called adjusted fai afai which is defined by equation 4 4 afai r rc n i r r rc r e d r rc s w i r r rc r e d orde r nir o r d e r red orde r swir o r d e r red where order represents the serial number of the corresponding band for different sensors table 2 the main reason for the simplification of the formula is that the spectra of the blooms have a similar waveform therefore although the center wavelengths of different data sources in the red nir and swir bands are different as long as the band range is wide enough the final extraction results will not be affected excessively shi et al 2019 by using a baseline reflectivity structure similar to that of the fai to reduce the difference between the nir and swir bands the afai highlights the characteristics of the reflection peak in the nir band the afai threshold determination for habs was conducted using the following steps first the initial afai threshold for the boundary between water and habs was set to 0 01 secondly the initial hab regions were expanded to reach twice their original size so that the histogram curve of the afai in the expanded area shows two peaks which represent the concentrated area of clear water pixels and habs pixels respectively finally starting from the minimum afai value the sum of the left and right standard deviations of the value were calculated the value corresponding to the minimum value of this sum is the optimal threshold fang et al 2018b after a series of tests it was found that the range of 0 02 to 0 03 is relatively stable in order to eliminate the atmospheric impact of a few images as much as possible which is necessary for a more precise segmentation of habs the initial threshold needs to be adjusted separately by visual interpretation shi et al 2019 regarding the threshold problem of concentration grading since the afai value does not truly reflect the concentration of chla fang et al 2018b we simplified it by performing hab classification algorithm based on experience value li et al 2011 zhang et al 2016b according to the hab characteristic of a considerable dynamic range of the reflectivity in the nir and green bands the average reflectivity of the pixels are calculated based on the pixel statistics window which are then divided into each level using the experience value by comparing the pixel values of landsat 8 oli and sentinel 2 afai images collected on the same day august 24 2019 we also developed a set of equivalent afai division standards for hab map extraction based on sentinel 2 data 2 6 water level prediction previous studies have shown that the rise of water level can reduce the algae biomass either directly by a dilution effect or indirectly by changing the limnological conditions of the aquatic environment with complicated mechanisms braga becker 2020 ji et al 2017 yang et al 2016 since the temporal resolution of the jason series satellites is 10 days and they only provide water level data until 2017 to obtain as much water level data as possible during the transit of the multispectral satellite and build a set of models predicting the water level through water surface area to weigh the impact of the water level of hulun lake on frequent habs we perform simple linear regression polynomial regression and tree regression based on existing data to obtain the optimal regression model the water area was calculated using the modified normalized difference water index mndwi water mask du et al 2016 which is defined by the following formula 5 mndwi r rc g r e e n r rc s w i r r rc g r e e n r rc s w i r where r rc g r e e n and r rc s w i r represent the toa reflectance of the green and swir bands respectively polynomial regression and tree regression were conducted to compare the model s performance li et al 2016 mutanga et al 2012 prasad et al 2006 due to the small amount of data for the water area and water level the data sets were divided into a training set and a test set at the 7 3 ratio commonly used in machine learning algorithms the accuracy evaluation indicators are represented by r2 and rmse as expressed by eqs 6 and 7 respectively 6 r 2 i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n x i x 2 1 i 1 n x i x i 2 i 1 n x i x 2 7 rmse 1 n i 1 n x i x i 2 where x i is the measured data x i represents the data obtained from the regression models and x is the mean of the x set 2 7 human settlement extraction the variation of the area and spatial distribution of surrounding human settlements can indirectly reflect the impact of urbanization on the ecological stability of lakes with regard to the identification of human settlements the high resolution polsar system combines different polarizations in its images to achieve a more comprehensive detection of features which can be applied in the classification target recognition and ground parameter inversion de et al 2018 zhang et al 2016a the most popular polsar scattering power decomposition schemes are derived from the initial study of freeman and durden and the yamaguchi four component method freeman and durden 1998 sato et al 2012 the freeman durden decomposition yields three scattering components surface double bounce and volume scattering an important assumption of the theory that the target has reflective symmetry increases the ratio of the cross polarized hv component in polsar observations causing oblique buildings or other man made structures to be easily confused with vegetation due to volume scattering mainly influenced by the hv component to reduce the proportion of volume scattering and the adverse effects caused by the large hv component in processing yamaguchi et al 2005 introduced helical scattering as the fourth component and the coherency matrix decomposition can be expressed as equation 8 8 t f s t s f d t d f v t v f c t c where f s f d f v and f c represent the coefficients of the corresponding physical scatterings t surface t double t volume and t helix are the expansion matrices considering the need to balance the hv channel power the power formulas of the four components are expressed by eqs 9 12 9 p c f c 2 im s hv s hh s vv 10 p v f v 4 t 33 2 p c 8 s hv 2 2 p c 11 p s f s 1 β 2 12 p d f d 1 α 2 where s hh s hv and s vv represent elements of the scattering matrix and s hv is the conjugation of s hv t 33 is an element of the corresponding coherency matrix which contributes significantly to p v α and β are unknowns to be calculated later sato et al 2012 rotated the coherency matrix by an angle to reduce the correlation of each component in relative azimuth as in eq 13 13 t θ t 11 θ t 12 θ t 13 θ t 21 θ t 22 θ t 23 θ t 31 θ t 32 θ t 33 θ r p θ t r p θ where means complex conjugation and transposition and r p θ is the rotation matrix represented in eq 14 14 r p θ 1 0 0 0 cos 2 θ sin 2 θ 0 sin 2 θ cos 2 θ then various branching conditions are set up to distinguish the scattering mechanism and the final decomposition framework can be expressed by equation 15 15 t f s t s f d t d f c t c f v t v dipole for c 1 0 f vd t v dihedral for c 1 0 where c 1 2 re f s β f d α t 11 t 12 1 2 f c t 11 and t 12 are elements of the rotation coherency matrix f s f d f c f v and f vd represent the coefficients t v dipole and t v dihedral represent the volume scattering matrix under the conditions of average distribution of dipole and directional dihedral target respectively in the experiments a total of 11 regions with available palsar and gf 3 data were selected for area change analysis through the npp viirs data the first six regions were chosen to perform the accuracy assessment based on high resolution google images as ground truth zhou et al 2017 evaluation indices are divided into overall accuracy oa commission error ce and omission error oe 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal change of habs in total 430 scenes of landsat images and 98 scenes of sentinel 2 images were downloaded separately to invert the dynamic changes of habs from 1984 to 2019 after processing and statistical analysis of the afai data 61 scenes with habs were detected afai grading maps with hab areas of over 100 km2 are summarized in fig 3 and show that the spatial distribution pattern of the hab occurrences is relatively random which may be closely related to both wind speed and direction at the time the satellite transited jing et al 2019 meanwhile the hab area has fluctuated significantly with the relative change rate between adjacent area values ranging from 97 93 to 2457 29 fig 4 in addition from july 15 to july 16 1999 the area decreased by 317 27 km2 with the relative change rate of 79 69 in just one day which further confirms that there is a certain contingency and variability in the occurrence of habs some periods of severe hab events in hulun lake can be identified the first peak is observed for the mid 1980 s during three consecutive years from 1984 to 1986 a large scale hab event broke out from the end of july to the beginning of august in this period the hab area reached a historical peak of 911 81 km2 on august 4 1986 the second largest outbreak occurred in the late 1990 s with an area of 458 27 km2 however during the next decade the water level continued to decline and hulun lake experienced hab events for 6 years that were characterized by a small area and low afai value the most recent period of continuous outbreaks started in 2013 when the water level began to rise again the introduction of sentinel 2 images after 2015 has exposed the frequency and persistence of hab events the outbreaks of almost every midsummer show a sparse distribution but long duration due to the limitations posed by the temporal resolution of the source data and cloud covers due to colder weather conditions no such phenomenon was observed in related years including 1987 1988 2001 2005 in general late july and early august are the time periods with peaks of disruptive hab events however in recent years the events have continued until mid september which corresponds to increased climate effects and worsened water quality conditions compared with hulun lake hab events in buir lake are shown to be rare by the multi source remote sensing hab monitoring carried out in this study a total of 413 available landsat series and 96 sentinel 2 images were evaluated but only 9 images with hab were found fig 5 accounting for only 1 76 of the total number of images at the time of the hab events the conditions of the two lakes are very similar and 1984 1999 and 2013 are also the time periods with large scale hab events in buir lake this suggests that in these years the conditions favorable for algae flooding were met including increased temperatures reduced precipitation and nutrient inflow into lakes the freezing periods of hulun lake and buir lake occur between early november of the current year to mid may of the following year during this time the extremely low temperatures greatly inhibits the photosynthesis and expansion of cyanobacteria previous studies have shown that the composition of planktonic algae of hulun lake during the freezing period is made up predominantly of harmless green algae 52 5 followed by diatom algae 29 8 while cyanobacteria the most important hab forming algae account for only 10 5 wang et al 2019 this failure of cyanobacteria to become the dominant community at low temperatures is the reason that hab events in hulun lake and buir lake are not as persistent and seasonal as those in lakes of southern china such as taihu lake and chaohu lake and due to the different geographical conditions at middle and high latitudes 3 2 variations in driving factors 3 2 1 meteorological conditions to further explore the important role played by meteorological conditions in a specific hab event the hab area monitored by remote sensing and the meteorological conditions on the day of satellite transit were analyzed using correlation analysis under the assumption that the hab area represents the volume of the algae biomass zhang et al 2019a four common meteorological indicators namely daily average temperature wind speed air pressure and maximum sunshine hours were correlated with the detected area since the relevant meteorological data is only available until 2018 56 sample points corresponding to satellite data were evaluated as shown in fig 6 a highly significant positive correlation was observed between hab area and temperature which demonstrates that the multiplication and expansion of dominant algae is closely related to the local temperature since water temperatures of 25 to 30 are suitable for the germination of algae cysts microcystis and other algae groups can quickly gain a competitive advantage in this temperature range accelerating the production of photosynthetic pigments to reach community expansion the rapid increase in temperature is an important determinate factor for the occurrence of large scale hab outbreaks ndong et al 2014 in terms of wind speed the statistical analysis shows a relatively small negative correlation but no obvious relationship with the local average daily pressure could be determined p greater than 0 05 studies have shown that the stability of water bodies is one of the necessary conditions for the formation of habs gentle wind and waves promote the algal expansion while wind speeds greater than 3 m s can submerge surface blooms ma et al 2013 as for the temperature there is a positive correlation between the maximum sunshine hours and hab area in addition we conducted multiple linear regression to comprehensively consider the driving effects of meteorological factors on hab the results show that the above factors explain 51 9 r² 0 519 p 0 000 n 56 of the hab area again confirming the leading role of meteorological conditions in hab events evaluating the effect of precipitation on the hab events in hulun lake however may prove difficult because precipitation can not only reverse the recharge relationship between rivers and lakes by changing the water volume supplied by the river but also increase the impact of surface runoff on exogenous nutrient input eventually causing a dual relationship with the hab event therefore in order to measure the effect of precipitation conditions laterally we retrieved the data of annual water level changes of hulun lake and of the runoff of the water supplying river 3 2 2 water surface area and water level water surface area and water level reflect changes in the water volume and are important indicators for the comprehensive consideration of various driving factors of habs in semi arid areas the performance of different water level prediction regression models is shown in fig 7 a given the small number of data samples the test set performance of the models after the 2 degree polynomial model tends to deteriorate it indicated that based on the performance of each model on the training set and test set the 2 degree polynomial model can achieve the optimal results in the description of the relationship between water level and water surface area for hulun lake without overfitting the r2 and rmse of which reached 0 989 and 0 025 for the test set respectively in addition the water level of training samples and test samples were respectively predicted based on the 2 degree polynomial model and the linear regression model of predicted water level and measured water level is shown in fig 7b the two straight lines almost overlap which once again verifies the superiority of the 2 degree polynomial model regression therefore it was chosen to predict the water level elevation using the existing water surface area fig 7c it can be seen that the average water level of hulun lake during the flood season shows a sharp downward trend from 1999 to 2012 after that it rose rapidly from 1984 to 2019 the surface area obtained from the water mask fluctuated between 1758 51 km2 to 2105 42 km2 in contrast buir lake the throughput lake between the orxon and the halaha river was characterized by extremely low surface area fluctuation from 1984 to 2019 ranging between 604 21 km2 and 611 12 km2 which corresponds to approximately one third of the hulun lake area based on the prediction of the water level at the occurrence of the hab event by the 2 degree polynomial model the correlation diagram between the water level and the hab area can be finally obtained as shown in fig 7d significantly negative correlation was found between the two indicators for hulun lake r² 0 39 p 0 002 n 61 3 2 3 nutrient concentration and chla the average nutrient and chla concentrations of hulun lake of recent years are shown in fig 8 and show an overall upward trend for both tn and tp concentrations from 2006 to 2011 in 2012 the average concentration of both decreased significantly with the relative change rate of 40 12 and 48 41 respectively which may be related to the slowing of the drought effect in 2012 and the beginning of the rising water level following this significant drop the concentrations began to stabilize liang et al 2016 with the average tn and tp concentrations of 2 36 mg l and 0 21 mg l respectively however these concentrations far exceed the lake eutrophication assessment standard threshold values of tn 0 20 mg l and tp 0 02 mg l ji et al 2014 this also indicates that the average concentration of tn and tp in hulun lake in the past ten years has reached more than 10 times the corresponding requirements of eutrophic lakes the corresponding tn tp ratio was high and stable except in 2007 and 2008 as for chla the direct indicator to measure habs it decreased at first and then increased reaching its peak in recent years during the analyzed time period all of the above indicators exceeded even the corresponding values of lakes in southern china such as taihu lake lü et al 2017 indicating that almost annual large scale hab outbreaks in hulun lake occur with sufficient nutrients available thus contributing to the continuing deterioration of the situation in addition our results show that the corresponding concentrations in buir lake are much lower with the range of chla tn and tp being 3 12 4 03 mg m3 0 46 0 79 mg l and 0 019 0 057 mg l respectively this is consistent with the absence of large scale hab events in buir lake since 2013 with the low concentrations of exogenous nutrients most likely limiting hab growth in order to constrain the source of the high nutrient concentrations in hulun lake the water from the inlets of the two water supplying rivers was sampled the trends of tn and tp over time shown in fig 9 indicate that the nutrient concentrations in the two estuaries are very similar and vary significantly resulting in an unstable lake environment the tn concentrations range between 1 81 3 03 mg l the tp concentrations between 0 09 0 54 mg l and they both reached their local minimum in 2012 in addition the increase in river runoff into the lake since 2012 further promoted the accumulation of nutrients 3 3 spatial distribution and area of human settlements as is shown in fig 1a the human settlements in hulun basin are mainly concentrated along the hailar river in the north of hulun lake and around the kherlen river in the southwest the extraction result of the human settlements is shown in fig 10 a and the accuracy assessment for human settlement extraction shows the oa of the gf 3 data generally higher than that of palsar table 3 moreover the roads were wrongly recognized as towns for regions c d e and f resulting in a generally high ce and thus a reduced oa further mountain shadows were misclassified in regions b and d causing the ce value to be higher than 15 in contrast the most accurate results were obtained for region a where the above problems were avoided with an oa of 91 62 and 95 32 for palsar and gf 3 data respectively overall the extraction algorithm can identify the scattering characteristics of human settlement regions as much as achievable the distribution of human settlements is denser after 10 years of regional urbanization showing an expansion trend of the surrounding areas fig 10 the relative change rate of the area of the selected regions ranges from 13 69 to 204 88 among them hulunbuir in the lower reaches of the hailar river has experienced the most significant changes from 25 61 km2 to 78 08 km2 combined with the long term hab frequency map shown in fig 11 for analysis the high frequency outbreak areas are mainly concentrated on the northeastern edge of hulun lake and the southwest part of the lake while hab events are less frequent in the east and southeast for the former there are densely distributed urban areas near the northeast edge such as manzhouli dalai nur district with relative change rate of 149 31 and 51 16 respectively the latter is close to the estuaries of kherlen river which flows through xin barag right banner with an area growth rate of 13 69 it indicated that from a long term perspective the distribution and expansion of human settlements have a potential positive impact on the spatial distribution of habs in hulun basin 4 discussions the size of the lake determines to a certain extent the self purification ability and stability of the lake ecosystem kane et al 2009 mooij et al 2010 xu et al 2005 over the past 20 years the sister lakes analyzed in this study exhibitedcertaindifferences in water quality hulun lake is lightly to moderately eutrophic in summer and lightly eutrophic in autumn and winter chuai et al 2012 jiang et al 2011 which poses a serious threat to the water security of the hulunbuir area however while mainstream optical remote sensing has not detected large scale hab events in buir lake since 2014 the nutrient concentration which is much lower than that of hulun lake still reached the threshold of lake eutrophication therefore this paper aims to highlight the similarities and differences in terms of meteorological and hydrological conditions and anthropogenic activities to further explore why the water quality problem of hulun lake has remained unsolved for such a long period of time 4 1 strengths and weaknesses of hab remote sensing in the hab remote sensing it is not easy work to realize real time monitoring of habs from the beginning of eutrophication of the water body to the rapid reproduction and expansion of cyanobacteria as the dominant species and eventually to the gradual extinction shen et al 2019 the rapid dynamics in the temporal and spatial distribution of habs also make it difficult to achieve accurate correspondence between transit satellite images and real time sampling for example on july 24 2015 severe outbreaks of habs were observed in the southwest of hulun lake 116 58 31 2 e 48 50 31 8 n and water samples were collected at various points in the sampling experiments fig 12 a b the field measurement was also carried out at the sampling points of buir lake and no obvious habs were observed visually however on july 28 when landsat 8 transited and captured images the habs monitored by the satellite mainly gathered in the north of hulun lake fig 3 a similar situation occurred at the end of july 2016 due to the fluidity of water the spatial and concentration distribution of algae in the lake change significantly with the wind direction and wind speed in addition there is also a huge difference between the spatial resolution of remote sensing image acquisition and the spatial scale of sampling which ultimately lead to a large difference between the location of hab events monitored by the satellite and the field sampling results near the satellite transit date this also shows a major challenge in the study of hab remote sensing large scale remote sensing interpretation and accurate field measurement have their own characteristics the two are complementary and cannot be replaced by each other based on the classic fai method the afai formula for band index is simplified and it can also correct the complex atmosphere and eliminate some adverse effects of the atmospheric and thin clouds a series of experiments by fang et al 2018a highlighted the effectiveness and reliability of afai and developed a set of threshold determination programs through the large scale remote sensing method in time and space the study for the dynamic changes of hab in long time series has been conducted and some findings can be observed in the rapidly changing hab phenomenon the hab events in hulun lake had not been significantly improved in the last 36 years but its scope and harmfulness has become more extensive in the context of climate warming 4 2 comparison of meteorological and hydrological conditions between sister lakes the annual meteorological data from 2005 to 2018 were collected by nearby weather stations fig 13 the average annual temperature trends of hulun lake and buir lake are similar with freezing periods between 170 and 180 days although the altitudes of the two lakes are approximately 642 m and 554 2 m respectively the temperature variations over the years are only up to 1 c the warmer climate of hulun lake is more suitable for the mass reproduction of algae the average precipitation gap between the two lakes for this time period derived from gpcc data is only 36 08 mm from 2005 to 2012 the average annual precipitation of hulun lake was less than 200 mm and continuous low runoff from the kherlen river and the orxon river contributed to the rapid shrinkage of the lake surface coupled with the impact of the structure of the inner lake liang et al 2016 the nutrients deposited in the lake also increase with the falling water level both lakes reached the average annual precipitation peak in 2013 the excessive precipitation in the face of a low water level promoted surface runoff and water exchange with the supply river which carried excessive nutrients into the two lakes and may have led to the simultaneously occurring large scale hab outbreaks on july 30 2013 fig 3 fig 5 it also shows that the probability of large scale habs in drought years is greatly increased fig 7 fig 13 in terms of the wind speed inhibiting the spatial expansion of habs the average annual wind speed of hulun lake is generally higher than that of buir lake and the gap has increased dramatically in recent years therefore wind speed cannot explain the difference in water quality between the two lakes in addition no significant correlation was found between air pressure and hab area fig 6 indicating that the difference of 10 hpa over the years does not account for the differences in water quality based on the above analysis it can be concluded that the prolonged drought and sudden heavy rainfall indirectly led to a rise of the internal nutrient concentration and the external nutrient input for the two lakes respectively which in turn increased the risk of large scale habs 4 3 analysis of anthropogenic impacts in general habs are characterized using the covered area and algae biomass which are mainly affected by meteorological factors and eutrophication zhang et al 2019a studies have shown extensive human activities can adversely affect the stability and balance of the aquatic ecosystems chislock et al 2019 chuai et al 2012 since a distinct contrast between the nighttime lights around hulun lake and buir lake was identified fig 1 it is necessary to evaluate the environmental impacts of anthropogenic activities on frequent habs using economic data table 4 the gross domestic product gdp growth rate of hulunbuir calculated by the expenditure approach has been slowing down from 2005 to 2018 the industrial production follows a similar trend after fluctuating during the first six years the gdp growth rate steadily declined until finally registering the first negative growth of 1 40 in 2017 which may result from economic transformation operations for the regulation and suppression of large polluting enterprises including fur processing plants and nitrate mining in the upper reaches of the kherlen river in addition smelters coal mining companies and cement plants are concentrated in the hailar district and heavy chemical industry bases tanneries and paper mills are located along the northeast of hulun lake table 5 the detailed data show that these heavily polluting industries grew rapidly until the government started to gradually reduce their proportion in 2015 as a result vast amount of industrial wastewater accumulated over the years and was discharged into the corresponding rivers as surface runoff thus inevitably reaching hulun lake which may explain the high frequency regional distribution characteristics of hab occurrence fig 11 meanwhile excessive grazing caused a degradation of the pastures that led to severe soil erosion in summers withabundant precipitation chen et al 2012 and is likely responsible for the first large scale hab events from 1984 to 1986 fig 3 fig 5 after the chinese government implemented the household responsibility system in 1983 an agriculture production system that allowed households to contract land machinery and other facilities from collective organizations herdsmen with a single production mode contracted the grassland around hulun lake and buir lake this resulted in a significant increase in livestock breeding and thus increased animal waste in the sister lakes fig 12c it directly led to the sharp increase of tn and tp in the aquatic ecosystem providing rich nutrient conditions for the occurrence of habs the application of chemical fertilizers in farmland along the two water supplying rivers had similar consequences unlike the variable changes in industrial output agriculture and animal husbandry have maintained relatively slight growth with an output value in 2018 three times that of 2005 the implementation of large scale farming operations has almost halved the number of livestock however animal husbandry has maintained a steady growth rate in most years generally speaking because animal husbandry is a traditional industry in hulunbuir the impact of irregular grazing behavior cannot be underestimated and is the primary factor leading to lake eutrophication the results listed in table 4 highlight the rapid development of tourism the second peak period of the hab sequence in 1999 may have been caused by the combination of a vigorously developed tourism industry after the expansion of the hulun lake nature reserve in 1996 and the closure of the xinkai river in 1998 when hulun lake became a closed lake the hulun lake tourist resort in the northeast and the gold coast tourist attractions in the southwest attract nearly 10 million visitors every year which drives the surrounding catering and service industry fig 12d tourism revenues have grown dramatically with a relative change rate of 18 31 and a share in total gdp of 54 69 in 2018 far exceeding both industrial enterprises and agriculture and animal husbandry mentioned above the local economy is clearly increasingly dependent on the income of tourism related industries however catering waste water food waste and uncivilized behavior of tourists also seriously burden the ecological balance of hulun lake the tourist attractions are located very close to areas with high incidence of habs which also indicates the important driving effect of tourism pollution 4 4 implication for enhanced lake ecological supervision based on the above economic data and the hab sequence from 1984 to 2019 we conclude that the deterioration of the water quality in hulun lake and buir lake is not only related to drought and less precipitation in general but also to the intensified human activity and relevant government policies since the 1980s the rapid increase of extensive animal husbandry has led to a higher nutrient base level in both lakes high economic returns were achieved by extensive production at the cost of the natural environment to restore the balance of trace elements simply by the annual water exchange of the lakes with the water supplying rivers and the evaporation of rainfall is difficult besides the tourism industry was strongly encouraged after 1996 and a number of grasslands were restored to protect tourism the local government implemented a series of governance policies and invested billions of yuan into improvement of the lake ecology after 2015 however the high concentration of nutrients in hulun lake that accumulated over the years has made these efforts a mere drop in the bucket and the corresponding beneficial effects have been greatly reduced the reason buir lake was able to maintain a relatively good water quality in recent years is that the random grazing by the lake was brought under control and the areas surrounding buir lake and upstream of halaha river are sparsely populated hence the impact of anthropicfactors such as overexploitation on buir lake is low which further confirms the necessity of enhanced ecological supervision the reduction of nutrient input through ecological management of the kherlen and orxon rivers is the most scientific and feasible method to reduce the frequency of habs in hulun lake paerl otten 2013 purifying the wastewater at sewage outlets can very effectively reduce water pollution furthermore strengthening controls on livestock grazing and metabolite emissions is also essential for the ecological restoration of the hulunbuir grassland in addition stricter enforcement of regulations should also be considered for curbing environmental damage in nature reserves huo et al 2019 5 conclusions hab outbreaks are a global problem and have caused economic losses on the order of billions of dollars furthermore they pose a huge challenge to the self purification capacity of freshwater ecosystems in addition to simplifying the traditional spectral index extraction of hab maps we conducted a series of experiments in a pair of sister lakes to constrain the driving factors of hab outbreaks our results show that drought and unreasonable anthropogenic activities have caused a continuous accumulation of tn and tp in hulun lake with average concentrations of 2 34 and 0 19 mg l respectively that resulted in ungovernable water pollution for the last 36 years the cause of the shrinkage of the semi arid hulun lake and its impact on the water quality were analyzed furthermore the deeper influence of human activities was also investigated in detail from 2007 to 2018 the human settlements in the hulunbuir grassland have grown as much as 3 fold and more frequent economic activity boosted the local gdp from 31 92 billion yuan in 2005 to 125 29 billion in 2018 high pollution industrial production developed animal husbandry and soaring tourism brought extensive economic benefits but also made hulun lake a major sewage accumulation point our results show that a warmer climate less rainfall and excessive anthropogenic development have a significant impact on the lake s ecosystem in contrast to previous studies we provide a new perspective to understand the anthropic factors that contribute to the eutrophication of semi arid lake groups despite insufficient sample numbers for the statistical analysis due to the remoteness of the study area and the multiple factors driving habs we discussed the dynamics of these potential factors and have attempted to constrain the mechanism using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods with the help of field measurements hab frequency map and existing statistical data based on the nighttime light remote sensing data urban extraction can help determine the variation of human settlements with time supplemented by economic statistics and compared with buir lake a semi quantitative analysis of the impact of various industries on the deteriorated water quality in hulun lake was conducted under the general trend of global warming the contribution of meteorological conditions to the reproduction and expansion of habs have become less stringent therefore actively taking appropriate measures to reduce the accumulated nutrients and restore the ecological balance of hulun lake is an urgent issue the local government needs to address credit authorship contribution statement jiaqi

4888,univariate meteorological drought indices are inadequate to represent the complexity of hydrological conditions under the intensification of hydrological cycle due to climate change at catchment scale in this study standardised precipitation actual evapotranspiration index spaei was proposed which can combine both meteorological and hydrological drought characteristics at catchment scale the proposed new drought index considers the hydrologically calibrated aet to account for the water use in addition to meteorological effect the proposed hydrometeorological drought index was potential in identifying meteorological and hydrological drought events accounting for the time lag effects and comparable with global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam remote sensing aet data based drought index the pet based drought index of spei which is based on energy demand has shown intensified drought characteristics compared to spaei which is based on both energy demand and available moisture supply and can be a promising variable in the drought estimation the climate change projections of precipitation and temperatures downscaled using statistical downscaling model based on k means clustering classification and regression trees and support vector regression were used using three general circulation model outputs intensified drought characteristics under climate change has been predicted over krishna river basin india in terms of increase of drought areal extent of about 25 31 with increase of drought frequency as 5 years per 20 years and durations as 4 5 months based on the proposed hydrometeorological drought index of spaei keywords hydrometeorological drought evapotranspiration hydrological modelling climate change spei sri 1 introduction drought is one of the most widespread and slowly developing natural hazard due to the lack of water availability in terms of precipitation and consequent shortage of streamflow and soil moisture affecting socioeconomics aadhar and mishra 2017 aghakouchak et al 2015 dai 2011 it corresponds to the failure of spatial and temporal precipitation meteorological drought inadequate streamflows hydrological drought decrease in soil moisture and crop yields agricultural drought therefore consequent impact on ecosystem and socioeconomic activities of the human being socio economic drought wilhite and glantz 1985 among these the most widely used drought indices at regional scale water resources management are meteorological and hydrological to characterise and compare drought severity frequency and duration marcos garcia et al 2017 a meteorological drought index accounts for the deviation of climatological variables precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet in a given year from the normal conditions e g standardized precipitation index spi by mckee et al 1993 standardized precipitation evapotranspiration spei developed by vicente serrano et al 2010 nevertheless none of these meteorological indices can consider the effect of evapotranspiration flux based on actual water availabilities in the drought estimation furthermore such meteorological droughts are independent of actual water availabilities land use and vegetation in the drought estimation at catchment scale a drought assessment solely based on meteorological aspects without considering deficits in hydrological cycle will not be sufficient for the regional water resources management decision under climate change oloruntade et al 2017 whereas hydrological drought assessment is based on the fall of streamflow and water storages below long term mean levels e g standardized runoff index sri shukla and woods 2008 implementation of such hydrological drought assessments are limited for ungauged basins loon et al 2019 furthermore hydrological drought assessment entirely based on below normal streamflow may mislead due to the human influenced regulated flows due to diversions water transfers and instream abstractions lanen et al 2013 traditionally drought assessment studies were exclusively based on either meteorological or hydrological aspects without considering the combined effect of climatological deviations and acute water shortages at river basin scales to this end drought assessment studies have evolved by integrating various meteorological e g spi and hydrological drought indicators e g sri in a unique manner of aggregation to develop composite drought indices shah and mishra 2020 wang et al 2020 these composite drought indices can combine the individual drought indicators either statistically e g copula based composite drought index shah and mishra 2020 wang et al 2020 or simple weighting entropy weighted drought index waseem et al 2015 however to understand the complexity and time lags yang et al 2017b between meteorological and hydrological drought indices it is very important to structure the drought indices with an integration of most prominent hydro meteorological variables to retain the dependence between these variables given the limitations of meteorological and hydrological drought indices as individual a drought index which will synthesize the hydro meteorological information can be more reliable in the context of operational drought management at river basin scale under climate change a comprehensive hydro meteorological drought index combining major hydrological variables such as precipitation pet aet and runoff r simultaneously to characterise the meteorological and hydrological drought will be more promising for efficient drought management at catchment scale the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei has become popular meteorological drought index due to the inclusion of atmospheric climate demand as the difference p pet between precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration pet vicente serrano et al 2010 even though spei has proven to be more reliable measure than standardized precipitation index spi e g tirivarombo et al 2018 as it includes pet in addition to p it cannot account for the actual water availability of a region moreover p pet is energy based atmospheric water demand and do not account for the effects of regional land surface changes and actual moisture availability which is the difference p aet between p and actual evapotranspiration aet also pet is the maximum possible moisture loss limited only by the energy endowment or it is the energy driven et shelton 2008 whereas aet represents the transfer of moisture from the surface to the atmosphere in response to both the energy demand and available moisture supply and can be a promising variable in the drought estimation liu et al 2017 inclusion of aet in meteorological drought indices such as spei which is a prominent hydrological variable can represent hydro meteorological drought indicator the present study aimed at inclusion of most prominent hydrological variables of p pet aet and r in the drought formulation to develop a hydro meteorological drought indicator which can work accurately to define both meteorological and hydrological aspects together at catchment scale the conventional approaches to estimate aet at river basin scales is based on data intensive macro scale distributed hydrological simulation models and water balance methods expressed as aet p r at annual time scale hamel and guswa 2015 alternatively several parametric models have been developed for estimating aet with operational meteorological variables of precipitation and temperatures as inputs e g zhang et al 2004 such parametric models are based on the assumption that aet is limited by precipitation under very dry conditions and limited by pet under very wet conditions e g budyko 1974 however these parametric models of aet are purely based on region specific climate considering p and pet and limited to represent variability of evapotranspiration under water uses asokan et al 2010 in this context time invariant model parameters were estimated at catchment scale with consideration of closure of water balance by asokan et al 2010 jarsjö et al 2008 however time invariant catchment scale parameters are limited to capture temporal variability of water energy balance variables instead dynamic model parameters accounting for the variations of p pet and r under climate signals with the closure of water balance can be more promising e g rehana et al 2020c application of such hydrological calibration models on the aet estimates can account for the variability of p pet and r at catchment scale inclusion of such hydrological induced aet in the drought estimation can account for the catchment scale hydro meteorological aspects the present study proposed a modelling framework to include hydrologically calibrated aet estimates in the formulation of spei to develop a new hydro meteorological drought monitoring index standardized precipitation actual evapotranspiration index spaei it can be noted that the parametric aet model adopted in the present study is based on budyko formulation which is suitable for long term basin average scale and large catchments gunkel and lange 2017 therefore the study mainly focused on 12 month time scale annual drought characterization to avoid the use of short term soil moisture storages donohue et al 2007 the proposed drought index of spaei consider the joint effect of meteorological and actual water budget and has a potential to evaluate the effects of climate and hydrological changes in order to study the impacts of climate variability on drought characteristics the study adopted statistical downscaling model based projections of precipitation and temperature based on general circulation model gcm outputs the study compared the newly proposed hydro meteorological drought index of spaei with meteorological drought index of spei and hydrological drought index of standardized runoff index sri for current and projected scenarios

considered as meteorological drought index which works based on the climatic water balance the accumulated monthly difference in mm between precipitation and pet as follows 1 d p p e t where p is the monthly precipitation mm and pet is the monthly potential evapotranspiration mm the structure of spei works with three parameter log logistic distribution by fitting the d eq 1 series following to vicente serrano et al 2010 the probability density function pdf f x and cumulative distribution function cdf f x of the three parameter log logistic distribution is given as follows 2 f x β α x γ α β 1 1 x γ α β 2 where α β and γ are the scale shape and origin parameters respectively the parameters of the log logistic distribution are obtained by following the l moment procedure as follows 3 β 2 w 1 w 0 6 w 1 w 0 6 w 2 4 α w 0 2 w 1 β γ 1 1 β γ 1 1 β 5 γ w 0 α γ 1 1 β γ 1 1 β where w 0 w 1 and w 2 are the probability weighted moments calculated based on yue and hashino 2007 as follows 6 w r 1 n n 1 r 1 j 1 n r n 1 r x j r 0 1 2 where n is the sample size and xj is the ordered vector of observations in descending order next the cumulative distribution function of log logistic distribution can be calculated with the estimated parameters of pearson iii distribution 7 f x 1 x γ α β 1 the three parameter log logistic distribution was applied to model the time series of p pet for various time scales furthermore the fitted three parameter log logistic distribution is validated with the kolmogorov smirnov k s chakravarti 1967 goodness of fit test for the climatic water balance time series of

categorization as follows moderate if spei were in between 1 0 to 1 49 severe if spei were in between 1 50 to 1 99 and extreme if spei were less than 2 0 based on vicente serrano et al 2010 2 2 2 development of hydro meteorological drought index standardised precipitation actual evapotranspiration index spaei the proposed hydro meteorological drought index spaei was aimed to integrate most important operational meteorological drought defining variable p hydrological drought defining variable r at catchment scale the most complex hydrological variable which define both meteorological and hydrological drought characteristics at catchment scale in terms of water availability p r and evaporative demand pet is actual evapotranspiration aet the present study aimed to include hydrologically induced aet in the structure of spei to formulate hydro meteorological drought indices as shown in fig 2 the fig 2 shows the overview of the proposed methodology to estimate the hydro meteorological drought index spaei the spaei considered hydrologically induced aet at catchment scale including meteorological variables of precipitation and temperatures along with hydrological variable of runoff fig 2 first the pet was estimated with thornthwaite model thornthwaite 1948 with monthly average air temperature and geographical location of the region of interest as input variables it can be noted that pet can be estimated using any other standard model such as penman monteith model which may require various meteorological variables such as temperature wind speed relative humidity radiation hargreaves and allen 2003 due to the unavailability of observed gridded data sets for the case study the study limited to use thornwaite model for the estimation of pet the next step in the hydro meteorological drought formulation is the estimation of hydrological induced aet as a function of p pet and r one of the classical formulations to estimate aet is budyko model which is a function of p pet and parameter ω which accounts for the non climatic catchment characteristics budyko 1974 eq 10 10 aet p 1 pet p 1 pet p ω 1 ω here one of the widely used non parametric formulation of budyko equation is developed by zhang et al 2004 for the estimation of aet as follows 11 aet climate p 1 e x p p e t p p e t t a n h p pet 0 5 it should be noted that the budyko formulation was developed for large catchments 10000 km2 at long term average scale with stationary hydrological conditions as assumptions with negligible soil water storage changes gunkel and lange 2017 wu et al 2017 yang et al 2007 in order to guarantee the relevance of aet based catchment scale drought index and to avoid the use of short term soil moisture storages the focus of the present study was made at 12 month accumulated annual drought characterization the aet can be estimated with the p and pet estimated at monthly time scale using eq 11 as the workability of aet model applied in the present study which is based on budyko formulation is more towards annual scales the study worked to estimate the 12 month scale drought indices the monthly p and pet are accumulated to 12 month scale as follows 12 p i k i k 1 i p i w h e r e k 12 13 pe t i k i k 1 i p e t i w h e r e k 12 where p i k and pe t i k are the accumulated precipitation and pet in month i the 12 month accumulated p and pet values will be used in eq 11 to estimate the accumulated aet values at 12 month scale by applying accumulated values of p and pet directly in the eq 11 the conditions of p becoming zero for any given month can overcome in the calculation with this the study has focused on annual drought index of 12 month accumulation time period it can be noted that due to seasonality of rainfall short term droughts e g 1 month accumulation can be valuable to evaluate the effect of time lags of precipitation response on hydrological droughts at monthly scale such short term drought duration assessment can be promising for the agricultural water management the aet estimated based on eq 11 is completely based on meteorological forcing and region specific climatic conditions and therefore can be considered as climate induced aet aetclim asokan et al 2010 such climate induced aet with p and pet cannot account for the variability in evapotranspiration flux under water use changes with p pet and r in the drought estimation rehana et al 2020a therefore aetclim has to be hydrologically calibrated to account for the variability of p pet and r at catchment scales which can further serve as input for the hydro meteorological drought index spaeihydro as shown in fig 2 the aet clim i can be evaluated by integrating the basin runoff r to estimate hydrologically induced aet aet hydro for this purpose single model parameter for the entire river basin at annual time scale has been introduced by asokan et al 2010 and jarsjö et al 2008 where the observed r obs o u t l e t and uncalibrated r calculated o u t l e t runoff estimated from the hydrological model at the basin outlet were compared as follows 14 r calculated o u t l e t r obs o u t l e t p aet clim p x cal aet clim 15 x cal r obs o u t l e t r calculated o u t l e t 1 r obs o u t l e t r calculated o u t l e t p aet clim where r obs o u t l e t and r calculated o u t l e t are the long term annual average observed and simulated runoff at the basin outlet in m3 s respectively and p and aet clim are the long term accumulated annual average observed precipitation and aet estimated based on eq 11 over the basin in mm year the simulated runoff r calculated o u t l e t will be calculated by dividing the entire river basin into uniform grids at each grid i the residual available water raw calculated i will be estimated using annual total precipitation p i and climate induced aet aet clim i from eq 11 as follows 16 raw calculated i p i aet clim i the discharge at the basin outlet r calculated o u t l e t was estimated by accumulating the flow at grid cell i raw calculated i and from all upstream grid cells raw cal g according to the flow direction of the river and corresponding to the area of each grid cell a cell as follows 17 r calculated o u t l e t raw calculated i raw calculated g a cell the annual scale basin averaged calibration factors estimated based on eq 15 can be applied on the aet clim eq 11 to study the changes of aet under hydro meteorological or water use over the river basin however such time invariant single basin model parameters may not be valid to study the possible hydro climatic variability under climate change rehana et al 2020c furthermore application of such model parameters developed based on historically observed data may limit to capture the temporal variability of hydro climatic variables under climate signals sireesha naidu et al 2020 given that hydrological variables such as p pet and r have shown pronounced change under climate change due to the intensification of global hydrological cycle therefore model parameters should also account for such changes in this context developing hydrological model parameters which can relate various hydro climatic variables such as p et and observed r can improve the hydrological model performance lópez lópez et al 2017 therefore the study proposed to estimate the dynamic model parameters accounting for the variability of p pet and observed r such developed models can be used further to estimate the model calibration factors for the future scenarios under climate change projections based on statistical downscaling models one of the major challenge in implementing such framework are limited data and poor understanding of complex relation between the model parameters and hydrological variables thus the study adopted machine learning models based on ensemble regression model erm to relate model parameters and p pet and observed r therefore a data driven modelling framework which can relate the model parameter and other hydro climatic variables such as p pet and r can be more appropriate following to the study of rehana et al 2020c the present study also adopted dynamic model

hydro p aet hydro the spaei also followed the original structure of spei in fitting the time series of p aet hydro using three parameter log logistic distribution to formulate annual hydro meteorological drought index as explained in section 2 2 1 2 2 4 climate change projection model statistical downscaling model sdm to study the climate change impacts on drought characteristics

speed with surface hydrological variables e g precipitation using statistical methods eum et al 2020 the present study developed a multisite statistical downscaling model to predict the climate change projections of precipitation and temperatures the basic formulation of statistical downscaling model includes data preprocessing to remove systematic bias in the modeled and actual climate

states cart transfer function support vector regression based on sireesha naidu et al 2020 national center for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar climate data from 1948 to the present at a resolution of 2 5o 2 5 was considered as large scale observed climate variables the potential predictor variables which have shown significant correlation coefficients with precipitation were identified as surface air temperature wind speed humidity etc which were also found as potential predictors in other studies over india rehana and mujumdar 2012 salvi et al 2013 spatial resolution mismatch between ncep and gcm predictor data has been resolved by applying an inverse distance weighting interpolation the gcm predictor data undergoes bias correction based on quantile mapping method by comparing the cumulative distribution functions cdfs of ncep and gcm predictor data for the historical and future scenarios to remove the systematic bias associated with the climate outputs li et al 2010 salvi et al 2013 both bias corrected gcm and reanalysis climate data undergoes with standardization which involves subtraction of mean and division by standard deviation estimated with all the data points of the time series wilby and dawson 2013 after data processing statistically significant climate variables predictors were considered to predict the precipitation over various grid points of the basin to capture the cross correlation between the grids rainfall states are defined as dry moderate and wet to estimate the rainfall state of the basin an unsupervised clustering algorithm k means clustering was used k means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that partitions n observations into k clusters for which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean macqueen 1967 k means clustering has been widely used in the statistical downscaling models in the prediction of rainfall states kannan and ghosh 2011 in this study we used the k means algorithm to achieve cross correlation among the rain stations and group the months having similar rainfall this technique reads the observed rainfall values for all grids in the basin in a month clusters them and provides a single representative value that is referred to as the state of rainfall for that particular month classification and regression tree cart which is a decision tree learning technique has been used in categorizing the rainfall into states by building a statistical relation between the continuous principal components extracted from predictor data and the rainfall states estimated using k means clustering the established relationship is assumed to intact for the future predictors which are then taken as input for cart model and for which the future rainfall states are estimated an advantage of cart over linear classification models is that they can capture non parametric and non linear relationships as well as yield simple models cross validation is carried in order to ensure there is no risk of overfitting the data for every iteration calculate the gini s impurity diversity index e loh 2011 of the data using the formula given in the equation 22 e i j p w i p w j 1 i j p w i 2 where p wj represents the probability of data being in jth class for each value of the attribute choosing an attribute splitting that minimizes the

number of iterations where e η individual regression models are built on separating the predictor and observed data based on the weather state category into individual datasets the svr model tries to fit the error within a certain threshold ε identifying a single separating hyperplane which maximizes the margin rather than solely minimizing the error which helps to find the best model vapnik et al 1997 linear svr was used as the regression technique to predict the precipitation and temperature without overfitting svr tries to minimize the error of misclassification calculated in addition to maximizing the margin between the separating hyperplane and the support vectors application of svr model in statistical downscaling under climate change can be found in gaur et al 2020 goly and teegavarapu 2020 rehana 2019 sireesha naidu et al 2020 3 results the first part of the study tested the performance of the developed hydro meteorological drought index in capturing the meteorological and hydrological drought characteristics the second part of the study has focused on quantification of climate change impacts on the proposed hydro meteorological drought index under precipitation and temperature projections based on statistical downscaling model more specifically the study compared the drought characteristics of areal extent frequency intensity and duration for the standard drought index of spei and proposed hydro meteorological drought index of spaeihydro under climate change projections 3 1 performance of constructed spaei the time series of p pet and p aet were fitted with three parameter log logistic distribution and validated with the kolmogorov smirnov k s chakravarti 1967 goodness of fit test a rejection frequency for log logistic distribution was defined as the ratio of number of grid points which did not fit the time series of p pet and p aet with log logistic distribution to the total number of grid points in the river basin at a given significance level monish and rehana 2019 the k s rejection frequencies for the overall basin including all valid grid points were obtained as 6 and 8 for p pet and p aet respectively at a significance level of 0 05 which are in agreement with earlier studies over krb rehana et al 2020a the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 was used to obtain the relative distribution rankings to choose the best suitable probability distribution to fit runoff the akaike information criterion aic was used to obtain the relative distribution rankings to choose the best suitable distribution to fit runoff the aic values for the lognormal generalized extreme value gev and log logistic distributions were obtained as 583 588 and 1783 respectively both lognormal and gev distributions were ranked as the best distributions and the present study used gev distribution to fit the discharge data in the formulation of sri due to its better applicability over widely varying hydro climatic regimes shukla and wood 2008 the study tested the superiority of hydro meteorological drought index of spaeihydro in characterising drought by comparing with spei and sri the pearson s correlation coefficients of 12 month scale spaeihydro with spei and with sri from 1966 to 2014 were obtained as 0 73 and 0 76 respectively which are significant at p 0 05 the fig 3 shows the kendall rank correlation coefficients between spei sri and spaeihydro at significance test of α 0 01 over krb at 12 month time scale it was noted that spei and sri have high correlation coefficients with spaeihydro capturing catchment scale meteorological and hydrological drought characteristics the strength of the spaeihydro furthermore investigated based on historical drought events over krb rehana et al 2020a pointed out that most severe drought events have occurred in the years of 1972 1985 2002 and 2003 over krb the effect of spaeihydro was tested by analysing the 12 month scale spei sri and spaeihydro for the current climatology period of 1966 2014 table 1 gives the drought intensity for major drought years of 1972 1985 2002 2003 and 2012 estimated based on spei sri and spaeihydro the 12 month moving time window ending in december can account for both active monsoon and the non monsoon months over the study area mallya et al 2016 therefore the intensity of major drought years of december months were compared the drought intensities of hydro meteorological drought index of spaeihydro were found to be comparable with both meteorological spei and hydrological sri drought indices intensities specifically for higher runoff value of 17 93 m3 s in 1985 the spei 1 04 and sri 1 21 indices were noted as same with lower intensity of spaeihydro value as 0 65 while for lowest annual runoff value of 1 07 m3 s in 2003 the spei 1 16 and sri 1 68 indices again same intensities with higher intensity of spaeihydro as 1 06 with this spaeihydro can provide a more reasonable catchment scale drought assessment conditions compared to spei and sri fig 4 to compare the onset and termination of drought events the study considered 1 0 as threshold fig 5 compares the basin averaged monthly 12 month time scale spei sri and spaeihydro time series for the period from 1965 to 2015 the years 1972 a 1985 b 2002 and 2003 c and 2012 d were noted as major drought years as shown in fig 5 exceeding the threshold of 1 0 which is in agreement with earlier research finding over the basin rehana et al 2020a these were also declared as major drought years all over india mallya et al 2016 the spaeihydro is in agreement with both spei and sri in identifying the major drought events over the basin for the year 1972 the drought onset with spei has started from january 1972 which extended till september 1973 whereas the hydrological drought index of sri has persisted with a time lag effect for the period of september 1972 to july 1973 the hydro meteorological drought index spaeihydro has followed both meteorological and hydrological factors into account and noted drought period from september 1972 to july 1973 as drought onset period with 0 5 as threshold to illustrate such time lag effect of meteorological and hydrological drought onsets the year 1984 which was not a severe drought year but the spei has noted the occurrence of drought from september 1984 with drought intensity as 0 76 however the sri has noted the hydrological drought occurrence from october onwards with a time lag of one month with drought intensity as 0 92 while the hydro meteorological drought has also identified the occurrence of drought from november onwards with drought intensity as 1 46 overall spaeihydro was noted to identify the meteorological droughts of spei as well as hydrological drought events of sri for major drought years over the study area accounting for the time lag effects as spei is energy based et estimate it is characterizing the drought events as severe compared to spaeihydro which is based on both water availability and energy figs 6 and 7 for example we considered the most severe drought year of 2002 which was also one of the noted drought all over india mallya et al 2016 for comparing the drought intensity characterization for both spei and spaeihydro as shown in fig 6 as spei was based on the atmospheric water demand without accounting for the terrestrial actual water availability it has characterized the entire basin under extreme while spaeihydro has identified as severe and moderate this can also be noted by comparing the drought areal extents based on spei and spaeihydro for various categories of moderate severe and extreme estimated from 1951 to 2014 as shown in fig 7 the areal extent of drought was estimated as the ratio of grids affected with various categories including moderate severe and extreme of drought to the total grid points covering the entire river basin the spei spaeihydro has characterized 35 2 29 6 of area under moderate 35 47 17 1 of area under severe and 49 07 16 8 of area under extreme for the drought year of 2002 therefore spaeihydro can provide more insight in capturing the severe and extreme drought characteristics at catchment scales compared to spei due to the inclusion of aet in the drought characterizing instead of pet further to validate the newly proposed hydro meteorological drought index we have used remote sensing aet estimates based on gleam in the drought formulation of spei to frame spaei rs fig 6 the spaeihydro was noted to be more comparable with spaei rs in terms of drought characterization compared to spei it should be noted that the difference between spaeihydro and spaei rs is mainly due to the aet estimation method used in the drought indices formulation a comparison of modeled aet based on budyko formulation and remote sensing based aet can be more appropriate to verify the new proposed drought index formulation the spatial average correlation coefficient between modeled budyko and remote sensing aet data was estimated for a period of 1980 to 2014 and obtained as 0 88 these research findings are in agreement with earlier study by rehana and monish 2020 with about 99 of grid points having correlation coefficients 0 8 all over india when compared with the budyko and gleam based aet data sets for period of 1980 to 2014 overall the newly proposed hydro meteorological drought characterization has followed the remote sensing aet based drought index which is most dependable and validated global terrestrial aet data with many hydrological applications zhang et al 2010 it can be noted that the sri estimated is with the basin outlet discharge point which is always affected by water abstractions therefore the hydrological drought was experienced for almost for all months fig 5 ideally the discharge locations for comparison should be considered at sub basin scale since the hydrological model applied in the present study is with closure of water balance and therefore basin outlet discharge location was considered in the estimation and comparison of sri index with spei and spaeihydro 3 2 hydro meteorological variability current and future climate signals 3 2 1 hydro climatology over krb for current and future scenarios the present study used the climate change projections of precipitation and temperatures based on three gcm outputs to study the climate change impacts on hydrometeorological droughts over krb the study considered the current climatology as 1951 1989 and 1990 2005 with future projections time slices as 2021 2040 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 to study the drought characteristics over krb depending on the ncep resolution the predictor matrix has considered around 100 20 gridsx5 predictors encompassing the entire basin considering that there will be a homogeneous pattern among these predictor variables as well as keeping the computational constraints in view pca was applied in order to reduce the problem of multidimensionality and multicollinearity for capturing 98 of variability of predictor data about 15 principal components have been selected instead of 100 predictor dimensions covering the entire basin in the statistical downscaling model the rainfall states for the current period were obtained for the observed historical data using k means clustering which are then given as inputs to cart model to find the rainfall states for gcm future datasets then individual regression model based on svr were built for each grid for every state finally depending on the rainfall state of a month in the future for every grid the corresponding regression model was identified and applied to get the amount of rainfall in that month for temperature a single regression model was built for each grid in contrast to multiple models for rainfall which was applied to get the future temperature predictions the historical time period of 1951 1989 and 1990 2005 were used as training and testing of the statistical downscaling model the basin averaged mean values of estimated precipitation and temperatures for training testing and for the future time periods of 2021 2040 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 were provided in table 2 for the observed and for three gcm projections with rcp 4 5 scenario the increase in precipitation and temperatures for the future scenarios were predicted compared with the observed time periods table 2 the bcccsm canesm and miroc gcms have shown lower precipitation averages compared to the observed data but an increase of 16 13 mm to 108 1 mm compared to the historical projections and an increase of 0 55 c to 0 94 c in temperatures there is an average increase of precipitation with about 3 38 4 2 and 4 1 with bcccsm canesm and miroc models respectively over krb for the future scenarios of 2021 2080 compared to observed period of 1990 2005 similarly an increase of temperature of about 0 59 0 37 and 0 32 c with bcccsm canesm and miroc models respectively over krb for the future scenarios of 2021 2080 compared to observed period of 1990 2005 such increase of temperature and precipitation results was found to be in comparison with earlier research findings over the basin rehana et al 2020b for instance based on regional circulation model rcm based coordinated regional downscaling experiment cordex projections of precipitation and temperatures were analysed over krb by rehana et al 2020b their study noted about 2 19 of increase in precipitation and about 1 29 c of increase in temperature for the period of 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 respectively compared to observed period of 1966 2003 with rcp 4 5 scenario with various cordex model outputs compared to rcm projections the gcm projections based on statistical downscaling model as developed in the present study has shown lower precipitation and temperature increases over krb it can be noted that statistical downscaling models based on gcm outputs have provide more accurate climate change projections as they are developed based on the historical relationship between the large scale climate and surface based hydrological variables eden et al 2014 from the comparison of the performance of gcm simulations with observed data the gcm projections which are based on the statistical relationships developed based on the observed climate have proven to be promising tools for the hydrometeorological drought impact assessment over krb the average annual pet estimated with future scenarios of precipitation and temperatures using thornthwaite model were noted to increase in the range of 100 mm to 200 mm over krb there is an average increase of pet with about 6 6 5 2 and 2 6 with bcccsm canesm and miroc models respectively over krb for the future scenarios of 2021 2080 compared to observed period of 1990 2005 there is a consequent increase in the estimates of aethydro in the range of 250 mm to 500 mm compared with the current period as given in table 2 there is an average increase of hydrological induced aet with about 28 2 37 7 and 23 9 with bcccsm canesm and miroc models respectively over krb for the future scenarios of 2021 2080 compared to observed period of 1990 2005 3 2 2 drought projections based on spaeihydro the precipitation and temperature projections were used as input into the hydrometeorological droughts assessment over krb in terms of spei and spaeihydro to show the meteorological hydrological and hydro meteorological drought impacts under climate change the present study used spei sri and spaeihydro for current and future scenarios for three gcm outputs we estimated spei sri and spaeihydro for all three gcms for rcp 4 5 scenarios for krb with downscaled projections of precipitation and temperatures along with the hydrologically calibrated aet and simulated runoff before applying any climate model simulation for impact assessment study the predictability of the hydro meteorological phenomenon has to be tested with observed data for the current climatology li et al 2010 to study the capability of the downscaled climate projections of precipitation and temperatures in predicting for the historical drought periods the three different gcm model outputs in capturing the drought intensities were examined the study compared the basin averaged spei sri and spaeihydro based drought intensities for the observed period and with three gcm model outputs as shown in fig 8 all three gcms were able to capture the major historical drought years between the period of 1951 to 2015 for example the bcccsm has identified the major drought year of 1972 with spei 1 6 sri 1 5 and spaeihydro 1 32 whereas the miroc also has identified the drought year of 1972 with spei 1 4 sri 0 11 and spaeihydro 1 3 as drought intensities however canesm model characterised the 1972 with drought intensities with spei 0 0 sri 1 5 and spaeihydro 1 3 overall bcccsm and miroc have identified major drought years over krb with all three indices of spei sri and spaeihydro compared to canesm the study considered the current climatology as 1951 1989 and 1990 2005 with future projections time slices as 2021 2040 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 to study various drought characteristics in terms of intensity areal extent frequency and duration over krb figs 8 9 10 and 11 mainly the study compared the spei and spaeihydro drought indices in terms of intensity and areal extent for future scenarios to quantify the impacts on meteorological and hydrometeorological droughts the moderate and severe drought areal extents have been predicted to increase for the future periods compared to the current however the extreme drought areal extent has not been captured attributed to the caveat of statistical downscaling models ability to capture the extremes effectively compared to mean climate rehana and mujumdar 2012 overall the drought area has increased from 14 8 to 23 44 for the 2021 2040 period 14 39 for the 2041 2060 period and 15 4 30 75 for the 2061 2080 period there is a net increase of 25 31 from the current to future periods over krb fig 9 here drought is analysed in terms of average intensity estimated over the whole basin frequency of droughts for every time period considered as well as the average duration of drought in the considered time period higher and more frequent drought intensities have been observed with bcccsm and miroc with a threshold of 1 compared to the current periods particularly after 2000 year however the drought intensity is not as high for the severe and extreme drought years compared to the imd data as the extremes are not captured accurately using the climate change projections of statistical downscaling models the frequency of drought is more with spei compared to the drought frequency with spaeihydro for most of the basin and higher for the northern regions of the krb fig 10 the average drought frequency for the current period 1951 2014 was estimated as 9 5 and 9 years respectively with spei and spaeihydro the study noted that number of drought years were predicted to increase from 5 to 6 years for every 20 years with spei whereas the number of drought years increase is predicted with spaeihydro as 4 5 years for every 20 years among these projections the bcccsm has shown higher drought frequencies for the period of 2041 2060 over the north of the basin with both indices of spei and spaeihydro the miroc has predicted more droughts in the 2021 2040 period with spei in the central region of the basin and for both 2021 2040 as well as the period 2061 2080 with spaeihydro in the north western region however canesm has shown higher drought frequencies in the southern parts of the basin with spaeihydro for the period 2041 2060 the bcccsm model has predicted the basin averaged drought frequencies with spei spaeihydro as 5 4 8 5 and 6 4 years respectively for the three future time slices 2021 2040 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 the basin average drought frequency with miroc with spei spaeihydro was predicted as 9 4 5 3 4 and 3 5 years respectively for the three future time slices 2021 2040 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 following this the canesm also has predicted increase of drought frequencies with basin averaged frequencies with spei spaeihydro as 4 4 5 7 6 7 and 6 5 5 years respectively for the three future time slices 2021 2040 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 overall highest number of droughts were predicted during the time period of 2061 2080 with both spei and spaeihydro drought indices which directs for the possible adaptive measures and policy making for the water resources management over krb longer drought duration months were noted with spei compared to spaeihydro for all over krb the basin averaged drought durations were estimated with spei and spaeihydro for the current period as 6 and 3 months respectively as the spei is based on the difference between climatic water balance of p pet such long durations can be expected such results are evident due to the positive climatic demand with pet p pet resulting in more drought months whereas spaeihydro is based on the hydrological induced aet involving runoff along with the precipitation the lack of water can be expected for few months only compared to atmospheric water demand p pet therefore the drought durations were estimated as less for spaeihydro compared to spei over krb the drought durations were compared for spei and spaeihydro for current and future scenarios based on three gcm climate change projections and compared as shown in fig 11 for about 7 9 2 3 months of basin averaged drought durations were predicted for the period of 2021 2080 period with bcccsm whereas the miroc model has shown higher drought durations with about 10 5 and 5 months with spei respectively for the period of 2021 2040 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 with an increase of 1 5 3 5 months with spaeihydro whereas the drought duration has been predicted to increase from 6 to 9 4 5 months with spei spaeihydro for the future scenarios of up to 2060 overall drought durations were predicted to increase over the basin for the time period of 2061 2080 with both the drought indices predominantly in the northern parts of the basin which can directly affect the crop productivity and food security 4 discussion the study aimed to include aet in the drought characterisation along with precipitation at catchment scale to represent both hydrological and meteorological aspects combinedly whereas aet is a complex hydrological variable to estimate in comparison to other forms of hydrological variables such as precipitation runoff and pet there are various advanced state of the art satellite based remote sensing observations of aet which are available at various spatial and temporal resolutions however drought index developed based on such data cannot be used to quantify the impacts of climate change projections on droughts based on the most sophisticated and reliable gcm outputs therefore the study aimed to include aet which was estimated as a function of readily available estimated and simulated hydro climate variables p r and pet which can be further used in the drought impact assessment under climate change for this purpose the study adopted a well known and classical approach of aet estimation which was accepted globally for long term and at catchment scales the study adopted a calibration free formulation of budyko hypothesis to estimate the aet at catchment scale as a function of accumulated p and pet at 12 month scale to frame annual drought estimation inclusion of aet in the drought characterisation can account for the transfer of moisture from the surface to the atmosphere in response to both the energy demand and available moisture supply and can be a promising variable in the drought estimation liu et al 2016 given the advantages of the proposed drought index some caveats are still there which need special attention starting with the aet empirical model to statistical downscaling model there can be several uncertainties arising from various sources it should be noted that budyko formulation has been developed for long term average and large catchments with stationary assumptions towards soil water storage changes due to ground water recharge and human interactions gunkel and lange 2017 therefore the proposed methodology of budyko formulation of aet estimates for any catchment should be implemented through accurate validation with water balance and most dependable state of the art satellite based aet estimates further the study used budyko based empirical formulation to estimate aet and one can use any such model e g turc 1954 and can study the uncertainty in the drought characterisation one of the major assumptions made in the analysis is that aet estimates were at 12 month accumulation monthly time scale by neglecting the storage changes which are prominent at monthly time scale the study is limited for the annual drought indices estimation by neglecting the storage changes which can be further extended with the inclusion of appropriate storage component in drought estimation which can definitely account for the agricultural drought aspects at catchment scales the aet estimates was used in a conceptual hydrological model involving p and aet to quantify the water availability with closure of water balance calibration factors in the drought characteristics the advantage of use of a conceptual hydrological model as implemented in the present study has allowed to use the most prominent hydrometeorological variables which can be modelled and estimated based on the most dependable climate change projections of precipitation and temperatures the study adopted a dynamic calibration approach which was modelled as a function of p aet and r using a data driven algorithm based on ensemble regression the calibrated factors were imposed on the aet estimates based on budyko framework to estimate the hydrological induced aet which was used in the hydro meteorological drought index formulation using the structure of spei furthermore we have introduced a calibration parameter only on the aet estimates in the water balance equation of p aet one can extend such basic conceptual model by introducing various other variables such as soil land use etc and can introduce more parameters furthermore the dynamic calibration factor modelled by ensemble regression model can be implemented by various machine learning algorithms accounting for such multiple calibration parameter into account such modelled calibration factors were further used to estimate the dynamic calibration parameters for the future scenarios with climate change projections of p aet and uncalibrated runoff the formulated drought index with hydrologically calibrated aet estimates in spei was named as standardised precipitation actual evapotranspiration index spaeihydro the study adopted a statistical downscaling model to generate the climate change projections of precipitation and temperatures with three gcms with rcp 4 5 scenarios the study used the newly formulated drought index of spaeihydro to study the climate change impacts on hydrometeorological drought assessment at river basin scale the study compared the meteorological spei hydrological sri and hydrometeorological spaeihydro drought impacts under climate change by integrating the projections of precipitation and temperatures it can be noted that the proposed hydro meteorological drought index is not accounting for the groundwater component of the hydrological system however based on sufficient data availability of ground water storage at river basin scale and with the use of basic water balance equation one can account for the ground water component in the proposed drought index with the inclusion of ground water component in the basic formulation of hydro meteorological drought index eq 21 along with p aet and r all major forms of droughts such as meteorological hydrological and agricultural can be represented with one drought index the proposed hydrometeorological drought indicator has provided promising results in reconstruction of earlier major drought years over the basin based on both meteorological and hydrological indices accounting for the time lag effects of both indices further given the advantage to capture both meteorological and hydrological aspects together in one index the proposed formulation can provide an ease in the water resources management and decision making for the policy makers 5 conclusions the following conclusions are derived from this study the spaeihydro can provide more insight in capturing the severe and extreme drought characteristics at catchment scales compared the spei due to the inclusion of hydrologically induced aet in the drought characterizing instead of pet there is an average increase of precipitation temperature with about 3 38 0 59 c 4 2 0 37 c and 4 1 0 32 c with bcccsm canesm and miroc models respectively over krb for the future scenarios of 2021 2080 compared to observed period of 1990 2005 there is an average increase of pet aet with about 6 6 28 2 5 2 37 7 and 2 6 23 9 with bcccsm canesm and miroc models respectively over krb for the future scenarios of 2021 2080 compared to observed period of 1990 2005 intensification drought characteristics under climate change over krb has been predicted in terms of drought areal extent increase of about 25 31 with increase of drought frequency as 5 years and durations as 4 5 months based on the proposed hydrometeorological drought index of spaeihydro the projected drought characteristics based on spei are more intensified compared to spaeihydro due to the consideration of pet which is maximum possible moisture loss based on energy demand on the other hand inclusion of aet as demonstrated in the present study can account for the transfer of moisture from the surface to the atmosphere in response to both energy demand and available moisture supply and can be a promising variable in the drought estimation credit authorship contribution statement s rehana conceptualization

4888,univariate meteorological drought indices are inadequate to represent the complexity of hydrological conditions under the intensification of hydrological cycle due to climate change at catchment scale in this study standardised precipitation actual evapotranspiration index spaei was proposed which can combine both meteorological and hydrological drought characteristics at catchment scale the proposed new drought index considers the hydrologically calibrated aet to account for the water use in addition to meteorological effect the proposed hydrometeorological drought index was potential in identifying meteorological and hydrological drought events accounting for the time lag effects and comparable with global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam remote sensing aet data based drought index the pet based drought index of spei which is based on energy demand has shown intensified drought characteristics compared to spaei which is based on both energy demand and available moisture supply and can be a promising variable in the drought estimation the climate change projections of precipitation and temperatures downscaled using statistical downscaling model based on k means clustering classification and regression trees and support vector regression were used using three general circulation model outputs intensified drought characteristics under climate change has been predicted over krishna river basin india in terms of increase of drought areal extent of about 25 31 with increase of drought frequency as 5 years per 20 years and durations as 4 5 months based on the proposed hydrometeorological drought index of spaei keywords hydrometeorological drought evapotranspiration hydrological modelling climate change spei sri 1 introduction drought is one of the most widespread and slowly developing natural hazard due to the lack of water availability in terms of precipitation and consequent shortage of streamflow and soil moisture affecting socioeconomics aadhar and mishra 2017 aghakouchak et al 2015 dai 2011 it corresponds to the failure of spatial and temporal precipitation meteorological drought inadequate streamflows hydrological drought decrease in soil moisture and crop yields agricultural drought therefore consequent impact on ecosystem and socioeconomic activities of the human being socio economic drought wilhite and glantz 1985 among these the most widely used drought indices at regional scale water resources management are meteorological and hydrological to characterise and compare drought severity frequency and duration marcos garcia et al 2017 a meteorological drought index accounts for the deviation of climatological variables precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet in a given year from the normal conditions e g standardized precipitation index spi by mckee et al 1993 standardized precipitation evapotranspiration spei developed by vicente serrano et al 2010 nevertheless none of these meteorological indices can consider the effect of evapotranspiration flux based on actual water availabilities in the drought estimation furthermore such meteorological droughts are independent of actual water availabilities land use and vegetation in the drought estimation at catchment scale a drought assessment solely based on meteorological aspects without considering deficits in hydrological cycle will not be sufficient for the regional water resources management decision under climate change oloruntade et al 2017 whereas hydrological drought assessment is based on the fall of streamflow and water storages below long term mean levels e g standardized runoff index sri shukla and woods 2008 implementation of such hydrological drought assessments are limited for ungauged basins loon et al 2019 furthermore hydrological drought assessment entirely based on below normal streamflow may mislead due to the human influenced regulated flows due to diversions water transfers and instream abstractions lanen et al 2013 traditionally drought assessment studies were exclusively based on either meteorological or hydrological aspects without considering the combined effect of climatological deviations and acute water shortages at river basin scales to this end drought assessment studies have evolved by integrating various meteorological e g spi and hydrological drought indicators e g sri in a unique manner of aggregation to develop composite drought indices shah and mishra 2020 wang et al 2020 these composite drought indices can combine the individual drought indicators either statistically e g copula based composite drought index shah and mishra 2020 wang et al 2020 or simple weighting entropy weighted drought index waseem et al 2015 however to understand the complexity and time lags yang et al 2017b between meteorological and hydrological drought indices it is very important to structure the drought indices with an integration of most prominent hydro meteorological variables to retain the dependence between these variables given the limitations of meteorological and hydrological drought indices as individual a drought index which will synthesize the hydro meteorological information can be more reliable in the context of operational drought management at river basin scale under climate change a comprehensive hydro meteorological drought index combining major hydrological variables such as precipitation pet aet and runoff r simultaneously to characterise the meteorological and hydrological drought will be more promising for efficient drought management at catchment scale the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei has become popular meteorological drought index due to the inclusion of atmospheric climate demand as the difference p pet between precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration pet vicente serrano et al 2010 even though spei has proven to be more reliable measure than standardized precipitation index spi e g tirivarombo et al 2018 as it includes pet in addition to p it cannot account for the actual water availability of a region moreover p pet is energy based atmospheric water demand and do not account for the effects of regional land surface changes and actual moisture availability which is the difference p aet between p and actual evapotranspiration aet also pet is the maximum possible moisture loss limited only by the energy endowment or it is the energy driven et shelton 2008 whereas aet represents the transfer of moisture from the surface to the atmosphere in response to both the energy demand and available moisture supply and can be a promising variable in the drought estimation liu et al 2017 inclusion of aet in meteorological drought indices such as spei which is a prominent hydrological variable can represent hydro meteorological drought indicator the present study aimed at inclusion of most prominent hydrological variables of p pet aet and r in the drought formulation to develop a hydro meteorological drought indicator which can work accurately to define both meteorological and hydrological aspects together at catchment scale the conventional approaches to estimate aet at river basin scales is based on data intensive macro scale distributed hydrological simulation models and water balance methods expressed as aet p r at annual time scale hamel and guswa 2015 alternatively several parametric models have been developed for estimating aet with operational meteorological variables of precipitation and temperatures as inputs e g zhang et al 2004 such parametric models are based on the assumption that aet is limited by precipitation under very dry conditions and limited by pet under very wet conditions e g budyko 1974 however these parametric models of aet are purely based on region specific climate considering p and pet and limited to represent variability of evapotranspiration under water uses asokan et al 2010 in this context time invariant model parameters were estimated at catchment scale with consideration of closure of water balance by asokan et al 2010 jarsjö et al 2008 however time invariant catchment scale parameters are limited to capture temporal variability of water energy balance variables instead dynamic model parameters accounting for the variations of p pet and r under climate signals with the closure of water balance can be more promising e g rehana et al 2020c application of such hydrological calibration models on the aet estimates can account for the variability of p pet and r at catchment scale inclusion of such hydrological induced aet in the drought estimation can account for the catchment scale hydro meteorological aspects the present study proposed a modelling framework to include hydrologically calibrated aet estimates in the formulation of spei to develop a new hydro meteorological drought monitoring index standardized precipitation actual evapotranspiration index spaei it can be noted that the parametric aet model adopted in the present study is based on budyko formulation which is suitable for long term basin average scale and large catchments gunkel and lange 2017 therefore the study mainly focused on 12 month time scale annual drought characterization to avoid the use of short term soil moisture storages donohue et al 2007 the proposed drought index of spaei consider the joint effect of meteorological and actual water budget and has a potential to evaluate the effects of climate and hydrological changes in order to study the impacts of climate variability on drought characteristics the study adopted statistical downscaling model based projections of precipitation and temperature based on general circulation model gcm outputs the study compared the newly proposed hydro meteorological drought index of spaei with meteorological drought index of spei and hydrological drought index of standardized runoff index sri for current and projected scenarios

considered as meteorological drought index which works based on the climatic water balance the accumulated monthly difference in mm between precipitation and pet as follows 1 d p p e t where p is the monthly precipitation mm and pet is the monthly potential evapotranspiration mm the structure of spei works with three parameter log logistic distribution by fitting the d eq 1 series following to vicente serrano et al 2010 the probability density function pdf f x and cumulative distribution function cdf f x of the three parameter log logistic distribution is given as follows 2 f x β α x γ α β 1 1 x γ α β 2 where α β and γ are the scale shape and origin parameters respectively the parameters of the log logistic distribution are obtained by following the l moment procedure as follows 3 β 2 w 1 w 0 6 w 1 w 0 6 w 2 4 α w 0 2 w 1 β γ 1 1 β γ 1 1 β 5 γ w 0 α γ 1 1 β γ 1 1 β where w 0 w 1 and w 2 are the probability weighted moments calculated based on yue and hashino 2007 as follows 6 w r 1 n n 1 r 1 j 1 n r n 1 r x j r 0 1 2 where n is the sample size and xj is the ordered vector of observations in descending order next the cumulative distribution function of log logistic distribution can be calculated with the estimated parameters of pearson iii distribution 7 f x 1 x γ α β 1 the three parameter log logistic distribution was applied to model the time series of p pet for various time scales furthermore the fitted three parameter log logistic distribution is validated with the kolmogorov smirnov k s chakravarti 1967 goodness of fit test for the climatic water balance time series of

determined d value p 1 f x if p 0 5 then p is replaced by 1 p and the sign of the resultant spei is reversed the constants are co 2 5515517 c1 0 802853 c2 0 010328 d1 1 432788 d2 0 189269 and d3 0 001308 obtained based on abramowitz 1974 which serve as constants in the conversion of inverse normal distribution function for a given probability value p the drought severity of spei can be categorization as follows moderate if spei were in between 1 0 to 1 49 severe if spei were in between 1 50 to 1 99 and extreme if spei were less than 2 0 based on vicente serrano et al 2010 2 2 2 development of hydro meteorological drought index standardised precipitation actual evapotranspiration index spaei the proposed hydro meteorological drought index spaei was aimed to integrate most important operational meteorological drought defining variable p hydrological drought defining variable r at catchment scale the most complex hydrological variable which define both meteorological and hydrological drought characteristics at catchment scale in terms of water availability p r and evaporative demand pet is actual evapotranspiration aet the present study aimed to include hydrologically induced aet in the structure of spei to formulate hydro meteorological drought indices as shown in fig 2 the fig 2 shows the overview of the proposed methodology to estimate the hydro meteorological drought index spaei the spaei considered hydrologically induced aet at catchment scale including meteorological variables of precipitation and temperatures along with hydrological variable of runoff fig 2 first the pet was estimated with thornthwaite model thornthwaite 1948 with monthly average air temperature and geographical location of the region of interest as input variables it can be noted that pet can be estimated using any other standard model such as penman monteith model which may require various meteorological variables such as temperature wind speed relative humidity radiation hargreaves and allen 2003 due to the unavailability of observed gridded data sets for the case study the study limited to use thornwaite model for the estimation of pet the next step in the hydro meteorological drought formulation is the estimation of hydrological induced aet as a function of p pet and r one of the classical formulations to estimate aet is budyko model which is a function of p pet and parameter ω which accounts for the non climatic catchment characteristics budyko 1974 eq 10 10 aet p 1 pet p 1 pet p ω 1 ω here one of the widely used non parametric formulation of budyko equation is developed by zhang et al 2004 for the estimation of aet as follows 11 aet climate p 1 e x p p e t p p e t t a n h p pet 0 5 it should be noted that the budyko formulation was developed for large catchments 10000 km2 at long term average scale with stationary hydrological conditions as assumptions with negligible soil water storage changes gunkel and lange 2017 wu et al 2017 yang et al 2007 in order to guarantee the relevance of aet based catchment scale drought index and to avoid the use of short term soil moisture storages the focus of the present study was made at 12 month accumulated annual drought characterization the aet can be estimated with the p and pet estimated at monthly time scale using eq 11 as the workability of aet model applied in the present study which is based on budyko formulation is more towards annual scales the study worked to estimate the 12 month scale drought indices the monthly p and pet are accumulated to 12 month scale as follows 12 p i k i k 1 i p i w h e r e k 12 13 pe t i k i k 1 i p e t i w h e r e k 12 where p i k and pe t i k are the accumulated precipitation and pet in month i the 12 month accumulated p and pet values will be used in eq 11 to estimate the accumulated aet values at 12 month scale by applying accumulated values of p and pet directly in the eq 11 the conditions of p becoming zero for any given month can overcome in the calculation with this the study has focused on annual drought index of 12 month accumulation time period it can be noted that due to seasonality of rainfall short term droughts e g 1 month accumulation can be valuable to evaluate the effect of time lags of precipitation response on hydrological droughts at monthly scale such short term drought duration assessment can be promising for the agricultural water management the aet estimated based on eq 11 is completely based on meteorological forcing and region specific climatic conditions and therefore can be considered as climate induced aet aetclim asokan et al 2010 such climate induced aet with p and pet cannot account for the variability in evapotranspiration flux under water use changes with p pet and r in the drought estimation rehana et al 2020a therefore aetclim has to be hydrologically calibrated to account for the variability of p pet and r at catchment scales which can further serve as input for the hydro meteorological drought index spaeihydro as shown in fig 2 the aet clim i can be evaluated by integrating the basin runoff r to estimate hydrologically induced aet aet hydro for this purpose single model parameter for the entire river basin at annual time scale has been introduced by asokan et al 2010 and jarsjö et al 2008 where the observed r obs o u t l e t and uncalibrated r calculated o u t l e t runoff estimated from the hydrological model at the basin outlet were compared as follows 14 r calculated o u t l e t r obs o u t l e t p aet clim p x cal aet clim 15 x cal r obs o u t l e t r calculated o u t l e t 1 r obs o u t l e t r calculated o u t l e t p aet clim where r obs o u t l e t and r calculated o u t l e t are the long term annual average observed and simulated runoff at the basin outlet in m3 s respectively and p and aet clim are the long term accumulated annual average observed precipitation and aet estimated based on eq 11 over the basin in mm year the simulated runoff r calculated o u t l e t will be calculated by dividing the entire river basin into uniform grids at each grid i the residual available water raw calculated i will be estimated using annual total precipitation p i and climate induced aet aet clim i from eq 11 as follows 16 raw calculated i p i aet clim i the discharge at the basin outlet r calculated o u t l e t was estimated by accumulating the flow at grid cell i raw calculated i and from all upstream grid cells raw cal g according to the flow direction of the river and corresponding to the area of each grid cell a cell as follows 17 r calculated o u t l e t raw calculated i raw calculated g a cell the annual scale basin averaged calibration factors estimated based on eq 15 can be applied on the aet clim eq 11 to study the changes of aet under hydro meteorological or water use over the river basin however such time invariant single basin model parameters may not be valid to study the possible hydro climatic variability under climate change rehana et al 2020c furthermore application of such model parameters developed based on historically observed data may limit to capture the temporal variability of hydro climatic variables under climate signals sireesha naidu et al 2020 given that hydrological variables such as p pet and r have shown pronounced change under climate change due to the intensification of global hydrological cycle therefore model parameters should also account for such changes in this context developing hydrological model parameters which can relate various hydro climatic variables such as p et and observed r can improve the hydrological model performance lópez lópez et al 2017 therefore the study proposed to estimate the dynamic model parameters accounting for the variability of p pet and observed r such developed models can be used further to estimate the model calibration factors for the future scenarios under climate change projections based on statistical downscaling models one of the major challenge in implementing such framework are limited data and poor understanding of complex relation between the model parameters and hydrological variables thus the study adopted machine learning models based on ensemble regression model erm to relate model parameters and p pet and observed r therefore a data driven modelling framework which can relate the model parameter and other hydro climatic variables such as p pet and r can be more appropriate following to the study of rehana et al 2020c the present study also adopted dynamic model parameter hydrological induced model parameter x cal accounting for the temporal variability of p pet and r based on ensemble regression model er 2 2 3 ensemble regression er model ensemble regression er methods are machine learning paradigms in which multiple methods which are often referred to as weak learners are trained to solve a problem and are combined to get better results friedman 2001 the er model works on the hypothesis that diverse set of models can make better predictions in comparison with an individual model the er models has gained interest in the hydrological model assessments in recent years sajedi hosseini et al 2018 the input training dataset of n points x y x i y i i 1 n where x i is the set of predictors and y i as the observed predictand value at the i th timestep

which can be considered as predictand variable y i and uncalibrated runoff p aet resulting from hydrological raw calculated i eq 16 model along with p and aet were considered as predictor variables x

current and future scenarios 20 aet hydro x cal aet clim where aet hydro represent the hydrological aet representing the evaporative demand of the atmosphere accounting for energy available in terms of pet and water supply in terms of r the hydrologically calibrated aet estimates can serve as input to the hydro meteorological drought index of spaei along with precipitation as follows 21 spaei

2013 spatial resolution mismatch between ncep and gcm predictor data has been resolved by applying an inverse distance weighting interpolation the gcm predictor data undergoes bias correction based on quantile mapping method by comparing the cumulative distribution functions cdfs of ncep and gcm predictor data for the historical and future scenarios to remove the systematic bias associated with the climate outputs li et al 2010 salvi et al 2013 both bias corrected gcm and reanalysis climate data undergoes with standardization which involves subtraction of mean and division by standard deviation estimated with all the data points of the time series wilby and dawson 2013 after data processing statistically significant climate variables predictors were considered to predict the precipitation over various grid points of the basin to capture the cross correlation between the grids rainfall states are defined as dry moderate and wet to estimate the rainfall state of the basin an unsupervised clustering algorithm k means clustering was used k means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that partitions n observations into k clusters for which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean macqueen 1967 k means clustering has been widely used in the statistical downscaling models in the prediction of rainfall states kannan and ghosh 2011 in this study we used the k means algorithm to achieve cross correlation among the rain stations and group the months having similar rainfall this technique reads the observed rainfall values for all grids in the basin in a month clusters them and provides a single representative value that is referred to as the state of rainfall for that particular month classification and regression tree cart which is a decision tree learning technique has been used in categorizing the rainfall into states by building a statistical relation between the continuous principal components extracted from predictor data and the rainfall states estimated using k means clustering the established relationship is assumed to intact for the future predictors which are then taken as input for cart model and for which the future rainfall states are estimated an advantage of cart over linear classification models is that they can capture non parametric and non linear relationships as well as yield simple models cross validation is carried in order to ensure there is no risk of overfitting the data for every iteration calculate the gini s impurity diversity index e loh 2011 of the data using the formula given in the equation 22 e i j p w i p w j 1 i j p w i 2 where p wj represents the probability of data being in jth class for each value of the attribute choosing an attribute splitting that minimizes the decrease in this impurity e as much as possible it is 0 when all the patterns at node have the same class label continue until impurity e is less than a certain threshold η or on reaching the maximum number of iterations where e η individual regression models are built on separating the predictor and observed data based on the weather state category into individual datasets the svr model tries to fit the error within a certain threshold ε identifying a single separating hyperplane which maximizes the margin rather than solely minimizing the error which helps to find the best model vapnik et al 1997 linear svr was used as the regression technique to predict the precipitation and temperature without overfitting svr tries to minimize the error of misclassification calculated in addition to maximizing the margin between the separating hyperplane and the support vectors application of svr model in statistical downscaling under climate change can be found in gaur et al 2020 goly and teegavarapu 2020 rehana 2019 sireesha naidu et al 2020 3 results the first part of the study tested the performance of the developed hydro meteorological drought index in capturing the meteorological and hydrological drought characteristics the second part of the study has focused on quantification of climate change impacts on the proposed hydro meteorological drought index under precipitation and temperature projections based on statistical downscaling model more specifically the study compared the drought characteristics of areal extent frequency intensity and duration for the standard drought index of spei and proposed hydro meteorological drought index of spaeihydro under climate change projections 3 1 performance of constructed spaei the time series of p pet and p aet were fitted with three parameter log logistic distribution and validated with the kolmogorov smirnov k s chakravarti 1967 goodness of fit test a rejection frequency for log logistic distribution was defined as the ratio of number of grid points which did not fit the time series of p pet and p aet with log logistic distribution to the total number of grid points in the river basin at a given significance level monish and rehana 2019 the k s rejection frequencies for the overall basin including all valid grid points were obtained as 6 and 8 for p pet and p aet respectively at a significance level of 0 05 which are in agreement with earlier studies over krb rehana et al 2020a the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 was used to obtain the relative distribution rankings to choose the best suitable probability distribution to fit runoff the akaike information criterion aic was used to obtain the relative distribution rankings to choose the best suitable distribution to fit runoff the aic values for the lognormal generalized extreme value gev and log logistic distributions were obtained as 583 588 and 1783 respectively both lognormal and gev distributions were ranked as the best distributions and the present study used gev distribution to fit the discharge data in the formulation of sri due to its better applicability over widely varying hydro climatic regimes shukla and wood 2008 the study tested the superiority of hydro meteorological drought index of spaeihydro in characterising drought by comparing with spei and sri the pearson s correlation coefficients of 12 month scale spaeihydro with spei and with sri from 1966 to 2014 were obtained as 0 73 and 0 76 respectively which are significant at p 0 05 the fig 3 shows the kendall rank correlation coefficients between spei sri and spaeihydro at significance test of α 0 01 over krb at 12 month time scale it was noted that spei and sri have high correlation coefficients with spaeihydro capturing catchment scale meteorological and hydrological drought characteristics the strength of the spaeihydro furthermore investigated based on historical drought events over krb rehana et al 2020a pointed out that most severe drought events have occurred in the years of 1972 1985 2002 and 2003 over krb the effect of spaeihydro was tested by analysing the 12 month scale spei sri and spaeihydro for the current climatology period of 1966 2014 table 1 gives the drought intensity for major drought years of 1972 1985 2002 2003 and 2012 estimated based on spei sri and spaeihydro the 12 month moving time window ending in december can account for both active monsoon and the non monsoon months over the study area mallya et al 2016 therefore the intensity of major drought years of december months were compared the drought intensities of hydro meteorological drought index of spaeihydro were found to be comparable with both meteorological spei and hydrological sri drought indices intensities specifically for higher runoff value of 17 93 m3 s in 1985 the spei 1 04 and sri 1 21 indices were noted as same with lower intensity of spaeihydro value as 0 65 while for lowest annual runoff value of 1 07 m3 s in 2003 the spei 1 16 and sri 1 68 indices again same intensities with higher intensity of spaeihydro as 1 06 with this spaeihydro can provide a more reasonable catchment scale drought assessment conditions compared to spei and sri fig 4 to compare the onset and termination of drought events the study considered 1 0 as threshold fig 5 compares the basin averaged monthly 12 month time scale spei sri and spaeihydro time series for the period from 1965 to 2015 the years 1972 a 1985 b 2002 and 2003 c and 2012 d were noted as major drought years as shown in fig 5 exceeding the threshold of 1 0 which is in agreement with earlier research finding over the basin rehana et al 2020a these were also declared as major drought years all over india mallya et al 2016 the spaeihydro is in agreement with both spei and sri in identifying the major drought events over the basin for the year 1972 the drought onset with spei has started from january 1972 which extended till september 1973 whereas the hydrological drought index of sri has persisted with a time lag effect for the period of september 1972 to july 1973 the hydro meteorological drought index spaeihydro has followed both meteorological and hydrological factors into account and noted drought period from september 1972 to july 1973 as drought onset period with 0 5 as threshold to illustrate such time lag effect of meteorological and hydrological drought onsets the year 1984 which was not a severe drought year but the spei has noted the occurrence of drought from september 1984 with drought intensity as 0 76 however the sri has noted the hydrological drought occurrence from october onwards with a time lag of one month with drought intensity as 0 92 while the hydro meteorological drought has also identified the occurrence of drought from november onwards with drought intensity as 1 46 overall spaeihydro was noted to identify the meteorological droughts of spei as well as hydrological drought events of sri for major drought years over the study area accounting for the time lag effects as spei is energy based et estimate it is characterizing the drought events as severe compared to spaeihydro which is based on both water availability and energy figs 6 and 7 for example we considered the most severe drought year of 2002 which was also one of the noted drought all over india mallya et al 2016 for comparing the drought intensity characterization for both spei and spaeihydro as shown in fig 6 as spei was based on the atmospheric water demand without accounting for the terrestrial actual water availability it has characterized the entire basin under extreme while spaeihydro has identified as severe and moderate this can also be noted by comparing the drought areal extents based on spei and spaeihydro for various categories of moderate severe and extreme estimated from 1951 to 2014 as shown in fig 7 the areal extent of drought was estimated as the ratio of grids affected with various categories including moderate severe and extreme of drought to the total grid points covering the entire river basin the spei spaeihydro has characterized 35 2 29 6 of area under moderate 35 47 17 1 of area under severe and 49 07 16 8 of area under extreme for the drought year of 2002 therefore spaeihydro can provide more insight in capturing the severe and extreme drought characteristics at catchment scales compared to spei due to the inclusion of aet in the drought characterizing instead of pet further to validate the newly proposed hydro meteorological drought index we have used remote sensing aet estimates based on gleam in the drought formulation of spei to frame spaei rs fig 6 the spaeihydro was noted to be more comparable with spaei rs in terms of drought characterization compared to spei it should be noted that the difference between spaeihydro and spaei rs is mainly due to the aet estimation method used in the drought indices formulation a comparison of modeled aet based on budyko formulation and remote sensing based aet can be more appropriate to verify the new proposed drought index formulation the spatial average correlation coefficient between modeled budyko and remote sensing aet data was estimated for a period of 1980 to 2014 and obtained as 0 88 these research findings are in agreement with earlier study by rehana and monish 2020 with about 99 of grid points having correlation coefficients 0 8 all over india when compared with the budyko and gleam based aet data sets for period of 1980 to 2014 overall the newly proposed hydro meteorological drought characterization has followed the remote sensing aet based drought index which is most dependable and validated global terrestrial aet data with many hydrological applications zhang et al 2010 it can be noted that the sri estimated is with the basin outlet discharge point which is always affected by water abstractions therefore the hydrological drought was experienced for almost for all months fig 5 ideally the discharge locations for comparison should be considered at sub basin scale since the hydrological model applied in the present study is with closure of water balance and therefore basin outlet discharge location was considered in the estimation and comparison of sri index with spei and spaeihydro 3 2 hydro meteorological variability current and future climate signals 3 2 1 hydro climatology over krb for current and future scenarios the present study used the climate change projections of precipitation and temperatures based on three gcm outputs to study the climate change impacts on hydrometeorological droughts over krb the study considered the current climatology as 1951 1989 and 1990 2005 with future projections time slices as 2021 2040 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 to study the drought characteristics over krb depending on the ncep resolution the predictor matrix has considered around 100 20 gridsx5 predictors encompassing the entire basin considering that there will be a homogeneous pattern among these predictor variables as well as keeping the computational constraints in view pca was applied in order to reduce the problem of multidimensionality and multicollinearity for capturing 98 of variability of predictor data about 15 principal components have been selected instead of 100 predictor dimensions covering the entire basin in the statistical downscaling model the rainfall states for the current period were obtained for the observed historical data using k means clustering which are then given as inputs to cart model to find the rainfall states for gcm future datasets then individual regression model based on svr were built for each grid for every state finally depending on the rainfall state of a month in the future for every grid the corresponding regression model was identified and applied to get the amount of rainfall in that month for temperature a single regression model was built for each grid in contrast to multiple models for rainfall which was applied to get the future temperature predictions the historical time period of 1951 1989 and 1990 2005 were used as training and testing of the statistical downscaling model the basin averaged mean values of estimated precipitation and temperatures for training testing and for the future time periods of 2021 2040 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 were provided in table 2 for the observed and for three gcm projections with rcp 4 5 scenario the increase in precipitation and temperatures for the future scenarios were predicted compared with the observed time periods table 2 the bcccsm canesm and miroc gcms have shown lower precipitation averages compared to the observed data but an increase of 16 13 mm to 108 1 mm compared to the historical projections and an increase of 0 55 c to 0 94 c in temperatures there is an average increase of precipitation with about 3 38 4 2 and 4 1 with bcccsm canesm and miroc models respectively over krb for the future scenarios of 2021 2080 compared to observed period of 1990 2005 similarly an increase of temperature of about 0 59 0 37 and 0 32 c with bcccsm canesm and miroc models respectively over krb for the future scenarios of 2021 2080 compared to observed period of 1990 2005 such increase of temperature and precipitation results was found to be in comparison with earlier research findings over the basin rehana et al 2020b for instance based on regional circulation model rcm based coordinated regional downscaling experiment cordex projections of precipitation and temperatures were analysed over krb by rehana et al 2020b their study noted about 2 19 of increase in precipitation and about 1 29 c of increase in temperature for the period of 2021 2040 and 2041 2060 respectively compared to observed period of 1966 2003 with rcp 4 5 scenario with various cordex model outputs compared to rcm projections the gcm projections based on statistical downscaling model as developed in the present study has shown lower precipitation and temperature increases over krb it can be noted that statistical downscaling models based on gcm outputs have provide more accurate climate change projections as they are developed based on the historical relationship between the large scale climate and surface based hydrological variables eden et al 2014 from the comparison of the performance of gcm simulations with observed data the gcm projections which are based on the statistical relationships developed based on the observed climate have proven to be promising tools for the hydrometeorological drought impact assessment over krb the average annual pet estimated with future scenarios of precipitation and temperatures using thornthwaite model were noted to increase in the range of 100 mm to 200 mm over krb there is an average increase of pet with about 6 6 5 2 and 2 6 with bcccsm canesm and miroc models respectively over krb for the future scenarios of 2021 2080 compared to observed period of 1990 2005 there is a consequent increase in the estimates of aethydro in the range of 250 mm to 500 mm compared with the current period as given in table 2 there is an average increase of hydrological induced aet with about 28 2 37 7 and 23 9 with bcccsm canesm and miroc models respectively over krb for the future scenarios of 2021 2080 compared to observed period of 1990 2005 3 2 2 drought projections based on spaeihydro the precipitation and temperature projections were used as input into the hydrometeorological droughts assessment over krb in terms of spei and spaeihydro to show the meteorological hydrological and hydro meteorological drought impacts under climate change the present study used spei sri and spaeihydro for current and future scenarios for three gcm outputs we estimated spei sri and spaeihydro for all three gcms for rcp 4 5 scenarios for krb with downscaled projections of precipitation and temperatures along with the hydrologically calibrated aet and simulated runoff before applying any climate model simulation for impact assessment study the predictability of the hydro meteorological phenomenon has to be tested with observed data for the current climatology li et al 2010 to study the capability of the downscaled climate projections of precipitation and temperatures in predicting for the historical drought periods the three different gcm model outputs in capturing the drought intensities were examined the study compared the basin averaged spei sri and spaeihydro based drought intensities for the observed period and with three gcm model outputs as shown in fig 8 all three gcms were able to capture the major historical drought years between the period of 1951 to 2015 for example the bcccsm has identified the major drought year of 1972 with spei 1 6 sri 1 5 and spaeihydro 1 32 whereas the miroc also has identified the drought year of 1972 with spei 1 4 sri 0 11 and spaeihydro 1 3 as drought intensities however canesm model characterised the 1972 with drought intensities with spei 0 0 sri 1 5 and spaeihydro 1 3 overall bcccsm and miroc have identified major drought years over krb with all three indices of spei sri and spaeihydro compared to canesm the study considered the current climatology as 1951 1989 and 1990 2005 with future projections time slices as 2021 2040 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 to study various drought characteristics in terms of intensity areal extent frequency and duration over krb figs 8 9 10 and 11 mainly the study compared the spei and spaeihydro drought indices in terms of intensity and areal extent for future scenarios to quantify the impacts on meteorological and hydrometeorological droughts the moderate and severe drought areal extents have been predicted to increase for the future periods compared to the current however the extreme drought areal extent has not been captured attributed to the caveat of statistical downscaling models ability to capture the extremes effectively compared to mean climate rehana and mujumdar 2012 overall the drought area has increased from 14 8 to 23 44 for the 2021 2040 period 14 39 for the 2041 2060 period and 15 4 30 75 for the 2061 2080 period there is a net increase of 25 31 from the current to future periods over krb fig 9 here drought is analysed in terms of average intensity estimated over the whole basin frequency of droughts for every time period considered as well as the average duration of drought in the considered time period higher and more frequent drought intensities have been observed with bcccsm and miroc with a threshold of 1 compared to the current periods particularly after 2000 year however the drought intensity is not as high for the severe and extreme drought years compared to the imd data as the extremes are not captured accurately using the climate change projections of statistical downscaling models the frequency of drought is more with spei compared to the drought frequency with spaeihydro for most of the basin and higher for the northern regions of the krb fig 10 the average drought frequency for the current period 1951 2014 was estimated as 9 5 and 9 years respectively with spei and spaeihydro the study noted that number of drought years were predicted to increase from 5 to 6 years for every 20 years with spei whereas the number of drought years increase is predicted with spaeihydro as 4 5 years for every 20 years among these projections the bcccsm has shown higher drought frequencies for the period of 2041 2060 over the north of the basin with both indices of spei and spaeihydro the miroc has predicted more droughts in the 2021 2040 period with spei in the central region of the basin and for both 2021 2040 as well as the period 2061 2080 with spaeihydro in the north western region however canesm has shown higher drought frequencies in the southern parts of the basin with spaeihydro for the period 2041 2060 the bcccsm model has predicted the basin averaged drought frequencies with spei spaeihydro as 5 4 8 5 and 6 4 years respectively for the three future time slices 2021 2040 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 the basin average drought frequency with miroc with spei spaeihydro was predicted as 9 4 5 3 4 and 3 5 years respectively for the three future time slices 2021 2040 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 following this the canesm also has predicted increase of drought frequencies with basin averaged frequencies with spei spaeihydro as 4 4 5 7 6 7 and 6 5 5 years respectively for the three future time slices 2021 2040 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 overall highest number of droughts were predicted during the time period of 2061 2080 with both spei and spaeihydro drought indices which directs for the possible adaptive measures and policy making for the water resources management over krb longer drought duration months were noted with spei compared to spaeihydro for all over krb the basin averaged drought durations were estimated with spei and spaeihydro for the current period as 6 and 3 months respectively as the spei is based on the difference between climatic water balance of p pet such long durations can be expected such results are evident due to the positive climatic demand with pet p pet resulting in more drought months whereas spaeihydro is based on the hydrological induced aet involving runoff along with the precipitation the lack of water can be expected for few months only compared to atmospheric water demand p pet therefore the drought durations were estimated as less for spaeihydro compared to spei over krb the drought durations were compared for spei and spaeihydro for current and future scenarios based on three gcm climate change projections and compared as shown in fig 11 for about 7 9 2 3 months of basin averaged drought durations were predicted for the period of 2021 2080 period with bcccsm whereas the miroc model has shown higher drought durations with about 10 5 and 5 months with spei respectively for the period of 2021 2040 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 with an increase of 1 5 3 5 months with spaeihydro whereas the drought duration has been predicted to increase from 6 to 9 4 5 months with spei spaeihydro for the future scenarios of up to 2060 overall drought durations were predicted to increase over the basin for the time period of 2061 2080 with both the drought indices predominantly in the northern parts of the basin which can directly affect the crop productivity and food security 4 discussion the study aimed to include aet in the drought characterisation along with precipitation at catchment scale to represent both hydrological and meteorological aspects combinedly whereas aet is a complex hydrological variable to estimate in comparison to other forms of hydrological variables such as precipitation runoff and pet there are various advanced state of the art satellite based remote sensing observations of aet which are available at various spatial and temporal resolutions however drought index developed based on such data cannot be used to quantify the impacts of climate change projections on droughts based on the most sophisticated and reliable gcm outputs therefore the study aimed to include aet which was estimated as a function of readily available estimated and simulated hydro climate variables p r and pet which can be further used in the drought impact assessment under climate change for this purpose the study adopted a well known and classical approach of aet estimation which was accepted globally for long term and at catchment scales the study adopted a calibration free formulation of budyko hypothesis to estimate the aet at catchment scale as a function of accumulated p and pet at 12 month scale to frame annual drought estimation inclusion of aet in the drought characterisation can account for the transfer of moisture from the surface to the atmosphere in response to both the energy demand and available moisture supply and can be a promising variable in the drought estimation liu et al 2016 given the advantages of the proposed drought index some caveats are still there which need special attention starting with the aet empirical model to statistical downscaling model there can be several uncertainties arising from various sources it should be noted that budyko formulation has been developed for long term average and large catchments with stationary assumptions towards soil water storage changes due to ground water recharge and human interactions gunkel and lange 2017 therefore the proposed methodology of budyko formulation of aet estimates for any catchment should be implemented through accurate validation with water balance and most dependable state of the art satellite based aet estimates further the study used budyko based empirical formulation to estimate aet and one can use any such model e g turc 1954 and can study the uncertainty in the drought characterisation one of the major assumptions made in the analysis is that aet estimates were at 12 month accumulation monthly time scale by neglecting the storage changes which are prominent at monthly time scale the study is limited for the annual drought indices estimation by neglecting the storage changes which can be further extended with the inclusion of appropriate storage component in drought estimation which can definitely account for the agricultural drought aspects at catchment scales the aet estimates was used in a conceptual hydrological model involving p and aet to quantify the water availability with closure of water balance calibration factors in the drought characteristics the advantage of use of a conceptual hydrological model as implemented in the present study has allowed to use the most prominent hydrometeorological variables which can be modelled and estimated based on the most dependable climate change projections of precipitation and temperatures the study adopted a dynamic calibration approach which was modelled as a function of p aet and r using a data driven algorithm based on ensemble regression the calibrated factors were imposed on the aet estimates based on budyko framework to estimate the hydrological induced aet which was used in the hydro meteorological drought index formulation using the structure of spei furthermore we have introduced a calibration parameter only on the aet estimates in the water balance equation of p aet one can extend such basic conceptual model by introducing various other variables such as soil land use etc and can introduce more parameters furthermore the dynamic calibration factor modelled by ensemble regression model can be implemented by various machine learning algorithms accounting for such multiple calibration parameter into account such modelled calibration factors were further used to estimate the dynamic calibration parameters for the future scenarios with climate change projections of p aet and uncalibrated runoff the formulated drought index with hydrologically calibrated aet estimates in spei was named as standardised precipitation actual evapotranspiration index spaeihydro the study adopted a statistical downscaling model to generate the climate change projections of precipitation and temperatures with three gcms with rcp 4 5 scenarios the study used the newly formulated drought index of spaeihydro to study the climate change impacts on hydrometeorological drought assessment at river basin scale the study compared the meteorological spei hydrological sri and hydrometeorological spaeihydro drought impacts under climate change by integrating the projections of precipitation and temperatures it can be noted that the proposed hydro meteorological drought index is not accounting for the groundwater component of the hydrological system however based on sufficient data availability of ground water storage at river basin scale and with the use of basic water balance equation one can account for the ground water component in the proposed drought index with the inclusion of ground water component in the basic formulation of hydro meteorological drought index eq 21 along with p aet and r all major forms of droughts such as meteorological hydrological and agricultural can be represented with one drought index the proposed hydrometeorological drought indicator has provided promising results in reconstruction of earlier major drought years over the basin based on both meteorological and hydrological indices accounting for the time lag effects of both indices further given the advantage to capture both meteorological and hydrological aspects together in one index the proposed formulation can provide an ease in the water resources management and decision making for the policy makers 5 conclusions the following conclusions are derived from this study the spaeihydro can provide more insight in capturing the severe and extreme drought characteristics at catchment scales compared the spei due to the inclusion of hydrologically induced aet in the drought characterizing instead of pet there is an average increase of precipitation temperature with about 3 38 0 59 c 4 2 0 37 c and 4 1 0 32 c with bcccsm canesm and miroc models respectively over krb for the future scenarios of 2021 2080 compared to observed period of 1990 2005 there is an average increase of pet aet with about 6 6 28 2 5 2 37 7 and 2 6 23 9 with bcccsm canesm and miroc models respectively over krb for the future scenarios of 2021 2080 compared to observed period of 1990 2005 intensification drought characteristics under climate change over krb has been predicted in terms of drought areal extent increase of about 25 31 with increase of drought frequency as 5 years and durations as 4 5 months based on the proposed hydrometeorological drought index of spaeihydro the projected drought characteristics based on spei are more intensified compared to spaeihydro due to the consideration of pet which is maximum possible moisture loss based on energy demand on the other hand inclusion of aet as demonstrated in the present study can account for the transfer of moisture from the surface to the atmosphere in response to both energy demand and available moisture supply and can be a promising variable in the drought estimation credit authorship contribution statement s rehana conceptualization

4889,assessment of river sediment sources transport and controlling factors in karst regions is critical to the development of effective soil erosion and sediment management strategies this 2 year study used a hysteresis index of discharge and suspended sediment data combined with the basin s inherent geological characteristics to assess sediment sources and hydrological connectivity at six sites in an agricultural karst watershed of southwest china principal component analysis was further used to describe sediment control by rainfall antecedent precipitation precipitation duration amount and intensity and stream hydrology maximum and total discharge flood intensity and runoff coefficient results indicate that the annual sediment yield 0 8 6 6 mg km2 a 1 is low and sediment transport in karst areas is dependent on continuous rainfall ground substance component gsc and geomorphology characteristics determine the hydrology connectivity and sediment availability in a sub basin cq marked by a peak cluster depression with good vegetation sediment mainly comes from the paddy land and the surface stream shows clockwise hysteresis during storms surface water enters the underground system from sinkholes resulting in figure 8 hysteresis with multiple sediment peaks in another predominantly agricultural sub basin htp the thick layers of paddy and loess soil surrounding the river channel provide an accessible sediment source resulting in clockwise hysteresis the surface outlet of the watershed hz is affected by an upstream reservoir but bank erosion and sediment activation are evident during storms the subsurface outlet msk of the watershed shows more anti clockwise hysteresis due to the activation of the conduit network in the wet season surface water draining into the underground river and the distant sediment sources this study shows that discharge suspended sediment concentration hysteresis analysis can provide a reference for soil and water conservation decision making in karst areas keywords karst hysteresis analysis turbidity suspended sediment transport ground substance component 1 introduction soil erosion and river sediment transport have become serious social and environmental problems all over the world excessive sediment entering a river will reduce its ecological function and sediment related substances such as phosphorus can also have a negative impact on water quality krueger et al 2009 river suspended sediment concentration ssc can reflect the regional soil erosion therefore it is very important to evaluate the source transport and controlling factors of river ssc for implementing effective soil erosion and sediment management strategies li et al 2017 karst areas in southwest china are likely to suffer from soil erosion due to their special geological background vast soluble carbonate rocks humid climate and dense agricultural population wang et al 2003 compared to non karst areas this area has large surface fluctuation low surface runoff coefficient shallow and discontinuous soil in addition to soil erosion on the surface the development of solution enhanced conduits leads to underground soil leakage zhang et al 2007 due to the close relationship between karst soil erosion and rocky desertification scientific research has been carried out on soil erosion and land degradation environment factors characteristics and its occurrence law in the process of karst rocky desertification he et al 2009 the surface soil erosion in the carbonate rock area significantly changes with seasonal precipitation bai and wan 1998 on macro scale geological structure affects the distribution of surface material and surface runoff by controlling the characteristics of landforms thus affecting soil erosion huaduan and rui 2006 the forest vegetation coverage rate in karst areas is usually lower than that in non karst areas which also reduces the functions of vegetation on soil water conservation soil consolidation and fixation cao et al 2003 what is more modern erosion is a comprehensive process of natural erosion and man made accelerated erosion based on the previous studies zhang put forward the view that soil erosion on karst slopes is a mixture of surface water erosion gravity erosion chemical dissolution underground erosion creep and man made accelerated erosion zhang et al 2007 at present some methods have been used to study the sediment sources and transport in karst areas chen et al 2017 li et al 2016 saleh 2008 vigiak et al 2017 gao et al 2013 cheng et al 2020 used fingerprint tracing to investigate sediment sources in a karst landscape and pointed that subsurface and clastic rock sources represent a significant component of the catchment sediment budget targeting hillslope surface soils alone may have limited impact on suspended sediment export at landscape scale li et al 2020 used a composite fingerprinting to investigate sediment sources and their relative contributions in a karst depression they pointed out that soil conservation measures are required to control soil erosion for cropland due to its high sediment contribution and great attention should be paid when using only a single core to quantify sediment provenance li et al 2016 used a revised universal soil loss equation rusle for estimating the spatial and temporal distribution of soil erosion and result shows that the intensity level of soil erosion changes across space the most active area is mainly concentrated in the upstream peak cluster depression however the application of these methods is limited by their high requirements of sample representativeness and sample quantity with the development of monitoring technology the acquisition of high resolution discharge and sediment monitoring data has become simple and the explanation of discharge suspended sediment concentration q ssc hysteresis can provide another way to understand the changes of sediment sources sediment reserves and flow pathways sherriff et al 2016 vercruysse et al 2017 many versions of the hysteresis index hi have been developed to describe the types of hysteresis which is helpful for quantitative description and comparative analysis of time varying storm events in multiple basins langlois et al 2005 lloyd et al 2016 this method q ssc hysteresis analysis had proven reliable in many areas langlois et al 2005 sherriff et al 2016 but which had not yet been used for sediment management studies of karstic water systems in china in order to develop a targeted sediment management plan it is necessary to develop a comprehensive understanding of water and sediment control factors in karst agricultural basins the objectives of this study were to 1 determine the main sediment transport channels and their source areas based on the analysis of q ssc hysteresis and data on hydrogeology soil and land use 2 deduce the potential factors controlling sediment transport based on the mathematical analysis of the characteristics of sediment transport and rainfall runoff and antecedent rainfall 3 provide advice on sediment management for different basins 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in the houzhai river catchment in guizhou province china in the center of the southeast asian karst region fig 1 as of 2010 about 32 400 people lived in the houzhai catchment and more than 95 percent of the population worked in agriculture the catchment is therefore thought to be experiencing land use disturbance li et al 2010 the houzhai catchment is classified as a typical mountain karst river basin wang and zhang 2001 the elevation is between 1210 and 1565 m above sea level with a decreasing trend from southeast to northwest fig 2 a the change trend of landform from upstream to downstream is peak cluster depression peak cluster valley peak forest basin and peak forest plain the lithology consists of the middle triassic guanling formation with limestone dolomite pelitic dolomite and thin marl fig 2 b the upper reaches of the basin are mainly composed of depressions and peak forests fig 2 d with few surface water systems and developed underground water systems the potential energy of groundwater is large the flow velocity is fast and the water transformations precipitation surface water and ground water are rapid due to the lack of residual materials or deposits transported by external forces the soil is generally composed of black and yellow lime soil formed by in situ weathering the middle reaches of the basin can be divided into two sub regions of different geomorphology and landscape fig 2 d the northern part is a dolomite marl area with undeveloped underground structure the landform combination of this area is peak forest karst plain and the residual peak forest with tens of meters high is distributed in island cluster the hydraulic gradient is small 4 2 to 7 8 the surface water system flow direction is not concentrated there are some ancient river channels and dry valleys influenced by lithology dolomite and calcareous dolomite the red weathering crust platform is formed and the gently ground covered by thick loose laterite soil layer the southern part of the middle reaches of the basin is peak forest valley area the peak forest is distributed in the form of clan or island the vertical seepage zone is small the groundwater depth is shallow 3 to 12 m and the surface river alternates with the underground river the surface is flat 7 average hydraulic gradient with many springs black and yellow limestone soil is distributed on the slopes paddy soil is distributed on the dam lands the residual red clay 7 to 8 m thick accounts for 20 of the area the lower reach of the basin is peak cluster and hilly combination type landform maokeng to msk fig 2 d due to the decrease of the base level of surface erosion some areas are reactivated and many depressions and sinkholes are formed houzhai river which originates from muzhu cave is the main surface river in houzhai basin fig 2 d zhongba river and dengzhan river flow into houzhai river near htp abbreviation of huangtupo place name and flow out from northwest of basin after passing qingshan reservoir houzhai underground river originated in the east fig 2 d after the groundwater converges to the muzhu reservoir part of the groundwater continues to flow in the ground system passing through the lht abbreviation of laoheitan place name in the southwest and finally flows out of the surface at msk abbreviation of maoshuikeng place name the rest of the groundwater flows into the northwest of the basin after converging with the surface tributaries from the northeast and finally flows out of the basin from hz abbreviation of houzhai place name yue et al 2015 the runoff at the outlet hz and msk accounts for more than 95 of the total runoff of the basin and only a part of groundwater flows out of the basin at the southwest boundary the surface river and underground river in houzhai basin formed a unique double layer structure system through hydraulic connection the basins were divided into sub basins according to geomorphic types or landforms and hydrological stations were set up at the outlet of each basin table 1 shows the basic information of houzhai and its sub watershed hydrology stations 2 2 data collection suspended sediment data were collected at each hydrology station using high resolution 10 min turbidity visoturb 700iq wtw xylem analytics and q measurements turbidity was calibrated to ssc using a rating curve eder et al 2010 gippel 1995 during storms river water was collected in a 300 ml plastic bottle at 2 hour intervals the suspended sediment concentration was measured by filtering the river water with a 0 45 μm filter membrane this approach for ss estimation was validated by direct depth integrated and cross sectional samples and no differences in turbidity ssc relationship occurred between event and nonevent samples sherriff et al 2015 yan et al 2021 a total of 243 valid samples were collected during the storm events and the turbidity ssc relationship for each hydrological station is shown in fig 3 cqdb n 41 r2 0 93 cqdx n 36 r2 0 71 htp n 33 r2 0 98 lht n 33 r2 0 72 hz n 42 r2 0 98 msk n 42 r2 0 94 triangular rafts were installed at hydrological stations using hobo u20 onset computer pressure transducers with a resolution of 0 02 kpa and a monitoring interval of 10 min measured water pressures were corrected for barometric pressure fluctuations and converted to water levels from which flow rates were calculated using a rating curve meteorological data were collected from three weather stations hobo u30 measuring 10 min resolution rainfall air temperature relative air humidity radiation and wind speed 2 3 data analysis the individual storm events from january 2017 to december 2018 were extracted according to the suspended sediment characteristics of each hydrological station in this study a storm event is usually defined as having total precipitation p 10 mm and significant changes in q and ssc however the parameters defining storms differ between watersheds or hydrological stations for cqdb the start of a storm event is defined as the rate of change for 10 consecutive minutes 0 35 m3 s 1 for q and 1 0 g m 3 for ssc measurements and the end of the storm event is defined as a change in q 0 06 m3 s 1 in a continuous 6 hour measurement and ssc 3 g m 3 table 2 shows the storm definition parameters for all hydrological stations and the number of storm events counted for each hydrological station storm events are finally classified by hysteresis categories and hi the hyperbolas of q and ssc indicate the direction and qualitative type of hysteresis clockwise where ssc peaks before q anti clockwise where q peaks before ssc figure 8 with both clockwise and anti clockwise characteristics and indeterminate in which the relationship between ssc and q is difficult to define hysteresis index is a numerical indicator for each storm event calculated with q and ssc data hinew is used in this study because it is more stable than other indicators and can provide a comparison between different watersheds lloyd et al 2016 hinew uses the difference between the ssc values on the rising limb rl and falling limb fl of a storm rather than a ratio and effectively normalizes rl and fl at every measurement point thereby resulting in an index between 1 and 1 1 normalizedq i q i q min q max q min 2 normalizedssc i ssc i ssc min ssc max ssc min 3 hi new ssc r l n o r m ssc f l n o r m where the i subscript refers to timestep i and min and max refer to the minimum and maximum storm parameter values respectively the analysis is carried out using 10 intervals of q and the average value is used as the final hinew value of the storm a higher hinew indicates a greater asynchronous behavior between ssc and q a positive hinew indicates more clockwise hysteresis and a negative hinew indicates more anti clockwise hysteresis the data are classified according to hysteresis types clockwise anti clockwise figure 8 indeterminate to facilitate the investigation of the control factors at each hydrological station sixteen potential control factors were collated for each sub basin in individual storm events belmont et al 2014 sherriff et al 2015 discharge parameters include maximum discharge m3 s 1 total event discharge qtotal m3 event duration t h flood intensity qmax qmin time of rise and rainfall runoff ratio precipitation parameters include total event precipitation p mm duration of rainfall event train h maximum precipitation intensity at 10 and 30 min resolutions i10 and i30 mm h 1 and average precipitation intensity imean mm h 1 antecedent parameters include rainfall at 1 3 5 7 and 10 days before event initiation mm sscmean total event ss load divided by total event flow volume g m 3 was selected as the sediment response variable this flow weighted concentration index can better indicate the availability of the source by reducing the impact of basin hydrology and it also eliminates any potential autocorrelation with the discharge parameters used to calculate ssc principal component analysis pca is carried out for each main hysteresis type of each hydrological station and the potential controls are defined as those that occupy similar areas of sscmean on the pca loading map dominic et al 2015 sherriff et al 2015 tena et al 2014 3 results 3 1 ss load at each station fig 4 shows the daily ss load sequence of each hydrological station and the weekly rainfall distribution in houzhai basin for 2017 and 2018 htp is only in 2018 there is a strong correlation between sediment transport volume and rainfall at each hydrological station which also indicates that rainfall is the main external driving factor of soil erosion and sediment transport the distribution of ss load is uneven the wet season may september accounts for more than 90 of the ss load and ss load is mainly controlled by individual storm events 10 per year from cq to htp to hz the daily sediment transport gradually increases with the catchment area table 3 table 4 shows the sediment and runoff information in each hydrological station 2018 was wetter than 2017 1170 mm vs 960 mm underground river flow in the houzhai basin accounted for more than 70 of total runoff cq and houzhai basins are closed as reflected by runoff coefficients between 0 3 and 0 4 in the htp basin the runoff coefficient was 0 1 which indicates that there may be underground rivers or other outlets besides the monitored surface stream the annual sediment transport modulus of houzhai and its sub basins ranged from 0 8 to 6 6 mg km 2 a 1 3 2 storm event hysteresis fig 5 shows the distribution of hinew in all storm events at six hydrological stations four basins over a 2 year period from upstream to downstream within the houzhai basin hinew has a trend from large to small and from more clockwise to more anti clockwise the average hinew value of cq lht and htp basins in the middle and upper reaches is between 0 27 and 0 39 but the average value of hz and msk in the lower reaches is 0 02 and 0 06 respectively cqdb and cqdx have mainly clockwise hysteresis in which cqdx shows the maximum value of hinew in all basins 0 85 the ssc range of cqdb average 129 g m 3 is larger than that of cqdx average 22 g m 3 htp is clockwise except for one anti clockwise event and the ssc of htp is the largest of all drainage basins reaching a maximum of 820 g m 3 the hinew values of lht are all 0 and tend to be clockwise but the ssc range at lht is the smallest of all stations average 18 g m 3 msk and hz hinew values are basically distributed around 0 which indicates that their hysteresis types are relatively complex their average ssc values 83 and 81 g m 3 respectively ranged in the middle of all hydrology stations the ssc range of all underground rivers cqdx lht msk is significantly smaller than that of surface rivers cqdb htp hz the wet season may september accounted for more than 90 of hysteresis loops in all basins and the wet season ssc value was significantly higher than that in the dry season fig 6 shows all hysteresis types and their ss load ratios for the six hydrological stations the ss load proportion does not strongly depend on the proportion of the loop type for cqdb the clockwise loops accounted for 60 of events and contributed 72 of the ss load while figure 8 loops accounted for 7 of events but contributed 1 of the ss load cqdx and lht are similar in that the proportion of ss load depends on the quantity and both had only anti clockwise and figure 8 hysteresis types the proportion of cqdx clockwise ss events was 64 while that of lht was 56 whereas figure 8 represented 46 of ss load for cqdx and 44 of ss load for lht in contrast at htp the clockwise type accounted for 76 of events and 92 of ss load with the figure 8 type accounting for 24 of events and only 8 of the total ss load the distribution of the hysteresis types in hz was relatively balanced event proportions were 38 anti clockwise 31 clockwise and 31 figure 8 whereas the ss load was 51 anti clockwise 30 clockwise and 19 figure 8 msk was different from other stations figure 8 accounted for 64 of the total number of events and 75 of the total ss load with the remainder being anti clockwise 3 3 storm event ss controls fig 7 shows the pca principal component analysis loading map for each hysteresis types in each sub basin in this study the potential influencing factors of storm events were divided into three principal components loading principal 1 2 and 3 which accounted for at least 78 6 of the variation table 5 shows the absolute distance between potential control variables and sscmean in fig 7 the closer the distance the stronger the control dominic et al 2015 tena et al 2014 in cqdb clockwise is the main hysteresis type which is strongly controlled by rainfall intensity index i10 i30 imean anti clockwise was mainly affected by the antecedent precipitation 3 5 7 10 day antecedent rainfall cqdx still predominantly clockwise is mainly related to the antecedent precipitation and maximum discharge qmax while figure 8 is mainly related to rainfall intensity index i10 i30 imean and flood intensity pca analysis showed that hysteresis in htp seemed to be independent of any potential controls for lht both the clockwise and figure 8 types are influenced by rainfall intensity and total event precipitation but clockwise is more dependent on rainfall duration whereas figure 8 is more dependent on flood intensity due to the existence of the qingshan reservoir the hysteresis type in hz is greatly disturbed by human activities reservoir drainage and storage for msk figure 8 is positively related to rainfall intensity flood intensity and maximum discharge whereas anti clockwise is mainly controlled by flood intensity 4 discussion 4 1 characteristics of annual sediment transport in karst basins due to the special geological conditions soil erosion and sediment transport in karst areas are more dependent on continuous rainfall than that in non karst areas from 2017 to 2018 storms during the wet season may september accounted for 89 of events and 98 of total ss load but they were not linearly dependent on rainfall total rainfall during the two rainy wet seasons accounted for 67 under the action of differential karst dissolution the topography of the epikarst zone is highly variable surface runoff only occurs under the condition of high rainfall which is manifested as the mechanism of saturation excess runoff peng and wang 2012 the epikarst zone plays a dominant role in the regulation and storage of rainfall and water 33 63 its hydrological regulation and storage function has a great range of variation and is mainly controlled by the water content in the early stage but less affected by rainfall intensity fu et al 2016 as a result a single rainfall event does not threaten soil erosion in this area while continuous rainfall has a disproportionate effect on soil erosion or sediment transport it is worth noting that the suspended sediment transport modulus of the basins in this study 0 8 6 6 mg km 2 a 1 table 4 is far lower than that of non karst areas for example the average annual sediment yield of a watershed in the north of the loess plateau is 1061 1736 mg km 2 a 1 zhao et al 2017 the annual soil erosion modulus of a basin in the black soil area of northeast china is about 800 mg km 2 a 1 fang et al 2013 nonetheless the risk of soil erosion in karst basins is not low it takes 2000 8000 years to dissolve 25 m of pure carbonate rock and form 1 cm of soil jiang et al 2014 if the soil formation rate is taken as the tolerance of soil loss many research results show that the allowable loss rate in karst area is 0 2 to 55 mg km 2 a 1 with an average of 4 3 mg km 2 a 1 cao et al 2020 jiang et al 2014 this means that attention must be paid to the prevention and control of soil erosion in karst basins 4 2 hydrology connectivity and sediment availability q ssc hysteresis type is fundamentally determined by geomorphology and ground substance component gsc the geomorphic characteristics determine the water source connectivity while ground substance component determines the sediment availability table 3 shows the possible causes of each hysteresis category in general the clockwise hysteresis pattern is attributed to a rapid response where the distance between the sediment source and outlet is short this pattern reflects rapid erosion and depletion of sediment in the stream network because of a limited supply of readily available sediment for transport conversely the anti clockwise hysteresis pattern is often interpreted as sediment from more distant sources related to extended travel time de girolamo et al 2015 sun et al 2016 tena et al 2014 the geomorphology of a watershed affects the energy fluxes mass movement and water and sediment dispersion within the watershed zhang et al 2015 drainage density is an important index of geomorphology which has a positive correlation with annual sediment yield li et al 2019 lane et al 1997 topographic relief influences the distribution of rivers and erosion characteristics of the basin generally speaking the greater the topographic relief the greater the potential energy of water and the stronger erosion capacity thus the higher the suspended sediment concentration zhang et al 2015 de vente et al 2011 ground substance component gsc is the material basis of sediment including lithology soil and vegetation etc in the karst area of southwest china the sediment yield is closely related to the characteristics of lithology jiang et al 2014 fissures conduits and channels were extensively developed on limestone hillsides resulting in high surface water leakage and low runoff coefficient peng and wang 2012 therefore the wider the limestone coverage the less runoff and less sediment transported by the surface river however the epikarst zone is not developed in the dolomite slope with thin and uniform soil and poor water holding capacity jiang et al 2014 hence the sediment loss in the area dominated by dolomite is low good vegetation cover can conserve water and consolidate soil so there is a negative correlation between vegetation cover and sediment transport braud et al 2001 ouyang et al 2010 it should be noted that gully activity is not correlated with the percentage of total vegetation cover but with the percentage of cover of low vegetation in the gully floor rey 2003 this highlights the importance of spatial distribution of forest vegetation in reducing sediment yield at the gully outlet in this study cq belongs to the peak cluster depression landform the ss load at cqdb was dominated by positive hinew clockwise hysteresis suggesting sediments were scour derived the project of returning farmland to forest greatly increased vegetation coverage in cq basin reduced the artificial disturbance of limestone slope land and effectively controlled the soil erosion on the slopes cao et al 2020 the sediment of cqdb should mainly come from low lying paddy field peak cluster valley occupies a large area of htp sub basin although 92 of the ss load in htp basin is controlled by clockwise hysteresis the event indicators sscmean are independent of other variables in pca loading diagrams fig 7 this shows that the q ssc relationship of htp do not change significantly due to external conditions such as rainfall vegetation in upstream of htp is mainly forest shrubs and grassland which reduces the hydrological connectivity of the upstream surface mellander et al 2015 the lower reaches are peak forest plain accounting for 24 of the total area of htp with flat terrain a large amount of paddy soil and thick layer of loess are distributed around the river course and the vegetation is dominated by crops fig 2 c it can be inferred that the source area of htp sediment is mainly in the lowlands downstream htp was also marked by storm events with two ssc peaks fig 6 the first peak was very early and short which may be related to the lack of river power in the early stage resulting in a small amount of coarse sediment deposited on the riverbed oeurng et al 2010 in hz the total ss load is mainly controlled by anti clockwise type flood 51 of the total ss load which is related to qingshan reservoir reservoirs can store water reduce the flood peak discharge and change the annual runoff distribution oeurng et al 2010 the second major type of hysteresis in hz is clockwise where sediment is mainly proximally derived in contrast to htp and cq the lithology is dolomite from qingshan reservoir to hz fig 2b although loess and paddy soil are distributed around the river channel large areas of grassland and artificial forest land are exposed these conditions suggest that the proximal source of hz sediment is bank erosion 4 3 effects of storm event characteristics on suspended sediment yield in areas dominated by hydraulic erosion rainfall and runoff are the main natural driving factors of soil erosion soil erosion in karst areas must be different from that in non karst areas because of the dual structure to obtain the main driving factors of sediment transport among basins with different landforms and ground substance component a total of 16 hydrological and rainfall indicators were taken into consideration table 5 the main external factors affecting sediment transport in cq are rainfall intensity i30 and antecedent precipitation cq are mainly composed of peak cluster depression with seasonal surface river and developed epikarst zone fig 2 d the potential energy of groundwater is large and the water precipitation surface and ground water transformation are rapid the epikarst zone absorbs a considerable part of precipitation via solution enhanced rock joints fissures and pipes williams 2008 however the antecedent precipitation will make part of epikarst be filled with rainwater which may cause erosion with less precipitation in the later stage for example in the case of antecedent precipitation a single rainfall greater than 10 mm may cause significant water stage changes in underground rivers however in the absence of antecedent precipitation situation 23 mm precipitation is needed to achieve the same effect cao et al 2020 the surface sediment transport is controlled by rainfall intensity and the surface water can enter the underground system through sinkholes which makes the sediment transport in underground river also under the control of rainfall intensity fingerprint tracing shows that surface sediment accounts for 38 of the sediment in underground rivers which supports this view cheng et al 2020 pca analysis cannot give the main control factors of htp sediment transport this also shows that the q ssc of htp is determined by the internal characteristics of the basin ground substance component gsc and geomorphology lht is similar to cqdx in which intense floods connect surface water with the underground river through sinkholes thus providing another important sediment source the distribution of landforms and soils in lht watershed is similar to that of htp but surface rivers in the upper and middle reaches of the lht exit the basin in the northwest which may explain the low annual sediment transport modulus 0 8 1 3 mg km2 a 1 of the lht station msk is the total outlet of groundwater in houzhai basin which has complex geomorphology soil and land use units therefore the sediment transport characteristics of msk represent the general sediment transport characteristics of underground rivers in southwest karst area the main external controlling factors of msk sediment transport are precipitation event duration and total event discharge the average value of hinew for msk is 0 06 so the peak of the ssc tends to lag the peak of q the contribution of figure 8 to ss load 75 is positively correlated with precipitation intensity flood intensity and maximum discharge there is a large amount of paddy soil exposed at the proximal end and high intensity rainfall can easily divert proximal sediment into the subsurface through sinkholes fig 2 during the wet season may september the elevated water level of qingshan reservoir caused surface water that should have flowed into the reservoir to be diverted into the subsurface conduit network that water instead flowed to msk via maokeng fig 2d which is another important distal sediment source of msk similarly barna et al 2020 observed temporary flow reversals within the conduit network between lht and msk anti clockwise hysteresis at msk 25 is mainly controlled by event duration barna et al 2020 found that the groundwater velocity within the conduit network was 2 3 km d in summer and 0 4 2 km day in winter because the maximum conduit length in the basin is 16 km the travel time from the upstream end of the basin to msk is 5 8 days therefore the longer the flood duration the higher the proportion of distal sediment which shows as anti clockwise hysteresis 4 4 watershed management based on sediment sources and connections reducing soil loss and sediment transport requires management strategies based on catchment characteristics that is availability and regional connectivity of sediment sources it is important to note that the contribution of the sediment rather than the frequency of the hysteresis type must be used to prioritize the management strategy in the cq river basin surface soil erosion mainly comes from paddy fields and the remote hillsides are not the focus of soil and water conservation special attention should be paid to the influx of flood water into the valley during heavy rains and to the accumulation of rainwater in the farmland itself therefore building drainage facilities along the perimeter of farmland can effectively prevent soil erosion on the surface cqdx has a large amount of sediment from surface water pouring into the sinkhole during the rainstorm so walls and other protective works around the sinkhole should be considered the geomorphology and other conditions in the htp watershed effectively reduce the risk of soil loss from upstream however the thick layer of loess distributed around the river channel can output a large amount of sediment after the surface passage is activated by rainfall exceeding the infiltration capacity large scale conversion of farmland to grass would be effective in reducing sediment transport but in htp where agricultural productivity is prioritized this is impractical thus planting shelterbelts along river channels increasing surface roughness and adding temporary sediment control measures such as sediment fences may be practical solutions in htp hydraulic engineering can effectively change regional hydrological conditions such as the qingshan reservoir which reduces hz ss load however the reservoir may be affected by siltation over time riverbank erosion is the main sediment source in hz and sediment can be reduced by hardening the riverbank and increasing its stability msk and lht are typical examples of underground sediment transport both show the characteristics of multiple sediment sources which is related to the complexity of underground structure and the seasonal connectivity and they also exhibit connectivity to surface sediment subsurface soil leakage is a prominent feature in karst areas due to its concealment and complexity more research is needed in the future climate change prediction shows that the increasing frequency of floods in southwest china will aggravate soil erosion and sediment transport he et al 2011 the karst mountainous area is large the available land is scattered the soil layer is thin and there is a lack of available groundwater which is not conducive to agricultural production changing the land use structure and ecological development mode are important strategies to improve the environment in the future 5 conclusions this 2 year study used a hysteresis index of discharge and suspended sediment data combined with the basin s inherent geological characteristics to assess sediment sources and transport mechanisms at six sites in an agricultural karst watershed of southwest china so that targeted sediment management measures can be developed the conclusions can be summarized as follows the sediment transport modulus of the river in this karst basin is very low 0 8 6 6 mg km2 a 1 due to the developed epikarst zone in this area sediment transport depends on continuous rainfall and the amount of sediment transport in rainy season accounts for more than 90 of the total annual sediment transport the proportion of sediment transport in underground rivers ranges from 17 to 81 which also reflects the special phenomenon of soil leakage in karst area ground substance component gsc is the material basis of soil erosion and geomorphology characteristics determine the hydrology connectivity in a basin these two conditions regulate the discharge suspended sediment hysteresis type external conditions such as rainfall and pre watershed soil moisture will further characterize the river s q ssc type discharge suspended sediment concentration hysteresis analysis has proved to be a simple and efficient method to understand the sediment sources and flow pathways in many other areas and it also can provide a reference for soil and water conservation decision making

4889,assessment of river sediment sources transport and controlling factors in karst regions is critical to the development of effective soil erosion and sediment management strategies this 2 year study used a hysteresis index of discharge and suspended sediment data combined with the basin s inherent geological characteristics to assess sediment sources and hydrological connectivity at six sites in an agricultural karst watershed of southwest china principal component analysis was further used to describe sediment control by rainfall antecedent precipitation precipitation duration amount and intensity and stream hydrology maximum and total discharge flood intensity and runoff coefficient results indicate that the annual sediment yield 0 8 6 6 mg km2 a 1 is low and sediment transport in karst areas is dependent on continuous rainfall ground substance component gsc and geomorphology characteristics determine the hydrology connectivity and sediment availability in a sub basin cq marked by a peak cluster depression with good vegetation sediment mainly comes from the paddy land and the surface stream shows clockwise hysteresis during storms surface water enters the underground system from sinkholes resulting in figure 8 hysteresis with multiple sediment peaks in another predominantly agricultural sub basin htp the thick layers of paddy and loess soil surrounding the river channel provide an accessible sediment source resulting in clockwise hysteresis the surface outlet of the watershed hz is affected by an upstream reservoir but bank erosion and sediment activation are evident during storms the subsurface outlet msk of the watershed shows more anti clockwise hysteresis due to the activation of the conduit network in the wet season surface water draining into the underground river and the distant sediment sources this study shows that discharge suspended sediment concentration hysteresis analysis can provide a reference for soil and water conservation decision making in karst areas keywords karst hysteresis analysis turbidity suspended sediment transport ground substance component 1 introduction soil erosion and river sediment transport have become serious social and environmental problems all over the world excessive sediment entering a river will reduce its ecological function and sediment related substances such as phosphorus can also have a negative impact on water quality krueger et al 2009 river suspended sediment concentration ssc can reflect the regional soil erosion therefore it is very important to evaluate the source transport and controlling factors of river ssc for implementing effective soil erosion and sediment management strategies li et al 2017 karst areas in southwest china are likely to suffer from soil erosion due to their special geological background vast soluble carbonate rocks humid climate and dense agricultural population wang et al 2003 compared to non karst areas this area has large surface fluctuation low surface runoff coefficient shallow and discontinuous soil in addition to soil erosion on the surface the development of solution enhanced conduits leads to underground soil leakage zhang et al 2007 due to the close relationship between karst soil erosion and rocky desertification scientific research has been carried out on soil erosion and land degradation environment factors characteristics and its occurrence law in the process of karst rocky desertification he et al 2009 the surface soil erosion in the carbonate rock area significantly changes with seasonal precipitation bai and wan 1998 on macro scale geological structure affects the distribution of surface material and surface runoff by controlling the characteristics of landforms thus affecting soil erosion huaduan and rui 2006 the forest vegetation coverage rate in karst areas is usually lower than that in non karst areas which also reduces the functions of vegetation on soil water conservation soil consolidation and fixation cao et al 2003 what is more modern erosion is a comprehensive process of natural erosion and man made accelerated erosion based on the previous studies zhang put forward the view that soil erosion on karst slopes is a mixture of surface water erosion gravity erosion chemical dissolution underground erosion creep and man made accelerated erosion zhang et al 2007 at present some methods have been used to study the sediment sources and transport in karst areas chen et al 2017 li et al 2016 saleh 2008 vigiak et al 2017 gao et al 2013 cheng et al 2020 used fingerprint tracing to investigate sediment sources in a karst landscape and pointed that subsurface and clastic rock sources represent a significant component of the catchment sediment budget targeting hillslope surface soils alone may have limited impact on suspended sediment export at landscape scale li et al 2020 used a composite fingerprinting to investigate sediment sources and their relative contributions in a karst depression they pointed out that soil conservation measures are required to control soil erosion for cropland due to its high sediment contribution and great attention should be paid when using only a single core to quantify sediment provenance li et al 2016 used a revised universal soil loss equation rusle for estimating the spatial and temporal distribution of soil erosion and result shows that the intensity level of soil erosion changes across space the most active area is mainly concentrated in the upstream peak cluster depression however the application of these methods is limited by their high requirements of sample representativeness and sample quantity with the development of monitoring technology the acquisition of high resolution discharge and sediment monitoring data has become simple and the explanation of discharge suspended sediment concentration q ssc hysteresis can provide another way to understand the changes of sediment sources sediment reserves and flow pathways sherriff et al 2016 vercruysse et al 2017 many versions of the hysteresis index hi have been developed to describe the types of hysteresis which is helpful for quantitative description and comparative analysis of time varying storm events in multiple basins langlois et al 2005 lloyd et al 2016 this method q ssc hysteresis analysis had proven reliable in many areas langlois et al 2005 sherriff et al 2016 but which had not yet been used for sediment management studies of karstic water systems in china in order to develop a targeted sediment management plan it is necessary to develop a comprehensive understanding of water and sediment control factors in karst agricultural basins the objectives of this study were to 1 determine the main sediment transport channels and their source areas based on the analysis of q ssc hysteresis and data on hydrogeology soil and land use 2 deduce the potential factors controlling sediment transport based on the mathematical analysis of the characteristics of sediment transport and rainfall runoff and antecedent rainfall 3 provide advice on sediment management for different basins 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in the houzhai river catchment in guizhou province china in the center of the southeast asian karst region fig 1 as of 2010 about 32 400 people lived in the houzhai catchment and more than 95 percent of the population worked in agriculture the catchment is therefore thought to be experiencing land use disturbance li et al 2010 the houzhai catchment is classified as a typical mountain karst river basin wang and zhang 2001 the elevation is between 1210 and 1565 m above sea level with a decreasing trend from southeast to northwest fig 2 a the change trend of landform from upstream to downstream is peak cluster depression peak cluster valley peak forest basin and peak forest plain the lithology consists of the middle triassic guanling formation with limestone dolomite pelitic dolomite and thin marl fig 2 b the upper reaches of the basin are mainly composed of depressions and peak forests fig 2 d with few surface water systems and developed underground water systems the potential energy of groundwater is large the flow velocity is fast and the water transformations precipitation surface water and ground water are rapid due to the lack of residual materials or deposits transported by external forces the soil is generally composed of black and yellow lime soil formed by in situ weathering the middle reaches of the basin can be divided into two sub regions of different geomorphology and landscape fig 2 d the northern part is a dolomite marl area with undeveloped underground structure the landform combination of this area is peak forest karst plain and the residual peak forest with tens of meters high is distributed in island cluster the hydraulic gradient is small 4 2 to 7 8 the surface water system flow direction is not concentrated there are some ancient river channels and dry valleys influenced by lithology dolomite and calcareous dolomite the red weathering crust platform is formed and the gently ground covered by thick loose laterite soil layer the southern part of the middle reaches of the basin is peak forest valley area the peak forest is distributed in the form of clan or island the vertical seepage zone is small the groundwater depth is shallow 3 to 12 m and the surface river alternates with the underground river the surface is flat 7 average hydraulic gradient with many springs black and yellow limestone soil is distributed on the slopes paddy soil is distributed on the dam lands the residual red clay 7 to 8 m thick accounts for 20 of the area the lower reach of the basin is peak cluster and hilly combination type landform maokeng to msk fig 2 d due to the decrease of the base level of surface erosion some areas are reactivated and many depressions and sinkholes are formed houzhai river which originates from muzhu cave is the main surface river in houzhai basin fig 2 d zhongba river and dengzhan river flow into houzhai river near htp abbreviation of huangtupo place name and flow out from northwest of basin after passing qingshan reservoir houzhai underground river originated in the east fig 2 d after the groundwater converges to the muzhu reservoir part of the groundwater continues to flow in the ground system passing through the lht abbreviation of laoheitan place name in the southwest and finally flows out of the surface at msk abbreviation of maoshuikeng place name the rest of the groundwater flows into the northwest of the basin after converging with the surface tributaries from the northeast and finally flows out of the basin from hz abbreviation of houzhai place name yue et al 2015 the runoff at the outlet hz and msk accounts for more than 95 of the total runoff of the basin and only a part of groundwater flows out of the basin at the southwest boundary the surface river and underground river in houzhai basin formed a unique double layer structure system through hydraulic connection the basins were divided into sub basins according to geomorphic types or landforms and hydrological stations were set up at the outlet of each basin table 1 shows the basic information of houzhai and its sub watershed hydrology stations 2 2 data collection suspended sediment data were collected at each hydrology station using high resolution 10 min turbidity visoturb 700iq wtw xylem analytics and q measurements turbidity was calibrated to ssc using a rating curve eder et al 2010 gippel 1995 during storms river water was collected in a 300 ml plastic bottle at 2 hour intervals the suspended sediment concentration was measured by filtering the river water with a 0 45 μm filter membrane this approach for ss estimation was validated by direct depth integrated and cross sectional samples and no differences in turbidity ssc relationship occurred between event and nonevent samples sherriff et al 2015 yan et al 2021 a total of 243 valid samples were collected during the storm events and the turbidity ssc relationship for each hydrological station is shown in fig 3 cqdb n 41 r2 0 93 cqdx n 36 r2 0 71 htp n 33 r2 0 98 lht n 33 r2 0 72 hz n 42 r2 0 98 msk n 42 r2 0 94 triangular rafts were installed at hydrological stations using hobo u20 onset computer pressure transducers with a resolution of 0 02 kpa and a monitoring interval of 10 min measured water pressures were corrected for barometric pressure fluctuations and converted to water levels from which flow rates were calculated using a rating curve meteorological data were collected from three weather stations hobo u30 measuring 10 min resolution rainfall air temperature relative air humidity radiation and wind speed 2 3 data analysis the individual storm events from january 2017 to december 2018 were extracted according to the suspended sediment characteristics of each hydrological station in this study a storm event is usually defined as having total precipitation p 10 mm and significant changes in q and ssc however the parameters defining storms differ between watersheds or hydrological stations for cqdb the start of a storm event is defined as the rate of change for 10 consecutive minutes 0 35 m3 s 1 for q and 1 0 g m 3 for ssc measurements and the end of the storm event is defined as a change in q 0 06 m3 s 1 in a continuous 6 hour measurement and ssc 3 g m 3 table 2 shows the storm definition parameters for all hydrological stations and the number of storm events counted for each hydrological station storm events are finally classified by hysteresis categories and hi the hyperbolas of q and ssc indicate the direction and qualitative type of hysteresis clockwise where ssc peaks before q anti clockwise where q peaks before ssc figure 8 with both clockwise and anti clockwise characteristics and indeterminate in which the relationship between ssc and q is difficult to define hysteresis index is a numerical indicator for each storm event calculated with q and ssc data hinew is used in this study because it is more stable than other indicators and can provide a comparison between different watersheds lloyd et al 2016 hinew uses the difference between the ssc values on the rising limb rl and falling limb fl of a storm rather than a ratio and effectively normalizes rl and fl at every measurement point thereby resulting in an index between 1 and 1 1 normalizedq i q i q min q max q min 2 normalizedssc i ssc i ssc min ssc max ssc min 3 hi new ssc r l n o r m ssc f l n o r m where the i subscript refers to timestep i and min and max refer to the minimum and maximum storm parameter values respectively the analysis is carried out using 10 intervals of q and the average value is used as the final hinew value of the storm a higher hinew indicates a greater asynchronous behavior between ssc and q a positive hinew indicates more clockwise hysteresis and a negative hinew indicates more anti clockwise hysteresis the data are classified according to hysteresis types clockwise anti clockwise figure 8 indeterminate to facilitate the investigation of the control factors at each hydrological station sixteen potential control factors were collated for each sub basin in individual storm events belmont et al 2014 sherriff et al 2015 discharge parameters include maximum discharge m3 s 1 total event discharge qtotal m3 event duration t h flood intensity qmax qmin time

event flow volume g m 3 was selected as the sediment response variable this flow weighted concentration index can better indicate the availability of the source by reducing the impact of basin hydrology and it also eliminates any potential autocorrelation with the discharge parameters used to calculate ssc principal component analysis pca is carried out for each main hysteresis type of each hydrological station and the potential controls are defined as those that occupy similar areas of sscmean on the pca loading map dominic et al 2015 sherriff et al 2015 tena et al 2014 3 results 3 1 ss load at each station fig 4 shows the daily ss load sequence of each hydrological station and the weekly rainfall distribution in houzhai basin for 2017 and 2018 htp is only in 2018 there is a strong correlation between sediment transport volume and rainfall at each hydrological station which also indicates that rainfall is the main external driving factor of soil erosion and sediment transport the distribution of ss load is uneven the wet season may september accounts for more than 90 of the ss load and ss load is mainly controlled by individual storm events 10 per year from cq to htp to hz the daily sediment transport gradually increases with the catchment area table 3 table 4 shows the sediment and runoff information in each hydrological station 2018 was wetter than 2017 1170 mm vs 960 mm underground river flow in the houzhai basin accounted for more than 70 of total runoff cq and houzhai basins are closed as reflected by runoff coefficients between 0 3 and 0 4 in the htp basin the runoff coefficient was 0 1 which indicates that there may be underground rivers or other outlets besides the monitored surface stream the annual sediment transport modulus of houzhai and its sub basins ranged from 0 8 to 6 6 mg km 2 a 1 3 2 storm event hysteresis fig 5 shows the distribution of hinew in all storm events at six hydrological stations four basins over a 2 year period from upstream to downstream within the houzhai basin hinew has a trend from large to small and from more clockwise to more anti clockwise the average hinew value of cq lht and htp basins in the middle and upper reaches is between 0 27 and 0 39 but the average value of hz and msk in the lower reaches is 0 02 and 0 06 respectively cqdb and cqdx have mainly clockwise hysteresis in which cqdx shows the maximum value of hinew in all basins 0 85 the ssc range of cqdb average 129 g m 3 is larger than that of cqdx average 22 g m 3 htp is clockwise except for one anti clockwise event and the ssc of htp is the largest of all drainage basins reaching a maximum of 820 g m 3 the hinew values of lht are all 0 and tend to be clockwise but the ssc range at lht is the smallest of all stations average 18 g m 3 msk and hz hinew values are basically distributed around 0 which indicates that their hysteresis types are relatively complex their average ssc values 83 and 81 g m 3 respectively ranged in the middle of all hydrology stations the ssc range of all underground rivers cqdx lht msk is significantly smaller than that of surface rivers cqdb htp hz the wet season may september accounted for more than 90 of hysteresis loops in all basins and the wet season ssc value was significantly higher than that in the dry season fig 6 shows all hysteresis types and their ss load ratios for the six hydrological stations the ss load proportion does not strongly depend on the proportion of the loop type for cqdb the clockwise loops accounted for 60 of events and contributed 72 of the ss load while figure 8 loops accounted for 7 of events but contributed 1 of the ss load cqdx and lht are similar in that the proportion of ss load depends on the quantity and both had only anti clockwise and figure 8 hysteresis types the proportion of cqdx clockwise ss events was 64 while that of lht was 56 whereas figure 8 represented 46 of ss load for cqdx and 44 of ss load for lht in contrast at htp the clockwise type accounted for 76 of events and 92 of ss load with the figure 8 type accounting for 24 of events and only 8 of the total ss load the distribution of the hysteresis types in hz was relatively balanced event proportions were 38 anti clockwise 31 clockwise and 31 figure 8 whereas the ss load was 51 anti clockwise 30 clockwise and 19 figure 8 msk was different from other stations figure 8 accounted for 64 of the total number of events and 75 of the total ss load with the remainder being anti clockwise 3 3 storm event ss controls fig 7 shows the pca principal component analysis loading map for each hysteresis types in each sub basin in this study the potential influencing factors of storm events were divided into three principal components loading principal 1 2 and 3 which accounted for at least 78 6 of the variation table 5 shows the absolute distance between potential control variables and sscmean in fig 7 the closer the distance the stronger the control dominic et al 2015 tena et al 2014 in cqdb clockwise is the main hysteresis type which is strongly controlled by rainfall intensity index i10 i30 imean anti clockwise was mainly affected by the antecedent precipitation 3 5 7 10 day antecedent rainfall cqdx still predominantly clockwise is mainly related to the antecedent precipitation and maximum discharge qmax while figure 8 is mainly related to rainfall intensity index i10 i30 imean and flood intensity pca analysis showed that hysteresis in htp seemed to be independent of any potential controls for lht both the clockwise and figure 8 types are influenced by rainfall intensity and total event precipitation but clockwise is more dependent on rainfall duration whereas figure 8 is more dependent on flood intensity due to the existence of the qingshan reservoir the hysteresis type in hz is greatly disturbed by human activities reservoir drainage and storage for msk figure 8 is positively related to rainfall intensity flood intensity and maximum discharge whereas anti clockwise is mainly controlled by flood intensity 4 discussion 4 1 characteristics of annual sediment transport in karst basins due to the special geological conditions soil erosion and sediment transport in karst areas are more dependent on continuous rainfall than that in non karst areas from 2017 to 2018 storms during the wet season may september accounted for 89 of events and 98 of total ss load but they were not linearly dependent on rainfall total rainfall during the two rainy wet seasons accounted for 67 under the action of differential karst dissolution the topography of the epikarst zone is highly variable surface runoff only occurs under the condition of high rainfall which is manifested as the mechanism of saturation excess runoff peng and wang 2012 the epikarst zone plays a dominant role in the regulation and storage of rainfall and water 33 63 its hydrological regulation and storage function has a great range of variation and is mainly controlled by the water content in the early stage but less affected by rainfall intensity fu et al 2016 as a result a single rainfall event does not threaten soil erosion in this area while continuous rainfall has a disproportionate effect on soil erosion or sediment transport it is worth noting that the suspended sediment transport modulus of the basins in this study 0 8 6 6 mg km 2 a 1 table 4 is far lower than that of non karst areas for example the average annual sediment yield of a watershed in the north of the loess plateau is 1061 1736 mg km 2 a 1 zhao et al 2017 the annual soil erosion modulus of a basin in the black soil area of northeast china is about 800 mg km 2 a 1 fang et al 2013 nonetheless the risk of soil erosion in karst basins is not low it takes 2000 8000 years to dissolve 25 m of pure carbonate rock and form 1 cm of soil jiang et al 2014 if the soil formation rate is taken as the tolerance of soil loss many research results show that the allowable loss rate in karst area is 0 2 to 55 mg km 2 a 1 with an average of 4 3 mg km 2 a 1 cao et al 2020 jiang et al 2014 this means that attention must be paid to the prevention and control of soil erosion in karst basins 4 2 hydrology connectivity and sediment availability q ssc hysteresis type is fundamentally determined by geomorphology and ground substance component gsc the geomorphic characteristics determine the water source connectivity while ground substance component determines the sediment availability table 3 shows the possible causes of each hysteresis category in general the clockwise hysteresis pattern is attributed to a rapid response where the distance between the sediment source and outlet is short this pattern reflects rapid erosion and depletion of sediment in the stream network because of a limited supply of readily available sediment for transport conversely the anti clockwise hysteresis pattern is often interpreted as sediment from more distant sources related to extended travel time de girolamo et al 2015 sun et al 2016 tena et al 2014 the geomorphology of a watershed affects the energy fluxes mass movement and water and sediment dispersion within the watershed zhang et al 2015 drainage density is an important index of geomorphology which has a positive correlation with annual sediment yield li et al 2019 lane et al 1997 topographic relief influences the distribution of rivers and erosion characteristics of the basin generally speaking the greater the topographic relief the greater the potential energy of water and the stronger erosion capacity thus the higher the suspended sediment concentration zhang et al 2015 de vente et al 2011 ground substance component gsc is the material basis of sediment including lithology soil and vegetation etc in the karst area of southwest china the sediment yield is closely related to the characteristics of lithology jiang et al 2014 fissures conduits and channels were extensively developed on limestone hillsides resulting in high surface water leakage and low runoff coefficient peng and wang 2012 therefore the wider the limestone coverage the less runoff and less sediment transported by the surface river however the epikarst zone is not developed in the dolomite slope with thin and uniform soil and poor water holding capacity jiang et al 2014 hence the sediment loss in the area dominated by dolomite is low good vegetation cover can conserve water and consolidate soil so there is a negative correlation between vegetation cover and sediment transport braud et al 2001 ouyang et al 2010 it should be noted that gully activity is not correlated with the percentage of total vegetation cover but with the percentage of cover of low vegetation in the gully floor rey 2003 this highlights the importance of spatial distribution of forest vegetation in reducing sediment yield at the gully outlet in this study cq belongs to the peak cluster depression landform the ss load at cqdb was dominated by positive hinew clockwise hysteresis suggesting sediments were scour derived the project of returning farmland to forest greatly increased vegetation coverage in cq basin reduced the artificial disturbance of limestone slope land and effectively controlled the soil erosion on the slopes cao et al 2020 the sediment of cqdb should mainly come from low lying paddy field peak cluster valley occupies a large area of htp sub basin although 92 of the ss load in htp basin is controlled by clockwise hysteresis the event indicators sscmean are independent of other variables in pca loading diagrams fig 7 this shows that the q ssc relationship of htp do not change significantly due to external conditions such as rainfall vegetation in upstream of htp is mainly forest shrubs and grassland which reduces the hydrological connectivity of the upstream surface mellander et al 2015 the lower reaches are peak forest plain accounting for 24 of the total area of htp with flat terrain a large amount of paddy soil and thick layer of loess are distributed around the river course and the vegetation is dominated by crops fig 2 c it can be inferred that the source area of htp sediment is mainly in the lowlands downstream htp was also marked by storm events with two ssc peaks fig 6 the first peak was very early and short which may be related to the lack of river power in the early stage resulting in a small amount of coarse sediment deposited on the riverbed oeurng et al 2010 in hz the total ss load is mainly controlled by anti clockwise type flood 51 of the total ss load which is related to qingshan reservoir reservoirs can store water reduce the flood peak discharge and change the annual runoff distribution oeurng et al 2010 the second major type of hysteresis in hz is clockwise where sediment is mainly proximally derived in contrast to htp and cq the lithology is dolomite from qingshan reservoir to hz fig 2b although loess and paddy soil are distributed around the river channel large areas of grassland and artificial forest land are exposed these conditions suggest that the proximal source of hz sediment is bank erosion 4 3 effects of storm event characteristics on suspended sediment yield in areas dominated by hydraulic erosion rainfall and runoff are the main natural driving factors of soil erosion soil erosion in karst areas must be different from that in non karst areas because of the dual structure to obtain the main driving factors of sediment transport among basins with different landforms and ground substance component a total of 16 hydrological and rainfall indicators were taken into consideration table 5 the main external factors affecting sediment transport in cq are rainfall intensity i30 and antecedent precipitation cq are mainly composed of peak cluster depression with seasonal surface river and developed epikarst zone fig 2 d the potential energy of groundwater is large and the water precipitation surface and ground water transformation are rapid the epikarst zone absorbs a considerable part of precipitation via solution enhanced rock joints fissures and pipes williams 2008 however the antecedent precipitation will make part of epikarst be filled with rainwater which may cause erosion with less precipitation in the later stage for example in the case of antecedent precipitation a single rainfall greater than 10 mm may cause significant water stage changes in underground rivers however in the absence of antecedent precipitation situation 23 mm precipitation is needed to achieve the same effect cao et al 2020 the surface sediment transport is controlled by rainfall intensity and the surface water can enter the underground system through sinkholes which makes the sediment transport in underground river also under the control of rainfall intensity fingerprint tracing shows that surface sediment accounts for 38 of the sediment in underground rivers which supports this view cheng et al 2020 pca analysis cannot give the main control factors of htp sediment transport this also shows that the q ssc of htp is determined by the internal characteristics of the basin ground substance component gsc and geomorphology lht is similar to cqdx in which intense floods connect surface water with the underground river through sinkholes thus providing another important sediment source the distribution of landforms and soils in lht watershed is similar to that of htp but surface rivers in the upper and middle reaches of the lht exit the basin in the northwest which may explain the low annual sediment transport modulus 0 8 1 3 mg km2 a 1 of the lht station msk is the total outlet of groundwater in houzhai basin which has complex geomorphology soil and land use units therefore the sediment transport characteristics of msk represent the general sediment transport characteristics of underground rivers in southwest karst area the main external controlling factors of msk sediment transport are precipitation event duration and total event discharge the average value of hinew for msk is 0 06 so the peak of the ssc tends to lag the peak of q the contribution of figure 8 to ss load 75 is positively correlated with precipitation intensity flood intensity and maximum discharge there is a large amount of paddy soil exposed at the proximal end and high intensity rainfall can easily divert proximal sediment into the subsurface through sinkholes fig 2 during the wet season may september the elevated water level of qingshan reservoir caused surface water that should have flowed into the reservoir to be diverted into the subsurface conduit network that water instead flowed to msk via maokeng fig 2d which is another important distal sediment source of msk similarly barna et al 2020 observed temporary flow reversals within the conduit network between lht and msk anti clockwise hysteresis at msk 25 is mainly controlled by event duration barna et al 2020 found that the groundwater velocity within the conduit network was 2 3 km d in summer and 0 4 2 km day in winter because the maximum conduit length in the basin is 16 km the travel time from the upstream end of the basin to msk is 5 8 days therefore the longer the flood duration the higher the proportion of distal sediment which shows as anti clockwise hysteresis 4 4 watershed management based on sediment sources and connections reducing soil loss and sediment transport requires management strategies based on catchment characteristics that is availability and regional connectivity of sediment sources it is important to note that the contribution of the sediment rather than the frequency of the hysteresis type must be used to prioritize the management strategy in the cq river basin surface soil erosion mainly comes from paddy fields and the remote hillsides are not the focus of soil and water conservation special attention should be paid to the influx of flood water into the valley during heavy rains and to the accumulation of rainwater in the farmland itself therefore building drainage facilities along the perimeter of farmland can effectively prevent soil erosion on the surface cqdx has a large amount of sediment from surface water pouring into the sinkhole during the rainstorm so walls and other protective works around the sinkhole should be considered the geomorphology and other conditions in the htp watershed effectively reduce the risk of soil loss from upstream however the thick layer of loess distributed around the river channel can output a large amount of sediment after the surface passage is activated by rainfall exceeding the infiltration capacity large scale conversion of farmland to grass would be effective in reducing sediment transport but in htp where agricultural productivity is prioritized this is impractical thus planting shelterbelts along river channels increasing surface roughness and adding temporary sediment control measures such as sediment fences may be practical solutions in htp hydraulic engineering can effectively change regional hydrological conditions such as the qingshan reservoir which reduces hz ss load however the reservoir may be affected by siltation over time riverbank erosion is the main sediment source in hz and sediment can be reduced by hardening the riverbank and increasing its stability msk and lht are typical examples of underground sediment transport both show the characteristics of multiple sediment sources which is related to the complexity of underground structure and the seasonal connectivity and they also exhibit connectivity to surface sediment subsurface soil leakage is a prominent feature in karst areas due to its concealment and complexity more research is needed in the future climate change prediction shows that the increasing frequency of floods in southwest china will aggravate soil erosion and sediment transport he et al 2011 the karst mountainous area is large the available land is scattered the soil layer is thin and there is a lack of available groundwater which is not conducive to agricultural production changing the land use structure and ecological development mode are important strategies to improve the environment in the future 5 conclusions this 2 year study used a hysteresis index of discharge and suspended sediment data combined with the basin s inherent geological characteristics to assess sediment sources and transport mechanisms at six sites in an agricultural karst watershed of southwest china so that targeted sediment management measures can be developed the conclusions can be summarized as follows the sediment transport modulus of the river in this karst basin is very low 0 8 6 6 mg km2 a 1 due to the developed epikarst zone in this area sediment transport depends on continuous rainfall and the amount of sediment transport in rainy season accounts for more than 90 of the total annual sediment transport the proportion of sediment transport in underground rivers ranges from 17 to 81 which also reflects the special phenomenon of soil leakage in karst area ground substance component gsc is the material basis of soil erosion and geomorphology characteristics determine the hydrology connectivity in a basin these two conditions regulate the discharge suspended sediment hysteresis type external conditions such as rainfall and pre watershed soil moisture will further characterize the river s q ssc type discharge suspended sediment concentration hysteresis analysis has proved to be a simple and efficient method to understand the sediment sources and flow pathways in many other areas and it also can provide a reference for soil and water conservation decision making
