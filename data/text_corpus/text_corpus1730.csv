8650,this article uses a discrete choice experiment carried out in the city of antofagasta chile to understand consumer s preferences for urban drinking water to disentangle the perceptions and valuation of drinking water attributes we propose a willingness to pay wtp space model where the wtps for water attributes are distributed as a mixture of normal distribution this approach combines discrete and continuous heterogeneity representations of tastes providing a richer interpretation of preference heterogeneity for drinking water characteristics such as price the organoleptic characteristics information about the chemical composition origin and the taste of water by distinguishing between tap or bottled water this mixture based formulation is also flexible enough to identify clusters of individuals with differing wtp for these attributes the elicited perceptions and inferred preferences derived from our results are important to understand why consumers still distrust tap water for drinking though tap water meets chilean regulations in terms of safety and is distributed within a stable network keywords water demand tap water willingness to pay discrete choice model wtp space mixture distribution choice experiment chile 1 introduction access to safe domestic drinking water is fundamental for the health of individuals 1 in chile whereas provision of tap water has increased its quality and taste have been one of the main concerns of local water suppliers for many years some empirical studies carried out in chile suggest that having drunk tap water in previous decades could lead to health problems in the present due to a high concentration or arsenic and boron 2 3 specifically 4 found that exposure to high levels of arsenic in tap water during 1958 1970 might be related to an increase in the risk of lung and bladder cancer up to 40 years after whereas 5 found that exposure to arsenic in tap water during early childhood may result in an increase in childhood liver cancer mortality in northern chile despite the fact that the quality of tap water has improved considerably in recent years 6 the chilean population still has concerns about water quality and its potential impact on their health this fact has resulted in a sustained increase in the consumption of bottled water for drinking purposes by chilean households 7 and a variety of home based practices to process tap water although the general perception of chileans that bottled water is of better quality than tap water there are some studies that invalidate this claim for example 8 found that unlike tap water only 10 of bottled water marketed in chile have the adequate concentration of fluoride and thus the potential to prevent cavities similarly 9 found that some chilean bottled waters do not comply with national drinkable water regulations all this evidence together with the fact that the price of bottled water is 140 times higher than the price of tap water based on our calculations reflects that consumer preferences for other water characteristics might be more important than price 10 this leads us to make the following research questions what are the characteristics of drinking water that individuals value the most what is the willingness to pay wtp for these characteristics and what kind of observed or unobserved differences across individuals might drive the results by answering these questions our work contributes to three strands of the literature on the demand of drinking water first we focus on the city of antofagasta in northern chile this city it is located in the hyper arid atacama desert where water is scarce and more expensive than the national average 11 moreover this city has been involved in a process known as perceptual scarcity 12 this concept means that residents still have a strong aversion to drinking tap water that ultimately leads to an increased consumption of bottled water even though tap water is more accessible safer and cheaper and the amount of investment in local infrastructure has increased 13 thus one of the goals of this study aims to understand the incidence of perceptual scarcity in antofagasta by eliciting willingness of residents to pay for drinking water features second we use a stated preference data with the following experimental attributes for drinking water 1 price 2 the organoleptic characteristics of water 3 information about the chemical composition and origin of water and 4 the taste of water by distinguishing between tap or bottled water to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that has attempted to identify valuation of the attributes of drinking water in chile using a discrete choice method for non market valuation previous studies have focused on perceptions of stakeholders 14 and consumers 12 15 and integrated management of water resources 16 finally we also provide an extension of the wtp space model 17 by including not only unobserved heterogeneity but also observed heterogeneity in wtp metrics due to individuals characteristics such as age gender geographical location and trust in local water provider to do so we allow the wtp distributions to be a mixture of gaussian distributions with mixture weights that are assumed to follow a discrete latent class distribution and that depend on individual specific covariates this mixture based formulation is flexible enough to identify clusters of consumers with differing willingness to pay for water attributes although this formulation has been used in preference space models 18 21 to the best of our knowledge this is the first article to present this extension in the context of wtp space from a policy point of view understanding consumer preferences for water attributes is essential if the goal is to promote the consumption of tap water for drinking and reduce the negative environmental and socioeconomic issues related to the bottled water industry 22 for example water supply companies can improve their position respect to the bottled water industry by knowing the perceptions impressions and feelings that consumers have on the main characteristics of water if there exists a generalized feeling that tap water tastes bad then households might be willing to pay more if the tap water were more tasteless similarly if individuals have a greater preference for bottled water that offers information regarding its chemical composition through labeling then local companies could develop campaigns to inform the population about the levels of chemical compounds in tap water 2 background non market valuation studies using discrete choice experiments have been applied to various subjects including natural resources 23 27 in choice experiments participants are presented with a series of hypothetical scenarios with a discrete number of alternatives characterized by attribute levels that are controlled according to an experimental design that is usually orthogonal econometric choice models are then used to model the tradeoffs elicited by the stated choices that can be then translated into metrics such as willingness to pay wtp for marginal improvements if the attributes of the good or service of interest it is expected that participants of the experiment will choose the alternative with greatest utility consumers are assumed to be utility maximizers however the association between a given alternative and its utility may vary across individuals due to differences in personal preferences see for example 24 25 28 29 thus it is important to consider the factors that contribute to both observed and unobserved heterogeneity in preferences to improve inference on economic valuation of attributes or features for instance a low overall wtp for an attribute does not necessarily mean that this attribute is not highly valued by some people it can mean that there is high heterogeneity in how the population values that attribute in the empirical literature various authors propose factors that could affect individual preferences for drinking water for example 30 identifies three endogenous factors in consumer choice of water 1 taste preferences and perception 2 fear about tap water quality and 3 convenience portability reliability and accessibility for example some consumers prefer tap water because of the inconvenience of transporting bottled water 31 32 state that some preferences are related to psychological factors e g the desire to conform to social norms or the desire to protect the environment in some social circles drinking bottled water is a signal of social status in other circles people drink tap water as a way of expressing their environmental concerns see refs 13 33 therefore to derive wtp estimates for the different attributes of water and to recover preference heterogeneity we will use discrete choice models in wtp space as proposed by refs 17 34 which allow us to derive wtp metrics directly by re parameterizing the original preference space 35 state that the wtp space approach fits the data better reduces the incidence of very high values in wtp estimates and provides greater control in wtp specification and testing since it allows direct specification of the wtp heterogeneity distributions avoiding the choice of arbitrary distributions originating from the quotient between non monetary and monetary parameters 36 in fact according to the results of 37 wtp space specifications provide a parsimonious solution that fits the data well and give plausible results in the analyses of preferences for tap water in italy along the same lines the results of 38 indicated that wtp space models can help to accurately predict household level wtp for select improvements in drinking water access and services in ethiopia 3 case study the city of antofagasta the city of antofagasta has a population of more than 360 000 residents being one of the largest urban agglomerations in the north of chile with a significant itinerant population related to the mining industry 39 40 its urban area has a high degree of socio spatial segregation 41 with dynamic levels of internal and foreign migration 42 in terms of geography antofagasta is located in the hyper arid atacama desert one of the driest places on earth that receives less than 2 mm yr of precipitation 11 43 44 these characteristics makes the city of antofagasta to face great challenges such as water shortage contamination and the lack of water for domestic industrial irrigation and other uses 16 in terms of economic activity the city is located in a geographical area dominated by mining extraction activities the mining boom of the 1990s brought significant foreign direct investment to the area resulting in a major expansion of the cooper industry 12 in fact one of the most important copper producing firm with the largest open pit mine in the world 45 operates in the area these copper producing firms and other extractive industries have become important users of water in the upper basin and the coastal city of antofagasta the increased use of water by the extractive industries together with uncontrolled urban expansion has led to the antofagasta region to a state of water scarcity 46 47 for example bottled water sales in antofagasta have doubled compared to the city of santiago the capital city of chile moreover antofagasta presents the highest prices for drinking water in the country the price for cubic meter in antofagasta is 2550 clp m3 3 25 usd m3 which is 100 higher than in santiago 1280 clp m3 1 63 usd m3 and 50 more expensive than in other cities in the same region such as calama 1685 clp m3 2 15 usd m3 48 water in the city of antofagasta is supplied by the private company aguas antofagasta 1 1 aguas antofagasta is a subsidiary of the epm group grupo epm de colombia owned by the municipality of medellin is a company with operations in chile providing drinking water and wastewater management which has invested intensively in infrastructure ponds and in the improvement and increase of drinking water and sewerage networks among other projects 49 these investments have resulted in antofagasta being the first city in chile to receive desalinated drinking water the first desalination plant built in 2003 supplies 70 of the population a second plant was constructed in february 2013 thus antofagasta is expected to become the first urban center in latin america and one of only ten cities in the world to be supplied with 100 desalinated water although investments in desalination plants reflect the concern for an ecological and stable supply this does not mean that residents of the city necessarily trust desalinated water to be safe for consumption 12 described a mistrust of the local water provider due to past experiences in fact after the incorporation of the toconce and holajar rivers as drinking water sources in 1958 the whole population was exposed to arsenic concentrations up to 17 times more than the level recommended by world health organization 50 a high incidence of lung cancer bladder cancer and white spots on the skin have been associated with this exposure to highe levels of arsenic in the water 50 resulting in the so called phantom of arsenic phenomenon it was not until 1971 when the first water treatment plants were installed that arsenic concentrations began to drop 51 moreover 12 found that the residents of la chimba a sector of antofagasta supplied with 100 desalinated water distrust their tap water and consume bottled water instead although desalinated drinking water does not contain arsenic many of the region s inhabitants declare that they are unaware of this fact the authors point out that much of this mistrust comes from traumatic experiences in the past 4 experimental design the instrument consisted of two clearly differentiated sections the first section of the survey was designed to collect information on socio demographics at the respondent level such as age income and gender the second section of the survey asked the respondent to choose between two types of drinking water based on paired descriptions on a choice card fig 1 the experiment was designed as a binary choice without an opt out alternative to recognize water as an essential good and to avoid confusion by respondents in the local context each choice card depicted two unlabeled water alternatives each with five attributes water attributes were combined according to a bayesian efficient design 52 using as priors parameters from a pilot collected before the full launch of this study the experimental attributes and their levels are summarized in table 1 the experimental design resulted in 12 choice situations with a d error of 0 3063 and an s estimate of 234 which provides a lower bound of the required sample size for good statistical properties of the point estimates of the choice model supporting the target sample size of n 300 before starting the interview the interviewer explained the variables to the respondents showed them a choice card and asked if you were to choose between these two types of drinking water which alternative do you prefer the process was repeated ten times with different choice cards representing ten choice situations and yielding a pseudo panel dataset this number of choice situations was chosen based on the resulting metrics of the d efficient design in what follows we explain how we decided on the attributes and their level for the choice experiment according to the who drinking water must be clean and safe colorless odorless tasteless free from suspension elements and must not contain pathogenic microorganisms the importance of these characteristics known as organoleptic properties has been corroborated in several studies 53 55 for example in a survey of domestic consumption of water in the state of maryland in the usa 34 of respondents declared that esthetic factors color flavor and smell were important 56 in chile the importance of organoleptic attributes is reflected in the standards for drinking water nch 409 1 57 which ensure that all drinking water meets the established physical chemical bacteriological and disinfection requirements 2 2 to meet these standards drinking water must be constantly analyzed in established laboratories 75 in the context of antofagasta measuring these attributes are especially relevant according to ref 49 the tap water from its local networks meets the standards established to keep water free of undesirable elements such as arsenic iron escherichia coli bacteria coliform bacteria and turbidity nevertheless as mentioned before 12 found a general distrust of tap water in la chimba a sector of the city supplied by desalinated water although the majority of respondents rated the organoleptic properties of tap water as acceptable they did not trust it to be safe when assessing the overall quality of tap water only 20 said they were satisfied whereas 80 of the respondents in the study consumed bottled water instead in this context the already defined perceptive scarcity is relevant since most of those respondents spent a considerable part of their monthly budget on bottled water this may have been due to marketing efforts on the part of the bottled water companies 58 59 and or the fact that some distribution networks are not up to date altering the quality of tap drinking water between its point of origin to the point of consumption 60 the levels of the smell and color variables were derived from the results of the drinking water quality indices for the domestic tap network 61 64 assuming that the bottled water circulating in the city of antofagasta has similar or higher quality drinking water should not fluctuate beyond the levels detailed in table 1 because the perception of taste is highly idiosyncratic 65 and the strong preference for bottled water in the chilean population 7 12 we decided to study the perception of water taste among three types of water providers in the local context namely water bottled by a non local brand water bottled by a local brand and tap water from the municipal network in chile the regulations for bottled and tap water are different tap water is subject to regulation nch409 1 which sets the standards and requires constant monitoring of water quality bottled water is subject to regulation n 106 1997 ds106 of the chilean ministry of health 66 which provides the guidelines for the classification of mineral waters indicates the parameters that must be monitored and establishes concentration limits for 17 chemical elements however it does not require that the chemical composition of bottled water be printed on the bottle label to make an informed judgment about the source of their drinking water consumers must have access to information about its chemical composition and know how to interpret it presently this information is not always available for example 9 analyzed various brands of bottled water and concluded that there are some brands that meet the criteria of the bottled water regulation ds106 but do not meet the nch409 1 standards the levels for labelling information are detailed in table 3 according to ref 31 bottled water is 500 to 1000 times more expensive than tap water in the city of antofagasta drinking water can be grouped into three categories by price water bottled by a national brand water bottled by a local brand at the regional level and tap water from the municipal network the prices of these categories were extracted from various sources detailed in table 4 including the chilean national statistical institute for the price of bottled water 67 the chilean national consumer service for the price of drum water 7 aguas antofagasta 49 64 the prices for local bottled and tap water are based on the local criteria of the city of antofagasta prices for bottled water distributed by a national brand are set nationally in addition drinking water is considered at its standard market price without including any circumstance or format that could make it more expensive 5 econometric modeling approach we assume that the utility function of individual i extracted from choosing drinking water j in choice situation t is given by u i j t α i p i j t x i j t β i ε i j t where p i j t is the price variable x i j t is a k x 1 vector of drinking water attributes and the parameters α i and β i are the individual specific preference parameters we also assume that the error term ε i j t is type 1 extreme value distributed with a variance given by μ i 2 π 2 6 where μ i is an individual specific scale parameter dividing the previous equation by μ i does not affect the behavioral specification and results in a new error term which is iid extreme value distributed with variance equal to π 2 6 u i j t λ i p i j t x i j t c i ε i j t where c i β i μ i and λ i α i μ i 17 call this specification the model in preference space since the scale parameter μ i appears in the denominator of c i and λ i both expressions are uncorrelated unless the scale parameter does not vary with the individual thus specifying the parameters to be independent implies that the error term is homoscedastic since the willingness to pay wtp for a particular attribute is given by γ i c i λ i one can also recast the utility function and obtain the so called wtp space model as follows 17 u i j t λ i p i j t x i j t γ i ε i j t the main advantage of the wtp space model is that it allows us to calculate wtp directly by re parameterizing the utility model furthermore it allows us to choose the wtp heterogeneity distribution γ i c i λ i directly instead of choosing independent distributions for c i and λ i as explained by ref 68 distributional assumptions in preference space can lead to unusual distributions for wtp with undefined moments for example assuming that both c i and λ i are normally distributed implies that γ i is a ratio of two normal which does not have defined moments further benefits of the wtp space approach have been discussed earlier in this paper as a methodological contribution we estimate a mixed mixed multinomial logit mm mnl model in wtp space that allows for both observed and unobserved heterogeneity using a gaussian mixture with q components specifically we assume that there exist q 1 q classes or segments of individuals such that individuals belonging to the same class share similar preferences and have their own set of characteristics thus the wtp parameters in each class are distributed as γ i m v n γ q σ q with probability w i q for q 1 q such that q w i q 1 and w i q 0 heterogenous wtps are then represented as a weighted average of normals with the following mixture distribution 69 g γ i q 1 q w i q m v n γ q σ q since q w i q 1 g γ i is a convex combination of m v n γ q σ q and preserves both the non negative and integration to 1 property and thus g γ i is a well defined probability density function the probability assignment for each individual and class is modelled assuming a semi parametric multinomial distribution of the form w i q e x p h i λ q c 1 q e x p h i λ q where h i is a set of observable individuals characteristics as typical with multinomial specifications we assume that λ 1 0 this class allocation formulation allows us to probabilistically allocate respondents to different classes depending on their socio demographic characteristics this adds more realisms to the modeling approach by allowing a discrete and both observed and unobserved sorting of individuals into classes groups each of which has its own set of characteristics assuming that the wtps are distributed by a mixture of normal distributions allows for two layers of heterogeneity first since the parameters are distributed multivariate normally for each q 1 q we allow for unobserved heterogeneity in tastes within each class second as the probabilities of belonging to each class depends on individuals characteristics we can also explore and explain why wtps vary across segments of respondents the coefficients in the wtp space models are estimated using the maximum simulated likelihood msl estimator and the gmnl package in r 70 in particular it is assumed that the price coefficient is fixed at 1 whereas λ i is assumed to be log normal distributed 6 data collection the study was designed as a face to face survey in the city of antofagasta with data collection carried out by trained enumerators between january and february of 2020 the survey was applied to the entire city of antofagasta which has an established drinking water network the city was divided into quintiles by the average fiscal value of its blocks see fig 2 this division was necessary due to the high socio spatial segregation in antofagasta 41 in this way it was possible to obtain a random and representative sample of the statistically homogeneous socio spatial sectors the survey was designed to obtain preferences at the family level with a sample of n 300 the surveys carried out on each quintile are proportional to the number of households in each identified quintile see table 5 for socio demographic information of the sample 7 results 7 1 sample characteristics table 5 shows that the average age of the respondents is 39 years 61 7 of the respondents are head of household and 69 are employed on average the respondents have 13 years of schooling 28 3 have completed secondary education 12 years of formal instruction and 19 have completed professional education the average family income is about 931 343 clp equivalent to 1 187 2 usd the proportion of married and single respondents is fairly balanced 45 and 44 respectively table 6 presents the average values declared by the respondents with a likert scale from 1 to 5 for each set of dimensions water characteristics trust in water sources and consumption from various sources cronbach s α for the three groups are acceptable for the dimension importance of attributes the respondents were asked to assign a value to the attributes they consider most important on a scale of 1 5 where 5 is highly important on average respondents considered flavor and price to be the most important attributes in line with recent findings of 15 71 information about the chemical composition and the origin of the water were much less valuable by the respondents on average this is not surprising given that 67 7 of the respondents stated that they were not able to interpret labels with chemical and nutritional information see table 5 trust of drinking water sources was captured using the same likert scale on average respondents trust in tap water has the lowest value with an average of 2 7 whereas respondents place a higher trust in bottled water with an average of 3 74 these results agree with those shown in table 5 where 76 3 declare that tap water contains some harmful chemical and 70 3 state that tap water contains arsenic it is interesting that only 40 of those surveyed stated that they have a full knowledge about the origin of the water that supplies their home consumption of the three types of water was also registered using a likert scale where 1 is never consumed from this source and 5 is always consumed tap water consumption has the lowest value possibly reflecting average low confidence in this source both drum water and bottled water consumption have similar average values 7 2 willingness to pay assuming homogeneous preferences in this section we present our benchmark estimates for the willingness to pay wtp using dummy variables for the attribute levels columns 1 and 2 of table 7 present the wtp point estimates γ and standard errors respectively using the standard conditional logit model mnl which assumes that wtp and hence preferences for the full set of attributes are homogeneous fixed wtp model since the model is estimated in wtp space rather than preference space the point estimates are interpreted as the average wtp across respondents for each attribute 3 3 specifically we estimated a mnl model including price as an independent variable after parameter estimation via ml we computed the wtp for each attribute as the negative of the ratio between the coefficient for that attribute and price s coefficient the standard errors were computed using the delta method a negative value implies that people dislike that attribute whereas a positive value indicates that people like that characteristic so that they are willing to pay for a marginal improvement in that attribute since price was divided by 100 to avoid numerical issues during optimization the estimates are in clp 100 per liter in general the wtp estimates seem reasonable with respect to the degree of labeling information we observe that on average people prefer to have full information about water s origin and chemical nutritional composition rather than no information and they are willing to pay 497 clp l 0 63 usd l for that information ceteris paribus the remainder wtp estimates for levels of information just origin or chemical nutritional composition are not statistically significant revealing that these attributes have an average marginal utility close to zero this result although it seems to be counterintuitive can be explained by the fact that people in the sample might have very heterogeneous preferences for example if the share of individuals in the population with positive and negative wtp is similar then the preferences tend to offset each other resulting in an average wtp close to zero we explore this potential explanation in the following subsection in terms of organoleptic attributes 4 4 all the organoleptic variables are detailed in table 2 individuals in the sample have stronger preferences for absence of turbidity than absence of odor on average individuals are willing to pay 799 clp l 1 02 usd l to drink water without excessive turbidity turbidity in water lower than 5 u pt co but only about 337 clp l 0 43 usd l for water that is odorless finally people prefer the taste of water bottled by a local or national brand over the taste of tap water on average individuals are willing to pay 815 clp l 1 04 usd l for national bottled water and about 807 clp l 1 03 usd l for local bottled water to assess whether the differences between preferences for the local versus the national brand are statistically significant we performed a χ 2 test under the null hypothesis that h 0 γ n a t i o n a l γ l o c a l the statistic is 0 0054 with one degree of freedom rejecting the null thus we can assert that there are no significant differences in preferences between water from a local or national brand these preliminary results are in line with previous studies see for example 12 30 37 in qualitative terms people do care about the quality of the water they drink individuals have strong preferences for bottled water vs tap water ceteris paribus because they believe that bottled water is safer and healthier this is an expected result due to the bad reputation of tap water in antofagasta city since the 1970s people also care about organoleptic characteristics such absence of turbidity and odor they also value information about the origin and chemical properties of water though not as much as the rest of attributes the magnitude of the estimated wtp for local and national brands are in line with the actual value of bottled water in the local market for example the average price of a bottled water of 1 6 l is about 1 000 clp 1 27 usd or about 625 clp 0 80 usd per liter 67 which is slightly lower than our estimates 7 3 willingness to pay assuming uncorrelated heterogeneous preferences one of the main drawbacks of previous estimates is that they assume that individual preferences for water characteristics are the same which can be very restrictive since there exist psychological social among others factors that can influence the choice of drinking water 30 32 for example our previous estimates show that there is not enough statistical evidence to argue that the marginal utility of having information about the chemical and nutritional composition of water is greater than not having any type of information however this result may be biased and obscured by the unobserved heterogeneity of individual preferences to relax this restriction we assume that people s preferences are heterogeneous so that the wtp parameters are distributed following a continuous distribution γ i f whereas the price coefficient is log normally distributed such that λ i exp λ τ υ i where υ t n 2 2 columns 3 and 4 of table 7 show the point estimates and standard errors for the wtp space model assuming that the wtps for all the non price attributes are independent and normally distributed specifically the coefficients can be written as γ i k γ k σ k υ i k where γ k is the mean of wtp for attribute k σ k is the standard deviation and υ i k is an independent standard normal deviate for each wtp the mean and standard deviation of the distribution are estimated the model and all those that follow were estimated by maximum simulated likelihood msl using 300 halton draws in terms of fit the log likelihood ll is considerably lower than that for the model assuming homogeneous preferences 1 754 vs 1 937 similarly both measures of information the akaike information criterion aic and the bayesian information criterion bic are lower implying that the explanatory power of the model with random wtp is considerably greater than that of the model with fixed wtp the mean parameters for the wtp metrics are reduced by almost half compared to the model with fixed parameters note also that the average wtp metrics are estimated more precisely by allowing for unobserved heterogeneity according to the new estimates individuals are willing to pay 410 and 329 clp l 0 42 usd l for national and local brands of drinking water respectively holding everything else constant the qualitative results for the rest of the average wtps remain the same as in the fixed parameter model regarding unobserved preference heterogeneity most of the standard deviations are statistically significant indicating that wtp parameters do vary in the population with the exception of the valuation for the taste of water to formally test whether the standard deviations of wtp increase the fit of the model we conducted a likelihood ratio lr test comparing the model with normally distributed wtp against the fixed wtp model the lr statistic is χ 2 3667 with 8 of freedom so we reject the null that all standard deviations are jointly zero using the standard deviation of the parameters we can plot the unconditional wtp heterogeneity distribution for each attribute 5 5 the unconditional distribution was computed using 100 000 draws from the estimated distribution fig 3 a shows the distribution for labeling and information characteristics it can be observed that there is substantial heterogeneity in the wtp for information about the origin and chemical nutritional information of water using the point estimates we can also compute the share of individuals in the population with a positive wtp as φ β ˆ k σ ˆ k column 5 of table 7 shows that 48 of the population values having information about the origin of drinking water this share increases to 71 for having chemical nutritional information note that the fixed wtp model disguised this remarkable variation in preferences the mean wtp for full information is greater but its distribution also shows a high level of heterogeneity whereas the mean wtp is 291 clp l 0 37 usd l some individuals are willing to pay up to 1 000 clp l 1 27 usd l again using mean and standard deviation we find that 89 of the population is willing to pay for full information with a share around 18 willing to pay more than 500 clp l 0 64 usd l for this information fig 3b plots the unconditional wtp heterogeneity distribution for organoleptic attributes we can observe that most of the individuals have a negative wtp for turbidity and odor however preferences are more heterogeneous for turbidity although most individuals feel they should be compensated for drinking water with some degree of turbidity about 85 of the population the variance is high resulting in a heavy tailed distribution the wtp distribution for the taste of water national vs local brand reveals that people show much less heterogeneity in preferences 100 of the individuals prefer the taste of bottled water over tap water in addition the null variability for the wtp for local brand bottled water confirms that the residents of antofagasta have strong preferences for this particular source of drinking water see for example 7 72 73 7 4 willingness to pay assuming correlated heterogeneous preferences the previous model assumes that tastes are uncorrelated however we might expect some degree of correlation across preferences and hence wtp 17 to allow for correlation we assume that wtp is distributed according to a multivariate normal distribution γ i m v n γ σ instead of estimating the full variance covariance matrix σ we rather estimate the lower triangular cholesky factor l such that l l σ columns 6 7 and 8 show the results for the correlated random wtp model the standard deviations of the parameters were obtained using d i a g σ 1 2 and their standard errors were computed using the delta method in terms of relative quality of the correlated wtp model it can be observed that the aic measure is lower than in previous models whereas the bic measure is slightly higher than in the uncorrelated wtp model this result was also found by refs 17 34 and 37 in terms of the estimated wtp means these have expected signs with magnitudes slightly higher than those from the uncorrelated model but lower than those of the fixed wtp model the model is concordant in suggesting that the absence of turbidity is the most valuable attribute for individuals with an average wtp of 679 clp l 0 87 usd l this is followed by the taste of water bottled from a national brand table 8 gives the point estimates for the correlation matrix which are derived from the cholesky factors overall the wtp parameters are highly correlated for instance the wtp for turbidity is positively correlated with odor implying that people with strong preferences for water without turbidity are also likely to have strong preferences for odorless water similarly the wtp for full information has a positive correlation of 0 612 with national bottled water suggesting that those who have high wtp for full information also have high wtp for national bottled water 7 5 willingness to pay using a double mixture model so far our results indicate that there exists substantial unobserved heterogeneity in terms of wtp among individuals however we have not explained the sources of this heterogeneity in preferences in this section we allow for observed heterogeneity using our mm mnl model in wtp space table 9 present the results using two mm mnl models in wtp space columns 1 6 present the estimates omitting any socio economic covariates as a determinant of the weights of the gaussian mixture columns 7 12 display the estimates using as covariates the following individual specific variables whether the individual trusts the local provider of tap water age of the respondent whether the individual understands nutrition labelling gender whether the respondent is the household head and a set of geographical dummy variables representing the real estate valuation of the zone see fig 2 both models are estimated assuming two mixture components q 2 models with higher number of components resulted in singularities of the hessian matrix for model 1 the first component represents around 45 of the population whereas the second component represents the remaining 55 individuals belonging to the first component or class are characterized by having positive and significant wtp for information regarding the chemical composition and origin of the water this result contrasts with findings for individuals belonging to component or class two according to column 4 the wtp for this same characteristic is not statistically significant in terms of turbidity and odorlessness it is observed that both characteristics are more valued by individuals in class 2 in both cases the mean point estimates are approximately 5 times more negative in class two than in class one another important finding is the substantial amount that class two is willing to pay for local and national brands to avoid the taste of tap water accordingly individuals in class two are on average willing to pay 1 962 clp l for national bottled water and about 1 765 clp l for local bottled water whereas these amounts are 1 002 clp l and 1 140 clp l for class one respectively in terms of unobserved preference heterogeneity class two shows the largest degree of variability in wtp as revealed by the higher standard deviations compared to those in class one model 2 explicitly accounts for observed preference heterogeneity by modeling the class assignment probability as a function of individual specific covariates the estimated parameters for these variables indicate that younger women that distrust the local water provider understand chemical labelling live in relative wealthy sectors of the city and are the head of the household are more likely to belong to class two 45 of the sample these results support that including observed heterogeneity entails a reclassification of individuals from class two in model 1 to class one as for the wtp parameters we observe that the first class presents both lower means and standard deviations furthermore the results agree with the segmentation provided by the observed individual specific covariates for example note that individuals that understand nutritional chemical labelling are more likely to belong to class two this is in line with the fact that the average wtp for both origin and chemical information is higher in class two than in class one similarly class two is composed of individuals that do not trust the local water provider and hence are on average willing to pay more to avoid the taste of tap water than class one to shed some light in the variability and segmentation of the wtps for local and national brands in fig 4 we plot the implied unconditional estimates for both classes fig 4a shows that indeed class one has a lower average wtp for national brand and lower preference heterogeneity whereas respondents in class two are willing to pay a higher premium but the degree of unobserved heterogeneity is higher fig 4b presents a similar pattern the average wtp for the taste of water from a local brand is approximately 189 clp l for those individuals in class one whereas about 98 of the individuals in class two is willing to pay between 400 and 800 clp l more to drink water with similar taste to some local brand 8 discussion and conclusions one of the main issues in terms of water quality and scarcity in antofagasta is the perceptual scarcity hypothesis this social process occurs when the water distribution networks are well constituted but there is a perception that bottled water is safer 74 although local water suppliers and desalination programs in the city of antofagasta 14 comply nch409 1 and nch409 2 potability standards 57 75 there seems to be a local mistrust and negative perceptions towards urban drinking water which has persisted since 1971 12 76 the preliminary results of our study agree with the presence of perceptual scarcity considering that the average price of a 20 l drum of water is 1 983 cpl 2 53 usd twice the price of 20 l of tap water we show that drum water is preferred over tap water 76 of the sample vs 13 3 respectively even though tap water is both less expensive and more accessible to the citizenship regarding bottled water respondents state that only 10 7 use this type of water as their main source for drinking these results are in line with those findings for us 77 and spain 78 which show a similar pattern across consumers moreover most of those surveyed are convinced that drinking water from the tap has some harmful chemicals 76 3 or arsenic 70 3 we posit that this rejection to drink tap water is partially due to three reasons first arsenic has historically been present in the water supply of the region see for example 47 79 80 secondly arsenic is one of the main risk factors in bladder cancer 81 and lung cancer 82 finally the mining context of the region is a factor that exacerbates mistrust 47 copper extraction requires large amounts of water resources which are already scarce in the region 83 84 in addition mining extraction generates chemical substances that might affect water reserves however almost the entire city of antofagasta is supplied by desalination plants 14 a process that results in a low content of chlorides and arsenic 85 according to our wtp point estimates respondents are willing to pay on average 497 clp l for knowing the origin and chemical nutritional composition of water 799 clp l for drinking water without excessive turbidity and 337 clp l for odorless water in terms of type of water and as expected respondents wtp for drum and bottled water flavor is high compared to tap water individuals are willing to pay 815 clp l and about 807 clp l more for the taste of drum and bottled water respectively over the average price of tap water since both wtps are not statistically different we argue that individuals do not perceive a difference in taste between both types of water these results agree with those reached by ref 30 who also found a considerable demand for bottled water in spite of the availability of tap water that meets quality criteria it should be added that bottled water is not always the healthiest option 32 in chile the criteria and parameters that govern bottled water are different from those that govern tap water for instance ref 9 performed an exhaustive analysis of the chemical composition of bottled water in the chilean market and found variations in chemical compositions ph hardness and mineralization levels between brands all the water samples they analyzed have values that meet the parameters established in the bottled water regulations ds106 however some brands of bottled water would not be suitable for drinking consumption under the nch409 1 standards for tap water arsenic is sometimes found in bottled water in concentrations that exceed the limits of the nch409 1 standard nonetheless in general consumers still tend to associate bottled water with a healthy lifestyle 13 described this disconnect between testing results and consumer preferences as a paradox the results of the models with unobserved preference heterogeneity reveal substantial variation in the valuation of the information displayed on labels and organoleptic attributes along with a marked homogeneity and high wtp for the taste of bottled and drum water however our proposed mixture based formulation shows that a significant amount of unobserved individual heterogeneity represented by continuous distributions can be explained by classes of individuals with similar socio demographic characteristics for example our results provide evidence of two classes of groups of individuals with clearly different tastes for water attributes the first class which corresponds to 55 of the sample shows lower average wtp for water s attributes than that of the second class in terms of heterogeneity we observe a higher degree of variability in the second class for most of the attributes these results agree with the segmentation provided by the observed individual specific covariates for instance individuals that understand nutritional chemical labelling are more likely to belong to class two this is in line with the fact that the average wtp for both origin and chemical information is higher in class two than that in class one similarly class two is composed of younger individuals that do not trust the local water provider and hence are on average willing to pay more to avoid the taste of tap water this last finding confirms that there exists an important share of individuals in antofagasta about 45 of the sample whose preferences for tap water are considerably low due to the bad reputation of the local provider reinforcing the hypothesis of perceptual scarcity these results also highlight the importance of modeling flexible preferences using wtp space models that incorporate both unobserved and observed preference heterogeneity by combining the random parameter and latent class approach given that the experimental survey was based on hypothetical questions our conclusions must be understood within a hypothetical framework however we are confident that the results could be used as input for future water resources management plans intended to increase tap water consumption which are essential for the region to maintain a sustainable environment 16 for example education related to water parameters and distrust of tap water were detected as relevant characteristics in our study therefore both public and private policies could be generated to disseminate information regarding the quality of tap water and thus improve consumer confidence this would also help to reduce information asymmetry about quality that exists between consumers and suppliers of drinking water and hence improve efficiency given that our study also shows that there are groups of individuals with specific characteristics policies focused on age specific groups could also be

8650,this article uses a discrete choice experiment carried out in the city of antofagasta chile to understand consumer s preferences for urban drinking water to disentangle the perceptions and valuation of drinking water attributes we propose a willingness to pay wtp space model where the wtps for water attributes are distributed as a mixture of normal distribution this approach combines discrete and continuous heterogeneity representations of tastes providing a richer interpretation of preference heterogeneity for drinking water characteristics such as price the organoleptic characteristics information about the chemical composition origin and the taste of water by distinguishing between tap or bottled water this mixture based formulation is also flexible enough to identify clusters of individuals with differing wtp for these attributes the elicited perceptions and inferred preferences derived from our results are important to understand why consumers still distrust tap water for drinking though tap water meets chilean regulations in terms of safety and is distributed within a stable network keywords water demand tap water willingness to pay discrete choice model wtp space mixture distribution choice experiment chile 1 introduction access to safe domestic drinking water is fundamental for the health of individuals 1 in chile whereas provision of tap water has increased its quality and taste have been one of the main concerns of local water suppliers for many years some empirical studies carried out in chile suggest that having drunk tap water in previous decades could lead to health problems in the present due to a high concentration or arsenic and boron 2 3 specifically 4 found that exposure to high levels of arsenic in tap water during 1958 1970 might be related to an increase in the risk of lung and bladder cancer up to 40 years after whereas 5 found that exposure to arsenic in tap water during early childhood may result in an increase in childhood liver cancer mortality in northern chile despite the fact that the quality of tap water has improved considerably in recent years 6 the chilean population still has concerns about water quality and its potential impact on their health this fact has resulted in a sustained increase in the consumption of bottled water for drinking purposes by chilean households 7 and a variety of home based practices to process tap water although the general perception of chileans that bottled water is of better quality than tap water there are some studies that invalidate this claim for example 8 found that unlike tap water only 10 of bottled water marketed in chile have the adequate concentration of fluoride and thus the potential to prevent cavities similarly 9 found that some chilean bottled waters do not comply with national drinkable water regulations all this evidence together with the fact that the price of bottled water is 140 times higher than the price of tap water based on our calculations reflects that consumer preferences for other water characteristics might be more important than price 10 this leads us to make the following research questions what are the characteristics of drinking water that individuals value the most what is the willingness to pay wtp for these characteristics and what kind of observed or unobserved differences across individuals might drive the results by answering these questions our work contributes to three strands of the literature on the demand of drinking water first we focus on the city of antofagasta in northern chile this city it is located in the hyper arid atacama desert where water is scarce and more expensive than the national average 11 moreover this city has been involved in a process known as perceptual scarcity 12 this concept means that residents still have a strong aversion to drinking tap water that ultimately leads to an increased consumption of bottled water even though tap water is more accessible safer and cheaper and the amount of investment in local infrastructure has increased 13 thus one of the goals of this study aims to understand the incidence of perceptual scarcity in antofagasta by eliciting willingness of residents to pay for drinking water features second we use a stated preference data with the following experimental attributes for drinking water 1 price 2 the organoleptic characteristics of water 3 information about the chemical composition and origin of water and 4 the taste of water by distinguishing between tap or bottled water to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that has attempted to identify valuation of the attributes of drinking water in chile using a discrete choice method for non market valuation previous studies have focused on perceptions of stakeholders 14 and consumers 12 15 and integrated management of water resources 16 finally we also provide an extension of the wtp space model 17 by including not only unobserved heterogeneity but also observed heterogeneity in wtp metrics due to individuals characteristics such as age gender geographical location and trust in local water provider to do so we allow the wtp distributions to be a mixture of gaussian distributions with mixture weights that are assumed to follow a discrete latent class distribution and that depend on individual specific covariates this mixture based formulation is flexible enough to identify clusters of consumers with differing willingness to pay for water attributes although this formulation has been used in preference space models 18 21 to the best of our knowledge this is the first article to present this extension in the context of wtp space from a policy point of view understanding consumer preferences for water attributes is essential if the goal is to promote the consumption of tap water for drinking and reduce the negative environmental and socioeconomic issues related to the bottled water industry 22 for example water supply companies can improve their position respect to the bottled water industry by knowing the perceptions impressions and feelings that consumers have on the main characteristics of water if there exists a generalized feeling that tap water tastes bad then households might be willing to pay more if the tap water were more tasteless similarly if individuals have a greater preference for bottled water that offers information regarding its chemical composition through labeling then local companies could develop campaigns to inform the population about the levels of chemical compounds in tap water 2 background non market valuation studies using discrete choice experiments have been applied to various subjects including natural resources 23 27 in choice experiments participants are presented with a series of hypothetical scenarios with a discrete number of alternatives characterized by attribute levels that are controlled according to an experimental design that is usually orthogonal econometric choice models are then used to model the tradeoffs elicited by the stated choices that can be then translated into metrics such as willingness to pay wtp for marginal improvements if the attributes of the good or service of interest it is expected that participants of the experiment will choose the alternative with greatest utility consumers are assumed to be utility maximizers however the association between a given alternative and its utility may vary across individuals due to differences in personal preferences see for example 24 25 28 29 thus it is important to consider the factors that contribute to both observed and unobserved heterogeneity in preferences to improve inference on economic valuation of attributes or features for instance a low overall wtp for an attribute does not necessarily mean that this attribute is not highly valued by some people it can mean that there is high heterogeneity in how the population values that attribute in the empirical literature various authors propose factors that could affect individual preferences for drinking water for example 30 identifies three endogenous factors in consumer choice of water 1 taste preferences and perception 2 fear about tap water quality and 3 convenience portability reliability and accessibility for example some consumers prefer tap water because of the inconvenience of transporting bottled water 31 32 state that some preferences are related to psychological factors e g the desire to conform to social norms or the desire to protect the environment in some social circles drinking bottled water is a signal of social status in other circles people drink tap water as a way of expressing their environmental concerns see refs 13 33 therefore to derive wtp estimates for the different attributes of water and to recover preference heterogeneity we will use discrete choice models in wtp space as proposed by refs 17 34 which allow us to derive wtp metrics directly by re parameterizing the original preference space 35 state that the wtp space approach fits the data better reduces the incidence of very high values in wtp estimates and provides greater control in wtp specification and testing since it allows direct specification of the wtp heterogeneity distributions avoiding the choice of arbitrary distributions originating from the quotient between non monetary and monetary parameters 36 in fact according to the results of 37 wtp space specifications provide a parsimonious solution that fits the data well and give plausible results in the analyses of preferences for tap water in italy along the same lines the results of 38 indicated that wtp space models can help to accurately predict household level wtp for select improvements in drinking water access and services in ethiopia 3 case study the city of antofagasta the city of antofagasta has a population of more than 360 000 residents being one of the largest urban agglomerations in the north of chile with a significant itinerant population related to the mining industry 39 40 its urban area has a high degree of socio spatial segregation 41 with dynamic levels of internal and foreign migration 42 in terms of geography antofagasta is located in the hyper arid atacama desert one of the driest places on earth that receives less than 2 mm yr of precipitation 11 43 44 these characteristics makes the city of antofagasta to face great challenges such as water shortage contamination and the lack of water for domestic industrial irrigation and other uses 16 in terms of economic activity the city is located in a geographical area dominated by mining extraction activities the mining boom of the 1990s brought significant foreign direct investment to the area resulting in a major expansion of the cooper industry 12 in fact one of the most important copper producing firm with the largest open pit mine in the world 45 operates in the area these copper producing firms and other extractive industries have become important users of water in the upper basin and the coastal city of antofagasta the increased use of water by the extractive industries together with uncontrolled urban expansion has led to the antofagasta region to a state of water scarcity 46 47 for example bottled water sales in antofagasta have doubled compared to the city of santiago the capital city of chile moreover antofagasta presents the highest prices for drinking water in the country the price for cubic meter in antofagasta is 2550 clp m3 3 25 usd m3 which is 100 higher than in santiago 1280 clp m3 1 63 usd m3 and 50 more expensive than in other cities in the same region such as calama 1685 clp m3 2 15 usd m3 48 water in the city of antofagasta is supplied by the private company aguas antofagasta 1 1 aguas antofagasta is a subsidiary of the epm group grupo epm de colombia owned by the municipality of medellin is a company with operations in chile providing drinking water and wastewater management which has invested intensively in infrastructure ponds and in the improvement and increase of drinking water and sewerage networks among other projects 49 these investments have resulted in antofagasta being the first city in chile to receive desalinated drinking water the first desalination plant built in 2003 supplies 70 of the population a second plant was constructed in february 2013 thus antofagasta is expected to become the first urban center in latin america and one of only ten cities in the world to be supplied with 100 desalinated water although investments in desalination plants reflect the concern for an ecological and stable supply this does not mean that residents of the city necessarily trust desalinated water to be safe for consumption 12 described a mistrust of the local water provider due to past experiences in fact after the incorporation of the toconce and holajar rivers as drinking water sources in 1958 the whole population was exposed to arsenic concentrations up to 17 times more than the level recommended by world health organization 50 a high incidence of lung cancer bladder cancer and white spots on the skin have been associated with this exposure to highe levels of arsenic in the water 50 resulting in the so called phantom of arsenic phenomenon it was not until 1971 when the first water treatment plants were installed that arsenic concentrations began to drop 51 moreover 12 found that the residents of la chimba a sector of antofagasta supplied with 100 desalinated water distrust their tap water and consume bottled water instead although desalinated drinking water does not contain arsenic many of the region s inhabitants declare that they are unaware of this fact the authors point out that much of this mistrust comes from traumatic experiences in the past 4 experimental design the instrument consisted of two clearly differentiated sections the first section of the survey was designed to collect information on socio demographics at the respondent level such as age income and gender the second section of the survey asked the respondent to choose between two types of drinking water based on paired descriptions on a choice card fig 1 the experiment was designed as a binary choice without an opt out alternative to recognize water as an essential good and to avoid confusion by respondents in the local context each choice card depicted two unlabeled water alternatives each with five attributes water attributes were combined according to a bayesian efficient design 52 using as priors parameters from a pilot collected before the full launch of this study the experimental attributes and their levels are summarized in table 1 the experimental design resulted in 12 choice situations with a d error of 0 3063 and an s estimate of 234 which provides a lower bound of the required sample size for good statistical properties of the point estimates of the choice model supporting the target sample size of n 300 before starting the interview the interviewer explained the variables to the respondents showed them a choice card and asked if you were to choose between these two types of drinking water which alternative do you prefer the process was repeated ten times with different choice cards representing ten choice situations and yielding a pseudo panel dataset this number of choice situations was chosen based on the resulting metrics of the d efficient design in what follows we explain how we decided on the attributes and their level for the choice experiment according to the who drinking water must be clean and safe colorless odorless tasteless free from suspension elements and must not contain pathogenic microorganisms the importance of these characteristics known as organoleptic properties has been corroborated in several studies 53 55 for example in a survey of domestic consumption of water in the state of maryland in the usa 34 of respondents declared that esthetic factors color flavor and smell were important 56 in chile the importance of organoleptic attributes is reflected in the standards for drinking water nch 409 1 57 which ensure that all drinking water meets the established physical chemical bacteriological and disinfection requirements 2 2 to meet these standards drinking water must be constantly analyzed in established laboratories 75 in the context of antofagasta measuring these attributes are especially relevant according to ref 49 the tap water from its local networks meets the standards established to keep water free of undesirable elements such as arsenic iron escherichia coli bacteria coliform bacteria and turbidity nevertheless as mentioned before 12 found a general distrust of tap water in la chimba a sector of the city supplied by desalinated water although the majority of respondents rated the organoleptic properties of tap water as acceptable they did not trust it to be safe when assessing the overall quality of tap water only 20 said they were satisfied whereas 80 of the respondents in the study consumed bottled water instead in this context the already defined perceptive scarcity is relevant since most of those respondents spent a considerable part of their monthly budget on bottled water this may have been due to marketing efforts on the part of the bottled water companies 58 59 and or the fact that some distribution networks are not up to date altering the quality of tap drinking water between its point of origin to the point of consumption 60 the levels of the smell and color variables were derived from the results of the drinking water quality indices for the domestic tap network 61 64 assuming that the bottled water circulating in the city of antofagasta has similar or higher quality drinking water should not fluctuate beyond the levels detailed in table 1 because the perception of taste is highly idiosyncratic 65 and the strong preference for bottled water in the chilean population 7 12 we decided to study the perception of water taste among three types of water providers in the local context namely water bottled by a non local brand water bottled by a local brand and tap water from the municipal network in chile the regulations for bottled and tap water are different tap water is subject to regulation nch409 1 which sets the standards and requires constant monitoring of water quality bottled water is subject to regulation n 106 1997 ds106 of the chilean ministry of health 66 which provides the guidelines for the classification of mineral waters indicates the parameters that must be monitored and establishes concentration limits for 17 chemical elements however it does not require that the chemical composition of bottled water be printed on the bottle label to make an informed judgment about the source of their drinking water consumers must have access to information about its chemical composition and know how to interpret it presently this information is not always available for example 9 analyzed various brands of bottled water and concluded that there are some brands that meet the criteria of the bottled water regulation ds106 but do not meet the nch409 1 standards the levels for labelling information are detailed in table 3 according to ref 31 bottled water is 500 to 1000 times more expensive than tap water in the city of antofagasta drinking water can be grouped into three categories by price water bottled by a national brand water bottled by a local brand at the regional level and tap water from the municipal network the prices of these categories were extracted from various sources detailed in table 4 including the chilean national statistical institute for the price of bottled water 67 the chilean national consumer service for the price of drum water 7 aguas antofagasta 49 64 the prices for local bottled and tap water are based on the local criteria of the city of antofagasta prices for bottled water distributed by a national brand are set nationally in addition drinking water is considered at its standard market price without including any circumstance or format that could make it more expensive 5 econometric modeling approach we assume that the utility function of individual i extracted from choosing drinking water j in choice situation t is given by u i j t α i p i j t x i j t β i ε i j t where p i j t is the price variable x i j t is a k x 1 vector of drinking water attributes and the parameters α i and β i are the individual specific preference parameters we also assume that the error term ε i j t is type 1 extreme value distributed with a variance given by μ i 2 π 2 6 where μ i is an individual specific scale parameter dividing the previous equation by μ i does not affect the behavioral specification and results in a new error term which is iid extreme value distributed with variance equal to π 2 6 u i j t λ i p i j t x i j t c i ε i j t where c i β i μ i and λ i α i μ i 17 call this specification the model in preference space since the scale parameter μ i appears in the denominator of c i and λ i both expressions are uncorrelated unless the scale parameter does not vary with the individual thus specifying the parameters to be independent implies that the error term is homoscedastic since the willingness to pay wtp for a particular attribute is given by γ i c i λ i one can also recast the utility function and obtain the so called wtp space model as follows 17 u i j t λ i p i j t x i j t γ i ε i j t the main advantage of the wtp space model is that it allows us to calculate wtp directly by re parameterizing the utility model furthermore it allows us to choose the wtp heterogeneity distribution γ i c i λ i directly instead of choosing independent distributions for c i and λ i as explained by ref 68 distributional assumptions in preference space can lead to unusual distributions for wtp with undefined moments for example assuming that both c i and λ i are normally distributed implies that γ i is a ratio of two normal which does not have defined moments further benefits of the wtp space approach have been discussed earlier in this paper as a methodological contribution we estimate a mixed mixed multinomial logit mm mnl model in wtp space that allows for both observed and unobserved heterogeneity using a gaussian mixture with q components specifically we assume that there exist q 1 q classes or segments of individuals such that individuals belonging to the same class share similar preferences and have their own set of characteristics thus the wtp parameters in each class are distributed as γ i m v n γ q σ q with probability w i q for q 1 q such that q w i q 1 and w i q 0 heterogenous wtps are then represented as a weighted average of normals with the following mixture distribution 69 g γ i q 1 q w i q m v n γ q σ q since q w i q 1 g γ i is a convex combination of m v n γ q σ q and preserves both the non negative and integration to 1 property and thus g γ i is a well defined probability density function the probability assignment for each individual and class is modelled assuming a semi parametric multinomial distribution of the form w i q e x p h i λ q c 1 q e x p h i λ q where h i is a set of observable individuals characteristics as typical with multinomial specifications we assume that λ 1 0 this class allocation formulation allows us to probabilistically allocate respondents to different classes depending on their socio demographic characteristics this adds more realisms to the modeling approach by allowing a discrete and both observed and unobserved sorting of individuals into classes groups each of which has its own set of characteristics assuming that the wtps are distributed by a mixture of normal distributions allows for two layers of heterogeneity first since the parameters are distributed multivariate normally for each q 1 q we allow for unobserved heterogeneity in tastes within each class second as the probabilities of belonging to each class depends on individuals characteristics we can also explore and explain why wtps vary across segments of respondents the coefficients in the wtp space models are estimated using the maximum simulated likelihood msl estimator and the gmnl package in r 70 in particular it is assumed that the price coefficient is fixed at 1 whereas λ i is assumed to be log normal distributed 6 data collection the study was designed as a face to face survey in the city of antofagasta with data collection carried out by trained enumerators between january and february of 2020 the survey was applied to the entire city of antofagasta which has an established drinking water network the city was divided into quintiles by the average fiscal value of its blocks see fig 2 this division was necessary due to the high socio spatial segregation in antofagasta 41 in this way it was possible to obtain a random and representative sample of the statistically homogeneous socio spatial sectors the survey was designed to obtain preferences at the family level with a sample of n 300 the surveys carried out on each quintile are proportional to the number of households in each identified quintile see table 5 for socio demographic information of the sample 7 results 7 1 sample characteristics table 5 shows that the average age of the respondents is 39 years 61 7 of the respondents are head of household and 69 are employed on average the respondents have 13 years of schooling 28 3 have completed secondary education 12 years of formal instruction and 19 have completed professional education the average family income is about 931 343 clp equivalent to 1 187 2 usd the proportion of married and single respondents is fairly balanced 45 and 44 respectively table 6 presents the average values declared by the respondents with a likert scale from 1 to 5 for each set of dimensions water characteristics trust in water sources and consumption from various sources cronbach s α for the three groups are acceptable for the dimension importance of attributes the respondents were asked to assign a value to the attributes they consider most important on a scale of 1 5 where 5 is highly important on average respondents considered flavor and price to be the most important attributes in line with recent findings of 15 71 information about the chemical composition and the origin of the water were much less valuable by the respondents on average this is not surprising given that 67 7 of the respondents stated that they were not able to interpret labels with chemical and nutritional information see table 5 trust of drinking water sources was captured using the same likert scale on average respondents trust in tap water has the lowest value with an average of 2 7 whereas respondents place a higher trust in bottled water with an average of 3 74 these results agree with those shown in table 5 where 76 3 declare that tap water contains some harmful chemical and 70 3 state that tap water contains arsenic it is interesting that only 40 of those surveyed stated that they have a full knowledge about the origin of the water that supplies their home consumption of the three types of water was also registered using a likert scale where 1 is never consumed from this source and 5 is always consumed tap water consumption has the lowest value possibly reflecting average low confidence in this source both drum water and bottled water consumption have similar average values 7 2 willingness to pay assuming homogeneous preferences in this section we present our benchmark estimates for the willingness to pay wtp using dummy variables for the attribute levels columns 1 and 2 of table 7 present the wtp point estimates γ and standard errors respectively using the standard conditional logit model mnl which assumes that wtp and hence preferences for the full set of attributes are homogeneous fixed wtp model since the model is estimated in wtp space rather than preference space the point estimates are interpreted as the average wtp across respondents for each attribute 3 3 specifically we estimated a mnl model including price as an independent variable after parameter estimation via ml we computed the wtp for each attribute as the negative of the ratio between the coefficient for that attribute and price s coefficient the standard errors were computed using the delta method a negative value implies that people dislike that attribute whereas a positive value indicates that people like that characteristic so that they are willing to pay for a marginal improvement in that attribute since price was divided by 100 to avoid numerical issues during optimization the estimates are in clp 100 per liter in general the wtp estimates seem reasonable with respect to the degree of labeling information we observe that on average people prefer to have full information about water s origin and chemical nutritional composition rather than no information and they are willing to pay 497 clp l 0 63 usd l for that information ceteris paribus the remainder wtp estimates for levels of information just origin or chemical nutritional composition are not statistically significant revealing that these attributes have an average marginal utility close to zero this result although it seems to be counterintuitive can be explained by the fact that people in the sample might have very heterogeneous preferences for example if the share of individuals in the population with positive and negative wtp is similar then the preferences tend to offset each other resulting in an average wtp close to zero we explore this potential explanation in the following subsection in terms of organoleptic attributes 4 4 all the organoleptic variables are detailed in table 2 individuals in the sample have stronger preferences for absence of turbidity than absence of odor on average individuals are willing to pay 799 clp l 1 02 usd l to drink water without excessive turbidity turbidity in water lower than 5 u pt co but only about 337 clp l 0 43 usd l for water that is odorless finally people prefer the taste of water bottled by a local or national brand over the taste of tap water on average individuals are willing to pay 815 clp l 1 04 usd l for national bottled water and about 807 clp l 1 03 usd l for local bottled water to assess whether the differences between preferences for the local versus the national brand are statistically significant we performed a χ 2 test under the null hypothesis that h 0 γ n a t i o n a l γ l o c a l the statistic is 0 0054 with one degree of freedom rejecting the null thus we can assert that there are no significant differences in preferences between water from a local or national brand these preliminary results are in line with previous studies see for example 12 30 37 in qualitative terms people do care about the quality of the water they drink individuals have strong preferences for bottled water vs tap water ceteris paribus because they believe that bottled water is safer and healthier this is an expected result due to the bad reputation of tap water in antofagasta city since the 1970s people also care about organoleptic characteristics such absence of turbidity and odor they also value information about the origin and chemical properties of water though not as much as the rest of attributes the magnitude of the estimated wtp for local and national brands are in line with the actual value of bottled water in the local market for example the average price of a bottled water of 1 6 l is about 1 000 clp 1 27 usd or about 625 clp 0 80 usd per liter 67 which is slightly lower than our estimates 7 3 willingness to pay assuming uncorrelated heterogeneous preferences one of the main drawbacks of previous estimates is that they assume that individual preferences for water characteristics are the same which can be very restrictive since there exist psychological social among others factors that can influence the choice of drinking water 30 32 for example our previous estimates show that there is not enough statistical evidence to argue that the marginal utility of having information about the chemical and nutritional composition of water is greater than not having any type of information however this result may be biased and obscured by the unobserved heterogeneity of individual preferences to relax this restriction we assume that people s preferences are heterogeneous so that the wtp parameters are distributed following a continuous distribution γ i f whereas the price coefficient is log normally distributed such that λ i exp λ τ υ i where υ t n 2 2 columns 3 and 4 of table 7 show the point estimates and standard errors for the wtp space model assuming that the wtps for all the non price attributes are independent and normally distributed specifically the coefficients can be written as γ i k γ k σ k υ i k where γ k is the mean of wtp for attribute k σ k is the standard deviation and υ i k is an independent standard normal deviate for each wtp the mean and standard deviation of the distribution are estimated the model and all those that follow were estimated by maximum simulated likelihood msl using 300 halton draws in terms of fit the log likelihood ll is considerably lower than that for the model assuming homogeneous preferences 1 754 vs 1 937 similarly both measures of information the akaike information criterion aic and the bayesian information criterion bic are lower implying that the explanatory power of the model with random wtp is considerably greater than that of the model with fixed wtp the mean parameters for the wtp metrics are reduced by almost half compared to the model with fixed parameters note also that the average wtp metrics are estimated more precisely by allowing for unobserved heterogeneity according to the new estimates individuals are willing to pay 410 and 329 clp l 0 42 usd l for national and local brands of drinking water respectively holding everything else constant the qualitative results for the rest of the average wtps remain the same as in the fixed parameter model regarding unobserved preference heterogeneity most of the standard deviations are statistically significant indicating that wtp parameters do vary in the population with the exception of the valuation for the taste of water to formally test whether the standard deviations of wtp increase the fit of the model we conducted a likelihood ratio lr test comparing the model with normally distributed wtp against the fixed wtp model the lr statistic is χ 2 3667 with 8 of freedom so we reject the null that all standard deviations are jointly zero using the standard deviation of the parameters we can plot the unconditional wtp heterogeneity distribution for each attribute 5 5 the unconditional distribution was computed using 100 000 draws from the estimated distribution fig 3 a shows the distribution for labeling and information characteristics it can be observed that there is substantial heterogeneity in the wtp for information about the origin and chemical nutritional information of water using the point estimates we can also compute the share of individuals in the population with a positive wtp as φ β ˆ k σ ˆ k column 5 of table 7 shows that 48 of the population values having information about the origin of drinking water this share increases to 71 for having chemical nutritional information note that the fixed wtp model disguised this remarkable variation in preferences the mean wtp for full information is greater but its distribution also shows a high level of heterogeneity whereas the mean wtp is 291 clp l 0 37 usd l some individuals are willing to pay up to 1 000 clp l 1 27 usd l again using mean and standard deviation we find that 89 of the population is willing to pay for full information with a share around 18 willing to pay more than 500 clp l 0 64 usd l for this information fig 3b plots the unconditional wtp heterogeneity distribution for organoleptic attributes we can observe that most of the individuals have a negative wtp for turbidity and odor however preferences are more heterogeneous for turbidity although most individuals feel they should be compensated for drinking water with some degree of turbidity about 85 of the population the variance is high resulting in a heavy tailed distribution the wtp distribution for the taste of water national vs local brand reveals that people show much less heterogeneity in preferences 100 of the individuals prefer the taste of bottled water over tap water in addition the null variability for the wtp for local brand bottled water confirms that the residents of antofagasta have strong preferences for this particular source of drinking water see for example 7 72 73 7 4 willingness to pay assuming correlated heterogeneous preferences the previous model assumes that tastes are uncorrelated however we might expect some degree of correlation across preferences and hence wtp 17 to allow for correlation we assume that wtp is distributed according to a multivariate normal distribution γ i m v n γ σ instead of estimating the full variance covariance matrix σ we rather estimate the lower triangular cholesky factor l such that l l σ columns 6 7 and 8 show the results for the correlated random wtp model the standard deviations of the parameters were obtained using d i a g σ 1 2 and their standard errors were computed using the delta method in terms of relative quality of the correlated wtp model it can be observed that the aic measure is lower than in previous models whereas the bic measure is slightly higher than in the uncorrelated wtp model this result was also found by refs 17 34 and 37 in terms of the estimated wtp means these have expected signs with magnitudes slightly higher than those from the uncorrelated model but lower than those of the fixed wtp model the model is concordant in suggesting that the absence of turbidity is the most valuable attribute for individuals with an average wtp of 679 clp l 0 87 usd l this is followed by the taste of water bottled from a national brand table 8 gives the point estimates for the correlation matrix which are derived from the cholesky factors overall the wtp parameters are highly correlated for instance the wtp for turbidity is positively correlated with odor implying that people with strong preferences for water without turbidity are also likely to have strong preferences for odorless water similarly the wtp for full information has a positive correlation of 0 612 with national bottled water suggesting that those who have high wtp for full information also have high wtp for national bottled water 7 5 willingness to pay using a double mixture model so far our results indicate that there exists substantial unobserved heterogeneity in terms of wtp among individuals however we have not explained the sources of this heterogeneity in preferences in this section we allow for observed heterogeneity using our mm mnl model in wtp space table 9 present the results using two mm mnl models in wtp space columns 1 6 present the estimates omitting any socio economic covariates as a determinant of the weights of the gaussian mixture columns 7 12 display the estimates using as covariates the following individual specific variables whether the individual trusts the local provider of tap water age of the respondent whether the individual understands nutrition labelling gender whether the respondent is the household head and a set of geographical dummy variables representing the real estate valuation of the zone see fig 2 both models are estimated assuming two mixture components q 2 models with higher number of components resulted in singularities of the hessian matrix for model 1 the first component represents around 45 of the population whereas the second component represents the remaining 55 individuals belonging to the first component or class are characterized by having positive and significant wtp for information regarding the chemical composition and origin of the water this result contrasts with findings for individuals belonging to component or class two according to column 4 the wtp for this same characteristic is not statistically significant in terms of turbidity and odorlessness it is observed that both characteristics are more valued by individuals in class 2 in both cases the mean point estimates are approximately 5 times more negative in class two than in class one another important finding is the substantial amount that class two is willing to pay for local and national brands to avoid the taste of tap water accordingly individuals in class two are on average willing to pay 1 962 clp l for national bottled water and about 1 765 clp l for local bottled water whereas these amounts are 1 002 clp l and 1 140 clp l for class one respectively in terms of unobserved preference heterogeneity class two shows the largest degree of variability in wtp as revealed by the higher standard deviations compared to those in class one model 2 explicitly accounts for observed preference heterogeneity by modeling the class assignment probability as a function of individual specific covariates the estimated parameters for these variables indicate that younger women that distrust the local water provider understand chemical labelling live in relative wealthy sectors of the city and are the head of the household are more likely to belong to class two 45 of the sample these results support that including observed heterogeneity entails a reclassification of individuals from class two in model 1 to class one as for the wtp parameters we observe that the first class presents both lower means and standard deviations furthermore the results agree with the segmentation provided by the observed individual specific covariates for example note that individuals that understand nutritional chemical labelling are more likely to belong to class two this is in line with the fact that the average wtp for both origin and chemical information is higher in class two than in class one similarly class two is composed of individuals that do not trust the local water provider and hence are on average willing to pay more to avoid the taste of tap water than class one to shed some light in the variability and segmentation of the wtps for local and national brands in fig 4 we plot the implied unconditional estimates for both classes fig 4a shows that indeed class one has a lower average wtp for national brand and lower preference heterogeneity whereas respondents in class two are willing to pay a higher premium but the degree of unobserved heterogeneity is higher fig 4b presents a similar pattern the average wtp for the taste of water from a local brand is approximately 189 clp l for those individuals in class one whereas about 98 of the individuals in class two is willing to pay between 400 and 800 clp l more to drink water with similar taste to some local brand 8 discussion and conclusions one of the main issues in terms of water quality and scarcity in antofagasta is the perceptual scarcity hypothesis this social process occurs when the water distribution networks are well constituted but there is a perception that bottled water is safer 74 although local water suppliers and desalination programs in the city of antofagasta 14 comply nch409 1 and nch409 2 potability standards 57 75 there seems to be a local mistrust and negative perceptions towards urban drinking water which has persisted since 1971 12 76 the preliminary results of our study agree with the presence of perceptual scarcity considering that the average price of a 20 l drum of water is 1 983 cpl 2 53 usd twice the price of 20 l of tap water we show that drum water is preferred over tap water 76 of the sample vs 13 3 respectively even though tap water is both less expensive and more accessible to the citizenship regarding bottled water respondents state that only 10 7 use this type of water as their main source for drinking these results are in line with those findings for us 77 and spain 78 which show a similar pattern across consumers moreover most of those surveyed are convinced that drinking water from the tap has some harmful chemicals 76 3 or arsenic 70 3 we posit that this rejection to drink tap water is partially due to three reasons first arsenic has historically been present in the water supply of the region see for example 47 79 80 secondly arsenic is one of the main risk factors in bladder cancer 81 and lung cancer 82 finally the mining context of the region is a factor that exacerbates mistrust 47 copper extraction requires large amounts of water resources which are already scarce in the region 83 84 in addition mining extraction generates chemical substances that might affect water reserves however almost the entire city of antofagasta is supplied by desalination plants 14 a process that results in a low content of chlorides and arsenic 85 according to our wtp point estimates respondents are willing to pay on average 497 clp l for knowing the origin and chemical nutritional composition of water 799 clp l for drinking water without excessive turbidity and 337 clp l for odorless water in terms of type of water and as expected respondents wtp for drum and bottled water flavor is high compared to tap water individuals are willing to pay 815 clp l and about 807 clp l more for the taste of drum and bottled water respectively over the average price of tap water since both wtps are not statistically different we argue that individuals do not perceive a difference in taste between both types of water these results agree with those reached by ref 30 who also found a considerable demand for bottled water in spite of the availability of tap water that meets quality criteria it should be added that bottled water is not always the healthiest option 32 in chile the criteria and parameters that govern bottled water are different from those that govern tap water for instance ref 9 performed an exhaustive analysis of the chemical composition of bottled water in the chilean market and found variations in chemical compositions ph hardness and mineralization levels between brands all the water samples they analyzed have values that meet the parameters established in the bottled water regulations ds106 however some brands of bottled water would not be suitable for drinking consumption under the nch409 1 standards for tap water arsenic is sometimes found in bottled water in concentrations that exceed the limits of the nch409 1 standard nonetheless in general consumers still tend to associate bottled water with a healthy lifestyle 13 described this disconnect between testing results and consumer preferences as a paradox the results of the models with unobserved preference heterogeneity reveal substantial variation in the valuation of the information displayed on labels and organoleptic attributes along with a marked homogeneity and high wtp for the taste of bottled and drum water however our proposed mixture based formulation shows that a significant amount of unobserved individual heterogeneity represented by continuous distributions can be explained by classes of individuals with similar socio demographic characteristics for example our results provide evidence of two classes of groups of individuals with clearly different tastes for water attributes the first class which corresponds to 55 of the sample shows lower average wtp for water s attributes than that of the second class in terms of heterogeneity we observe a higher degree of variability in the second class for most of the attributes these results agree with the segmentation provided by the observed individual specific covariates for instance individuals that understand nutritional chemical labelling are more likely to belong to class two this is in line with the fact that the average wtp for both origin and chemical information is higher in class two than that in class one similarly class two is composed of younger individuals that do not trust the local water provider and hence are on average willing to pay more to avoid the taste of tap water this last finding confirms that there exists an important share of individuals in antofagasta about 45 of the sample whose preferences for tap water are considerably low due to the bad reputation of the local provider reinforcing the hypothesis of perceptual scarcity these results also highlight the importance of modeling flexible preferences using wtp space models that incorporate both unobserved and observed preference heterogeneity by combining the random parameter and latent class approach given that the experimental survey was based on hypothetical questions our conclusions must be understood within a hypothetical framework however we are confident that the results could be used as input for future water resources management plans intended to increase tap water consumption which are essential for the region to maintain a sustainable environment 16 for example education related to water parameters and distrust of tap water were detected as relevant characteristics in our study therefore both public and private policies could be generated to disseminate information regarding the quality of tap water and thus improve consumer confidence this would also help to reduce information asymmetry about quality that exists between consumers and suppliers of drinking water and hence improve efficiency given that our study also shows that there are groups of individuals with specific characteristics policies focused on age specific groups could also be

8651,whether rapid urbanization promote inter regional virtual water transfers and whether economic beneﬁts produced by virtual water trade differ across regions which have become the two significant issues concerned by relevant stakeholders to this end on the basis of investigating dynamic change of inter regional virtual water transfers in chinese 30 provinces from 2002 to 2015 this paper constructed the logarithmic mean divisia index models to analyze the factors driving such change particularly the impacts from the urbanization and evaluated quantitatively regional economic beneﬁts resulted from virtual water transfers so as to develop relevant policies that potentially facilitate optimal allocation of water resources results indicated that compared to that from 2002 to 2007 the total volume of inter regional virtual water transfers in china were smaller during 2010 and 2015 the rapid development of urbanization within china continued to improve the increase in the trend of virtual water flowing out of water scarce regions moreover regarding provincial economic beneﬁts resulted from inter regional virtual water trade the ratio of income to loss for most provinces in the eastern region was greater than one while the ratio was less than one for the rest of china furthermore this paper articulated more targeted water resources management measures from the perspective of the economically benefited regions and the economically damaged regions keywords virtual water trade urbanization industrial structure regional economic benefits 1 introduction water is an important strategic resource affecting the sustainable development of regional economy with increasing global warming water shortages are becoming one of the most typical ecological environment issues faced by all mankind according to the report by world resources institute 1 since the 1990s about 25 of the world s population are suffering from severe water shortages notably as for china according to the relevant data statistics in 2019 being one of the most serious countries facing water scarcity in the world the total water resources are around 2867 billion m3 and water availability per capita are 2051 m3 person 2 although the total volume of water resources in china is large more than 1 3 of the land is in a crisis in regard to water shortages due to the large population and prominent regional differences in the spatial distribution of water resources 3 moreover northern provinces with water shortages in china accounting for about 50 of the total population have less than 30 of the total water resources however of concern is that china s rapid industrialisation across regions is increasing demand for water resources resulting in water scarcity in northern provinces becoming more and more serious in particular more than sixty percent of cities here are facing water shortages 4 5 consequently the relevant discussions on regional water resources management in china have become the focus of attention from researchers and government agencies in fact to satisfy the growing demand for water many regions in china are increasing their use for surface water and groundwater resulting in some serious issues such as water environment deterioration natural ecological degradation and urban land subsidence in local areas 6 more seriously with the rapid development of regional economy the demand for local available water continued to increase 5 meanwhile the renewable water resources in many regions cannot sustain the growth rate of local residents life and firms production water demand 4 7 in this context the deterioration of regional natural environment is worsening which thus brings severe challenges to the sustainable development of the national economy 8 9 10 therefore for policy makers facing the spatial allocation imbalance between water supply and demand in china while making more efficient use of local water resources actively introducing external water resources is becoming one of the most important ways to alleviate regional water resources scarcity 7 11 12 at present there existed two kinds of water resources allocation ways to mitigate increasingly tense contradiction of regional water supply and demand 4 5 13 namely implementing water conservation projects and promoting virtual water trade for the former although this way could directly shift water resources from relatively rich regions to relatively scarcity regions to alleviate water crisis it not only required a mass of huge human and financial invests but it also incurred adverse effects on natural ecological environment especially a large number of immigration issues like south to north water diversion and the three gorges in china namely the geographical displacement of residents due to the construction of large water conservancy projects 5 6 therefore building artificial water conservation projects to ease regional water shortages has been treated cautiously by many stakeholders for a long time however as for the latter previous studies found that virtual water trade had more significant water resources management advantages in improving regional economic development efficiency and reducing adverse impacts of human activities on natural ecological environment 8 14 thus actively making use of virtual water had been favored by relevant policy makers in each water shortage area especially responding to the nearly half of the demand for grain and agricultural products in china s northwest region 15 in this way water shortage areas imported water intensive products to effectively alleviate local water crisis that is virtual water trade could optimize the allocation of regional water resources 4 5 therefore this field has received extensive attention from many researchers overall by reviewing the relevant literature a growing number of prior studies focused on inter regional virtual water transfers and the relevant issues over the past decades but it remained largely fraught by two limitations that we sought to alleviate here first less emphasis is placed on the factors driving dynamic change of inter regional virtual water transfers over a long time period it may not be beneficial to elucidating dynamic impacts of trade on regional virtual water accounting resulting in providing less insights for policy makers although a series of factors driving inter regional virtual water transfers are identified by previous studies which are listed in the second paragraph from bottom of section 2 the methodological limitations of employing structural decomposition analysis sda or econometric modeling em or multi regional input output mrio method may prevent more comprehensive understanding of the changes in the virtual water transfers and the corresponding driving factors of these changes so the possible impacts of other important factors such as urbanization it primarily contains the rate of growth in urbanization level and urban population size and industrial structure were not discussed fully in fact prior studies found that the growth in energy demand and the resulting in pollutants from the magnification of urban residents consumption and the rising level of the urbanization could be moderately counterbalanced by reductions in energy use through policies such as improving industrial structure 16 17 but from the perspective of virtual water resources the question is whether improving industrial structure are also effective for curtailing inter regional virtual water flows in addition another important question is how other factors such as urbanization affect inter regional virtual water transfers and whether the effects vary across regions obviously comprehensively clarifying factors driving inter regional virtual water transfers will be more conducive to enabling policy makers to effectively develop regional water sources management measures second the relevant evaluation on regional economic beneﬁts resulted from virtual water flows from a quantitative perspective is seldom discussed earlier and thus on this basis a more targeted water resource management policy that potentially optimizes the transfer of virtual water remained to be further in depth explored in fact the inter regional virtual water flows are not always from the regions with abundant water resources to the regions with scarce water resources 4 6 in order to efficiently allocate overall water resources to alleviate the local water demand gap it is particularly essential to seek the regions that need to be optimized in virtual water trade on the basis of investigating the break even point of virtual water trade this is largely due to the fact that water is a scarce economic resource under the condition of market economy trade provides a mechanism to allocate resources such as water resources from some regions to other regions 5 thus for the producers inter regional virtual water trade may inevitably lead to the loss of a parts of economic benefits whereas for the consumers it also may bring some economic benefits that would otherwise belong to the producers therefore the key to optimize the transfer of virtual water is to precisely determine the object areas on the basis of evaluating economic benefits obtained by the producers and the consumers notably as given in the last paragraph of section 2 a few prior studies thought that analyzing the impact of trade on economic beneﬁts was conductive to optimizing the allocation of water resources but they did not quantify economic benefits of each region in inter regional virtual water trade as a result it may be difficult to accurately identify which provinces are benefited areas and which are the damaged areas obviously for the stakeholders accurately identifying these areas would be conducive to formulating more targeted water resources management policies given that a logarithmic mean divisia index lmdi method within mrio analysis framework is employed to examine the driving factors of the virtual water transfers changes and the relevant optimization policies on inter regional virtual water flows for chinese 30 provinces for a period of 2002 and 2015 regrettably however the relevant research on this aspect has not been done in the prior studies in fact according to the study by ang 18 and he et al 19 as an effective tool in decision making analysis the application of lmdi method to assess the possible policy effects of the changes in factors has attracted much attention from researchers due to its more significant advantages in theoretical foundation and operability therefore in the previous studies lmdi has been used to investigate the determinants affecting pollutant emissions changes or energy intensity changes based on the input output io models 18 20 to facilitate policy makers to develop targeted regional water resources management measures employing the most recent and complete chinese mrio table this paper contributes to filling the mentioned above limitations by combining lmdi with mrio models and it consists of twofold first on the basis of comprehensively analyzing how the transfer of virtual water dynamically change for chinese 30 provinces from 2002 to 2015 this paper examines what factors drive such change particularly the impacts from the urbanization in china second through evaluating quantitatively provincial economic beneﬁts resulted from inter regional virtual water flows this paper further articulates targeted water resources management measures to effectively improve optimal allocation of water resources the rest of this paper is organized as follows the following section conducts literature review on virtual water transfers and the detailed methods and data used here are presented in section 3 section 4 mainly analyzes and discusses the results section 5 discusses the relevant uncertainty analysis the last section summarizes this paper and provides the corresponding water resources management policies 2 literature review generally the bottom up and top down methods are widely employed to investigate virtual water transfers and the relevant issues in the existing literature 4 13 21 on the basis of estimating water use per unit of product and distinguishing different product types the former determined the amount of virtual water in different products by using a production tree method furthermore considering that agricultural sector consumed the highest water resources a mass of previous studies carried out the calculation of virtual water in agricultural products and livestock products and thus discussed its impact on regional food security and optimal allocation of water resources 9 22 25 26 overall the advantage of this method is that on the basis of accurately calculating the amount of water resources for agricultural products or livestock through agricultural food trade and thus policy makers could develop relevant water management policies however its calculation process is complicated and it is especially necessary to comprehensively determine all types of agricultural products and estimate water use per unit the corresponding products 27 26 moreover it is weak in estimating the amount of virtual water resources in industrial sectors and describing the transfers of virtual water in the whole economic system 5 6 11 by contrast the top down methods represented by the io modeling analysis can not only reflect virtual water flows between industrial sectors and regions but it also can distinguish the differences in virtual water resources utilization technologies of traded products imported from different regions 21 28 therefore while making up for the deficiency of the bottom up method this method also can capture direct indirect and induced water use within an economy through a detailed accounting of interdependencies between inputs and outputs across sectors as a result it is widely used to conduct the analysis on virtual water resources accounting and the relevant issues in short using the io modeling methods the current research on this field can be primarily divided into the following types the first type focuses on the analysis on virtual water consumed by various sectors or regions in one year and thus conducts in depth discussion on the corresponding water resources management policies 11 29 36 37 remarkably after assessing chinese inter regional trade structure guan and hubacek 29 examined the effects of virtual water flows on china s water resources consumption they found that the trade structure in china was not very favorable in respect of water resource allocation moreover han et al 35 thought that increasing water use efﬁciency and creating relevant budgets for water resource allocation were conductive to alleviating pressures on regional water resources in china the second type focuses on variation characteristics of virtual water transfers for various sectors or regions during a specific period and thus discusses relevant water resources management measures 6 19 21 27 38 45 notably by analyzing china s virtual water export and import from 2002 to 2012 chen et al 40 found that china had net exported most virtual water resources and the stakeholders should adjust foreign trade structure to relieve regional water shortages moreover through studying driving factors of virtual water transfers in inter regional electricity transmissions in china from 2006 to 2016 zhang et al 44 found that the growth in electric power demand in the eastern region increased the virtual water imported from water deficient northwestern provinces but water efficiency improvements in power generation had partially offset this growth the third type focuses on the impact of virtual water flows on water scarcity across regions by weighting regional water use by a water stress index within the io analysis framework 4 5 7 46 47 it should be noted that liu et al 5 found that virtual water flows between regions under the rising fragmentation of production increased the scarcity of water resources in china s northern provinces additionally wang et al 7 studied the impact of the belt and road initiative on water scarcity and economic benefits in these regions and they found that trade balance between china and certain regions was affected by water scarcity overall by employing bottom up or top down methods prior studies primarily calculated the amount of virtual water and discussed the impact of virtual water trade on regional water shortages on this basis the effects of virtual water on regional water resources management policies were also studied it is of great significance to evaluate the current situation of regional water resources consumption and understand the role of virtual water in the optimal allocation of water resources but there are still two deficiencies in the existing literature on one hand previous studies regarding the changes in inter regional virtual water flows failed to account for the role of urbanization including the growth rate of urbanization level and urban population over a period of time notably using the sda method cai et al 4 studied the impacts of four drivers i e population water intensity production structure and demand for ﬁnal products on the changes in virtual water ﬂows for chinese 30 provinces during 2002 and 2012 based on the mrio approach liu et al 5 examined the role of three different trade types i e the trade of ﬁnal goods the trade of intermediate goods for the ﬁnal stage of production and trade in value chain on virtual water trade flows in china from 2002 to 2012 employing em methods duarte et al 9 explored a few determinants i e population per capita gross domestic product gdp geographical distance institutional and environmental factors affecting bilateral virtual water transfers between 70 countries from 1965 to 2010 due to agricultural food trade in addition using a multivariate linear regression method zhao et al 12 analyzed the impacts of key production factors such as regional population regional irrigation area and land s labor s and water s opportunity cost for production on net virtual water exports in china moreover by reviewing relevant literature d odorico et al 6 summarized four key drivers i e econo geography food demand water availability and agricultural production affecting virtual water flows from a qualitative perspective although the effect of population size on the changes in virtual water ﬂows in china had been studied by a few previous studies such as cai et al 4 zhao et al 12 and duarte et al 9 however for china according to the datasets on population growth rate provided by china statistical yearbook csy 48 since the one child policy was strictly enforced in 1978 china s population size remained to be almost unchanged from 2002 to 2015 on the contrary according to the relevant data released by china city statistical yearbook ccsy 49 the rate of growth in urbanization level and urban population size with an annual growth rate of around 2 and 6 respectively and accompanying rises in standard of living are steadily driving high growth in amounts of resources consumption in china during this period therefore exploring the impacts of urbanization process would be very of interest and importance on the other hand the relevant analysis on regional economic beneﬁts resulted from inter regional virtual water flows from a quantitative perspective were also seldom discussed in the existing literature notably although chen et al 11 and wang et al 7 thought that evaluating the impact of trade on economic beneﬁts was beneficial to optimizing the allocation of water resources they did not estimate economic benefits of each province resulted from inter regional virtual water trade in china from a quantitative perspective it may lead to provide less valuable insights for stakeholders to develop more targeted water resources management policies 3 methodology and data 3 1 calculation of virtual water transfers according to the study by wiedmann 50 the embodied in bilateral trade method the single regional io method and the mrio method are frequently used to explore indirect resources such as energy and water resources usage resulted from upstream production and estimate these things embodiments of traded commodities notably by accounting for regional and sectorial heterogeneity the mrio analysis is superior to other two methods for examining the inter regional trade impacts between regions and for encapsulating the links between industrial sectors 4 in particular application of mrio models and their extensions to explore environmental flows between regions and the resulting policy implications have been widely concerned by many scholars 51 53 on the above basis considering that the aim of this paper is to discuss virtual water transfers for chinese 30 provinces so mrio analysis is adopted here notably the discussion on virtual water in international trade that are excluded here as discussed in section 5 it would inevitably lead to the uncertainty on the estimation of the total virtual water resources in china however for simplicity the main reasons are as follows first compared to that from the impacts of international trade domestic trade has much larger impacts on the spatial of regional virtual water resources in china second for 30 provinces in chinese mrio tables during the studied period the amount of trading countries would be numerous so that estimating virtual water intensities for each provinces can be very difficult nevertheless prior studies thought that each province s virtual water in oversea trade could be deduced by combining the chinese mrio table with a global mrio table 35 but we will continue to extend the present study along this line in the future in addition it should be note that virtual water resources discussed in this paper refer to water resources consumed by each region to produce a product or provide a service in economic activities through inter regional trade because regional water resources endowment and the contribution of regional water resources to the output of products vary in different regions virtual water resources can be divided into three types namely green blue and gray water 54 55 specifically green water denotes virtual water flowing directly into commodity production through rainwater that formed directly from precipitation and stored in unsaturated soils and are available for direct use by plants green water represents virtual water used during the process of the production of goods that provided by groundwater and surface water in rivers lakes reservoirs ponds and aquifers gray water refers to sewage discharged during the production of a commodity that recycled by enterprises or factories in economic activities moreover as a top down modeling approach mrio analysis and the relevant models are not apt at distinguishing the above three types of virtual water resources in the case analysis 14 54 besides this also is not the focus of this paper in fact the major aim of this paper is to estimate the aggregate amount of regional virtual water resources and investigate the relevant water resources management measures in china according to the relationship between the row balance and the total balance of the chinese mrio table between multiple regions we have 1 y t r s 1 n z t r s u s 1 n f t r s where y t r is the aggregate output of province r for year t u is a summation vector matrix of one f t r s denotes final requirements of manufactured commodities of province r demanded by province s for year t moreover based on the chinese mrio table we can have 2 z t z 1 1 t z 1 n t z 1 n t z n 1 t z n 1 t z n n t z n n t z n n t z n n t where z t represents a matrix with intermediate deliveries z i j t r s from sector i in province r to sector j in province s in year t besides z t r s is the same structure and implication as the matrix a t r s and thus a t r s denotes intermediate input of province r demanded by province s for year t 3 a t a 1 1 t a 1 n t a 1 n t a n 1 t a n 1 t a n n t a n n t a n n t a n n t where a t denotes the intermediate input coefficients matrix covering a t r s the elements in the this matrix can be obtained as follows a i j t r s z i j t r s y j t s where y j t s denotes the aggregate output of sector j in province s n and j is the amount of provinces and industrial sectors in the chinese mrio tables respectively and r s n i j j n 30 j 3 in addition for each province the final requirement matrix can be derived as follows 4 f t f 1 1 t f 1 n t f 1 n t f n 1 t f n 1 t f n n t f n n t f n n t f n n t where f t is the final requirement matrix covering f t r s on this basis we can have y t z t u f t u and y t a t x t f t u consequently we can also have y t i a t 1 f t u and we further define m t i a t 1 where i and m t is the unit matrix and the leontief inverse therefore for each province in china the full coefficients including direct and indirect water resources can be derived as follows 5 v t w a t 1 m t 1 1 w a t 1 m t 1 n w a t 1 m t 1 n w a t n m t n 1 w a t n m t n 1 w a t n m t n n w a t n m t n n w a t n m t n n w a t n m t n n where m t r s represents the leontief inverse matrix of intermediate input from province r to province s in t period w a i t r w r i t r y i t r is the direct water resources coefficients for province r and its element denotes the ratio of the water resources in sector i to the total output in province r unit m 3 per ten thousand yuan furthermore according to equation 5 v t r s w a t r m t r s where v i t r s is the aggregate volume of full water resources including direct and indirect water resources produced in province r for one unit of final requirements in province s for sector i manufactured in province r unit m 3 per ten thousand yuan based on the above equations the total water resources occurring from economic production in province r in year t w p r t and virtual water transfers in provincial exports trade from province r to province s in year t v w t r s t can be deduced as follows 6 w p r t k 1 n v t k r f t r r v w t r s t 7 v w t r s t k 1 n v t k r f t r s v t r s k 1 n f t s k s r s r k n where v w t r s t denotes the number of virtual water transferring via provincial exports trade from province r to province s for year t besides the first term in equation 7 is the number of embodied water resources manufactured from other provinces that are embodied in commodities imported by other provinces consumers from province r k denotes the number of province in the chinese mrio table and k 30 k 1 n v t k r represents a row vector of water resources produced in 30 provinces in china that are essential for one unit of an industrial sector s final commodities manufactured in province r in year t f t r s denotes final commodities of each industrial sector generated in province r which provided the final consumers from other province s s r moreover the second term in equation 7 displays that the number of embodied water resources in the intermediate commodities are used by the producers to produce final commodities in 30 provinces within china and these intermediate products are provided by province r v t r s is a row vector representing the number of water resources in province r which is embodied in one unit of final commodities generated by other province s s r in each industrial sector k 1 n f t s k is a column vector denoting the final commodities generated in province r for final demanders for other provinces k within china and r is included here furthermore according to equation 7 for province r its inter regional virtual water transfers primarily contain the following two parts that is virtual water transferring via provincial exports trade v w t e from province r to all other provinces within china and virtual water transferring via provincial imports trade v w t i from all other provinces within china to province r respectively 8 v w t e r t k 1 n v t k r s r n f t r s s r n v t r s k 1 n f t s k 9 v w t i r t s r n k 1 n v t k r f t s r s r n v t r s k 1 n f t s k then for province r two important parameters are the total virtual water transfers t v w t and the balance of virtual water transferring via provincial trade b v w t which can be derived as follows respectively 10 t v w t r t v w t e r t v w t i r t 11 b v w t r t v w t e r t v w t i r t in addition as stated in the third from last paragraph of section 1 as a scarce economic resource similar to some kinds of resources like fossil fuels and labor water is allocated efficiently between the producer and the consumer in the production of consumable items through inter regional trade therefore assumed that there exists a change in the exchange rate of other primary resources for the producers occupying a certain amount of water means having a number of economic benefits a parts of economic benefits would be lost when parts of products produced by the producers are used to satisfy the consumption in another regions while for the consumers they would obtain some economic benefits belonged to the producers due to virtual water flows accordingly given that in order to optimize the transfer of virtual water resources this paper evaluates regional economic beneﬁts resulted from virtual water flows from a quantitative perspective taking each province as a unit this paper defines μ r t as water resource price for province r as mentioned above for any province it will play two roles of producer and consumer in the economic system via inter regional trade therefore within the context of virtual water transfers between regions province r will lose certain economic benefits as a producer denoting as l o s r t similarly being a consumer province r will also obtain some economic benefits denoting as i n c r t 12 l o s r t k 1 n v t k r s r n f t r s s r n v t r s k 1 n f t s k μ r t s r s r k n 13 i n c r t s r n k 1 n v t k r f t s r μ s t s r n v t r s k 1 n f t s k μ s t s r s r k n however it should be pointed out that on one hand this paper assumes that the price of provincial water resources introduced here is approximately equivalent to the price of water of each region in fact for a region in china the price of water sold to users is determined by water supply operators according to government regulations or standards agreed upon by both suppliers and users 56 57 overall prior studies showed that factors influencing the price of water primarily contained production cost economic bearing capacity of water users relationship between supply and demand demand structure and regional economic policy 17 58 60 therefore this price provided by the statistics department of each province in china could not fully reflect the water resource price of each region and a number of researchers thought that the price of water of each region in china was primarily related to the present situation of water supply and demand it also reflected the degree of scarcity of water resources in various provinces 5 moreover on this basis for each province whether it is a producer or a consumer this value l o s or i n c only reflects the value of economic benefits in inter provincial virtual trade rather than provincial productivity of water in the regional economic production process in the follow up research it is very desirable to introduce the influence of regional productivity of water on virtual water flows on the other hand from the perspective of economics as a process of earning economic benefits in inter regional trade export trade should be an economic income for a region on the contrary import trade should be an economic loss for a region 61 62 63 however from the perspective of water resource endowment the outflow of water in export trade means the reduction of water resources for a producer during the process of inter provincial virtual water trade and parts of water resources would otherwise belong to the producer that are transferred to the consumer of a traded good 4 5 therefore to avoid a possible controversy this paper assumes that for a producer provincial exports in interregional virtual water trade will lead to an economic loss of water resources and for a consumer provincial imports will bring about an economic income of water resources furthermore to discuss the impact of trade on the economic benefits of each province resulted from virtual water transfers this paper further introduces a ratio of income to loss r i l r t 14 r i l r t i n c r t l o s r t where if r i l r t 1 it indicates that province r is at the break even point on the economic benefits in virtual water trade in other words for province r economic income produced by virtual water trade is equal to its economic loss otherwise if r i l r t 1 it indicates that inter provincial trade will bring more economic income when water price is taken into account vice versa detailed calculation results are provided in table 2 3 2 factors decomposition models in the existing literature two methods including structural decomposition analysis sda and index decomposition analysis ida are commonly used to explore the impacts of a series of factors on regional economic structural changes or fossil energy consumption and resulting in greenhouse gas emissions changes 18 the former is superior to the latter for analyzing the effects of the links between inputs and outputs across industrial sectors and ﬁnal demand on the changes in related variables 64 but this method s application is based on a consecutive input output data and a series of assumptions that may affect the reliability of the results 65 for the latter only based on a relatively small amount of intermittent data sets it excels at capturing the structural effects of factors and describing strong relations with the relevant policy development and evaluation 18 in particular it should be noted the most significant advantage of the sda is that this method can trace the supply chain in the economic system so it has been widely used within the input output analysis framework 65 66 however compared to the sda the ida is more widely applicable in energy decomposition and the relevant policy analysis in fact application of ida in the existing literature primarily focused on the traditional areas of energy and emissions and relevant studies based on this method in other areas such as water use building materials and pollutant emissions were growing for the past few years 19 67 moreover as an important type of ida method the share of previous studies using lmdi had been increasing in recent years and lmdi would be likely to further enhance its dominance in the future study 18 notably ang 18 found that the lmdi method consisted of two subtypes i e lmdi i and lmdi ii based on the different weights formulae and lmdi i was superior to lmdi ii for performing a multi level aggregation and perfecting decomposition results at sub category level which were regarded as an important reason in exploring the factors driving virtual water transfers for chinese 30 provinces thus this paper employs the lmdi i method and thereby presenting the corresponding factors and models 1 urban population up prior studies showed that the growth in population size and the resulting in increase in the demand for external resources would accelerate the inter regional flow of amount of resources such as energy and water between regions 4 9 since 1978 the growth rate of china s total population remained to be small due to the one child policy but more and more rural chinese were rapidly moving into cities which increased at a rate of about 10 million per year especially flowed into the developed areas along the eastern coastal regions 68 69 as a result it would inevitably stimulate the transfer of virtual water across provinces in china in other words urban population and virtual water flows might have a certain correlation linkages which is interpreted as the effect of the changes in urban population size here 2 urbanization level ul the urbanization level is an important indicator of the development of productivity industrial production efficiency and social civilization in a region prior studies showed that the reasonable urbanization level could improve the natural ecological environment by promoting the changes in the pattern of social development so as to reduce the pressure of human activities on the natural environment 70 71 however within the context of global climate change the rate of growth in urbanization level would also drive the huge demand for resources such as energy and the resulting in greenhouse gas emissions 64 considering that water resource was an important economic factor affecting economic production there could be a correlation between urbanization level and regional water resource demand which is explained as the effect of the changes in urbanization level here 3 per capita gdp pgdp per capita gdp is an important index to reflect residents income level and its possible impacts on inter regional virtual water transfers can be explored from the following two perspectives first the growth in per capita gdp will significantly increase the marginal propensity to consume of residents in a region as a result the demand for resources such as water and energy will be increased to some extent second with the increase of residents income level to a certain degree the awareness of residents to save resources will be improved accordingly more importantly for residents the relevant water conservation policies proposed by the government will be easier to implement during this stage 9 consequently it is likely to curtail the demand for water resources however for china which stage are these provinces in this is the focus of this paper hence this impact here is interpreted as the effect of the changes in regional economic development 4 industrial structure is as inter regional trading partnerships become stronger the rapid development of regional economy is accompanied by the transfer of inter regional industries 65 resulting in a significant trend of virtual water transfers between regions investigating its reason there existed significant differences in water demand among different industrial sectors especially in the agricultural sector where water resources usage remained to be relatively higher 26 moreover the difference of industrial structure in each province will inevitably affect the consumption of water resources and under the circumstance that each province has a certain endowment of water resources inter regional water resources flows will occur through trade hence this impact here is interpreted as the effect of the changes in industrial structure 5 water intensity wi being a commonly adopted indicator to represent the utilization efficiency of water resources water intensity is measured by the number of water resources consumption of per unit output in a region in fact as given in the relevant model derivation in section 3 1 by affecting water resource consumption coefficient per unit of output in each industrial sector water intensity could change the transfer of virtual water generally previous studies found that the higher water intensity the lower virtual water flows in regional trade hence the impacts of this factor is interpreted as the effect of the change in water intensity here 6 regional structural effects rse during the regional economic development process in addition to the determinants mentioned above other determinants such as residents consumption structure between local and the rest of china and intermediate input structure between local and the rest of china could also play a role in facilitating the cross regional flow of resources in fact prior studies found that the impacts of final consumption structure and intermediate input structure could not be ignored while discussing the transfer of energy resources between regions 4 65 72 besides the current status of regional resources endowment would also affect the demand for external resources to some extent 73 for simplicity and the availability of data for embodied water in provincial imports trade except for the five factors mentioned above other possible impacts on regional virtual water flows are interpreted as structural effects in the local region similarly for embodied water in provincial exports trade other possible impacts are explained as structural effects from other regions to sum up the impacts of these factors are interpreted as the changes in regional structural effects therefore the changes in virtual water transfers can be decomposed as the ida identity which is expressed as follows 15 v w t r t i u p r t p r t u p r t g r t p r t q r t i g r t w r t i q r t i v w t r t i w r t i where v w t r t is the number of virtual water transfers including the v w t i and the v w t e for province r in year t i denotes a specific industrial sector for province r in year t u p r t p r t and g r t indicate the amount of urban population the total population and the total gross domestic production respectively for sector i of province r in year t q r t i w r t i and v w t r t i indicate the gross domestic production water resources consumption and virtual water usage respectively based on equation 15 we can have 16 v w t r t i u p r t u l r t p g d p r t i s r t i w i r t i r s e r t i where u l r t and p g d p r t represent the effect of urbanization level and the effect of economic development respectively i s r t i w i r t i and r s e r t i indicate the effect of industrial structure the effect of water intensity and regional structural effects respectively therefore the changes in virtual water transfers for province r can be obtained as follows 17 δ v w t r v w t r t v w t r t 1 where δ v w t r indicates the changes in virtual water transfers in province r v w t r t and v w t r t 1 are deﬁned as the number of virtual water transfers of phase t and phase t 1 respectively according to the lmdi i method for province r the changes in the provincial virtual water transfers consists of six factors thus we can obtain 18 δ v w t r δ u p r δ u l r δ p g d p r δ i s r δ w i r δ r s e r as a result the impacts of the respective factors on virtual water transfers in province r can be given as follows 19 δ u p r t i i v w

r s e r t 1 i 3 3 data first according to these models mentioned above china s mrio table is needed to use as the original data the most recent and complete datasets including chinese 30 provinces except for hong kong macao taiwan and tibet the rest of regions are referred as provinces and the abbreviations for each province are shown in table 1 on china s mrio tables are available in 2002 2007 2010 2012 and 2015 and thus these tables are adopted in this paper it should be noted that the china s mrio table in 2002 is from the study by zhong et al 64 the china s mrio tables in 2007 and 2010 are from liu and his colleagues study 74 75 the china s mrio tables in 2012 and 2015 are free of charge and available at http www ceads net data input output tables which has been used widely to explore the impact of interregional trade links on regional ecological environment in china 16 moreover the water use per unit of output from each sector in each region in china are also required here due to the lack of the relevant direct data this paper adopts the following method to estimate according to the water resources bulletin for each province in china 2001 2016 the china environmental statistics database 2001 2016 and the china statistical yearbook 2001 2016 the total amount of water consumption of each province in three industrial sectors i e the primary industry the secondary industry and the tertiary industry respectively can be estimated based on the previous studies calculation process 4 11 notably industrial sectors in china s mrio tables are all 30 sectors while the available data of water consumption by each province at the sector level is only 3 sectors because this paper primarily focuses on virtual water transfers at the provincial level rather than at the sector level the mrio tables were aggregated into these 3 sectors undoubtedly the aggregation level of the sectors would lead to the uncertainty which has discussed in section 5 second other datasets such as urban population urbanization level per capita gdp and industrial structure of each province from 2002 to 2015 are from the china statistical yearbook 2001 2016 besides all economic data such as per capita gdp in this paper is held at constant 2015 price to single out the possible effects from the price in addition to calculate provincial economic beneﬁts resulted from virtual water flows water price by each province is required during the studied period however the relevant statistical yearbook did not provide the water price of each province directly but we could obtain the price data of residential water and industrial water of prefecture level cities in each province from statistical yearbook of chinese urban water supply 2001 2016 thus the datasets on water price of each province used in this paper will be calculated based on the arithmetic average of water price for all prefecture level cities in the corresponding province 4 results and discussions 4 1 dynamic change based on equations 5 and 6 this paper explored variation characteristics of provincial virtual water transfers within china from 2002 to 2015 in general although the proportion of the total virtual water transfers in the total water resources consumption in china is on the decline 1 1 according to equation 7 the calculation results show that the ratio of the total amount of virtual water transfers to the total amount of water resources consumption in china in 200682 2007 2010 2012 and 2015 are 56 8 45 2 39 7 44 6 and 40 7 respectively the corresponding total amount of water resources consumption in china in the studied period are 577 2 billion m3 524 5 billion m3 554 3 billion m3 608 4 billion m3 and 565 5 billon m3 respectively the total amount of virtual water resources transfers within china is up to 257 5 billion m3 accounting for approximately 45 of the china s total water resources consumption during the studied period which underscores that provincial virtual water transfers have important implications for water resources management first focusing on the transfer of virtual water resources by each province fig 1 as for the v w t i as shown in fig 1a province with the biggest reductions is jiangsu falling by 21 0 billion m3 followed by inner mongolia and shandong respectively further calculation suggests that the reduction ranked the top five provinces i e jiangsu inner mongolia shandong shaanxi and gansu accounted for about 82 of china s total reductions thus these results firmly indicate that the decline in the inflow of virtual water in these areas is the main reason for the current decrease of the overall inflow of virtual water in china in addition from 2002 to 2015 province with the biggest growth is anhui increasing by 7 3 billion m3 followed by guangdong and tianjin respectively further calculations show that the increase ranked the top five provinces anhui guangdong tianjin zhejiang and chongqing accounted for more than 70 of china s total growth from 2002 to 2015 for the v w t e as shown in fig 1b province with the biggest drops is xinjiang reducing by 15 4 billion m3 followed by jilin and inner mongolia respectively additionally further calculations suggest that the reduction ranked the top five provinces i e jiangsu inner mongolia shandong shaanxi and gansu amounted to about 75 of china s total reductions besides during this period province with the biggest increase is heilongjiang rising by 7 0 billion m3 followed by jiangsu and hainan respectively in addition based on the data provided in fig 1 further calculations show that regions with the net inflow of virtual water is concentrated in the provinces of southeastern and eastern china and the yellow river basin during 2002 and 2015 particularly the beijing tianjin hebei region has the highest net inflow obviously these results imply that regions with abundant water resources provide strong support for these provinces economic growth through thick trade linkages and water resources management should be conducted at multiple spatial scales to unravel the complexity of trade relationships in other words interregional virtual water trade in china would be beneficial to responding the challenge of water shortage in these regions moreover provinces with the net outflow of virtual water is primarily located in china s southwest northeast and western regions particularly xinjiang and heilongjiang has the highest net outflow notably however via inter regional trade relations for some western provinces with water shortages such as ningxia and gansu the net outflow of virtual water is positive which indicates that external demand for local water resources from other provinces within china will further increase the local water crisis in fact due to the inadequacy of regional water endowment these regions have faced the challenge of water shortage for a long time and thus their socio economic development is relatively backward second from the perspective of virtual water transfers between provinces fig 2 on the whole the largest net water resources transfers more than 3 billion m3 primarily ﬂow from some western provinces and northeast provinces to the eastern provinces of china i e heilongjiang xinjiang to shandong xinjiang to hebei and inner mongolia to jiangsu the larger net water resources transfers 2 3 billion m3 primarily shift from xinjiang to the eastern and central provinces in china i e xinjiang to shandong and liaoning medium scale net water resources transfers 1 2 billion m3 primarily occur between the provinces of the northeast region i e heilongjiang to liaoning and jilin and flows from xinjiang to hebei jiangsu and zhejiang smaller scale net water resources transfers less than 1 billion m3 primarily happen between the provinces of the west region and central region moreover compared to that between 2002 and 2007 the total volume of virtual water transfers between provinces remain relatively smaller from 2010 to 2015 particularly this transfers from the western and central provinces to eastern coastal provinces decreases significantly investigating its reason due to the increase in the utilization efficiency of regional water resources and the readjustment of regional industrial structure for the eastern region in china it may effectively lessen the demand for external virtual water resources taken together the overall trend of chinese virtual water primarily flows from provinces located in the central western and northeastern china to the coastal provinces of eastern china between 2002 and 2015 finally as shown in fig 1 of appendix further calculations indicate that 2 2 due to space limitation detailed data sets can be obtained from the authors as for the v w t i by each province the intermediate inputs in the eastern and central provinces of china consume a higher proportion of virtual water resources that is the large amount of water resources consumed in this region is mainly due to the consumption of intermediate production by firms while the final consumption in northeast china i e heilongjiang liaoning and jilin use a higher proportion of virtual water also for the v w t e by each province the demand for local products or services in the intermediate production process is the main factor that leads to the increase of virtual water transfers in china in particular for chinese 30 provinces in 2015 the proportion of the outflow virtual water consumed by the intermediate input exceed 0 5 compared to that in 2002 this proportion increased by about 10 on the average it transpires that the higher proportion of virtual water consumed by the intermediate input indicates that industrial development within china has been characterized by high water consumption 4 2 driving factors in order to in depth investigate the factors driving the changes in inter regional virtual water flows for a period of 2002 and 2015 based on the year for 2002 this paper assumes that the changes of virtual water transfers by each province in the total effect is one if each changes in units from provincial virtual water transferring via exports and imports trade occur the number of their relative change resulted from the corresponding effects of the changes in urban population urbanization level per capita gdp industrial structure water intensity and regional structure can be obtained in fig 3 accordingly first as displayed in fig 3 overall a part of factors such as urban population urbanization level and per capita gdp play a significant role in promoting inter regional virtual water flows specifically as shown in fig 3 by contrast per capita gdp has a larger effect on enhancing the transfer of virtual water it transpires that with the rapid growth of regional economy in china the continuous improvement of residents income continue to increase the consumption of virtual water across provinces and the improvement in the residents consciousness of water saving need to be further strengthened actually prior studies found that with the rise of residents income level their awareness of resources conservation would continue to increase which was conducive to the continuous improvement of natural ecological environment 6 9 besides our results show that the acceleration of urbanization in china is rapidly increasing the transfer of inter regional virtual water from 2002 to 2015 investigating its reason this may be due to the fact that promoting urbanization is a priority of the government s public economic policy in china since the late 1990s as a result the pace of urbanization has accelerated significantly and thus china s urban economy has been growing rapidly resulting in a rapid increase in the demand for water resources in particular according to the relevant data provided by ccsy 49 compared to that in 2002 china s urbanization rate the value is 56 and its urban population size the value is 770 million increased by 42 and 54 in 2015 by 2030 china s urbanization rate and its urban population size are projected to rise to 80 and 880 million and a large amount of urban population is primarily concentrated in eastern china 76 in addition according to the study by united nations 76 china s urbanization will continue to grow as a result for at least the foreseeable future if no other relevant proactive measures are taken the trend of virtual water flows from the western china to the eastern china may be further strengthened second for the effects of industrial structure and water intensity their impacts on inter regional virtual water flows are negative specifically as exhibited in fig 3 in comparison water intensity has the most obvious negative effect on curtailing the transfer of virtual water from 2002 to 2015 one alternative explanation is that the continuous improvement in water resources utilization efficiency and the sustainable transformation of regional industrial structure in china lead to reduce the demand for water intensive products and thereby lessening inter regional virtual water flows moreover the adjustment of industrial structure in most provinces has a significant negative effect on reducing inter regional virtual water transfers especially curtailing the amount of virtual water transferring via imports trade in fact according to the data released by csy 48 the industrial structure of china s 30 provinces was constantly evolving from primary industry to tertiary industry since 2000s and compared to that in 2002 the ratio of the total output of china s tertiary industry to the total national economy increased by 17 accounting for around 50 in 2015 clearly this continuous optimization of regional industrial structure significantly lessened the consumption of virtual water in various provinces lastly our decomposition results show that the impact of regional structural effects on virtual water transfers across provinces presents a significant characteristic of regional differentiation from 2002 to 2015 fig 3 also the effect of the regional structure factors on inflow and outflow of virtual water in different regions shows a certain consistency that is either all of the effects are positive or all of the effects are negative specifically for most provinces in the eastern and northeastern regions regional structure factor exhibits a dampening effect on the growth of inter regional virtual water flows the reason could be likely explained that the relatively developed regions are not rich in water resources in china and with the increasing demand for water resources caused by the rapid development of regional economy virtual water available to other regions may also be significantly reduced notably however as for some provinces in the central and western regions such as sichuan yunnan and hubei although these regions are rich in abundant water resources the continuous optimization of industrial structure and the improvement of water resource utilization efficiency in other regions of china may reduce the demand for water resources in these regions resulting in the decline of virtual water transfers besides as for most provinces in the central and western regions the impact of regional structural effects is positive investigating its reason affected by regional economic structure the primary industry plays an important leading role in promoting local economic development particularly water consumption in the agricultural sector remains relatively higher than that of other sectors furthermore since 2000 china s industrial transfer such as water intensive and energy intensive industries from the east region to the central and western regions is accelerating 5 16 it may lead to the increasing demand for water resources in these regions and thereby facilitating the growth of inter regional virtual water transfers within china 4 3 economic benefits according to the above results the current status of inter provincial virtual water flows continually worsens water crisis in western and central provinces such as xinjiang and ningxia therefore for the stakeholders how to effectively optimize the allocation of water resources to promote sustainable development of regional economy in china is particularly necessary the first step is to precisely determine the object regions based on the economic benefits obtained by the producers and the consumers in inter regional virtual water trade considering that regional water price can objectively reflect the degree of scarcity of water resources in various provinces 5 this paper employs water price for each province to estimate its economic benefits resulted from virtual water transfers it should be noted that water price i e it primarily contains water price for residents and for enterprises used by different industrial sectors varies from province to province and water price for enterprises is higher than that for residents on this basis based on equations 9 and 10 as shown in table 2 the interval value for each province s economic benefits are estimated here on the whole for most provinces with net inflow of virtual water in the eastern china their values for the r i l are greater than one table 2 these results imply that while improving regional economic development efficiency and reducing the damage of human activities to the local water environment inter provincial trade also bring parts of economic benefits through transferring a large number of virtual water specifically from 2002 to 2015 due to interregional virtual water trade province with the most economic income is shandong followed by guangdong and tianjin respectively while for most provinces in the rest of china their values for the r i l all are less than one and province with the most economic loss due to interregional virtual water trade is xinjiang followed by heilongjiang and guangxi respectively notably however for some provinces in western regions with water shortages such as ningxia gansu and shaanxi the net outflow of virtual water in these regions remains to be positive these results indicate that inter regional trade further increases their water crisis and a serious loss of economic benefits resulted from virtual water transfers are also incurred in the regional development process for relatively backward regions with abundant water resources such as sichuan guangxi and yunnan via strong trade linkages while these regions effectively alleviate water shortages for other regions in china inter regional economic disparities are also likely to widen furthermore especially for xinjiang as exhibited in figs 2 and 3 it had flowed amounts of virtual water into the eastern provinces in china since 2002 by consuming a large amount of water resources in the local region and obtaining certain water intensive products trade provides strong support for other regions economic development but from the perspective of virtual water transfers its economic benefits suffer huge loss due to trade i e its values for the r i l are less than one this needs to arouse enough attention in regional water resources management measures to sum up these results show that to allocate effectively water resources for various regions formulating differentiated strategies for optimizing inter regional virtual water flows seem to be critical at this juncture thus this paper articulates more targeted water resources management measures from the following two aspects first for the economically benefitted regions with the net inflow of virtual water i e the boldface notation in table 2 they consume a lot of water resources so accelerating the upgrading of local industrial structure and cultivating residents water saving consciousness are especially essential moreover considering the important role of regional water prices in improving water saving awareness of enterprises and residents and regulating regional water market demand it would be a feasible way to appropriately raise water price on the basis of sufficient demonstration and investigation second for the economically damaged regions proactive initiatives such as conducting technological upgrading on the utilization efficiency of water resources and providing funds should be taken and thereby making up for the loss resulted from their involvement in virtual water trade for some provinces with water shortages such as ningxia gansu and shaanxi additionally for some provinces with abundant water resources such as sichuan guangxi and yunnan promoting technical progress in the utilization of water resources would also be an effective measure in addition it should be noted that there exists three types of uncertainties that potentially affect the robustness and reliability of these results mentioned above which will be discussed in our future study the first type is that error margins in the inherent uncertainty cannot be avoided particularly the industrial sectors aggregation in this paper only the water resources usage of the 3 industrial sectors in china can be directly obtained so we aggregate the mrio data covering 30 industrial sectors into 3 industrial sectors in fact although a part of prior studies 64 found that this kind of data processing possibly led to overestimate a region s resources consumption and the resulting in pollutant emissions su and ang 77 observed that its advantage laid in insuring data accuracy without incurring potential errors from some extra assumptions the second type is that the discussion on each province s virtual water resources in oversea trade is not taken into account here by nesting chinese mrio tables within global mrio tables from the world input output database and asia international io tables the eora mrio tables and the global trade analysis project a part of previous studies examined virtual water resources transfers in international trade in china 35 notably it is undeniable that this treatment will incur some uncertainties on the total virtual water transfers in china but this paper primarily focused dynamic change of virtual water transfers and the relevant issues for 30 provinces within china also domestic trade has much larger impacts on the spatial of regional virtual water resources in china than that of oversee trade therefore the treatment would not have a fundamental impact on the results of this paper the third type is relevant to regional water prices it should be noted that an average interval water price is used in this paper in other words for each province in china this interval value is estimated based on water price for residents and enterprises in all cities on average belonged to this province which could represent a minimum part of the water pressures while the representativeness of other industrial sectors such as agricultural sector one of the main users and energy sector one of the main non agricultural users for a region in this price used here is not fully reflected therefore undeniably this kind of treatment here may not be an accurate reflection of regional difference in water resources for each province however water price of each region not only can reflect the difference of water resource endowment by each region to a certain extent but it also can objectively reflect the scarcity degree of water resources in each region 5 therefore until better datasets came out water price could play a crucial role in allocating water resources and avoiding the waste of water resources so the treatment scheme used here is somewhat reasonable 5 conclusions and policy implications the aim of this paper is to facilitate our more comprehensive understanding of inter regional virtual water transfers within the trade of a modern economy to this end by establishing the lmdi models within mrio analysis framework this paper investigates dynamic change of virtual water transfers for chinese 30 provinces and explores the factors driving such change from 2002 to 2015 on this basis we articulate relevant water resource management policies that effectively promote optimal allocation of water resources our main conclusions and policy implications are as follows focusing on the conclusions it contains two aspects first overall the ratio of the total virtual water transfers to the total water resources consumption in china is on the decline the total amount of virtual water resources transfers within china are up to 257 5 billion m3 besides compared to that between 2002 and 2007 the total volume of virtual water transfers between provinces remain relatively smaller from 2010 to 2015 particularly this transfers from the western and central provinces to eastern coastal provinces decrease significantly for the factors driving dynamic change of inter regional virtual water transfers a part of factors such as urban population urbanization level and per capita gdp play a significant role in promoting inter regional virtual water flows moreover by contrast per capita gdp has a larger effect on promoting the transfer of virtual water within china from 2002 to 2015 as for factors such as industrial structure and water intensity they have a negative impacts on lessening inter regional virtual water flows from 2002 to 2015 in comparison water intensity has the most obvious negative effect on curtailing the transfer of virtual water in addition the impacts of regional structural effects i e residents consumption structure and intermediate input structure on virtual water transfers across provinces present a significant regional differentiation from 2002 to 2015 second on this basis of evaluating quantitatively provincial economic beneﬁts resulted from virtual water flows based on regional water prices our results show that from 2002 to 2015 for most provinces with net inflow of virtual water in the eastern china their values for a ratio of income to loss are greater than one specifically province with the most economic income due to interregional virtual water trade is shandong followed by guangdong and tianjin respectively while for most provinces in the rest of china their values for the ratio all are less than one and province with the most economic loss due to interregional virtual water trade is xinjiang followed by heilongjiang and guangxi respectively looking at the policy implications it consists of three aspects first the total amount of virtual water resources transfers within china amount to nearly 45 of the total water resources consumption from 2002 to 2015 obviously this value is large which explicitly highlights that provincial virtual water transfers have important implications for water resources management in china for virtual water resources transferring via imports trade the large amount of water resources consumed in the eastern and central provinces of china are mainly due to the consumption of intermediate production by firms while the final consumption in northeast china i e heilongjiang liaoning and jilin consume a higher proportion of virtual water for virtual water resources transferring via exports trade the demand for local commodities in the intermediate production process is the main factor that leads to the increase of virtual water transfers in china 4 5 78 thus the higher proportion of virtual water consumed by the intermediate input indicates that industrial development in china has been characterized by high water consumption it transpires that for policy makers how to improve the water resource utilization efficiency of firms across provinces in economic production may be the main task of regional water resources management in china 15 79 second via inter regional trade relations for some western provinces with water shortages such as ningxia and gansu the net outflow of virtual water is positive indicating that external demand will further exacerbate these regions water crisis more importantly inter provincial virtual water flows is from the central and western regions with scarce water resources to the developed eastern regions in china 4 41 in this context with frequent occurrence of extreme weather and climate events the amount of water resources in northern china will decrease and the relevant food related water demands will also continue to increase 80 81 moreover with the rapid acceleration of urbanization in china for at least the foreseeable future if no other relevant proactive measures are taken the trend of virtual water flows within china from the west to the east may be further strengthened thus for the stakeholders improving industrial structure and facilitating utilization efficiency of water resources to curtail the consumption of water resources in the eastern region seems to be urgent this provides an important theoretical foundation for policy makers to optimize regional virtual water resources flows in china lastly for various regions formulating differentiated strategies for regulating inter regional virtual water flows is particularly essential 47 82 from the perspective of overall planning this paper puts forward more targeted water management policies from the following two aspects specifically for the economically benefitted regions such as most eastern provinces in china they consume a lot of water resources so improving the upgrading of local industrial structure and cultivating residents water saving consciousness are especially essential moreover based on sufficient demonstration and investigation conducted by the related department appropriately raising water price would be an effective and feasible way however for the economically damaged regions proactive initiatives such as conducting technology cooperation and providing funds should be taken so as to make up for the loss resulted from their involvement in virtual water trade for some provinces with water shortages such as ningxia gansu and shaanxi in addition for some provinces with abundant water resources such as sichuan guangxi and yunnan promoting technical progress in the utilization of water resources would be an alternative measure author statement author contributions are as follows

8651,whether rapid urbanization promote inter regional virtual water transfers and whether economic beneﬁts produced by virtual water trade differ across regions which have become the two significant issues concerned by relevant stakeholders to this end on the basis of investigating dynamic change of inter regional virtual water transfers in chinese 30 provinces from 2002 to 2015 this paper constructed the logarithmic mean divisia index models to analyze the factors driving such change particularly the impacts from the urbanization and evaluated quantitatively regional economic beneﬁts resulted from virtual water transfers so as to develop relevant policies that potentially facilitate optimal allocation of water resources results indicated that compared to that from 2002 to 2007 the total volume of inter regional virtual water transfers in china were smaller during 2010 and 2015 the rapid development of urbanization within china continued to improve the increase in the trend of virtual water flowing out of water scarce regions moreover regarding provincial economic beneﬁts resulted from inter regional virtual water trade the ratio of income to loss for most provinces in the eastern region was greater than one while the ratio was less than one for the rest of china furthermore this paper articulated more targeted water resources management measures from the perspective of the economically benefited regions and the economically damaged regions keywords virtual water trade urbanization industrial structure regional economic benefits 1 introduction water is an important strategic resource affecting the sustainable development of regional economy with increasing global warming water shortages are becoming one of the most typical ecological environment issues faced by all mankind according to the report by world resources institute 1 since the 1990s about 25 of the world s population are suffering from severe water shortages notably as for china according to the relevant data statistics in 2019 being one of the most serious countries facing water scarcity in the world the total water resources are around 2867 billion m3 and water availability per capita are 2051 m3 person 2 although the total volume of water resources in china is large more than 1 3 of the land is in a crisis in regard to water shortages due to the large population and prominent regional differences in the spatial distribution of water resources 3 moreover northern provinces with water shortages in china accounting for about 50 of the total population have less than 30 of the total water resources however of concern is that china s rapid industrialisation across regions is increasing demand for water resources resulting in water scarcity in northern provinces becoming more and more serious in particular more than sixty percent of cities here are facing water shortages 4 5 consequently the relevant discussions on regional water resources management in china have become the focus of attention from researchers and government agencies in fact to satisfy the growing demand for water many regions in china are increasing their use for surface water and groundwater resulting in some serious issues such as water environment deterioration natural ecological degradation and urban land subsidence in local areas 6 more seriously with the rapid development of regional economy the demand for local available water continued to increase 5 meanwhile the renewable water resources in many regions cannot sustain the growth rate of local residents life and firms production water demand 4 7 in this context the deterioration of regional natural environment is worsening which thus brings severe challenges to the sustainable development of the national economy 8 9 10 therefore for policy makers facing the spatial allocation imbalance between water supply and demand in china while making more efficient use of local water resources actively introducing external water resources is becoming one of the most important ways to alleviate regional water resources scarcity 7 11 12 at present there existed two kinds of water resources allocation ways to mitigate increasingly tense contradiction of regional water supply and demand 4 5 13 namely implementing water conservation projects and promoting virtual water trade for the former although this way could directly shift water resources from relatively rich regions to relatively scarcity regions to alleviate water crisis it not only required a mass of huge human and financial invests but it also incurred adverse effects on natural ecological environment especially a large number of immigration issues like south to north water diversion and the three gorges in china namely the geographical displacement of residents due to the construction of large water conservancy projects 5 6 therefore building artificial water conservation projects to ease regional water shortages has been treated cautiously by many stakeholders for a long time however as for the latter previous studies found that virtual water trade had more significant water resources management advantages in improving regional economic development efficiency and reducing adverse impacts of human activities on natural ecological environment 8 14 thus actively making use of virtual water had been favored by relevant policy makers in each water shortage area especially responding to the nearly half of the demand for grain and agricultural products in china s northwest region 15 in this way water shortage areas imported water intensive products to effectively alleviate local water crisis that is virtual water trade could optimize the allocation of regional water resources 4 5 therefore this field has received extensive attention from many researchers overall by reviewing the relevant literature a growing number of prior studies focused on inter regional virtual water transfers and the relevant issues over the past decades but it remained largely fraught by two limitations that we sought to alleviate here first less emphasis is placed on the factors driving dynamic change of inter regional virtual water transfers over a long time period it may not be beneficial to elucidating dynamic impacts of trade on regional virtual water accounting resulting in providing less insights for policy makers although a series of factors driving inter regional virtual water transfers are identified by previous studies which are listed in the second paragraph from bottom of section 2 the methodological limitations of employing structural decomposition analysis sda or econometric modeling em or multi regional input output mrio method may prevent more comprehensive understanding of the changes in the virtual water transfers and the corresponding driving factors of these changes so the possible impacts of other important factors such as urbanization it primarily contains the rate of growth in urbanization level and urban population size and industrial structure were not discussed fully in fact prior studies found that the growth in energy demand and the resulting in pollutants from the magnification of urban residents consumption and the rising level of the urbanization could be moderately counterbalanced by reductions in energy use through policies such as improving industrial structure 16 17 but from the perspective of virtual water resources the question is whether improving industrial structure are also effective for curtailing inter regional virtual water flows in addition another important question is how other factors such as urbanization affect inter regional virtual water transfers and whether the effects vary across regions obviously comprehensively clarifying factors driving inter regional virtual water transfers will be more conducive to enabling policy makers to effectively develop regional water sources management measures second the relevant evaluation on regional economic beneﬁts resulted from virtual water flows from a quantitative perspective is seldom discussed earlier and thus on this basis a more targeted water resource management policy that potentially optimizes the transfer of virtual water remained to be further in depth explored in fact the inter regional virtual water flows are not always from the regions with abundant water resources to the regions with scarce water resources 4 6 in order to efficiently allocate overall water resources to alleviate the local water demand gap it is particularly essential to seek the regions that need to be optimized in virtual water trade on the basis of investigating the break even point of virtual water trade this is largely due to the fact that water is a scarce economic resource under the condition of market economy trade provides a mechanism to allocate resources such as water resources from some regions to other regions 5 thus for the producers inter regional virtual water trade may inevitably lead to the loss of a parts of economic benefits whereas for the consumers it also may bring some economic benefits that would otherwise belong to the producers therefore the key to optimize the transfer of virtual water is to precisely determine the object areas on the basis of evaluating economic benefits obtained by the producers and the consumers notably as given in the last paragraph of section 2 a few prior studies thought that analyzing the impact of trade on economic beneﬁts was conductive to optimizing the allocation of water resources but they did not quantify economic benefits of each region in inter regional virtual water trade as a result it may be difficult to accurately identify which provinces are benefited areas and which are the damaged areas obviously for the stakeholders accurately identifying these areas would be conducive to formulating more targeted water resources management policies given that a logarithmic mean divisia index lmdi method within mrio analysis framework is employed to examine the driving factors of the virtual water transfers changes and the relevant optimization policies on inter regional virtual water flows for chinese 30 provinces for a period of 2002 and 2015 regrettably however the relevant research on this aspect has not been done in the prior studies in fact according to the study by ang 18 and he et al 19 as an effective tool in decision making analysis the application of lmdi method to assess the possible policy effects of the changes in factors has attracted much attention from researchers due to its more significant advantages in theoretical foundation and operability therefore in the previous studies lmdi has been used to investigate the determinants affecting pollutant emissions changes or energy intensity changes based on the input output io models 18 20 to facilitate policy makers to develop targeted regional water resources management measures employing the most recent and complete chinese mrio table this paper contributes to filling the mentioned above limitations by combining lmdi with mrio models and it consists of twofold first on the basis of comprehensively analyzing how the transfer of virtual water dynamically change for chinese 30 provinces from 2002 to 2015 this paper examines what factors drive such change particularly the impacts from the urbanization in china second through evaluating quantitatively provincial economic beneﬁts resulted from inter regional virtual water flows this paper further articulates targeted water resources management measures to effectively improve optimal allocation of water resources the rest of this paper is organized as follows the following section conducts literature review on virtual water transfers and the detailed methods and data used here are presented in section 3 section 4 mainly analyzes and discusses the results section 5 discusses the relevant uncertainty analysis the last section summarizes this paper and provides the corresponding water resources management policies 2 literature review generally the bottom up and top down methods are widely employed to investigate virtual water transfers and the relevant issues in the existing literature 4 13 21 on the basis of estimating water use per unit of product and distinguishing different product types the former determined the amount of virtual water in different products by using a production tree method furthermore considering that agricultural sector consumed the highest water resources a mass of previous studies carried out the calculation of virtual water in agricultural products and livestock products and thus discussed its impact on regional food security and optimal allocation of water resources 9 22 25 26 overall the advantage of this method is that on the basis of accurately calculating the amount of water resources for agricultural products or livestock through agricultural food trade and thus policy makers could develop relevant water management policies however its calculation process is complicated and it is especially necessary to comprehensively determine all types of agricultural products and estimate water use per unit the corresponding products 27 26 moreover it is weak in estimating the amount of virtual water resources in industrial sectors and describing the transfers of virtual water in the whole economic system 5 6 11 by contrast the top down methods represented by the io modeling analysis can not only reflect virtual water flows between industrial sectors and regions but it also can distinguish the differences in virtual water resources utilization technologies of traded products imported from different regions 21 28 therefore while making up for the deficiency of the bottom up method this method also can capture direct indirect and induced water use within an economy through a detailed accounting of interdependencies between inputs and outputs across sectors as a result it is widely used to conduct the analysis on virtual water resources accounting and the relevant issues in short using the io modeling methods the current research on this field can be primarily divided into the following types the first type focuses on the analysis on virtual water consumed by various sectors or regions in one year and thus conducts in depth discussion on the corresponding water resources management policies 11 29 36 37 remarkably after assessing chinese inter regional trade structure guan and hubacek 29 examined the effects of virtual water flows on china s water resources consumption they found that the trade structure in china was not very favorable in respect of water resource allocation moreover han et al 35 thought that increasing water use efﬁciency and creating relevant budgets for water resource allocation were conductive to alleviating pressures on regional water resources in china the second type focuses on variation characteristics of virtual water transfers for various sectors or regions during a specific period and thus discusses relevant water resources management measures 6 19 21 27 38 45 notably by analyzing china s virtual water export and import from 2002 to 2012 chen et al 40 found that china had net exported most virtual water resources and the stakeholders should adjust foreign trade structure to relieve regional water shortages moreover through studying driving factors of virtual water transfers in inter regional electricity transmissions in china from 2006 to 2016 zhang et al 44 found that the growth in electric power demand in the eastern region increased the virtual water imported from water deficient northwestern provinces but water efficiency improvements in power generation had partially offset this growth the third type focuses on the impact of virtual water flows on water scarcity across regions by weighting regional water use by a water stress index within the io analysis framework 4 5 7 46 47 it should be noted that liu et al 5 found that virtual water flows between regions under the rising fragmentation of production increased the scarcity of water resources in china s northern provinces additionally wang et al 7 studied the impact of the belt and road initiative on water scarcity and economic benefits in these regions and they found that trade balance between china and certain regions was affected by water scarcity overall by employing bottom up or top down methods prior studies primarily calculated the amount of virtual water and discussed the impact of virtual water trade on regional water shortages on this basis the effects of virtual water on regional water resources management policies were also studied it is of great significance to evaluate the current situation of regional water resources consumption and understand the role of virtual water in the optimal allocation of water resources but there are still two deficiencies in the existing literature on one hand previous studies regarding the changes in inter regional virtual water flows failed to account for the role of urbanization including the growth rate of urbanization level and urban population over a period of time notably using the sda method cai et al 4 studied the impacts of four drivers i e population water intensity production structure and demand for ﬁnal products on the changes in virtual water ﬂows for chinese 30 provinces during 2002 and 2012 based on the mrio approach liu et al 5 examined the role of three different trade types i e the trade of ﬁnal goods the trade of intermediate goods for the ﬁnal stage of production and trade in value chain on virtual water trade flows in china from 2002 to 2012 employing em methods duarte et al 9 explored a few determinants i e population per capita gross domestic product gdp geographical distance institutional and environmental factors affecting bilateral virtual water transfers between 70 countries from 1965 to 2010 due to agricultural food trade in addition using a multivariate linear regression method zhao et al 12 analyzed the impacts of key production factors such as regional population regional irrigation area and land s labor s and water s opportunity cost for production on net virtual water exports in china moreover by reviewing relevant literature d odorico et al 6 summarized four key drivers i e econo geography food demand water availability and agricultural production affecting virtual water flows from a qualitative perspective although the effect of population size on the changes in virtual water ﬂows in china had been studied by a few previous studies such as cai et al 4 zhao et al 12 and duarte et al 9 however for china according to the datasets on population growth rate provided by china statistical yearbook csy 48 since the one child policy was strictly enforced in 1978 china s population size remained to be almost unchanged from 2002 to 2015 on the contrary according to the relevant data released by china city statistical yearbook ccsy 49 the rate of growth in urbanization level and urban population size with an annual growth rate of around 2 and 6 respectively and accompanying rises in standard of living are steadily driving high growth in amounts of resources consumption in china during this period therefore exploring the impacts of urbanization process would be very of interest and importance on the other hand the relevant analysis on regional economic beneﬁts resulted from inter regional virtual water flows from a quantitative perspective were also seldom discussed in the existing literature notably although chen et al 11 and wang et al 7 thought that evaluating the impact of trade on economic beneﬁts was beneficial to optimizing the allocation of water resources they did not estimate economic benefits of each province resulted from inter regional virtual water trade in china from a quantitative perspective it may lead to provide less valuable insights for stakeholders to develop more targeted water resources management policies 3 methodology and data 3 1 calculation of virtual water transfers according to the study by wiedmann 50 the embodied in bilateral trade method the single regional io method and the mrio method are frequently used to explore indirect resources such as energy and water resources usage resulted from upstream production and estimate these things embodiments of traded commodities notably by accounting for regional and sectorial heterogeneity the mrio analysis is superior to other two methods for examining the inter regional trade impacts between regions and for encapsulating the links between industrial sectors 4 in particular application of mrio models and their extensions to explore environmental flows between regions and the resulting policy implications have been widely concerned by many scholars 51 53 on the above basis considering that the aim of this paper is to discuss virtual water transfers for chinese 30 provinces so mrio analysis is adopted here notably the discussion on virtual water in international trade that are excluded here as discussed in section 5 it would inevitably lead to the uncertainty on the estimation of the total virtual water resources in china however for simplicity the main reasons are as follows first compared to that from the impacts of international trade domestic trade has much larger impacts on the spatial of regional virtual water resources in china second for 30 provinces in chinese mrio tables during the studied period the amount of trading countries would be numerous so that estimating virtual water intensities for each provinces can be very difficult nevertheless prior studies thought that each province s virtual water in oversea trade could be deduced by combining the chinese mrio table with a global mrio table 35 but we will continue to extend the present study along this line in the future in addition it should be note that virtual water resources discussed in this paper refer to water resources consumed by each region to produce a product or provide a service in economic activities through inter regional trade because regional water resources endowment and the contribution of regional water resources to the output of products vary in different regions virtual water resources can be divided into three types namely green blue and gray water 54 55 specifically green water denotes virtual water flowing directly into commodity production through rainwater that formed directly from precipitation and stored in unsaturated soils and are available for direct use by plants green water represents virtual water used during the process of the production of goods that provided by groundwater and surface water in rivers lakes reservoirs ponds and aquifers gray water refers to sewage discharged during the production of a commodity that recycled by enterprises or factories in economic activities moreover as a top down modeling approach mrio analysis and the relevant models are not apt at distinguishing the above three types of virtual water resources in the case analysis 14 54 besides this also is not the focus of this paper in fact the major aim of this paper is to estimate the aggregate amount of regional virtual water resources and investigate the relevant water resources management measures in china according to the relationship between the row balance and the total balance of the chinese mrio table between multiple regions we have 1 y t r s 1 n z t r s u s 1 n f t r s where y t r is the aggregate output of province r for year t u is a summation vector matrix of one f t r s denotes final requirements of manufactured commodities of province r demanded by province s for year t moreover based on the chinese mrio table we can have 2 z t z 1 1 t z 1 n t z 1 n t z n 1 t z n 1 t z n n t z n n t z n n t z n n t where z t represents a matrix with intermediate deliveries z i j t r s from sector i in province r to sector j in province s in year t besides z t r s is the same structure and implication as the matrix a t r s and thus a t r s denotes intermediate input of province r demanded by province s for year t 3 a t a 1 1 t a 1 n t a 1 n t a n 1 t a n 1 t a n n t a n n t a n n t a n n t where a t denotes the intermediate input coefficients matrix covering a t r s the elements in the this matrix can be obtained as follows a i j t r s z i j t r s y j t s where y j t s denotes the aggregate output of sector j in province s n and j is the amount of provinces and industrial sectors in the chinese mrio tables respectively and r s n i j j n 30 j 3 in addition for each province the final requirement matrix can be derived as follows 4 f t f 1 1 t f 1 n t f 1 n t f n 1 t f n 1 t f n n t f n n t f n n t f n n t where f t is the final requirement matrix covering f t r s on this basis we can have y t z t u f t u and y t a t x t f t u consequently we can also have y t i a t 1 f t u and we further define m t i a t 1 where i and m t is the unit matrix and the leontief inverse therefore for each province in china the full coefficients including direct and indirect water resources can be derived as follows 5 v t w a t 1 m t 1 1 w a t 1 m t 1 n w a t 1 m t 1 n w a t n m t n 1 w a t n m t n 1 w a t n m t n n w a t n m t n n w a t n m t n n w a t n m t n n where m t r s represents the leontief inverse matrix of intermediate input from province r to province s in t period w a i t r w r i t r y i t r is the direct water resources coefficients for province r and its element denotes the ratio of the water resources in sector i to the total output in province r unit m 3 per ten thousand yuan furthermore according to equation 5 v t r s w a t r m t r s where v i t r s is the aggregate volume of full water resources including direct and indirect water resources produced in province r for one unit of final requirements in province s for sector i manufactured in province r unit m 3 per ten thousand yuan based on the above equations the total water resources occurring from economic production in province r in year t w p r t and virtual water transfers in provincial exports trade from province r to province s in year t v w t r s t can be deduced as follows 6 w p r t k 1 n v t k r f t r r v w t r s t 7 v w t r s t k 1 n v t k r f t r s v t r s k 1 n f t s k s r s r k n where v w t r s t denotes the number of virtual water transferring via provincial exports trade from province r to province s for year t besides the first term in equation 7 is the number of embodied water resources manufactured from other provinces that are embodied in commodities imported by other provinces consumers from province r k denotes the number of province in the chinese mrio table and k 30 k 1 n v t k r represents a row vector of water resources produced in 30 provinces in china that are essential for one unit of an industrial sector s final commodities manufactured in province r in year t f t r s denotes final commodities of each industrial sector generated in province r which provided the final consumers from other province s s r moreover the second term in equation 7 displays that the number of embodied water resources in the intermediate commodities are used by the producers to produce final commodities in 30 provinces within china and these intermediate products are provided by province r v t r s is a row vector representing the number of water resources in province r which is embodied in one unit of final commodities generated by other province s s r in each industrial sector k 1 n f t s k is a column vector denoting the final commodities generated in province r for final demanders for other provinces k within china and r is included here furthermore according to equation 7 for province r its inter regional virtual water transfers primarily contain the following two parts that is virtual water transferring via provincial exports trade v w t e from province r to all other provinces within china and virtual water transferring via provincial imports trade v w t i from all other provinces within china to province r respectively 8 v w t e r t k 1 n v t k r s r n f t r s s r n v t r s k 1 n f t s k 9 v w t i r t s r n k 1 n v t k r f t s r s

can be derived as follows respectively 10 t v w t r t v w t e r t v w t i r t 11 b v w t r t v w t e r t v w t i r t in addition as stated in the third from last paragraph of section 1 as a scarce economic resource similar to some kinds of resources like fossil fuels and labor water is allocated efficiently between the producer and the consumer in the production of consumable items through inter regional trade therefore assumed that there exists a change in the exchange rate of other primary resources for the producers occupying a certain amount of water means having a number of economic benefits a parts of economic benefits would be lost when parts of products produced by the producers are used to satisfy the consumption in another regions while for the consumers they would obtain some economic benefits belonged to the producers due to virtual water flows accordingly given that in order to optimize the transfer of virtual water resources this paper evaluates regional economic beneﬁts resulted from virtual water flows from a quantitative perspective taking each province as a unit this paper defines μ r t as water resource price for province r as mentioned above for any province it will play two roles of producer and consumer in the economic system via inter regional trade therefore within the context of virtual water transfers between regions province r will lose certain economic benefits as a producer denoting as l o s r t similarly being a consumer province r will also obtain some economic benefits denoting as i n c r t 12 l o s r t k 1 n v t k r s r n f t r s s r n v t r s k 1 n f t s k μ r t s r s r k n 13 i n c r t s r n k 1 n v t k r f t s r μ s t s r n v t r s k 1 n f t s k μ s t s r s r k n however it should be pointed out that on one hand this paper assumes that the price of provincial water resources introduced here is approximately equivalent to the price of water of each region in fact for a region in china the price of water sold to users is determined by water supply operators according to government regulations or standards agreed upon by both suppliers and users 56 57 overall prior studies showed that factors influencing the price of water primarily contained production cost economic bearing capacity of water users relationship between supply and demand demand structure and regional economic policy 17 58 60 therefore this price provided by the statistics department of each province in china could not fully reflect the water resource price of each region and a number of researchers thought that the price of water of each region in china was primarily related to the present situation of water supply and demand it also reflected the degree of scarcity of water resources in various provinces 5 moreover on this basis for each province whether it is a producer or a consumer this value l o s or i n c only reflects the value of economic benefits in inter provincial virtual trade rather than provincial productivity of water in the regional economic production process in the follow up research it is very desirable to introduce the influence of regional productivity of water on virtual water flows on the other hand from the perspective of economics as a process of earning economic benefits in inter regional trade export trade should be an economic income for a region on the contrary import trade should be an economic loss for a region 61 62 63 however from the perspective of water resource endowment the outflow of water in export trade means the reduction of water resources for a producer during the process of inter provincial virtual water trade and parts of water resources would otherwise belong to the producer that are transferred to the consumer of a traded good 4 5 therefore to avoid a possible controversy this paper assumes that for a producer provincial exports in interregional virtual water trade will lead to an economic loss of water resources and for a consumer provincial imports will bring about an economic income of water resources furthermore to discuss the impact of trade on the economic benefits of each province resulted from virtual water transfers this paper further introduces a ratio of income to loss r i l r t 14 r i l r t i n c r t l o s r t where if r i l r t 1 it indicates that province r is at the break even point on the economic benefits in virtual water trade in other words for province r economic income produced by virtual water trade is equal to its economic loss otherwise if r i l r t 1 it indicates that inter provincial trade will bring more economic income when water price is taken into account vice versa detailed calculation results are provided in table 2 3 2 factors decomposition models in the existing literature two methods including structural decomposition analysis sda and index decomposition analysis ida are commonly used to explore the impacts of a series of factors on regional economic structural changes or fossil energy consumption and resulting in greenhouse gas emissions changes 18 the former is superior to the latter for analyzing the effects of the links between inputs and outputs across industrial sectors and ﬁnal demand on the changes in related variables 64 but this method s application is based on a consecutive input output data and a series of assumptions that may affect the reliability of the results 65 for the latter only based on a relatively small amount of intermittent data sets it excels at capturing the structural effects of factors and describing strong relations with the relevant policy development and evaluation 18 in particular it should be noted the most significant advantage of the sda is that this method can trace the supply chain in the economic system so it has been widely used within the input output analysis framework 65 66 however compared to the sda the ida is more widely applicable in energy decomposition and the relevant policy analysis in fact application of ida in the existing literature primarily focused on the traditional areas of energy and emissions and relevant studies based on this method in other areas such as water use building materials and pollutant emissions were growing for the past few years 19 67 moreover as an important type of ida method the share of previous studies using lmdi had been increasing in recent years and lmdi would be likely to further enhance its dominance in the future study 18 notably ang 18 found that the lmdi method consisted of two subtypes i e lmdi i and lmdi ii based on the different weights formulae and lmdi i was superior to lmdi ii for performing a multi level aggregation and perfecting decomposition results at sub category level which were regarded as an important reason in exploring the factors driving virtual water transfers for chinese 30 provinces thus this paper employs the lmdi i method and thereby presenting the corresponding factors and models 1 urban population up prior studies showed that the growth in population size and the resulting in increase in the demand for external resources would accelerate the inter regional flow of amount of resources such as energy and water between regions 4 9 since 1978 the growth rate of china s total population remained to be small due to the one child policy but more and more rural chinese were rapidly moving into cities which increased at a rate of about 10 million per year especially flowed into the developed areas along the eastern coastal regions 68 69 as a result it would inevitably stimulate the transfer of virtual water across provinces in china in other words urban population and virtual water flows might have a certain correlation linkages which is interpreted as the effect of the changes in urban population size here 2 urbanization level ul the urbanization level is an important indicator of the development of productivity industrial production efficiency and social civilization in a region prior studies showed that the reasonable urbanization level could improve the natural ecological environment by promoting the changes in the pattern of social development so as to reduce the pressure of human activities on the natural environment 70 71 however within the context of global climate change the rate of growth in urbanization level would also drive the huge demand for resources such as energy and the resulting in greenhouse gas emissions 64 considering that water resource was an important economic factor affecting economic production there could be a correlation between urbanization level and regional water resource demand which is explained as the effect of the changes in urbanization level here 3 per capita gdp pgdp per capita gdp is an important index to reflect residents income level and its possible impacts on inter regional virtual water transfers can be explored from the following two perspectives first the growth in per capita gdp will significantly increase the marginal propensity to consume of residents in a region as a result the demand for resources such as water and energy will be increased to some extent second with the increase of residents income level to a certain degree the awareness of residents to save resources will be improved accordingly more importantly for residents the relevant water conservation policies proposed by the government will be easier to implement during this stage 9 consequently it is likely to curtail the demand for water resources however for china which stage are these provinces in this is the focus of this paper hence this impact here is interpreted as the effect of the changes in regional economic development 4 industrial structure is as inter regional trading partnerships become stronger the rapid development of regional economy is accompanied by the transfer of inter regional industries 65 resulting in a significant trend of virtual water transfers between regions investigating its reason there existed significant differences in water demand among different industrial sectors especially in the agricultural sector where water resources usage remained to be relatively higher 26 moreover the difference of industrial structure in each province will inevitably affect the consumption of water resources and under the circumstance that each province has a certain endowment of water resources inter regional water resources flows will occur through trade hence this impact here is interpreted as the effect of the changes in industrial structure 5 water intensity wi being a commonly adopted indicator to represent the utilization efficiency of water resources water intensity is measured by the number of water resources consumption of per unit output in a region in fact as given in the relevant model derivation in section 3 1 by affecting water resource consumption coefficient per unit of output in each industrial sector water intensity could change the transfer of virtual water generally previous studies found that the higher water intensity the lower virtual water flows in regional trade hence the impacts of this factor is interpreted as the effect of the change in water intensity here 6 regional structural effects rse during the regional economic development process in addition to the determinants mentioned above other determinants such as residents consumption structure between local and the rest of china and intermediate input structure between local and the rest of china could also play a role in facilitating the cross regional flow of resources in fact prior studies found that the impacts of final consumption structure and intermediate input structure could not be ignored while discussing the transfer of energy resources between regions 4 65 72 besides the current status of regional resources endowment would also affect the demand for external resources to some extent 73 for simplicity and the availability of data for embodied water in provincial imports trade except for the five factors mentioned above other possible impacts on regional virtual water flows are interpreted as structural effects in the local region similarly for embodied water in provincial exports trade other possible impacts are explained as structural effects from other regions to sum up the impacts of these factors are interpreted as the changes in regional structural effects therefore the changes in virtual water transfers can be decomposed as the ida identity which is expressed as follows 15 v w t r t i u p r t p r t u p r t g r t p r t q r t i g r t w r t i q r t i v w t r t i w r t i where v w t r t is the number of virtual water transfers including the v w t i and the v w t e for province r in year t i denotes a specific industrial sector for province r in year t u p r t p r t and g r t indicate the amount of urban population the total population and the total gross domestic production respectively for sector i of province r in year t q r t i w r t i and v w t r t i indicate the gross domestic production water resources consumption and virtual water usage respectively based on equation 15 we can have 16 v w t r t i u p r t u l r t p g d p r t i s r t i w i r t i r s e r t i where u l r t and p g d p r t represent the effect of urbanization level and the effect of economic development respectively i s r t i w i r t i and r s e r t i indicate the effect of industrial structure the effect of water intensity and regional structural effects respectively therefore the changes in virtual water transfers for province r can be obtained as follows 17 δ v w t r v w t r t v w t r t 1 where δ v w t r indicates the changes in virtual water transfers in province r v w t r t and v w t r t 1 are deﬁned as the number of virtual water transfers of phase t and phase t 1 respectively according to the lmdi i method for province r the changes in the provincial virtual water transfers consists of six factors thus we can obtain 18 δ v w t r δ u p r δ u l r δ p g d p r δ i s r δ w i r δ r s e r as a result the impacts of the respective factors on virtual water transfers in province r can be given as follows 19 δ u p r t i i v w

r s e r t 1 i 3 3 data first according to these models mentioned above china s mrio table is needed to use as the original data the most recent and complete datasets including chinese 30 provinces except for hong kong macao taiwan and tibet the rest of regions are referred as provinces and the abbreviations for each province are shown in table 1 on china s mrio tables are available in 2002 2007 2010 2012 and 2015 and thus these tables are adopted in this paper it should be noted that the china s mrio table in 2002 is from the study by zhong et al 64 the china s mrio tables in 2007 and 2010 are from liu and his colleagues study 74 75 the china s mrio tables in 2012 and 2015 are free of charge and available at http www ceads net data input output tables which has been used widely to explore the impact of interregional trade links on regional ecological environment in china 16 moreover the water use per unit of output from each sector in each region in china are also required here due to the lack of the relevant direct data this paper adopts the following method to estimate according to the water resources bulletin for each province in china 2001 2016 the china environmental statistics database 2001 2016 and the china statistical yearbook 2001 2016 the total amount of water consumption of each province in three industrial sectors i e the primary industry the secondary industry and the tertiary industry respectively can be estimated based on the previous studies calculation process 4 11 notably industrial sectors in china s mrio tables are all 30 sectors while the available data of water consumption by each province at the sector level is only 3 sectors because this paper primarily focuses on virtual water transfers at the provincial level rather than at the sector level the mrio tables were aggregated into these 3 sectors undoubtedly the aggregation level of the sectors would lead to the uncertainty which has discussed in section 5 second other datasets such as urban population urbanization level per capita gdp and industrial structure of each province from 2002 to 2015 are from the china statistical yearbook 2001 2016 besides all economic data such as per capita gdp in this paper is held at constant 2015 price to single out the possible effects from the price in addition to calculate provincial economic beneﬁts resulted from virtual water flows water price by each province is required during the studied period however the relevant statistical yearbook did not provide the water price of each province directly but we could obtain the price data of residential water and industrial water of prefecture level cities in each province from statistical yearbook of chinese urban water supply 2001 2016 thus the datasets on water price of each province used in this paper will be calculated based on the arithmetic average of water price for all prefecture level cities in the corresponding province 4 results and discussions 4 1 dynamic change based on equations 5 and 6 this paper explored variation characteristics of provincial virtual water transfers within china from 2002 to 2015 in general although the proportion of the total virtual water transfers in the total water resources consumption in china is on the decline 1 1 according to equation 7 the calculation results show that the ratio of the total amount of virtual water transfers to the total amount of water resources consumption in china in 200682 2007 2010 2012 and 2015 are 56 8 45 2 39 7 44 6 and 40 7 respectively the corresponding total amount of water resources consumption in china in the studied period are 577 2 billion m3 524 5 billion m3 554 3 billion m3 608 4 billion m3 and 565 5 billon m3 respectively the total amount of virtual water resources transfers within china is up to 257 5 billion m3 accounting for approximately 45 of the china s total water resources consumption during the studied period which underscores that provincial virtual water transfers have important implications for water resources management first focusing on the transfer of virtual water resources by each province fig 1 as for the v w t i as shown in fig 1a province with the biggest reductions is jiangsu falling by 21 0 billion m3 followed by inner mongolia and shandong respectively further calculation suggests that the reduction ranked the top five provinces i e jiangsu inner mongolia shandong shaanxi and gansu accounted for about 82 of china s total reductions thus these results firmly indicate that the decline in the inflow of virtual water in these areas is the main reason for the current decrease of the overall inflow of virtual water in china in addition from 2002 to 2015 province with the biggest growth is anhui increasing by 7 3 billion m3 followed by guangdong and tianjin respectively further calculations show that the increase ranked the top five provinces anhui guangdong tianjin zhejiang and chongqing accounted for more than 70 of china s total growth from 2002 to 2015 for the v w t e as shown in fig 1b province with the biggest drops is xinjiang reducing by 15 4 billion m3 followed by jilin and inner mongolia respectively additionally further calculations suggest that the reduction ranked the top five provinces i e jiangsu inner mongolia shandong shaanxi and gansu amounted to about 75 of china s total reductions besides during this period province with the biggest increase is heilongjiang rising by 7 0 billion m3 followed by jiangsu and hainan respectively in addition based on the data provided in fig 1 further calculations show that regions with the net inflow of virtual water is concentrated in the provinces of southeastern and eastern china and the yellow river basin during 2002 and 2015 particularly the beijing tianjin hebei region has the highest net inflow obviously these results imply that regions with abundant water resources provide strong support for these provinces economic growth through thick trade linkages and water resources management should be conducted at multiple spatial scales to unravel the complexity of trade relationships in other words interregional virtual water trade in china would be beneficial to responding the challenge of water shortage in these regions moreover provinces with the net outflow of virtual water is primarily located in china s southwest northeast and western regions particularly xinjiang and heilongjiang has the highest net outflow notably however via inter regional trade relations for some western provinces with water shortages such as ningxia and gansu the net outflow of virtual water is positive which indicates that external demand for local water resources from other provinces within china will further increase the local water crisis in fact due to the inadequacy of regional water endowment these regions have faced the challenge of water shortage for a long time and thus their socio economic development is relatively backward second from the perspective of virtual water transfers between provinces fig 2 on the whole the largest net water resources transfers more than 3 billion m3 primarily ﬂow from some western provinces and northeast provinces to the eastern provinces of china i e heilongjiang xinjiang to shandong xinjiang to hebei and inner mongolia to jiangsu the larger net water resources transfers 2 3 billion m3 primarily shift from xinjiang to the eastern and central provinces in china i e xinjiang to shandong and liaoning medium scale net water resources transfers 1 2 billion m3 primarily occur between the provinces of the northeast region i e heilongjiang to liaoning and jilin and flows from xinjiang to hebei jiangsu and zhejiang smaller scale net water resources transfers less than 1 billion m3 primarily happen between the provinces of the west region and central region moreover compared to that between 2002 and 2007 the total volume of virtual water transfers between provinces remain relatively smaller from 2010 to 2015 particularly this transfers from the western and central provinces to eastern coastal provinces decreases significantly investigating its reason due to the increase in the utilization efficiency of regional water resources and the readjustment of regional industrial structure for the eastern region in china it may effectively lessen the demand for external virtual water resources taken together the overall trend of chinese virtual water primarily flows from provinces located in the central western and northeastern china to the coastal provinces of eastern china between 2002 and 2015 finally as shown in fig 1 of appendix further calculations indicate that 2 2 due to space limitation detailed data sets can be obtained from the authors as for the v w t i by each province the intermediate inputs in the eastern and central provinces of china consume a higher proportion of virtual water resources that is the large amount of water resources consumed in this region is mainly due to the consumption of intermediate production by firms while the final consumption in northeast china i e heilongjiang liaoning and jilin use a higher proportion of virtual water also for the v w t e by each province the demand for local products or services in the intermediate production process is the main factor that leads to the increase of virtual water transfers in china in particular for chinese 30 provinces in 2015 the proportion of the outflow virtual water consumed by the intermediate input exceed 0 5 compared to that in 2002 this proportion increased by about 10 on the average it transpires that the higher proportion of virtual water consumed by the intermediate input indicates that industrial development within china has been characterized by high water consumption 4 2 driving factors in order to in depth investigate the factors driving the changes in inter regional virtual water flows for a period of 2002 and 2015 based on the year for 2002 this paper assumes that the changes of virtual water transfers by each province in the total effect is one if each changes in units from provincial virtual water transferring via exports and imports trade occur the number of their relative change resulted from the corresponding effects of the changes in urban population urbanization level per capita gdp industrial structure water intensity and regional structure can be obtained in fig 3 accordingly first as displayed in fig 3 overall a part of factors such as urban population urbanization level and per capita gdp play a significant role in promoting inter regional virtual water flows specifically as shown in fig 3 by contrast per capita gdp has a larger effect on enhancing the transfer of virtual water it transpires that with the rapid growth of regional economy in china the continuous improvement of residents income continue to increase the consumption of virtual water across provinces and the improvement in the residents consciousness of water saving need to be further strengthened actually prior studies found that with the rise of residents income level their awareness of resources conservation would continue to increase which was conducive to the continuous improvement of natural ecological environment 6 9 besides our results show that the acceleration of urbanization in china is rapidly increasing the transfer of inter regional virtual water from 2002 to 2015 investigating its reason this may be due to the fact that promoting urbanization is a priority of the government s public economic policy in china since the late 1990s as a result the pace of urbanization has accelerated significantly and thus china s urban economy has been growing rapidly resulting in a rapid increase in the demand for water resources in particular according to the relevant data provided by ccsy 49 compared to that in 2002 china s urbanization rate the value is 56 and its urban population size the value is 770 million increased by 42 and 54 in 2015 by 2030 china s urbanization rate and its urban population size are projected to rise to 80 and 880 million and a large amount of urban population is primarily concentrated in eastern china 76 in addition according to the study by united nations 76 china s urbanization will continue to grow as a result for at least the foreseeable future if no other relevant proactive measures are taken the trend of virtual water flows from the western china to the eastern china may be further strengthened second for the effects of industrial structure and water intensity their impacts on inter regional virtual water flows are negative specifically as exhibited in fig 3 in comparison water intensity has the most obvious negative effect on curtailing the transfer of virtual water from 2002 to 2015 one alternative explanation is that the continuous improvement in water resources utilization efficiency and the sustainable transformation of regional industrial structure in china lead to reduce the demand for water intensive products and thereby lessening inter regional virtual water flows moreover the adjustment of industrial structure in most provinces has a significant negative effect on reducing inter regional virtual water transfers especially curtailing the amount of virtual water transferring via imports trade in fact according to the data released by csy 48 the industrial structure of china s 30 provinces was constantly evolving from primary industry to tertiary industry since 2000s and compared to that in 2002 the ratio of the total output of china s tertiary industry to the total national economy increased by 17 accounting for around 50 in 2015 clearly this continuous optimization of regional industrial structure significantly lessened the consumption of virtual water in various provinces lastly our decomposition results show that the impact of regional structural effects on virtual water transfers across provinces presents a significant characteristic of regional differentiation from 2002 to 2015 fig 3 also the effect of the regional structure factors on inflow and outflow of virtual water in different regions shows a certain consistency that is either all of the effects are positive or all of the effects are negative specifically for most provinces in the eastern and northeastern regions regional structure factor exhibits a dampening effect on the growth of inter regional virtual water flows the reason could be likely explained that the relatively developed regions are not rich in water resources in china and with the increasing demand for water resources caused by the rapid development of regional economy virtual water available to other regions may also be significantly reduced notably however as for some provinces in the central and western regions such as sichuan yunnan and hubei although these regions are rich in abundant water resources the continuous optimization of industrial structure and the improvement of water resource utilization efficiency in other regions of china may reduce the demand for water resources in these regions resulting in the decline of virtual water transfers besides as for most provinces in the central and western regions the impact of regional structural effects is positive investigating its reason affected by regional economic structure the primary industry plays an important leading role in promoting local economic development particularly water consumption in the agricultural sector remains relatively higher than that of other sectors furthermore since 2000 china s industrial transfer such as water intensive and energy intensive industries from the east region to the central and western regions is accelerating 5 16 it may lead to the increasing demand for water resources in these regions and thereby facilitating the growth of inter regional virtual water transfers within china 4 3 economic benefits according to the above results the current status of inter provincial virtual water flows continually worsens water crisis in western and central provinces such as xinjiang and ningxia therefore for the stakeholders how to effectively optimize the allocation of water resources to promote sustainable development of regional economy in china is particularly necessary the first step is to precisely determine the object regions based on the economic benefits obtained by the producers and the consumers in inter regional virtual water trade considering that regional water price can objectively reflect the degree of scarcity of water resources in various provinces 5 this paper employs water price for each province to estimate its economic benefits resulted from virtual water transfers it should be noted that water price i e it primarily contains water price for residents and for enterprises used by different industrial sectors varies from province to province and water price for enterprises is higher than that for residents on this basis based on equations 9 and 10 as shown in table 2 the interval value for each province s economic benefits are estimated here on the whole for most provinces with net inflow of virtual water in the eastern china their values for the r i l are greater than one table 2 these results imply that while improving regional economic development efficiency and reducing the damage of human activities to the local water environment inter provincial trade also bring parts of economic benefits through transferring a large number of virtual water specifically from 2002 to 2015 due to interregional virtual water trade province with the most economic income is shandong followed by guangdong and tianjin respectively while for most provinces in the rest of china their values for the r i l all are less than one and province with the most economic loss due to interregional virtual water trade is xinjiang followed by heilongjiang and guangxi respectively notably however for some provinces in western regions with water shortages such as ningxia gansu and shaanxi the net outflow of virtual water in these regions remains to be positive these results indicate that inter regional trade further increases their water crisis and a serious loss of economic benefits resulted from virtual water transfers are also incurred in the regional development process for relatively backward regions with abundant water resources such as sichuan guangxi and yunnan via strong trade linkages while these regions effectively alleviate water shortages for other regions in china inter regional economic disparities are also likely to widen furthermore especially for xinjiang as exhibited in figs 2 and 3 it had flowed amounts of virtual water into the eastern provinces in china since 2002 by consuming a large amount of water resources in the local region and obtaining certain water intensive products trade provides strong support for other regions economic development but from the perspective of virtual water transfers its economic benefits suffer huge loss due to trade i e its values for the r i l are less than one this needs to arouse enough attention in regional water resources management measures to sum up these results show that to allocate effectively water resources for various regions formulating differentiated strategies for optimizing inter regional virtual water flows seem to be critical at this juncture thus this paper articulates more targeted water resources management measures from the following two aspects first for the economically benefitted regions with the net inflow of virtual water i e the boldface notation in table 2 they consume a lot of water resources so accelerating the upgrading of local industrial structure and cultivating residents water saving consciousness are especially essential moreover considering the important role of regional water prices in improving water saving awareness of enterprises and residents and regulating regional water market demand it would be a feasible way to appropriately raise water price on the basis of sufficient demonstration and investigation second for the economically damaged regions proactive initiatives such as conducting technological upgrading on the utilization efficiency of water resources and providing funds should be taken and thereby making up for the loss resulted from their involvement in virtual water trade for some provinces with water shortages such as ningxia gansu and shaanxi additionally for some provinces with abundant water resources such as sichuan guangxi and yunnan promoting technical progress in the utilization of water resources would also be an effective measure in addition it should be noted that there exists three types of uncertainties that potentially affect the robustness and reliability of these results mentioned above which will be discussed in our future study the first type is that error margins in the inherent uncertainty cannot be avoided particularly the industrial sectors aggregation in this paper only the water resources usage of the 3 industrial sectors in china can be directly obtained so we aggregate the mrio data covering 30 industrial sectors into 3 industrial sectors in fact although a part of prior studies 64 found that this kind of data processing possibly led to overestimate a region s resources consumption and the resulting in pollutant emissions su and ang 77 observed that its advantage laid in insuring data accuracy without incurring potential errors from some extra assumptions the second type is that the discussion on each province s virtual water resources in oversea trade is not taken into account here by nesting chinese mrio tables within global mrio tables from the world input output database and asia international io tables the eora mrio tables and the global trade analysis project a part of previous studies examined virtual water resources transfers in international trade in china 35 notably it is undeniable that this treatment will incur some uncertainties on the total virtual water transfers in china but this paper primarily focused dynamic change of virtual water transfers and the relevant issues for 30 provinces within china also domestic trade has much larger impacts on the spatial of regional virtual water resources in china than that of oversee trade therefore the treatment would not have a fundamental impact on the results of this paper the third type is relevant to regional water prices it should be noted that an average interval water price is used in this paper in other words for each province in china this interval value is estimated based on water price for residents and enterprises in all cities on average belonged to this province which could represent a minimum part of the water pressures while the representativeness of other industrial sectors such as agricultural sector one of the main users and energy sector one of the main non agricultural users for a region in this price used here is not fully reflected therefore undeniably this kind of treatment here may not be an accurate reflection of regional difference in water resources for each province however water price of each region not only can reflect the difference of water resource endowment by each region to a certain extent but it also can objectively reflect the scarcity degree of water resources in each region 5 therefore until better datasets came out water price could play a crucial role in allocating water resources and avoiding the waste of water resources so the treatment scheme used here is somewhat reasonable 5 conclusions and policy implications the aim of this paper is to facilitate our more comprehensive understanding of inter regional virtual water transfers within the trade of a modern economy to this end by establishing the lmdi models within mrio analysis framework this paper investigates dynamic change of virtual water transfers for chinese 30 provinces and explores the factors driving such change from 2002 to 2015 on this basis we articulate relevant water resource management policies that effectively promote optimal allocation of water resources our main conclusions and policy implications are as follows focusing on the conclusions it contains two aspects first overall the ratio of the total virtual water transfers to the total water resources consumption in china is on the decline the total amount of virtual water resources transfers within china are up to 257 5 billion m3 besides compared to that between 2002 and 2007 the total volume of virtual water transfers between provinces remain relatively smaller from 2010 to 2015 particularly this transfers from the western and central provinces to eastern coastal provinces decrease significantly for the factors driving dynamic change of inter regional virtual water transfers a part of factors such as urban population urbanization level and per capita gdp play a significant role in promoting inter regional virtual water flows moreover by contrast per capita gdp has a larger effect on promoting the transfer of virtual water within china from 2002 to 2015 as for factors such as industrial structure and water intensity they have a negative impacts on lessening inter regional virtual water flows from 2002 to 2015 in comparison water intensity has the most obvious negative effect on curtailing the transfer of virtual water in addition the impacts of regional structural effects i e residents consumption structure and intermediate input structure on virtual water transfers across provinces present a significant regional differentiation from 2002 to 2015 second on this basis of evaluating quantitatively provincial economic beneﬁts resulted from virtual water flows based on regional water prices our results show that from 2002 to 2015 for most provinces with net inflow of virtual water in the eastern china their values for a ratio of income to loss are greater than one specifically province with the most economic income due to interregional virtual water trade is shandong followed by guangdong and tianjin respectively while for most provinces in the rest of china their values for the ratio all are less than one and province with the most economic loss due to interregional virtual water trade is xinjiang followed by heilongjiang and guangxi respectively looking at the policy implications it consists of three aspects first the total amount of virtual water resources transfers within china amount to nearly 45 of the total water resources consumption from 2002 to 2015 obviously this value is large which explicitly highlights that provincial virtual water transfers have important implications for water resources management in china for virtual water resources transferring via imports trade the large amount of water resources consumed in the eastern and central provinces of china are mainly due to the consumption of intermediate production by firms while the final consumption in northeast china i e heilongjiang liaoning and jilin consume a higher proportion of virtual water for virtual water resources transferring via exports trade the demand for local commodities in the intermediate production process is the main factor that leads to the increase of virtual water transfers in china 4 5 78 thus the higher proportion of virtual water consumed by the intermediate input indicates that industrial development in china has been characterized by high water consumption it transpires that for policy makers how to improve the water resource utilization efficiency of firms across provinces in economic production may be the main task of regional water resources management in china 15 79 second via inter regional trade relations for some western provinces with water shortages such as ningxia and gansu the net outflow of virtual water is positive indicating that external demand will further exacerbate these regions water crisis more importantly inter provincial virtual water flows is from the central and western regions with scarce water resources to the developed eastern regions in china 4 41 in this context with frequent occurrence of extreme weather and climate events the amount of water resources in northern china will decrease and the relevant food related water demands will also continue to increase 80 81 moreover with the rapid acceleration of urbanization in china for at least the foreseeable future if no other relevant proactive measures are taken the trend of virtual water flows within china from the west to the east may be further strengthened thus for the stakeholders improving industrial structure and facilitating utilization efficiency of water resources to curtail the consumption of water resources in the eastern region seems to be urgent this provides an important theoretical foundation for policy makers to optimize regional virtual water resources flows in china lastly for various regions formulating differentiated strategies for regulating inter regional virtual water flows is particularly essential 47 82 from the perspective of overall planning this paper puts forward more targeted water management policies from the following two aspects specifically for the economically benefitted regions such as most eastern provinces in china they consume a lot of water resources so improving the upgrading of local industrial structure and cultivating residents water saving consciousness are especially essential moreover based on sufficient demonstration and investigation conducted by the related department appropriately raising water price would be an effective and feasible way however for the economically damaged regions proactive initiatives such as conducting technology cooperation and providing funds should be taken so as to make up for the loss resulted from their involvement in virtual water trade for some provinces with water shortages such as ningxia gansu and shaanxi in addition for some provinces with abundant water resources such as sichuan guangxi and yunnan promoting technical progress in the utilization of water resources would be an alternative measure author statement author contributions are as follows

8652,consumption of bottled water in the u s continues to grow despite the higher user price and greater environmental cost relative to municipal tap water convenience is surely one reason for this trend but it is less relevant for in home consumption of bottled water the existing literature highlights perceptions of quality access to information and personal experience as important factors influencing water usage in the home in this paper we report the results of a 2018 survey of water customers of jacksonville electric authority jea the primary municipal water utility in northeast florida the survey includes detailed questions regarding self reported household water usage information availability information processing trust in institutions and demographic characteristics in addition in cooperation with jea we matched the survey results with administrative data on geographic location within the system using a bivariate probit regression method we estimate the determinants of water usage in the home the results show that concern for drinking water safety is the principal contributor of bottled water consumption moreover the evidence illustrates how information from water quality reports and objective measures of water hardness translate into the drinking water choice we also show that greater transaction costs of bottled water due to low access to retail suppliers is associated with a substitution of water filtration for bottled water keywords water usage risk perception survey research bivariate probit jel classification d12 q25 q53 1 introduction the outbreak of covid 19 in the united states instigated hoarding of food cleaning essentials and paper products as people stockpiled essential supplies however many seemed puzzled why some would hoard bottled water as the water in most homes is safe 1 while it is true that some communities suffer from documented water quality crises 2 3 aggregate bottled water consumption far exceeds the immediate needs of these communities the popularity of bottled water is much more a result of the perceived quality of tap water than its chemical composition 4 5 when households lack confidence in tap water safety they naturally turn to alternatives such as bottled water or water filtration systems bottling water began in the united kingdom during the 17th century because of an increase in demand for spa going and water therapy the american bottled water industry started in 1844 as therapeutic properties of spring water became popular among citizens 6 bottled water was considered a safer alternative to municipal water supplies in the 19th century due to possible contaminations with pathogens like cholera and typhoid however in the early 20th century the popularity of bottled water declined as the introduction of water chlorination alleviated many concerns about water borne diseases in municipal water supplies the resurgence in bottled water consumption at the end of the 20th century is associated with the relative convenience of disposable containers and a renewed emphasis on purity annual consumption of bottled water in the u s has increased from 16 2 gallons per capita in 1990 to 42 3 gallons per capita in 2018 7 notably bottled water has been the most popular packaged drink for three consecutive years 1 1 please visit https www globenewswire com news release 2020 01 10 1969028 0 en consumers want bottled water to be available wherever drinks are sold and if it s not most will choose another packaged beverage that uses much more plastic html for access to the report consumption of bottled water is the most expensive alternative to tap water both to an individual and to society in the united states bottled water ranges from 240 to 10 000 times more expensive than tap water 8 10 in addition the plastic container is a potential source of chemical migration that may cause additional health hazards 11 12 and the production and disposal of the plastic bottles are environmentally damaging 13 according to an estimate in 2011 production of the plastic necessary for the water bottles purchased in the united states uses 17 million barrels of crude oil every year this was equivalent to one day s worth of oil consumption in america a cost of nearly 1 795 billion 14 according to the environmental protection agency epa only a little over 8 of the bottles arrive in the recycling stream 2 2 please visit https www epa gov facts and figures about materials waste and recycling plastics material specific data for more information according to a recent new york times report 51 with more restrictions imposed by china thailand and india on imported scrap a growing number of cities are reducing recycling efforts the remaining bottles are either combusted or dumped into landfills the landfilled bottles generate incinerated toxic byproducts such as chlorine gas and ash containing heavy metals some of the bottles end up in streams rivers and the ocean contributing to contamination of water bodies given this colossal environmental damage organized anti bottled campaigns and utility services have tried to communicate the message that tap water is as safe as bottled water however controversies over tap water safety have limited the impact of this message one well known example is the crisis in flint michigan in 2015 the national resource defense council nrdc analyzed epa water testing data from many other communities as well their findings show that more than 18 million people were served by community water systems that had violated federal standards according to the nrdc the top five states with safe drinking water act sdwa violations by population in order were texas florida pennsylvania new jersey and georgia 15 these highly publicized incidents and reports naturally lead households to doubt the quality of their local water supply as a result they frequently turn to alternatives installing water filtration systems or drinking bottled water 16 in this paper we report the results of a 2018 survey of water customers of jacksonville electric authority jea the primary municipal water utility in northeast florida the survey includes detailed questions regarding self reported household water usage information availability information processing trust in institutions and demographic characteristics in addition in cooperation with jea we matched the survey results with administrative data on geographic location within the system using a bivariate probit regression method we estimate the determinants of water usage in the home in jacksonville fl the results show that concern for drinking water safety is the principal contributor of bottled water consumption moreover the evidence illustrates how information from water quality reports and objective measures of water hardness translate into the drinking water choice we also show that increases in the real cost of bottled water opportunity cost due to low access to retail suppliers is associated with a substitution of water filtration for bottled water 2 background established in 1895 the primary role of the not for profit community owned jea was to own operate and manage the electric system 17 in 1997 it took over the utility service offerings of the water and sewer systems previously operated by the city today jea is the primary water utility provider in the city of jacksonville duval county fl as well as for parts of neighboring st johns nassau and clay counties the jea drinking water system involves artesian wells water treatment plants the distribution grid of pipelines and customers meters 3 3 details of jea water supply system can be found at https www jea com about water supply currently there are 139 artesian wells that withdraw water from the florida aquifer the water is pumped to one of 38 water treatment plants where it flows through an aerator to remove the sulfur odor later the water is disinfected with chlorine per health regulations and enters over 4 700 miles of water lines for distribution every day jea supplies more than 110 million gallons of water to more than 348 000 customers as stipulated by the state of florida jea conducts a water quality monitoring program involving the collection and analysis of water samples from various locations throughout their treatment area in a typical year they collect more than 45 000 water samples and test for more than 100 bacteriological and chemical components according to the jea annual water quality reports most of the elements and minerals found in the drinking water occur naturally in the aquifer at very low levels and any odor is due to the presence of sulfur and iron bacteria 18 jea has always claimed that they make substantial investments to meet water quality standards per all regulatory requirements nevertheless jacksonville and jea have experienced their own bad press and local perceptions about the tap water quality remained mixed when the environmental working group ewg examined the quality of water supplies in a large group of major american cities between 2005 and 2009 the city of jacksonville ranked 10th worst 19 their findings showed that there were as many as 23 different types of toxic chemicals in the water supply in addition residents consistently report that their tap water has an unpleasant smell and taste these concerns are documented in our own pilot study conducted in 2016 20 21 subsequently jea failed certain water quality tests 18 and the source water assessment by the florida department of environmental protection identified potential sources of contamination in the vicinity of jea wells 22 given these recent developments we partnered with jea to conduct a customer survey designed to gauge quality perceptions and gain a better understanding of residents water consumption choices bottled water is considered a food product and is subject to the packaging and quality requirements of the food and drug administration fda in contrast quality of tap water is regulated by the environmental protection agency epa there is some confusion over which regulatory regime has higher standards 23 24 although bottled water marketing campaigns emphasizes the purity of their water sources there is relatively little evidence that bottled water is necessarily safer than tap water 25 26 in fact up to 25 of all bottled water originates from community water systems 27 nevertheless in many settings consumers believe bottled water is safer or tastes better if they have had adverse experiences with tap water or if their local provider has violated water quality standards 28 29 the research literature suggests the choice to consume bottled water is determined by perceptions of quality and safety of tap water convenience age and gender of household members presence of children household income education and skepticism towards public officials and institutions 30 34 people who complain about the taste of their tap water often turn to bottled water however blind taste tests show most people are unable to distinguish between tap and bottled water 35 36 highlighting the importance of perceptions in decision making however perceptions are easily conflated with objective water quality differences an implicit assumption within the existing research is that water quality remains invariant across regions and neighborhoods 37 though tap water comes from the same source and goes through the same quality control measures pipelines of different age and material can lead to quality differences for example on march 28 2020 in blanco county texas residents tap water had turned brown in the area of chimney valley road near highway 165 38 a controversial trenching work under the blanco river was expected to be the reason however this did not impact the other neighborhoods though this is a unique and exceptional example we argue that neighborhoods under the same water distributional system may experience differences in the tap water quality also the opportunity cost of alternatives to tap water may differ across communities 39 preferences differ access to affordable transportation is non uniform and every neighborhood does not enjoy the same convenience when it comes to retail suppliers therefore we hypothesize that the choice of drinking water in the home depends in part on the household s location within the system even though the ultimate source of the tap water is the same to our knowledge this is the first research that statistically tests this hypothesis 3 survey and data description this study uses survey data collected during the summer of 2018 all households who had a residential water meter from jea and an email address on record received an invitation email followed by periodic reminders to complete the online survey by focusing on a single city and water provider this study holds constant the source of municipal tap water and thereby highlights the importance of variation in perceived quality safety concerns of residents and location within the system this helps to ensure that the behaviors modeled are not attributable to municipal or regional differences and the inferences are driven by within city variation altogether 4958 respondents began the survey and 3718 reached the end resulting in a completion rate of 75 however not all responses were useable due to skipped questions and omitted responses our working sample uses 2614 responses based on the response rate calculator created by the american association for public opinion research the response rate is 4 9 40 this response rate is typical for long length email surveys in the united states 41 definitions and descriptive statistics for the variables used in the analysis appear in table 1 two variables listed in the table record usage of bottled water bottle water and water filters water filter in the home around 44 respondents mentioned using bottled water while nearly 57 of respondents mentioned using some type of water filter importantly approximately 21 of respondents report using both bottled water and water filters while about 20 use only unfiltered tap water having bottled water and or having a filtering system does not prevent people from sometimes using the tap water however when these choices are made it reveals a preference for added alternatives a desire to reduce reliance or dependence on the local tap water following the literature the study controls for respondents perceptions of water safety and aesthetics safe taste smell look respondents on average neither agree nor disagree with the statement that the tap water tastes and smells good they somewhat agree that the tap water looks good and is safe to assess the importance of information and media coverage of common complaints on water usage 25 42 respondents were asked if they had heard anything about any potential problems with the local water supply heard problems 22 59 respondents responded affirmatively 19 respondents also mentioned that they regularly check the water quality report check report we have also controlled for the water quality report jea water quality reports are organized according to five grids covering the service area 43 the total number of water quality violations in each grid is matched to the residential address of respondents violations the number of violations ranges between 1 and 6 distinctly 1 2 and 6 we have created dummy variables to present the different number of violations jea also publishes water hardness levels by zip code water is hard when it contains high levels of dissolved minerals primarily calcium and magnesium very hard water might have a salty taste and can cause unusual flavor in beverages the variable water hardness ranged between 136 and 368 parts per million represents the measured hardness level of the tap water in respondent s zip code attitudes toward publicly provided goods and services are sensitive to trust in authorities therefore respondents were asked how much trust they placed in accountability of jea trust jea on average respondents believe that they are highly accountable 22 82 respondents said that they have tested repaired or replaced their water heater recently water heater where 15 65 respondents did the same for their plumbing plumbing personal and household attributes are critical to decision making respondents were asked to report their family size family size and on average there are 2 74 members in each family with about 41 of the respondents with children kids most of the respondents 69 74 turned out to be long time more than 10 years residents of the area resident a little over 59 of the respondents are female gender the typical respondent is 49 years old age has some college education education and has an annual household income household income between 50 000 and 75 000 69 of the respondents are caucasian while 18 are african american more than 91 respondents claimed they are in good very good or excellent health health status considering that the jea service area includes the city of jacksonville and suburban communities from surrounding counties we judge this sample to be reasonably representative of the target population as described by recent census data 44 neighborhood characteristics might also influence the choice of drinking water source for example while agribusiness in the united states is efficient at meeting the caloric needs of the nation in the aggregate many families face a lack of physical or economic access and suffer from nutritional deficits the usda food access research atlas has identified neighborhoods by census tracts that lack access to the full range of a healthy diet 45 these areas are often referred to as food deserts low food access indicates limited access to retail stores which can change the opportunity cost of tap water substitutes especially bottled water in this study we combine our household level survey responses with locational usda data the key dummy variable low access indicates if the respondent lives in a low access food tract low access food tract is determined by census tracts where at least 500 people or 33 of the population live more than 1 mile urban areas or more than 10 miles rural areas from the nearest supermarket supercenter or large grocery store 27 of the respondents in our sample are located in low access tracts in addition to economic access to retail suppliers and tap water quality there are unobserved community characteristics that may determine choice of drinking water in the home to control for this source of heterogeneity each respondent was classified as residing in one of 7 health zones the duval county community health improvement plan chip separates duval county into 6 health zones hz which significantly differ demographically economically and consistently showed large health disparities in the community health status assessment as illustrated in fig 2 4 4 visit http duval floridahealth gov programs and services community health planning and statistics documents chip pdf for details we classified respondents residing in the surrounding suburban counties nassau st johns and clay county as zone 7 figs 1 and 2 offer a breakdown of our survey sample by health zones and counties given these zones are significantly different in their community characteristics and geography we expect that the diversity among these zones in their choice to drinking water source will be interesting and informative 4 empirical methodology consider the decision made by a household to reduce the dependence on tap water by drinking bottled water and or installing a water filter assume that the household aims to maximize utility by comparing all possibilities while the researcher does not observe these utilities she does observe the specific choice that a household has made conditional upon its circumstances moreover these alternatives to tap water are not mutually exclusive on the one hand water filters and bottled water may be complementary strategies to ensure quality drinking water on the other hand budget and time constraints might imply that if one mode is adopted then the household is less likely to adopt others our decision model captures this potential dependence by allowing for four potential outcomes drinking bottled water drinking filtered tap water drinking both bottled and filtered tap water and drinking unfiltered tap water only neither bottled nor filtered to capture this choice framework we estimate a bivariate probit model to explain two jointly determined decisions in which there is a possible non zero correlation in the random disturbances associated with a household s choices define the latent variable u 1 describing the desire to consume bottled water a similar latent variable u 2 describes the desire to use a water filter then define u 1 x 1 β 1 ε 1 y 1 1 if u 1 0 0 otherwise u 2 x 2 β 2 ε 2 y 2 1 if u 2 0 0 otherwise ε 2 ε 1 x 1 x 2 n 0 0 1 ρ ρ 1 the resulting bivariate probit model describes the joint probability associated with the two alternative modes of water usage conditional upon observable explanatory variables such as the respondents perception about tap water quality information level trust in government and household and geographic characteristics the associated log likelihood function accounts for the four possible outcomes maximization of this log likelihood function provides estimates of both the β coefficients and the correlation between the unobserved errors ρ 5 results table 2 presents the estimates from the bivariate probit model controlling for health zone fixed effects with standard errors corrected for clustering by health zone the key results reflecting perceptions of quality appear at the top of the table they indicate that the probability of using bottled water in the home decreases with the belief that the tap water is safe to drink by contrast the perceived safety of tap water is an insignificant determinant of water filter usage this suggests that respondents turn to bottled water when they are worried about tap water safety respondents aesthetic concerns about the tap water are captured by three variables taste smell and look the clearest result is captured by taste the more the respondents agree that their tap water tastes good the lower is their expected probability of using bottled or filtered water at home the look variable does not appear to capture any significant patterns while the smell variable produces some somewhat inconsistent estimates while 25 of the respondents reported some problems with the smell of the tap water approximately 58 at least somewhat agree that their tap water smells fine yet the respondents who somewhat disagree that their tap water smells good are less likely to use bottled water while the respondents who strongly agree or disagree are both less likely to use a water filter perceptions about the tap water safety smell look and taste are highly correlated in the sample table 3 and this may be one reason for inconsistencies in the aesthetic estimates the next set of variables illustrates the important difference between quality perception and observed characteristics the variable heard problems represents one channel through which perceptions are formed and it has a significant positive effect on the use of water filters significant positive coefficient that is if the respondent has heard about any potential problems with the water quality through conversation or in the news media he she is more likely to use water filters however there is no significant association between the variable heard problems and bottled water usage by contrast the variable water hardness is a physical characteristic of the tap water and the results suggest water hardness is associated with an increase in the consumption of bottled water significant positive coefficient other accounts of observable water quality include check report and violations on average those who self report regularly checking their official water quality report are less likely to use bottled water significant negative coefficient and more likely to use water filters significant positive coefficient the water quality report differs by grid location and this variation is captured by the variable violations the difference in the number of violations offers us the opportunity to compare how respondents react to a good versus bad report to explore this difference we interacted the variable check report with the variable violations the coefficient estimates are presented in the middle of table 2 where the base case is six violations in the water quality report and not checking coefficient estimates for interaction variables are not well suited for direct interpretation especially in nonlinear models thus we calculated the corresponding predicted probabilities for each of the six cases generated by the interaction holding all other variables constant 5 5 standard errors for the predicted probabilities are calculated using the delta method and are presented in parentheses for those households living in an area with one violation reading the report increases the probability of using tap water from 19 0 64 to 34 0 49 decreases the probability of using bottled water from 47 1 21 to 22 1 38 and decreases the probability of using a water filter from 53 1 20 to 49 1 11 all three of these differences are statistically significant at the 1 level we interpret this pattern as indicating that reading a good quality report only one violation increases respondents confidence in the tap water and reduces reliance on alternatives reading a report with two violations reduces the predicted probability of using the tap water from 27 2 27 to 13 1 35 increases the predicted probability of using bottled water from 32 1 19 to 47 0 74 and increases the predicted probability of using a water filter from 53 2 95 to 68 2 67 all three of these differences are statistically significant at the 1 level according to our results observing two violations is enough to trigger a shift away from tap water and toward alternatives for those households living in an area with six violations reading the report reduces the predicted probability of using tap water from 19 0 45 to 18 1 01 a statistically insignificant difference that is there is a pre existing distrust of water quality in this area illustrated by low tap water usage and reading the report does not make any real difference however reading the report decreases the predicted probability of using bottled water from 45 0 28 to 39 1 68 and increases the predicted probability of using a water filter from 56 0 51 to 62 1 79 both of these differences are statistically significant at the 1 level in this case reading the report does shift households away from bottled water and towards filtered water respondents who have tested repaired or replaced their water heater recently are more likely to use water filters significant positive coefficient but there is no association with bottled water usage this may be the result of common income constraints that is the time and money spent on a water heater may be an indication of affordability also the reasons to repair or replace a water heater may are likely correlated with water filter usage for example a major cause of water heater malfunction is hard water i e water with high mineral content a household that repairs or replaces its water heater due to hard water might naturally progress to installation of a water filter or water softener system as a growing metropolitan area jacksonville and its suburbs experience strong inflows of people from other parts of the u s and from abroad it can sometimes be difficult for new residents to adapt to regional differences such as the taste of the tap water it has been suggested that the difficulty to adopt to these differences may result in dissatisfaction with the tap water in jacksonville however our results are not consistent with this narrative rather we found that the probability of using bottled water increases with length of residency significant positive coefficient and that there is no relationship between length of residency and water filter usage the empirical model also includes a series of variables designed to capture demographic and economic characteristics of particular interest concerns the implications of income and education an increase in educational attainment is associated with a decrease in the probability of using bottled water significant negative coefficient also both income and educational accomplishments are associated with a higher probability of using water filters significant positive coefficient in short both knowledge and resources income lead respondents away from using bottled water and toward water filters also female respondents are less likely to use water filter than their male counterparts significant negative coefficient the result suggests african american respondents are more likely to use bottled water significant positive coefficient and less likely to use water filters significant negative coefficient these findings persist even after controlling for household income education family size and composition people s perceived confidence in respective authorities may also play significant role to determine the source of drinking water and our estimates confirm this expectation trust in the accountability of the jea is inversely related to the probability of drinking bottled water significant negative coefficient finally we find that the collection of fixed effects are statistically significant as a group that is even after controlling for household demographic and economic characteristics along with observable measures of water quality there remain unobserved geographic and neighborhood level features that drive water usage decisions most specifically our results indicate that the probability of using bottled water and water filters is significantly higher in all other health zones when compared to health zone 1 low access to supermarkets also seems to decrease the consumption of bottled water significant negative coefficient while increasing the use of water filters significant positive coefficient 6 discussion and conclusions the widespread use of bottled water is associated with significant personal expense and environmental damage although convenience is an important reason for the popularity of bottled water in public spaces this paper set out to investigate the determinants of the mode of water usage in the home consistent with prior research the results suggest that residential bottled water usage is strongly associated with perceived tap water safety 28 even after controlling for demographic economic and geographic characteristics in addition the estimation results suggest the use of water filters is sensitive to an income constraint and the level of education given the finding that some demographic groups appear to be more dependent on bottled water there is a potential public policy implication a municipal program designed to subsidize the purchase of in home water filters in certain economically challenged neighborhoods may help overcome some of the relevant economic barriers and thereby cut the dependence on bottled water additionally our results suggest that tap water safety concerns can be partially ameliorated by a widely distributed and well publicized water quality report conditional on other economic factors the area within the sample that featured the best water quality report one violation was the lofton oaks grid in nassau county nearly 17 of these households earn less than 50 000 year and about 39 earn 100 000 year or more in comparison the areas within the sample that were most likely to turn away from tap water after reading their water quality report were the ponte vedra and ponce de leon grids in st johns county two violations these areas are some of the wealthiest in the region with only 4 9 of the households earning less than 50 000 year and nearly 67 earning over 100 000 year respondents in this area have greater financial means to substitute away from the tap water and are consequently more sensitive to negative indicators of water quality as captured in the report the least responsive subsample to reading the water quality report was the major grid covering most of duval county six violations though there is considerable heterogeneity just over 27 of households earn less than 50 000 year and about 32 earn 100 000 year or more the rate of tap water usage is already very low and reading the report does not make a significant difference those who do read the report are more likely to use water filters a decision likely driven by cost factors that is to substitute consumption of bottled water with water filter which is financially more affordable much of the existing literature is based on national surveys that include respondents from different regions and customers of different utility service providers this approach complicates efforts to link economic behavior to individual level characteristics and perceptions perceptions are conditional on regional differences in organic composition of tap water as well as social and economic features of different communities our results are broadly consistent with the existing empirical literature and our pilot study but they also raise new questions about within system variation 6 6 we have estimated our model specifications with and without locational dummies although there is no change in significance there is noticeable changes in parameter values reinforcing the need to control for unobserved geographic characteristics we have found that african american households have a higher probability than other racial groups of using bottled water in the home according to the literature the result may be attributable to the racial and economic geography of the sample area featuring high concentrations of poverty among predominantly african american localities 42 46 these neighborhoods are also the source of persistent drinking water complaints in general 47 48 nevertheless we find that respondents from health zone 1 have a lower chance of drinking bottled or filtered water though 70 of the respondents in zone 1 are african americans this may seem contradictory however according to the usda food access research atlas health zone 1 includes three food desert clusters where approximately 38 of the population is classified as low income and low access 49 the issue of access is so severe that in 2019 the jacksonville city council approved incentive programs to attract supermarkets in these areas 50 this limitation on accessible alternatives operates as a barrier to purchase bottled water regardless of concerns for tap water quality the estimation results confirm this consumption of bottled water decreases with low access to supermarkets given that we have included controls for water quality perception observable measures of quality and access to retail stores the significant fixed effects suggest other factors that relate to drinking water choices in the home one plausible explanation for this difference and a fruitful avenue for future research is inter neighborhood variation in water utility infrastructure and supply lines in addition this study has shown that the information in the municipal water quality report appears to have significant influence on household behavior under certain circumstances another important area for future research is to compare the relative effectiveness of different communication strategies and information campaigns designed to provide transparency and build trust in municipal authorities author statement chiradip chatterjee conceptualization methodology writing original draft preparation writing reviewing and

8652,consumption of bottled water in the u s continues to grow despite the higher user price and greater environmental cost relative to municipal tap water convenience is surely one reason for this trend but it is less relevant for in home consumption of bottled water the existing literature highlights perceptions of quality access to information and personal experience as important factors influencing water usage in the home in this paper we report the results of a 2018 survey of water customers of jacksonville electric authority jea the primary municipal water utility in northeast florida the survey includes detailed questions regarding self reported household water usage information availability information processing trust in institutions and demographic characteristics in addition in cooperation with jea we matched the survey results with administrative data on geographic location within the system using a bivariate probit regression method we estimate the determinants of water usage in the home the results show that concern for drinking water safety is the principal contributor of bottled water consumption moreover the evidence illustrates how information from water quality reports and objective measures of water hardness translate into the drinking water choice we also show that greater transaction costs of bottled water due to low access to retail suppliers is associated with a substitution of water filtration for bottled water keywords water usage risk perception survey research bivariate probit jel classification d12 q25 q53 1 introduction the outbreak of covid 19 in the united states instigated hoarding of food cleaning essentials and paper products as people stockpiled essential supplies however many seemed puzzled why some would hoard bottled water as the water in most homes is safe 1 while it is true that some communities suffer from documented water quality crises 2 3 aggregate bottled water consumption far exceeds the immediate needs of these communities the popularity of bottled water is much more a result of the perceived quality of tap water than its chemical composition 4 5 when households lack confidence in tap water safety they naturally turn to alternatives such as bottled water or water filtration systems bottling water began in the united kingdom during the 17th century because of an increase in demand for spa going and water therapy the american bottled water industry started in 1844 as therapeutic properties of spring water became popular among citizens 6 bottled water was considered a safer alternative to municipal water supplies in the 19th century due to possible contaminations with pathogens like cholera and typhoid however in the early 20th century the popularity of bottled water declined as the introduction of water chlorination alleviated many concerns about water borne diseases in municipal water supplies the resurgence in bottled water consumption at the end of the 20th century is associated with the relative convenience of disposable containers and a renewed emphasis on purity annual consumption of bottled water in the u s has increased from 16 2 gallons per capita in 1990 to 42 3 gallons per capita in 2018 7 notably bottled water has been the most popular packaged drink for three consecutive years 1 1 please visit https www globenewswire com news release 2020 01 10 1969028 0 en consumers want bottled water to be available wherever drinks are sold and if it s not most will choose another packaged beverage that uses much more plastic html for access to the report consumption of bottled water is the most expensive alternative to tap water both to an individual and to society in the united states bottled water ranges from 240 to 10 000 times more expensive than tap water 8 10 in addition the plastic container is a potential source of chemical migration that may cause additional health hazards 11 12 and the production and disposal of the plastic bottles are environmentally damaging 13 according to an estimate in 2011 production of the plastic necessary for the water bottles purchased in the united states uses 17 million barrels of crude oil every year this was equivalent to one day s worth of oil consumption in america a cost of nearly 1 795 billion 14 according to the environmental protection agency epa only a little over 8 of the bottles arrive in the recycling stream 2 2 please visit https www epa gov facts and figures about materials waste and recycling plastics material specific data for more information according to a recent new york times report 51 with more restrictions imposed by china thailand and india on imported scrap a growing number of cities are reducing recycling efforts the remaining bottles are either combusted or dumped into landfills the landfilled bottles generate incinerated toxic byproducts such as chlorine gas and ash containing heavy metals some of the bottles end up in streams rivers and the ocean contributing to contamination of water bodies given this colossal environmental damage organized anti bottled campaigns and utility services have tried to communicate the message that tap water is as safe as bottled water however controversies over tap water safety have limited the impact of this message one well known example is the crisis in flint michigan in 2015 the national resource defense council nrdc analyzed epa water testing data from many other communities as well their findings show that more than 18 million people were served by community water systems that had violated federal standards according to the nrdc the top five states with safe drinking water act sdwa violations by population in order were texas florida pennsylvania new jersey and georgia 15 these highly publicized incidents and reports naturally lead households to doubt the quality of their local water supply as a result they frequently turn to alternatives installing water filtration systems or drinking bottled water 16 in this paper we report the results of a 2018 survey of water customers of jacksonville electric authority jea the primary municipal water utility in northeast florida the survey includes detailed questions regarding self reported household water usage information availability information processing trust in institutions and demographic characteristics in addition in cooperation with jea we matched the survey results with administrative data on geographic location within the system using a bivariate probit regression method we estimate the determinants of water usage in the home in jacksonville fl the results show that concern for drinking water safety is the principal contributor of bottled water consumption moreover the evidence illustrates how information from water quality reports and objective measures of water hardness translate into the drinking water choice we also show that increases in the real cost of bottled water opportunity cost due to low access to retail suppliers is associated with a substitution of water filtration for bottled water 2 background established in 1895 the primary role of the not for profit community owned jea was to own operate and manage the electric system 17 in 1997 it took over the utility service offerings of the water and sewer systems previously operated by the city today jea is the primary water utility provider in the city of jacksonville duval county fl as well as for parts of neighboring st johns nassau and clay counties the jea drinking water system involves artesian wells water treatment plants the distribution grid of pipelines and customers meters 3 3 details of jea water supply system can be found at https www jea com about water supply currently there are 139 artesian wells that withdraw water from the florida aquifer the water is pumped to one of 38 water treatment plants where it flows through an aerator to remove the sulfur odor later the water is disinfected with chlorine per health regulations and enters over 4 700 miles of water lines for distribution every day jea supplies more than 110 million gallons of water to more than 348 000 customers as stipulated by the state of florida jea conducts a water quality monitoring program involving the collection and analysis of water samples from various locations throughout their treatment area in a typical year they collect more than 45 000 water samples and test for more than 100 bacteriological and chemical components according to the jea annual water quality reports most of the elements and minerals found in the drinking water occur naturally in the aquifer at very low levels and any odor is due to the presence of sulfur and iron bacteria 18 jea has always claimed that they make substantial investments to meet water quality standards per all regulatory requirements nevertheless jacksonville and jea have experienced their own bad press and local perceptions about the tap water quality remained mixed when the environmental working group ewg examined the quality of water supplies in a large group of major american cities between 2005 and 2009 the city of jacksonville ranked 10th worst 19 their findings showed that there were as many as 23 different types of toxic chemicals in the water supply in addition residents consistently report that their tap water has an unpleasant smell and taste these concerns are documented in our own pilot study conducted in 2016 20 21 subsequently jea failed certain water quality tests 18 and the source water assessment by the florida department of environmental protection identified potential sources of contamination in the vicinity of jea wells 22 given these recent developments we partnered with jea to conduct a customer survey designed to gauge quality perceptions and gain a better understanding of residents water consumption choices bottled water is considered a food product and is subject to the packaging and quality requirements of the food and drug administration fda in contrast quality of tap water is regulated by the environmental protection agency epa there is some confusion over which regulatory regime has higher standards 23 24 although bottled water marketing campaigns emphasizes the purity of their water sources there is relatively little evidence that bottled water is necessarily safer than tap water 25 26 in fact up to 25 of all bottled water originates from community water systems 27 nevertheless in many settings consumers believe bottled water is safer or tastes better if they have had adverse experiences with tap water or if their local provider has violated water quality standards 28 29 the research literature suggests the choice to consume bottled water is determined by perceptions of quality and safety of tap water convenience age and gender of household members presence of children household income education and skepticism towards public officials and institutions 30 34 people who complain about the taste of their tap water often turn to bottled water however blind taste tests show most people are unable to distinguish between tap and bottled water 35 36 highlighting the importance of perceptions in decision making however perceptions are easily conflated with objective water quality differences an implicit assumption within the existing research is that water quality remains invariant across regions and neighborhoods 37 though tap water comes from the same source and goes through the same quality control measures pipelines of different age and material can lead to quality differences for example on march 28 2020 in blanco county texas residents tap water had turned brown in the area of chimney valley road near highway 165 38 a controversial trenching work under the blanco river was expected to be the reason however this did not impact the other neighborhoods though this is a unique and exceptional example we argue that neighborhoods under the same water distributional system may experience differences in the tap water quality also the opportunity cost of alternatives to tap water may differ across communities 39 preferences differ access to affordable transportation is non uniform and every neighborhood does not enjoy the same convenience when it comes to retail suppliers therefore we hypothesize that the choice of drinking water in the home depends in part on the household s location within the system even though the ultimate source of the tap water is the same to our knowledge this is the first research that statistically tests this hypothesis 3 survey and data description this study uses survey data collected during the summer of 2018 all households who had a residential water meter from jea and an email address on record received an invitation email followed by periodic reminders to complete the online survey by focusing on a single city and water provider this study holds constant the source of municipal tap water and thereby highlights the importance of variation in perceived quality safety concerns of residents and location within the system this helps to ensure that the behaviors modeled are not attributable to municipal or regional differences and the inferences are driven by within city variation altogether 4958 respondents began the survey and 3718 reached the end resulting in a completion rate of 75 however not all responses were useable due to skipped questions and omitted responses our working sample uses 2614 responses based on the response rate calculator created by the american association for public opinion research the response rate is 4 9 40 this response rate is typical for long length email surveys in the united states 41 definitions and descriptive statistics for the variables used in the analysis appear in table 1 two variables listed in the table record usage of bottled water bottle water and water filters water filter in the home around 44 respondents mentioned using bottled water while nearly 57 of respondents mentioned using some type of water filter importantly approximately 21 of respondents report using both bottled water and water filters while about 20 use only unfiltered tap water having bottled water and or having a filtering system does not prevent people from sometimes using the tap water however when these choices are made it reveals a preference for added alternatives a desire to reduce reliance or dependence on the local tap water following the literature the study controls for respondents perceptions of water safety and aesthetics safe taste smell look respondents on average neither agree nor disagree with the statement that the tap water tastes and smells good they somewhat agree that the tap water looks good and is safe to assess the importance of information and media coverage of common complaints on water usage 25 42 respondents were asked if they had heard anything about any potential problems with the local water supply heard problems 22 59 respondents responded affirmatively 19 respondents also mentioned that they regularly check the water quality report check report we have also controlled for the water quality report jea water quality reports are organized according to five grids covering the service area 43 the total number of water quality violations in each grid is matched to the residential address of respondents violations the number of violations ranges between 1 and 6 distinctly 1 2 and 6 we have created dummy variables to present the different number of violations jea also publishes water hardness levels by zip code water is hard when it contains high levels of dissolved minerals primarily calcium and magnesium very hard water might have a salty taste and can cause unusual flavor in beverages the variable water hardness ranged between 136 and 368 parts per million represents the measured hardness level of the tap water in respondent s zip code attitudes toward publicly provided goods and services are sensitive to trust in authorities therefore respondents were asked how much trust they placed in accountability of jea trust jea on average respondents believe that they are highly accountable 22 82 respondents said that they have tested repaired or replaced their water heater recently water heater where 15 65 respondents did the same for their plumbing plumbing personal and household attributes are critical to decision making respondents were asked to report their family size family size and on average there are 2 74 members in each family with about 41 of the respondents with children kids most of the respondents 69 74 turned out to be long time more than 10 years residents of the area resident a little over 59 of the respondents are female gender the typical respondent is 49 years old age has some college education education and has an annual household income household income between 50 000 and 75 000 69 of the respondents are caucasian while 18 are african american more than 91 respondents claimed they are in good very good or excellent health health status considering that the jea service area includes the city of jacksonville and suburban communities from surrounding counties we judge this sample to be reasonably representative of the target population as described by recent census data 44 neighborhood characteristics might also influence the choice of drinking water source for example while agribusiness in the united states is efficient at meeting the caloric needs of the nation in the aggregate many families face a lack of physical or economic access and suffer from nutritional deficits the usda food access research atlas has identified neighborhoods by census tracts that lack access to the full range of a healthy diet 45 these areas are often referred to as food deserts low food access indicates limited access to retail stores which can change the opportunity cost of tap water substitutes especially bottled water in this study we combine our household level survey responses with locational usda data the key dummy variable low access indicates if the respondent lives in a low access food tract low access food tract is determined by census tracts where at least 500 people or 33 of the population live more than 1 mile urban areas or more than 10 miles rural areas from the nearest supermarket supercenter or large grocery store 27 of the respondents in our sample are located in low access tracts in addition to economic access to retail suppliers and tap water quality there are unobserved community characteristics that may determine choice of drinking water in the home to control for this source of heterogeneity each respondent was classified as residing in one of 7 health zones the duval county community health improvement plan chip separates duval county into 6 health zones hz which significantly differ demographically economically and consistently showed large health disparities in the community health status assessment as illustrated in fig 2 4 4 visit http duval floridahealth gov programs and services community health planning and statistics documents chip pdf for details we classified respondents residing in the surrounding suburban counties nassau st johns and clay county as zone 7 figs 1 and 2 offer a breakdown of our survey sample by health zones and counties given these zones are significantly different in their community characteristics and geography we expect that the diversity among these zones in their choice to drinking water source will be interesting and informative 4 empirical methodology consider the decision made by a household to reduce the dependence on tap water by drinking bottled water and or installing a water filter assume that the household aims to maximize utility by comparing all possibilities while the researcher does not observe these utilities she does observe the specific choice that a household has made conditional upon its circumstances moreover these alternatives to tap water are not mutually exclusive on the one hand water filters and bottled water may be complementary strategies to ensure quality drinking water on the other hand budget and time constraints might imply that if one mode is adopted then the household is less likely to adopt others our decision model captures this potential dependence by allowing for four potential outcomes drinking bottled water drinking filtered tap water drinking both bottled and filtered tap water and drinking unfiltered tap water only neither bottled nor filtered to capture this choice framework we estimate a bivariate probit model to explain two jointly determined decisions in which there is a possible non zero correlation in the random disturbances associated with a household s choices define the latent variable u 1 describing the desire to consume bottled water a similar latent variable u 2 describes the desire to use a water filter then define u 1 x 1 β 1 ε 1 y 1 1 if u 1 0 0 otherwise u 2 x 2 β 2 ε 2 y 2 1 if u 2 0 0 otherwise ε 2 ε 1 x 1 x 2 n 0 0 1 ρ ρ 1 the resulting bivariate probit model describes the joint probability associated with the two alternative modes of water usage conditional upon observable explanatory variables such as the respondents perception about tap water quality information level trust in government and household and geographic characteristics the associated log likelihood function accounts for the four possible outcomes maximization of this log likelihood function provides estimates of both the β coefficients and the correlation between the unobserved errors ρ 5 results table 2 presents the estimates from the bivariate probit model controlling for health zone fixed effects with standard errors corrected for clustering by health zone the key results reflecting perceptions of quality appear at the top of the table they indicate that the probability of using bottled water in the home decreases with the belief that the tap water is safe to drink by contrast the perceived safety of tap water is an insignificant determinant of water filter usage this suggests that respondents turn to bottled water when they are worried about tap water safety respondents aesthetic concerns about the tap water are captured by three variables taste smell and look the clearest result is captured by taste the more the respondents agree that their tap water tastes good the lower is their expected probability of using bottled or filtered water at home the look variable does not appear to capture any significant patterns while the smell variable produces some somewhat inconsistent estimates while 25 of the respondents reported some problems with the smell of the tap water approximately 58 at least somewhat agree that their tap water smells fine yet the respondents who somewhat disagree that their tap water smells good are less likely to use bottled water while the respondents who strongly agree or disagree are both less likely to use a water filter perceptions about the tap water safety smell look and taste are highly correlated in the sample table 3 and this may be one reason for inconsistencies in the aesthetic estimates the next set of variables illustrates the important difference between quality perception and observed characteristics the variable heard problems represents one channel through which perceptions are formed and it has a significant positive effect on the use of water filters significant positive coefficient that is if the respondent has heard about any potential problems with the water quality through conversation or in the news media he she is more likely to use water filters however there is no significant association between the variable heard problems and bottled water usage by contrast the variable water hardness is a physical characteristic of the tap water and the results suggest water hardness is associated with an increase in the consumption of bottled water significant positive coefficient other accounts of observable water quality include check report and violations on average those who self report regularly checking their official water quality report are less likely to use bottled water significant negative coefficient and more likely to use water filters significant positive coefficient the water quality report differs by grid location and this variation is captured by the variable violations the difference in the number of violations offers us the opportunity to compare how respondents react to a good versus bad report to explore this difference we interacted the variable check report with the variable violations the coefficient estimates are presented in the middle of table 2 where the base case is six violations in the water quality report and not checking coefficient estimates for interaction variables are not well suited for direct interpretation especially in nonlinear models thus we calculated the corresponding predicted probabilities for each of the six cases generated by the interaction holding all other variables constant 5 5 standard errors for the predicted probabilities are calculated using the delta method and are presented in parentheses for those households living in an area with one violation reading the report increases the probability of using tap water from 19 0 64 to 34 0 49 decreases the probability of using bottled water from 47 1 21 to 22 1 38 and decreases the probability of using a water filter from 53 1 20 to 49 1 11 all three of these differences are statistically significant at the 1 level we interpret this pattern as indicating that reading a good quality report only one violation increases respondents confidence in the tap water and reduces reliance on alternatives reading a report with two violations reduces the predicted probability of using the tap water from 27 2 27 to 13 1 35 increases the predicted probability of using bottled water from 32 1 19 to 47 0 74 and increases the predicted probability of using a water filter from 53 2 95 to 68 2 67 all three of these differences are statistically significant at the 1 level according to our results observing two violations is enough to trigger a shift away from tap water and toward alternatives for those households living in an area with six violations reading the report reduces the predicted probability of using tap water from 19 0 45 to 18 1 01 a statistically insignificant difference that is there is a pre existing distrust of water quality in this area illustrated by low tap water usage and reading the report does not make any real difference however reading the report decreases the predicted probability of using bottled water from 45 0 28 to 39 1 68 and increases the predicted probability of using a water filter from 56 0 51 to 62 1 79 both of these differences are statistically significant at the 1 level in this case reading the report does shift households away from bottled water and towards filtered water respondents who have tested repaired or replaced their water heater recently are more likely to use water filters significant positive coefficient but there is no association with bottled water usage this may be the result of common income constraints that is the time and money spent on a water heater may be an indication of affordability also the reasons to repair or replace a water heater may are likely correlated with water filter usage for example a major cause of water heater malfunction is hard water i e water with high mineral content a household that repairs or replaces its water heater due to hard water might naturally progress to installation of a water filter or water softener system as a growing metropolitan area jacksonville and its suburbs experience strong inflows of people from other parts of the u s and from abroad it can sometimes be difficult for new residents to adapt to regional differences such as the taste of the tap water it has been suggested that the difficulty to adopt to these differences may result in dissatisfaction with the tap water in jacksonville however our results are not consistent with this narrative rather we found that the probability of using bottled water increases with length of residency significant positive coefficient and that there is no relationship between length of residency and water filter usage the empirical model also includes a series of variables designed to capture demographic and economic characteristics of particular interest concerns the implications of income and education an increase in educational attainment is associated with a decrease in the probability of using bottled water significant negative coefficient also both income and educational accomplishments are associated with a higher probability of using water filters significant positive coefficient in short both knowledge and resources income lead respondents away from using bottled water and toward water filters also female respondents are less likely to use water filter than their male counterparts significant negative coefficient the result suggests african american respondents are more likely to use bottled water significant positive coefficient and less likely to use water filters significant negative coefficient these findings persist even after controlling for household income education family size and composition people s perceived confidence in respective authorities may also play significant role to determine the source of drinking water and our estimates confirm this expectation trust in the accountability of the jea is inversely related to the probability of drinking bottled water significant negative coefficient finally we find that the collection of fixed effects are statistically significant as a group that is even after controlling for household demographic and economic characteristics along with observable measures of water quality there remain unobserved geographic and neighborhood level features that drive water usage decisions most specifically our results indicate that the probability of using bottled water and water filters is significantly higher in all other health zones when compared to health zone 1 low access to supermarkets also seems to decrease the consumption of bottled water significant negative coefficient while increasing the use of water filters significant positive coefficient 6 discussion and conclusions the widespread use of bottled water is associated with significant personal expense and environmental damage although convenience is an important reason for the popularity of bottled water in public spaces this paper set out to investigate the determinants of the mode of water usage in the home consistent with prior research the results suggest that residential bottled water usage is strongly associated with perceived tap water safety 28 even after controlling for demographic economic and geographic characteristics in addition the estimation results suggest the use of water filters is sensitive to an income constraint and the level of education given the finding that some demographic groups appear to be more dependent on bottled water there is a potential public policy implication a municipal program designed to subsidize the purchase of in home water filters in certain economically challenged neighborhoods may help overcome some of the relevant economic barriers and thereby cut the dependence on bottled water additionally our results suggest that tap water safety concerns can be partially ameliorated by a widely distributed and well publicized water quality report conditional on other economic factors the area within the sample that featured the best water quality report one violation was the lofton oaks grid in nassau county nearly 17 of these households earn less than 50 000 year and about 39 earn 100 000 year or more in comparison the areas within the sample that were most likely to turn away from tap water after reading their water quality report were the ponte vedra and ponce de leon grids in st johns county two violations these areas are some of the wealthiest in the region with only 4 9 of the households earning less than 50 000 year and nearly 67 earning over 100 000 year respondents in this area have greater financial means to substitute away from the tap water and are consequently more sensitive to negative indicators of water quality as captured in the report the least responsive subsample to reading the water quality report was the major grid covering most of duval county six violations though there is considerable heterogeneity just over 27 of households earn less than 50 000 year and about 32 earn 100 000 year or more the rate of tap water usage is already very low and reading the report does not make a significant difference those who do read the report are more likely to use water filters a decision likely driven by cost factors that is to substitute consumption of bottled water with water filter which is financially more affordable much of the existing literature is based on national surveys that include respondents from different regions and customers of different utility service providers this approach complicates efforts to link economic behavior to individual level characteristics and perceptions perceptions are conditional on regional differences in organic composition of tap water as well as social and economic features of different communities our results are broadly consistent with the existing empirical literature and our pilot study but they also raise new questions about within system variation 6 6 we have estimated our model specifications with and without locational dummies although there is no change in significance there is noticeable changes in parameter values reinforcing the need to control for unobserved geographic characteristics we have found that african american households have a higher probability than other racial groups of using bottled water in the home according to the literature the result may be attributable to the racial and economic geography of the sample area featuring high concentrations of poverty among predominantly african american localities 42 46 these neighborhoods are also the source of persistent drinking water complaints in general 47 48 nevertheless we find that respondents from health zone 1 have a lower chance of drinking bottled or filtered water though 70 of the respondents in zone 1 are african americans this may seem contradictory however according to the usda food access research atlas health zone 1 includes three food desert clusters where approximately 38 of the population is classified as low income and low access 49 the issue of access is so severe that in 2019 the jacksonville city council approved incentive programs to attract supermarkets in these areas 50 this limitation on accessible alternatives operates as a barrier to purchase bottled water regardless of concerns for tap water quality the estimation results confirm this consumption of bottled water decreases with low access to supermarkets given that we have included controls for water quality perception observable measures of quality and access to retail stores the significant fixed effects suggest other factors that relate to drinking water choices in the home one plausible explanation for this difference and a fruitful avenue for future research is inter neighborhood variation in water utility infrastructure and supply lines in addition this study has shown that the information in the municipal water quality report appears to have significant influence on household behavior under certain circumstances another important area for future research is to compare the relative effectiveness of different communication strategies and information campaigns

8653,we extend the axiomatic nash bargaining approach to the context of interregional water sharing in order to assess the approach s normative implications in a general equilibrium ge framework the ge model is applied to a water development project proposed for the wasatch front and cache valley regions of utah the bear river development project brdp we demonstrate conceptually how an allocation rule and attendant net regional welfare measures are endogenously determined as equilibrium solutions to the bargaining problem numerical analysis based upon a simulation model calibrated to current data reveals that nash bargaining is generally infeasible as a solution mechanism for sharing surplus water supplies generated through the implementation of the brdp with or without potential ex post side payments made between cache valley and the wasatch front only in the special case of 1 larger future regional population sizes 2 a hypothetical joint per capita cost share arrangement where total project i e fixed costs are shared equally across the two regions 3 hypothetically larger water augmentation rates and 4 the ignoring of potential environmental costs is the nash bargaining solution viable otherwise for all other scenarios where the analysis is based upon current or future population sizes joint or region specific cost share arrangements lower or higher water augmentation rates

classification c71 d58 r19 keywords nash bargaining solution optimal water sharing agreement water trading 1 introduction the management of interregional or transboundary surface water supplies is a key marker of human history 1 2 historically the extent to which contiguous regions have successfully shared common water supplies has impacted whether they have prospered or declined as early as 2500 bc the sumarian city states umma and lagash were engaged in intermittent wars over irrigation supplies and cropland boundaries wars lasting for 150 years commonly held water in this instance served as a disunifying force in contrast completion of the prodigious grand canal in the 7th century ad created the world s largest inland waterway transportation network which unified china into a nation state with a strong centralized government presiding over an expansive array of productive resources 1 1 1 solomon 1 chronicles the histories of several of the world s great canals e g the opening of new york s erie canal in 1825 egypt s suez canal in 1869 and the panama canal in 1914 describing in each case how international commerce was consequently extended similar stories are told of the world s major dams e g arizona and nevada s boulder dam later renamed hoover dam india s bhakra dam egypt s aswan dam china s three gorges dam turkey s ataturk dam and brazil and paraquay s itaipu dam where instead of international commerce more tightly controlled apportionment of water primarily for agricultural and municipal industrial uses within and in some cases between regions was the targeted outcome see 3 for a critique of 1 over the past half century in the face of global climate change and persistent population growth the question of how to efficiently and equitably manage shared water supplies has taken on added urgency in several regions of the world regions where impending shortages in supply portend conflict in the absence of cooperative agreements c f 1 4 7 the desert nations of the arabian peninsula libya along with israel and jordan for example could no longer support food self sufficiency with internal water resources as early as 70 years ago 1 6 facing less severe but no less challenging water allocation issues 10 nile basin countries including egypt ethiopia sudan and uganda have developed a cooperative framework agreement cfa as part of the nile basin initiative nbi with the aim of better managing the nile river and its riparian zones by most accounts the nbi process has proven to be tenuous at best at worst disruptive c f 8 9 in the midst of interregional conflicts such as these regions with competing jurisdictions over existing or potentially new surface water supplies have fostered effective formal cooperative arrangements through compacts and water markets with the common aim of more efficiently and equitably managing their water supplies for example relatively well functioning markets have been established in the western u s and southeastern australia markets facilitating both intra agricultural and agricultural urban trades via temporary lease agreements or purchase of actual water rights 10 2 2 not to say that these regions have historically eschewed conflict and allocative inefficiency for instance in the early 1900 s los angeles municipal water authorities ruthlessly gained control of the owens river constructing a 250 mile aqueduct that carries water from the river valley to the city owens valley farmers responded by dynamiting sections of the aqueduct and standing off against armed city agents between 1924 and 1927 1 11 further south in california irrigators in the imperial valley water district consume 70 of the state s 4 4 million acre foot allocation of colorado river water at a steeply subsidized cost resulting in profligate farming practices and the planting of water thirsty crops 1 allocative inefficiencies such as these persist in regions across the us as a result of excessive price subsidization 12 australia s murray darling basin mdb is site of the world s most advanced water trading program a program engaging not only irrigators municipalities and industries but also non landholding environmental stakeholders and financial investors in the trading of unbundled temporary and permanent water rights 13 the program has ended irrigation subsidies and requires farmers to pay for the maintenance of dams and canals after a little more than a decade cellphone enabled water trading among farmers and between farmers city authorities and environmental stakeholders has skyrocketed with roughly 80 of the basin s irrigators by now having participated in at least one trade 13 the mdb program even allows farmers whose irrigation systems have created soil salinity problems to purchase transpiration credits from forest owners whose trees remove salinity through their root systems 1 3 3 the mdb program has nevertheless attracted criticism see 14 15 and 16 in the western us water trading has evolved more stubbornly than it has in the mdb for the region as a whole including the states of arizona california colorado idaho montana new mexico nevada oregon texas utah wyoming and washington slightly over 700 short term leases and roughly 1500 sales occurred over the twenty year period from 1987 2007 over half of the lease arrangements and three quarters of the sales were either agricultural to agricultural or agricultural to urban 12 since then trading volume has gradually increased particularly in the drier southwestern states for example in arizona where over 30 of surface water withdrawals are drawn from the over allocated colorado river the diversion of water supplies to rural communities in the face of limited supply has become of paramount importance for state water managers 17 4 4 relative to us averages the southwestern states of arizona california and texas confront higher annual population growth 2 45 vs 1 15 between 1920 and 2018 higher temperature 61 1 f vs 52 5 f and less precipitation 20 68 in vs 30 48 in 17 from 2009 to 2018 nearly 151 000 acre feet of water was traded annually which comprises approximately 4 of the state s annual consumptive use as 17 report arizona has witnessed a near seven fold increase in total volume traded since 2009 with a clear trend upwards since 2012 and a large spike in 2018 coinciding with exceptional drought conditions in terms of types of water trades consummated 92 were in the form of leases while only a small volume 8 were tallied as permanent sales although water markets have been slow to evolve on a broader scale in the western us evidence from the operation of these existing markets suggests that gains associated with more efficient allocation of surface water resources can in fact materialize through trading 12 18 23 5 5 see 24 25 and 26 for insightful explanations of the theoretical prerogative of water trading see 27 29 and 30 for discussions on the role of regulators in the establishment and maintenance of water trading programs michelsen and young 31 propose a unique approach targeting intermittent drought under this approach temporary transfers of irrigation water provide secure water supplies to non agricultural users during drought periods the exercise of an option transfers water to higher valued uses only when needed while preserving water for agricultural use during normal water supply conditions trades are stimulated by large enough differentials in water values between current water owners and potential buyers in the western us for example the majority of trades have been from subsidized agricultural sellers to unsubsidized urban buyers who are grappling with projected increases in water demand as previously mentioned the impetus for developing surface water markets generally arises for one of two purposes 1 as a tool for reallocation of common water supplies between agricultural uses including both water rights and irrigation services and 2 as a means of expanding a growing urban area s access to safe water supplies 32 the setting for this paper aligns with the second purpose in this paper we extend the axiomatic nash bargaining approach to the context of interregional water sharing in order to assess the approach s normative implications in a general equilibrium ge framework 6 6 as binmore et al 1986 show the axiomatic theory of cooperative bargaining initially proposed by nash 33 has a tight relationship with the non cooperative sequential strategic approach to bargaining also proposed by nash 33 and later developed by rubinstein 34 cooperative bargaining relies solely upon the information in the pair of utility functions representing the welfare of the bargainers and the bargainers respective disagreement points or reservation utility levels below which the bargainers will not voluntarily participate in the bargaining scheme nash 33 identifies seven desirability axioms that are satisfied by a unique cooperative outcome four of which are generally considered key among them 1 pareto efficiency 2 symmetry in the bargainers respective utility levels net of their disagreement points 3 invariance to affine transformations of bargainers utility functions and 4 independence of irrelevant alternatives subsequent studies of the nash bargaining problem have suggested families of cooperative solutions satisfying more generalized versions of nash s original axioms 35 and more limited sets of axioms 36 37 we apply the ge model to a water development project proposed for the wasatch front and cache valley regions of utah the bear river development project brdp and conceptually demonstrate how an allocation rule and attendant net regional welfare measures are endogenously determined as equilibrium solutions to the bargaining problem numerical analysis based upon a simulation model calibrated to current data reveals that nash bargaining is generally infeasible as a solution mechanism for sharing surplus water supplies generated through the implementation of the brdp with and without potential ex post side payments made between cache valley and the wasatch front only in the special case of 1 larger future regional population sizes 2 a hypothetical joint per capita cost share arrangement where total project i e fixed costs are shared equally across the two regions 3 hypothetically larger water augmentation rates and 4 the ignoring of potential environmental costs is the nash bargaining solution viable otherwise for all other scenarios where the analysis is based upon current or future population sizes joint or region specific cost share arrangements lower or higher water augmentation rates and internalized or externalized environmental costs the nash bargaining solution is found to be unattainable as a potential mechanism to share surplus water supplies produced by the brdp our conceptual model and calibrated numerical analysis deepens the pool of studies that apply axiomatic bargaining solutions to existing resource sharing problems our particular contribution to this literature centers on the method we develop to derive more of a general equilibrium allocation rule and associated regional net welfare measures as endogenous outcomes of a cooperative bargaining framework 7 7 this method is different than 2 partial equilibrium flexible water allocation rule which determines efficient allocations based upon alternative exogenously determined river flows i e a rule specifying an efficient schedule of river water allocations between upstream and downstream users our model considers an alternative setting where regions essentially control their own region specific water supplies e g their own reservoirs filled predominantly by rivers flowing strictly within their respective boundaries but their geographic proximity nonetheless permits the establishment of a trading arrangement between the two subject to conveyance costs our application of this method to the brdp draws salience from utah s recommended water strategy 38 as 38 points out utah s agricultural systems use over 80 of water consumed statewide these systems are spread across the state in urban areas where they compete for available water supplies and rural areas where agriculture is likely to remain the predominant sector accommodating the state s projected population growth will require continued reductions in per capita water usage as well as implementation of additional water projects to optimize use of limited supplies among the urws s key recommendations is to augment water efficiency and conservation improvements with shifts in water supplies within and between sectors of the economy while mitigating any associated impacts in the basins of origin ultimately achieving both aggregative and allocative efficiency statewide will require changes in statutes that allow leasing of agricultural water rights as well as development of additional water resources such as via the brdp 38 the next section provides a brief review of the nash bargaining literature section 3 describes our study area and the brdp section 4 develops a conceptual model of the nash bargaining problem in a general equilibrium framework section 5 presents the results of our numerical analysis section 6 concludes 2 review of the nash bargaining literature a number of applications of axiomatic bargaining solutions in support of interregional water sharing or international environmental agreements ieas can be found in the literature four of these studies are most pertinent to ours 39 41 and 42 zhu et al 39 derive the nash bargaining solution for a hypothetical transboundary water sharing arrangement along the mekong river between upstream china and the downstream mekong river committee mrc consisting of the southeast asian nations of thailand laos cambodia and vietnam in their framework an international transfer of funds from an institution external to china and the mrc can be incorporated in the solution to provide stronger incentives for joint management of the river wet and dry seasons are distinguished and in each region water users are aggregated into three representative sectors industry and households hydropower generators and agriculture irrigators asymmetric weights are assigned to the nash bargaining function reflecting china s relative bargaining strength in general zhu et al 39 find relatively large welfare gains for both regions associated the nash bargaining solution the size and distribution of which depend upon the regions relative bargaining powers and the extent of international transfers dam capacity in both regions increases in the bargaining outcome however fixed capital costs associated with these increases in capacity are unaccounted for han et al 40 apply the nash bargaining solution to the hanjiang river basin china s largest and most developed tributary of the yangtze river basin in the southern region of the country the authors solve a bi level optimization model where a nash bargaining solution is determined among representative agents located in five distinct zones of the basin the solution is constrained by both a water resource constraint and a reservation benefit constraint the reservation benefit constraint ensures that no representative agent obtains less benefit from the nash bargaining allocation than the average benefit obtained from a first best allocation made by a basin wide manager within this framework han et al 40 find that all but one representative agent the most upstream agent would willingly participate in the nash bargaining scheme in a model where two producing countries north and south with differentiated abatement technologies competitively produce a homogeneous good for sale to consumers in a non producing third country cai and li 41 find that in a nash bargaining solution the north transfers a positive side payment to the south and the south reduces its emission level below its status quo level when either the south s valuation of the side payment or the north s marginal damage from the externality is sufficiently high i e when the regions are strongly asymmetric this result also holds when rather than consumers in a third country purchasing the homogeneous good from the north and south consumers in the south instead choose both domestically produced and imported amounts of the good the authors conclude that strong asymmetry among regions can produce self enforcing agreements dijkstra and nentjes 42 compare the nash bargaining and exchange matching lindahl eml solutions where under the eml each agent specifies her demand for and supply of the public good according to her personal exchange rate 8 8 the personal exchange rate for a given agent is based upon how much society as a whole agrees to contribute for each unit of that agent s contribution the agent states how much he will contribute to the public good at this exchange rate in equilibrium the exchange rates are such that each agent demands the same amount of the public good and this amount is the aggregate contribution across all agents with linear or quadratic benefits and quadratic costs eml and the nash bargaining solutions are equivalent in the presence of two agents with more than two agents high benefit low cost agents are better off under eml than nash bargaining taken together the results from these studies suggest that side payments made between agents participating in a nash bargaining scheme or transfers from third party organizations may be necessary to ensure the voluntary participation of all agents as 42 show side payments may be necessary for the nash bargaining scheme to coincide with an unconstrained pareto efficient solution further the extent of asymmetry in the benefits obtained by the agents is likely to impact their willingness to participate these findings serve as points of reference for our ensuing analysis concerning the self enforcing properties of the nash bargaining solution 3 the study area our study area encompasses two regions located in northern utah the wasatch front and cache valley fig 1 located in the north central part of the state comprised of weber davis salt lake utah and box elder counties the wasatch front is utah s largest metropolitan region roughly 80 of utah s population resides in this region which is home to the state s capital salt lake city and accounts for approximately 90 of the state s gross state product 43 the wasatch front stretches along and is hemmed in by the wasatch mountains to the east and great salt lake to the west because of these geographical barriers much of the land along the wasatch front has been developed the wasatch front has experienced considerable growth since the 1950s its population increasing by over 300 to its current 2 5 million residents with projections of the population reaching six million residents by 2065 44 much of the remaining undeveloped land is rapidly being developed forcing local governments and regional authorities to contend with problems of urban sprawl and related transportation issues according to perlich et al s 44 projections just under 30 of utah s population will reside in utah county by 2065 as will 40 of new residents to the state during this 50 year time span just over 20 of new residents will reside in salt lake county currently the wasatch front s most populous county forty and roughly 25 of those employed in the state are projected to be working in salt lake and utah counties respectively by 2065 davis county is projected to experience the state s third highest employment growth rate during this same time frame cache valley s population is also growing rapidly population is expected to roughly double in size from 135 000 currently to 230 000 by 2050 in comparison to most other regions in utah the valley is relatively rich in water jub engineers 45 reports a roughly 30 000 acre feet total supply surplus annually for the valley in terms of the valley s developed water supplies roughly 80 is consumed by irrigated cropland the remaining 20 devoted to municipal and industrial uses 45 the valley is also distinguished by its rich agricultural heritage according to recent usda estimates cache valley s average sales per farm is roughly three times as large as davis salt lake and weber counties and roughly 1 5 times as large as utah county s 46 cache valley is estimated to have slightly more than 37 of its land area in farms while the average for the wasatch front counties is just over 22 46 in 1991 the utah state legislature passed the bear river development act henceforth the act which directed the utah division of water resources udwr to develop up to 220 000 acre feet of the bear river s surface waters and its tributaries as part of the brdp of this amount 160 000 acre feet would be allocated to the wasatch front and the remaining 60 000 acre feet allocated to cache valley 47 as fig 2 shows the main stem of the bear river flows through cache valley to the cutler reservoir from there the river flows unimpeded south through box elder county to the bear river bird refuge near man made willard bay 47 as indicated in fig 2 the project entails constructing a raw water pipeline from cutler dam in cache valley to a proposed pumping station located at the site of a potential reservoir in fielding and the junction vault from there the water is piped to the proposed west haven treatment plant in weber county and subsequently routed through the weber basin and jordan valley water conservancy districts along the wasatch front an additional raw water pipeline is proposed from whites reservoir located in box elder county to the reservoir in fielding and the junction vault the water from whites reservoir represents a transfer of water within the wasatch front from box elder county in the northern region of the front to the more populous weber davis salt lake and utah counties in the southern region to help visualize more generally the type of water sharing arrangement captured by our conceptual and numerical models developed in sections 4 and 5 consider fig 3 panel a depicts the existing water topography between two regions prior to the implementation of a water development project such as the brdp in our case we can think of region 1 as representing the wasatch front and region 2 as cache valley region 1 is larger in size denoted by its larger non water resource base l 1 relative to region 2 s l 2 and is less agricultural denote by the region s lighter shade of green although the two region s available water supplies w 1 and w 2 are roughly equal in size region 1 s is smaller relative to both its non water resource base and population size region 2 s water supply is replenished by a larger river r a e g the bear river in fig 2 and its tributary r b a slightly weaker flowing river r c e g continuation of the bear river in fig 2 flows between the two regions and region 1 s available water supply is replenished by moderate and weaker flowing rivers r d and r e respectively panel b in fig 3 depicts the interregional water topography after the water development project is completed we see that river r c s flow between the two regions is enhanced reflecting the greater amount of water now transferred from region 2 to region 1 e g via the raw water pipeline extending from cutler dam in cache county to the west haven treatment plant in weber county in fig 2 in addition an additional water source is developed in region 1 e g the whites reservoir in fig 2 the water from this new source is piped south within region 1 via river r f as a result of the water transfers within region 1 and between regions 1 and 2 region 1 s main available water supply is now larger udwr s 47 cost estimates for the brdp range from approximately 1 5 billion to 2 8 billion the act requires the state of utah to fund the planning studies design and construction and environmental mitigation costs associated with the project the act also requires that the funding will be repaid by the regions within a period not to exceed 50 years at a 4 interest rate set by the utah board of water resources assuming a total cost estimate of 1 7 billion which includes reservoir and pipeline construction and other facilities to deliver the raw water from storage and diversions to regional delivery points udwr 47 reports annual repayments of just under 22 million for cache valley and slightly more than 58 million for the wasatch front we utilize these cost estimates in our numerical analysis in section 5 9 9 additional costs will be incurred by the regions to deliver and treat water from the brdp e g treatment operation and maintenance costs costs that are not covered by the overall funding provided by the state further potential environmental costs affiliated with the brdp are unaccounted for 4 the conceptual model we begin by setting notation in the context of a baseline autarkic model of two contiguous regions region 1 represents cache valley and region 2 the wasatch front we then specify the nash bargaining model and distinguish its key differences with the baseline model 4 1 baseline model assume region i 1 2 produces good j a c using inputs k w n according to production function 1 q i j f i j z i j k β i j k where input vector z i j k z i a w z i a n z i c w z i c n 0 and parameter vector β i j k β i a w β i a n β i c w β i c n 0 is defined such that function f i j exhibits constant returns to scale in vector z i j k outputs a and c denote composite agricultural and all other non agricultural goods respectively and inputs w and n represent respective amounts of water and a composite of all other inputs e g capital labor and land used to produce q i j 10 10 we distinguish the water input from a composite of non water inputs in order to maintain our focus on the sharing of water between the two regions in the ensuing numerical analysis in section 5 similarly we distinguish the agricultural good from a composite of non agricultural goods to reflect cache valley s relatively large agricultural sector and to simplify our ensuing analysis total cost associated with the production of good j in region i using inputs k is defined as 2 c i j k w i k z i j k i 1 2 j a c k w n where w i k 0 denotes region i s input prices assumed common across sectors a and c in each region 11 11 fixed costs are normalized to zero here in order to facilitate the role they play in section 5 in determining the social net benefits associated with implementing the brdp regional endowments of inputs w i and n i are defined as 12 12 we follow the computational general equilibrium cge literature by endowing the regions themselves rather than the regions consumers with resource levels w i and n i 48 3 w i j z i j w i 1 2 j a c 4 n i j z i j n i 1 2 j a c per capita welfare in region i is represented by utility function 5 u i u i x i α i i 1 2 where x i x i a x i c 0 represents region i s per capita consumption vector and parameter vector α i α i a α i c 0 region i s associated per capita consumption constraint is defined as 6 m i i j p i j x i j i 1 2 j a c where p i j 0 denotes per unit prices of goods j a c produced in region i and m i represents region i s per capita wealth level in the baseline equilibrium as in the nash bargaining model described in section 4 2 region i independently and simultaneously solves its cost minimization and per capita utility maximization problems for cost minimization input vector z i j k is chosen to minimize eq 2 subject to eqs 1 3 and 4 with region i taking input prices w i k as given conceptually the first order conditions for this problem solve for vector z i j and constraints 3 and 4 solve for input prices w i k the production function s curvature conditions in tandem with binding regional resource constraints ensures a unique interior solution to region i s cost minimization problem for utility maximization consumption vector x i is chosen to maximize eq 5 subject to 6 with region i taking prices p i j and per capita wealth level m i as given the utility function s curvature conditions in tandem with a linear consumption constraint likewise ensure a unique interior solution to region i s utility maximization problem two sets of market clearing conditions close the model 7 q i j n i x i j i 1 2 j a c 8 r i n i m i i 1 2 where r i j p i j q i j and n i denotes region i s population size eq 7 states that in equilibrium regional supplies of goods a and c equate with their corresponding consumption demands on a per capita basis which in turn effectively determine equilibrium prices p i j conditions 8 indicate that regional wealth is equal to regional gross domestic product gdp i e the sum of regional revenue levels from the production of goods a and c again on a per capita basis 13 13 following 48 our general equilibrium model abstracts from the household sector s resource allocation decisions i e allocation of z i j k thus regional revenues accruing to the household sector in the form of wealth is consistent with non negative profits obtained at the industry level if its resource allocation decision had instead been explicitly modeled then household sector wealth would accrue in the form of industry costs c i j plus profits the baseline equilibrium is ultimately characterized by the regions respective input demand output supply output demand indirect utility and cost functions as well as their respective regional gdps z i j k 0 z i j k ω i 0 p i j 0 w i k 0 q i j 0 q i j ω i 0 p i j 0 w i k 0 x i j 0 x i j ω i 0 p i j 0 w i

p i j 0 and w i k 0 are determined endogenously via eqs 3 4 and 7 i 1 2 j a c k w n the 0 superscript denotes baseline equilibrium values admittedly designating the baseline equilibrium as the status quo is an abstraction from any bilateral economic relationship at any given point in time regions are involved in multiregional economic relationships thus by abstracting to a bilateral relationship we either ignore or exogenize any impacts on that relationship emanating from pre existing internal trade between the two regions as well as external trade between each region and its other trading partners currently the wasatch front and cache valley do not internally trade their respective water supplies the focal point of this study further as we discuss in section 5 the data used to calibrate our numerical model are denominated in dollars which enables us to normalize all prices in the model to one thus mitigating potential bias associated with the prices respective equilibrium values nevertheless to the extent that the wasatch front and cache valley engage in trade relationships with other regions statewide nationwide and globally both our baseline equilibrium and nash bargaining solution likely underestimate the regions respective wealth levels 4 2 nash bargaining solution unlike the 47 engineered regional water allocations resulting from the brdp the nash bargaining solution henceforth nbs explicitly satisfies 33 original desirability properties of pareto optimality symmetry invariance and independence of irrelevant alternatives indeed the nbs uniquely satisfies these properties 49 as such the solution is both normative and positive further the nbs enables us to endogenously determine compensating variation welfare measures for each region associated with the water sharing arrangement although demonstrative in nature the nbs serves as a starting point for obtaining estimates of these measures endogenously via numerical optimization 14 14 of course benefit transfers from previous studies that have estimated water values in agriculture use municipal industrial use and for environmental purposes represent the most expedient method of affixing welfare measures to the specific amounts of water supply generated by the brdp c f 50 to begin the regional costs specified in eqs 2 are now independently minimized subject to 4 and a new interregional version of constraint 3 9 w 1 r 1 w 1 1 r 2 w 2 i j z i j w i 1 2 j a c constraint 9 accounts for the fact that regional water supplies z i j w i 1 2 j a c are tradable in the nbs i e that the two regions now share a common supply of available water priced at a common rate of w w as they would via a project such as the brdp further available water supplies in regions 1 and 2 respectively are augmented by growth factors r 1 r 2 0 mimicking the respective increases in cache valley s and the wasatch front s available water supplies as a result of the brdp in particular that cache valley s percentage increase exceeds the wasatch front s for example in accordance with 47 51 and 52 the brdp is expected to result in roughly 20 and 10 increases in cache valley s and the wasatch front s available water supplies respectively implying r 1 0 2 and r 2 0 1 a pair of per capita regional utility values u 1 u 2 denotes the nbs these are solution values for the interregional maximization problem 10 x 1 x 2 m a x u 1 x 1 α 1 u 1 0 u 2 x 2 α 2 u 2 0 subject to 11 u 1 u 2 u 1 0 u 2 0 and constraints 6 eq 11 constrains the nbs to deliver each region no less per capita welfare than they would otherwise obtain in the baseline equilibrium i e the status quo as depicted in 10 where each region s utility function is unweighted we effectively assign a non discriminatory egalitarian welfare function across the two regions egalitarianism in this sense is epitomized by the resulting nbs allocation u 1 u 2 satisfying u 1 u 1 0 u 2 u 2 0 i e each region retains an equal share of the payoff gain since we have no a priori reason to favor one region s per capita welfare level over the other in the nbs as reflected in 47 and 38 the standard unweighted bargaining function is deemed most appropriate for this normative exercise 15 15 see 34 for a generalization of the standard nash bargaining function market clearing conditions 7 continue to hold in the nbs for each region s composite good c however to account for the possibility of trade in embodied water i e the good produced in cache valley that uses water relatively intensively composite agricultural good a conditions 7 corresponding to good a are now rewritten as 12 i q i a i n i x i a i 1 2 similar to the interregional water constraint specified in 9 market clearing condition 12 accounts for the fact that agricultural composite good a is tradable in the nbs at a common equilibrium price p a market clearing conditions 8 continue to hold in the nbs albeit in modified forms 13 m 1 r 1 n 1 w w 1 r 1 w

regions given that region 1 is initially relatively well endowed with an available water supply and its supply is augmented by a relatively large growth factor i e r 1 r 2 0 we expect w w 1 r 1 w 1 j z 1 j w n 1 0 in 13 and w w 1 r 2 w 2 j z 2 j w n 2 0 in 14 i e that cache valley will export its excess water to the wasatch front in the nbs equilibrium similar to the baseline equilibrium the nbs is ultimately characterized by the regions respective input demand output supply output demand indirect utility and cost functions as well as regional gdps z i j k z i j k ω i p i c p a w i n w w q i

regional welfare measures compensating variations and net benefits associated with the regions having chosen to participate in the nbs as a means of allocating water shares arising from the brdp region i s per capita compensating variation c v i solves 15 u i ω i r i c v i u i 0 u i ω i 0 r i 0 i 1 2 eq 15 indicate that c v i is the dollar amount that when subtracted from region i s per

participate in the nbs and thereby obtain the solution s water allocation letting c o s t i represent region i s per capita share of the fixed capital costs associated with participating in the brdp these costs are explained in more detail in section 5 the region s net benefit n b i from choosing to participate in the nbs is defined as 16 n b i c v i c o s t i i 1 2 the ultimate goal of our numerical analysis presented below is to derive n b i estimates for cache valley and the wasatch front 5 numerical analysis we begin this section by specifying the respective functional forms chosen for f i j z i j k β i j k i 1 2 j a c k w n and u i x i α i i 1 2 in eqs 1 and 5 next we discuss the model s calibration to available data for the wasatch front and cache valley followed by a presentation of the model s numerical results we finish this section with a sensitivity analysis of the results 16 16 our numerical analyses are performed using gams v 33 2 0 r4f23b21 wex wei x86 64bit ms windows 5 1 model specification we specify the regional production function for q i j in eq 1 as cobb douglas 17 q i j γ i j k z i j k β i j k i 1 2 j a c k w n where parameters γ i j capture the effects of neutral technological change in sectors j a c in region i and marginal productivity parameters satisfy β i j w β i j n 1 i 1 2 j a c we also specify region i s per capita utility function u i in eq 5 as cobb douglas 18 u i δ i j x i j α i j i 1 2 j a c where parameters δ i capture the regional effects of neutral welfare change associated with a bundle of consumption goods j a c consistent with our scale assumption for production and to help ensure a sparse parameter set for calibration purposes we also assume that α i a α i c 1 i 1 2 17 17 our functional forms and parameter restrictions reflect both the simplicity and substitutability typically built into computable general equilibrium cge models particularly cge models aggregated at national or regional levels 48 these models are in turn calibrated to highly aggregated data which often warrant sparse parameter sets cf 53 55 5 2 model calibration model calibration is based upon data obtained from four separate sources water supply and use data are taken from 51 and 52 and the remaining county level economic and production data is obtained from 56 regional population data is taken from 57 column 3 of table 1 compiles the corresponding data for cache valley and column 4 the data for the wasatch front reported here at the per county level i e averaged over the five counties comprising the wasatch front region 18 18 we conducted our analysis using average county values for the wasatch front in order to enhance comparability with the single county level cache valley as noted in the table for simulation purposes the data in table 1 is compiled in a social accounting matrix sam and then scaled according to the procedure recommended in 48 from table 1 we see that the average wasatch front county is indeed relatively well endowed with the composite resource which in turn is allocated primarily to the production of its composite good as a result for our baseline equilibrium the quantity of the composite good produced in the wasatch front is considerably larger than that produced in cache valley further the population size of the average wasatch front county is roughly three times larger than cache valley s based upon eqs 1 8 from section 4 1 with 17 and 18 from section 5 1 substituted for 1 and 5 respectively and the first order conditions for the cost minimization and utility maximization problems described in section 3 calibration of the baseline equilibrium results in the parameter values reported in table 2 we normalized the price of the composite good to one in each region and observed the remaining prices each solve endogenously to one hence in line with 48 all prices in our baseline equilibrium are normalized to one i e p i j w i j k 1 i 1 2 j a c k w n this normalization comports with our numerical analysis since our input and production data in table 1 are denominated in dollars for future reference note that since the calibration exercise is based upon data contained in table 1 and this data defines our baseline equilibrium table 1 represents both the data for calibration and the baseline equilibrium from table 2 we see that cache valley and the average county in the wasatch front share similar values for the neutral technology shift parameters γ i j i 1 2 j a c and substitution parameters in production β i j k i 1 2 j a c k w n cache valley

represents the common supply of available water as a result of the brdp s implementation left hand side of constraint 9 variable w i t 0 0 represents the value of region i s water exported imported and c v i denotes region i s per capita compensating variation measure as defined in eq 15 also included in table 3 are the nbs values for per capita consumption levels x i j regional gdp levels r i and prices p a w i n w w i 1 2 j a c we note that because all variables are denominated in dollars these prices should be interpreted as value adjustment factors rather than per unit prices per se 19 19 the composite good s value adjustment factor in each region p i c i 1 2 continues to be normalized to one in the nbs lastly table 3 includes per capita annual repayments on the fixed costs associated with participating in the brdp c o s t i i 1 2 based upon 47 projections for cache valley and the wasatch front although 47 allocates specific repayment cost shares to three of the wasatch front s water conservancy districts the jordan valley weber basin and bear river water conservancy districts and thus attributes these cost shares to respective wasatch front counties we aggregate the cost shares across all wasatch front counties and divide by the front s total population to derive its per capita regional cost share to begin we compare our nbs results for z i j k and q i j with what are effectively the benchmark equilibrium values z i j k 0 and q i j 0 i 1 2 j a c k w n from table 1 recall that the data in table 1 mimic the benchmark equilibrium by design of the calibration exercise we see that as expected the value of water consumption under the nbs for production of both the agricultural and composite goods increases by larger percentages in the typical wasatch front county than in cache valley this outcome is consistent with the pattern of trade in water depicted by the values for w i t i 1 2 in table 3 over 1 3 million worth of water is traded annually in the nbs between cache valley and the average wasatch front county as a result of the brdp relatively minor changes occur in both regions with respect to the value of the composite input used in the production of the agricultural and composite goods interestingly relatively larger increases in the value of agricultural composite good production occur in the wasatch front cache valley most importantly for our purposes are the results for c v i and c o s t i i 1 2 contained in table 3 clearly the net benefits for each region from participating in the nbs as a means of distributing resources resulting from implementation of the brdp are negative appealing to eq 16 we find that cache valley s per capita net benefit is roughly 145 per person 19 22 164 50 and the typical wasatch front county s is approximately 13 per person 9 78 23 12 these results suggest that if cache valley and the wasatch front were to consider participating in an nbs agreement as a means of dividing the expected net surplus resulting from the brdp s expected water augmentation rates and cost share arrangement neither region would voluntarily agree to participate rather than sharing a net surplus the regions would be forced to share a net deficit 5 4 sensitivity analysis we test the sensitivity of our nbs results from section 5 3 in two different settings one assuming current regional population sizes see table 1 the other assuming projected population sizes in 2045 58 20 20 the year 2045 represents the midpoint of 47 50 year planning horizon in both settings we consider each of the following three effects first we measure the sensitivity of regional i s net benefit n b i to successive increases in 47 projected water augmentation rates from their baseline levels of r 1 0 2 and r 2 0 1 see table 2 we assume successive increases in these rates by a factor of 0 05 e g from r 1 0 2 r 2 0 1 to r 1 0 25 r 2 0 15 to r 1 0 3 r 2 0 2 etc given the baseline results of n b i 0 i 1 2 from section 5 3 our goal here is to measure the extent to which the brdp would hypothetically need to costlessly augment the regions available water supplies in order for the baseline results to be reversed i e for n b i 0 i 1 2 second we measure the sensitivity of section 5 3 s baseline results to economy wide aggregation of the brdp s annual repayment costs rather than region wide cost shares recall from section 5 3 that c o s t i i 1 2 is region i s per capita cost share under the brdp agreement here we consider a hypothetical joint per capita cost share arrangement henceforth denoted as c o s t whereby the project s total annual repayment cost of 80 million is divided equally among cache valley s and the wasatch front s aggregated population sizes of 2 642 046 current aggregate population size and 3 750 696 projected aggregate population size by 2045 respectively and third based upon 59 average estimate that resource and environmental costs account for 62 of the typical water development project s total accounting cost we measure the sensitivity of our nbs results to the inclusion of these external costs fig 4 depicts our results for the sensitivity of regional i s net benefit n b i to successive costless increases in 47 projected water augmentation rates from their baseline levels of r 1 0 2 and r 2 0 1 assuming current regional population sizes the figure s horizontal axis charts the successive increases in r 1 r 2 denoted as r c a c h e r w f respectively and its vertical axis measures corresponding per capita regional compensating variation levels relative to both regional and economy wide annual repayment costs each measured in person year cache valley s per capita compensating variation curve denoted c v c a c h e and annual repayment cost curve denoted c o s t c a c h e are depicted in the color gray and the average wasatch front county s compensating variation curve denoted c v w f and annual repayment cost curve denoted c o s t w f are depicted in blue the hypothetical aggregate cost share curve denoted c o s t is depicted in the color red 21 21 the corresponding data table for both figs 4 and 5 is contained in appendix a from fig 4 we see that when facing their respective region specific per capita cost shares i e c o s t c a c h e and c o s t w f cache valley s per capita net benefit is negative at all water augmentation rates and the wasatch front s per capita net benefit becomes positive at point b corresponding roughly to r c a c h e 1 425 r w f 1 325 referring to the corresponding data table in appendix a we see that the wasatch front s per capita net benefit equals 1 40 and cache valley s equals 113 55 at r c a c h e 1 45 r w f 1 35 the closest discrete augmentation rate combination associated with positive net benefits in the wasatch front hence without a side payment made from the wasatch front to cache valley the nbs is unattainable even at noticeably larger albeit hypothetical water augmentation rates to see this we multiply the wasatch front s per capita net benefit of 1 40 by the region s total population size of 2 508 305 referring to table 1 this is equal to the per county population size of 501 661 multiplied by the five counties comprising the wasatch front which equals 3 511 627 we then divide this amount by cache valley s population size of 133 741 which equals 26 26 since this potential per capita side payment from the wasatch front is well below cache valley s negative per capita net benefit of 113 55 we conclude that even with a potential side payment from the wasatch front to cache valley the nbs is not viable to the contrary when facing the hypothetical joint per capita cost share arrangement represented by the hashed horizontal red line at c o s t 30 28 in fig 4 cache valley s per capita net benefit becomes positive at point a corresponding roughly to r c a c h e 1 275 r w f 1 175 however now the wasatch front s per capita net benefit is negative at all water augmentation rates using the same method as was used above to show that no side payment from the wasatch front to cache valley can support the nbs under the brdp s proposed regional cost shares we find that cache valley s maximum per capita side payment of 0 13 is well beneath the wasatch front s negative per capita net benefit of 14 25 indicating that the nbs is unsupportable under hypothetical joint cost sharing as well 22 22 the nbs is unattainable under joint cost sharing even at the highest water augmentation rate combination of r c a c h e 1 5 r w f 1 4 since the highest per capita side payment cache valley is capable of making at this rate combination is 1 40 which is still beneath the wasatch front s negative per capita net benefit of 3 13 fig 5 depicts our results again for the sensitivity of region i s net benefit n b i to successive increases in 47 projected water augmentation rates assuming current regional population sizes but this time in the presence of now internalized environmental costs ecs from the figure we see that when ecs are internalized neither region attains positive per capita net benefits at any water augmentation rate combination when facing the hypothetical joint per capita cost share arrangement represented by the hashed horizontal red line at c o s t 49 05 cache valley s per capita net benefit becomes positive at point a corresponding roughly to r c a c h e 1 43 r w f 1 33 clearly even with a potential side payment from cache valley to the wasatch front at any possible water augmentation rate combination the nbs is not viable lastly we present numerical results for the future population setting for reference purposes we begin by comparing current and future population estimates in table 4 we see that populations in all counties are expected to increase quite significantly with the greatest percentage increase expected for the wasatch front s utah county fig 6 depicts our associated sensitivity results for the future population setting without internalized ecs the corresponding data table for both figs 6 and 7 is contained in appendix b 23 23 for this analysis we assume that the brdp s annual repayment costs as well as regional per capita compensating variations c v i i 1 2 remain constant in the face of growing regional population sizes in general we would expect per capita compensating variations to change in response to changes in production and input use levels as the regions s respective economies grow in comparison with the results presented in fig 4 we again see that when facing their respective region specific per capita cost shares c o s t c a c h e and c o s t w f cache valley s per capita net benefit is negative at all water augmentation rates r c a c h e and r w f the wasatch front s per capita net benefit becomes positive at point b corresponding roughly to r c a c h e 1 3 r w f 1 2 clearly with or without a side payment from the wasatch front to cache valley the nbs is unattainable however when facing the hypothetical joint per capita cost share arrangement represented by the hashed horizontal red line at c o s t 21 33 cache valley s per capita net benefit becomes positive at point a corresponding roughly to r c a c h e 1 225 r w f 1 125 and the wasatch front s per capita net benefit becomes positive at point c corresponding roughly to r c a c h e 1 4 r w f 1 3 from appendix b data table we see that between these two water augmentation rate combinations cache valley is unable to afford the necessary side payment to entice the wasatch front to participate in the nbs thus the nbs is unattainable unless augmentation rates reach the r c a c h e 1 4 r w f 1 3 levels where the wasatch front s per capita net benefit also becomes positive at this water augmentation rate combination the nbs is viable without the need for side payments fig 7 depicts our final set of results in this case for internalized ecs in the presence of future population levels similar to our previous results the nbs is unattainable with or without side payments and whether annual repayment cost shares are region specific as stipulated in 47 or hypothetically administered according to a joint per capita cost share arrangement in the case of region specific cost shares the point at which the wasatch front s net benefit becomes positive point b does not generate a large enough net benefit to fund a side payment to cache valley that would garner its participation in the nbs similarly in the case of a joint cost share arrangement the point at which cache valley s net benefit becomes positive point a does not generate a large enough net benefit to fund a side payment to the wasatch front 6 summary and conclusions in this paper we have extended the axiomatic nash bargaining approach to the context of interregional water sharing in order to assess the approach s normative implications in a general equilibrium framework as 33 showed the nbs uniquely satisfies four properties desired in any sharing agreement pareto efficiency symmetry in the bargainers respective utility levels net of their disagreement points invariance to affine transformations of bargainers utility functions and independence of irrelevant alternatives we have applied our conceptual general equilibrium model to a water development and sharing project proposed for the wasatch front and cache valley regions of utah the bear river development project brdp and demonstrated how an allocation rule and attendant net regional welfare measures are endogenously determined as equilibrium solutions to the bargaining problem numerical analysis based upon a simulation model calibrated to current data reveals that nash bargaining is generally infeasible as a solution mechanism for sharing surplus surface water supplies generated through the implementation of the brdp with or without potential ex post side payments made between cache valley and the wasatch front only in the special case of 1 larger future regional population sizes 2 a hypothetical joint per capita cost share arrangement where total project costs are shared equally across the two regions 3 hypothetically larger water augmentation rates and 4 ignoring potential environmental costs is the nash bargaining solution viable otherwise for all other scenarios the nbs is found to be unattainable as a potential mechanism to share surplus water supplies produced by the brdp it is interesting to note that our admittedly pessimistic findings for the brdp align with those reached for another major water development and sharing agreement proposed for the southern part of utah the lake powell pipeline lpp project in the case of the lpp evidence suggests that washington county which would receive approximately 95 of the project s water supply will incur debt and thereby be forced to increase water rates and or increase impact fees at levels deemed financially unsustainable 60 62 for example 62 estimate annual per capita repayment costs for washington county residents of 369 761 which dwarf those estimated by udwr 47 for the brdp examined in this study although 62 and 60 focus exclusively on the cost side of the ledger the lpp s relatively large per capita repayment costs points to a likely inviability under a nash bargaining framework at least to the extent to which the compensating variation measures calculated in this study for cache valley and the wasatch front apply to residents of washington county the major limitation of our numerical analysis is its reliance on highly aggregated data across industries and sectors of the economies that drive the main uses of water in the two regions our current level of aggregation to the agricultural and composite good sector levels dispels more disaggregated information about the regional economies that could at the very least refine our numerical results as such our numerical results are perhaps at this stage more demonstrative than actionable from a policymaking perspective nevertheless the results are suggestive of issues that should be addressed as a project such as the brdp moves closer to implementation questions concerning the cost share arrangement water augmentation rates and the extent to which environmental costs are explicitly accounted for need to be answered should total project costs be shared equally across the two regions or assigned regionally as they are currently specified in the brdp to what extent can the project s water augmentation rates be increased in order to ensure an economically viable interregional water sharing agreement to what extent should potential environmental costs be incorporated in the analysis upfront while our analysis has not explicitly incorporated potential effects from climate change the framework for our analysis suggests that as river flow diminishes in response to reduced snowpack and higher year round temperatures in both the wasatch front and cache valley as indicated by us environmental protection agency usepa 63 the viability of nash bargaining as a mechanism to share surplus water supplies produced by the brdp will hinge on two opposing influences on the supply side reduced water availability will tend to diminish potential economic surpluses resulting from the nbs however on the demand side it could be that sans aggressive water conservation efforts enacted by regional regulatory authorities household willingness to pay for water supplied via the brdp will increase enough to offset the anticipated supply side effect particularly among wasatch front households the results from this study suggest the offset would need to be considerable a transcendent question is whether surplus sharing mechanisms such as the nash bargaining solution have a place in the public decision making rubric can mechanisms like this be operationalized to inform actual interregional surplus sharing decisions we believe the answer is yes this paper demonstrates how the mechanism can potentially be utilized to generate endogenous measures of net regional welfare which in turn provides a basis upon which to determine the economic viability of water sharing arrangements declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

classification c71 d58 r19 keywords nash bargaining solution optimal water sharing agreement water trading 1 introduction the management of interregional or transboundary surface water supplies is a key marker of human history 1 2 historically the extent to which contiguous regions have successfully shared common water supplies has impacted whether they have prospered or declined as early as 2500 bc the sumarian city states umma and lagash were engaged in intermittent wars over irrigation supplies and cropland boundaries wars lasting for 150 years commonly held water in this instance served as a disunifying force in contrast completion of the prodigious grand canal in the 7th century ad created the world s largest inland waterway transportation network which unified china into a nation state with a strong centralized government presiding over an expansive array of productive resources 1 1 1 solomon 1 chronicles the histories of several of the world s great canals e g the opening of new york s erie canal in 1825 egypt s suez canal in 1869 and the panama canal in 1914 describing in each case how international commerce was consequently extended similar stories are told of the world s major dams e g arizona and nevada s boulder dam later renamed hoover dam india s bhakra dam egypt s aswan dam china s three gorges dam turkey s ataturk dam and brazil and paraquay s itaipu dam where instead of international commerce more tightly controlled apportionment of water primarily for agricultural and municipal industrial uses within and in some cases between regions was the targeted outcome see 3 for a critique of 1 over the past half century in the face of global climate change and persistent population growth the question of how to efficiently and equitably manage shared water supplies has taken on added urgency in several regions of the world regions where impending shortages in supply portend conflict in the absence of cooperative agreements c f 1 4 7 the desert nations of the arabian peninsula libya along with israel and jordan for example could no longer support food self sufficiency with internal water resources as early as 70 years ago 1 6 facing less severe but no less challenging water allocation issues 10 nile basin countries including egypt ethiopia sudan and uganda have developed a cooperative framework agreement cfa as part of the nile basin initiative nbi with the aim of better managing the nile river and its riparian zones by most accounts the nbi process has proven to be tenuous at best at worst disruptive c f 8 9 in the midst of interregional conflicts such as these regions with competing jurisdictions over existing or potentially new surface water supplies have fostered effective formal cooperative arrangements through compacts and water markets with the common aim of more efficiently and equitably managing their water supplies for example relatively well functioning markets have been established in the western u s and southeastern australia markets facilitating both intra agricultural and agricultural urban trades via temporary lease agreements or purchase of actual water rights 10 2 2 not to say that these regions have historically eschewed conflict and allocative inefficiency for instance in the early 1900 s los angeles municipal water authorities ruthlessly gained control of the owens river constructing a 250 mile aqueduct that carries water from the river valley to the city owens valley farmers responded by dynamiting sections of the aqueduct and standing off against armed city agents between 1924 and 1927 1 11 further south in california irrigators in the imperial valley water district consume 70 of the state s 4 4 million acre foot allocation of colorado river water at a steeply subsidized cost resulting in profligate farming practices and the planting of water thirsty crops 1 allocative inefficiencies such as these persist in regions across the us as a result of excessive price subsidization 12 australia s murray darling basin mdb is site of the world s most advanced water trading program a program engaging not only irrigators municipalities and industries but also non landholding environmental stakeholders and financial investors in the trading of unbundled temporary and permanent water rights 13 the program has ended irrigation subsidies and requires farmers to pay for the maintenance of dams and canals after a little more than a decade cellphone enabled water trading among farmers and between farmers city authorities and environmental stakeholders has skyrocketed with roughly 80 of the basin s irrigators by now having participated in at least one trade 13 the mdb program even allows farmers whose irrigation systems have created soil salinity problems to purchase transpiration credits from forest owners whose trees remove salinity through their root systems 1 3 3 the mdb program has nevertheless attracted criticism see 14 15 and 16 in the western us water trading has evolved more stubbornly than it has in the mdb for the region as a whole including the states of arizona california colorado idaho montana new mexico nevada oregon texas utah wyoming and washington slightly over 700 short term leases and roughly 1500 sales occurred over the twenty year period from 1987 2007 over half of the lease arrangements and three quarters of the sales were either agricultural to agricultural or agricultural to urban 12 since then trading volume has gradually increased particularly in the drier southwestern states for example in arizona where over 30 of surface water withdrawals are drawn from the over allocated colorado river the diversion of water supplies to rural communities in the face of limited supply has become of paramount importance for state water managers 17 4 4 relative to us averages the southwestern states of arizona california and texas confront higher annual population growth 2 45 vs 1 15 between 1920 and 2018 higher temperature 61 1 f vs 52 5 f and less precipitation 20 68 in vs 30 48 in 17 from 2009 to 2018 nearly 151 000 acre feet of water was traded annually which comprises approximately 4 of the state s annual consumptive use as 17 report arizona has witnessed a near seven fold increase in total volume traded since 2009 with a clear trend upwards since 2012 and a large spike in 2018 coinciding with exceptional drought conditions in terms of types of water trades consummated 92 were in the form of leases while only a small volume 8 were tallied as permanent sales although water markets have been slow to evolve on a broader scale in the western us evidence from the operation of these existing markets suggests that gains associated with more efficient allocation of surface water resources can in fact materialize through trading 12 18 23 5 5 see 24 25 and 26 for insightful explanations of the theoretical prerogative of water trading see 27 29 and 30 for discussions on the role of regulators in the establishment and maintenance of water trading programs michelsen and young 31 propose a unique approach targeting intermittent drought under this approach temporary transfers of irrigation water provide secure water supplies to non agricultural users during drought periods the exercise of an option transfers water to higher valued uses only when needed while preserving water for agricultural use during normal water supply conditions trades are stimulated by large enough differentials in water values between current water owners and potential buyers in the western us for example the majority of trades have been from subsidized agricultural sellers to unsubsidized urban buyers who are grappling with projected increases in water demand as previously mentioned the impetus for developing surface water markets generally arises for one of two purposes 1 as a tool for reallocation of common water supplies between agricultural uses including both water rights and irrigation services and 2 as a means of expanding a growing urban area s access to safe water supplies 32 the setting for this paper aligns with the second purpose in this paper we extend the axiomatic nash bargaining approach to the context of interregional water sharing in order to assess the approach s normative implications in a general equilibrium ge framework 6 6 as binmore et al 1986 show the axiomatic theory of cooperative bargaining initially proposed by nash 33 has a tight relationship with the non cooperative sequential strategic approach to bargaining also proposed by nash 33 and later developed by rubinstein 34 cooperative bargaining relies solely upon the information in the pair of utility functions representing the welfare of the bargainers and the bargainers respective disagreement points or reservation utility levels below which the bargainers will not voluntarily participate in the bargaining scheme nash 33 identifies seven desirability axioms that are satisfied by a unique cooperative outcome four of which are generally considered key among them 1 pareto efficiency 2 symmetry in the bargainers respective utility levels net of their disagreement points 3 invariance to affine transformations of bargainers utility functions and 4 independence of irrelevant alternatives subsequent studies of the nash bargaining problem have suggested families of cooperative solutions satisfying more generalized versions of nash s original axioms 35 and more limited sets of axioms 36 37 we apply the ge model to a water development project proposed for the wasatch front and cache valley regions of utah the bear river development project brdp and conceptually demonstrate how an allocation rule and attendant net regional welfare measures are endogenously determined as equilibrium solutions to the bargaining problem numerical analysis based upon a simulation model calibrated to current data reveals that nash bargaining is generally infeasible as a solution mechanism for sharing surplus water supplies generated through the implementation of the brdp with and without potential ex post side payments made between cache valley and the wasatch front only in the special case of 1 larger future regional population sizes 2 a hypothetical joint per capita cost share arrangement where total project i e fixed costs are shared equally across the two regions 3 hypothetically larger water augmentation rates and 4 the ignoring of potential environmental costs is the nash bargaining solution viable otherwise for all other scenarios where the analysis is based upon current or future population sizes joint or region specific cost share arrangements lower or higher water augmentation rates and internalized or externalized environmental costs the nash bargaining solution is found to be unattainable as a potential mechanism to share surplus water supplies produced by the brdp our conceptual model and calibrated numerical analysis deepens the pool of studies that apply axiomatic bargaining solutions to existing resource sharing problems our particular contribution to this literature centers on the method we develop to derive more of a general equilibrium allocation rule and associated regional net welfare measures as endogenous outcomes of a cooperative bargaining framework 7 7 this method is different than 2 partial equilibrium flexible water allocation rule which determines efficient allocations based upon alternative exogenously determined river flows i e a rule specifying an efficient schedule of river water allocations between upstream and downstream users our model considers an alternative setting where regions essentially control their own region specific water supplies e g their own reservoirs filled predominantly by rivers flowing strictly within their respective boundaries but their geographic proximity nonetheless permits the establishment of a trading arrangement between the two subject to conveyance costs our application of this method to the brdp draws salience from utah s recommended water strategy 38 as 38 points out utah s agricultural systems use over 80 of water consumed statewide these systems are spread across the state in urban areas where they compete for available water supplies and rural areas where agriculture is likely to remain the predominant sector accommodating the state s projected population growth will require continued reductions in per capita water usage as well as implementation of additional water projects to optimize use of limited supplies among the urws s key recommendations is to augment water efficiency and conservation improvements with shifts in water supplies within and between sectors of the economy while mitigating any associated impacts in the basins of origin ultimately achieving both aggregative and allocative efficiency statewide will require changes in statutes that allow leasing of agricultural water rights as well as development of additional water resources such as via the brdp 38 the next section provides a brief review of the nash bargaining literature section 3 describes our study area and the brdp section 4 develops a conceptual model of the nash bargaining problem in a general equilibrium framework section 5 presents the results of our numerical analysis section 6 concludes 2 review of the nash bargaining literature a number of applications of axiomatic bargaining solutions in support of interregional water sharing or international environmental agreements ieas can be found in the literature four of these studies are most pertinent to ours 39 41 and 42 zhu et al 39 derive the nash bargaining solution for a hypothetical transboundary water sharing arrangement along the mekong river between upstream china and the downstream mekong river committee mrc consisting of the southeast asian nations of thailand laos cambodia and vietnam in their framework an international transfer of funds from an institution external to china and the mrc can be incorporated in the solution to provide stronger incentives for joint management of the river wet and dry seasons are distinguished and in each region water users are aggregated into three representative sectors industry and households hydropower generators and agriculture irrigators asymmetric weights are assigned to the nash bargaining function reflecting china s relative bargaining strength in general zhu et al 39 find relatively large welfare gains for both regions associated the nash bargaining solution the size and distribution of which depend upon the regions relative bargaining powers and the extent of international transfers dam capacity in both regions increases in the bargaining outcome however fixed capital costs associated with these increases in capacity are unaccounted for han et al 40 apply the nash bargaining solution to the hanjiang river basin china s largest and most developed tributary of the yangtze river basin in the southern region of the country the authors solve a bi level optimization model where a nash bargaining solution is determined among representative agents located in five distinct zones of the basin the solution is constrained by both a water resource constraint and a reservation benefit constraint the reservation benefit constraint ensures that no representative agent obtains less benefit from the nash bargaining allocation than the average benefit obtained from a first best allocation made by a basin wide manager within this framework han et al 40 find that all but one representative agent the most upstream agent would willingly participate in the nash bargaining scheme in a model where two producing countries north and south with differentiated abatement technologies competitively produce a homogeneous good for sale to consumers in a non producing third country cai and li 41 find that in a nash bargaining solution the north transfers a positive side payment to the south and the south reduces its emission level below its status quo level when either the south s valuation of the side payment or the north s marginal damage from the externality is sufficiently high i e when the regions are strongly asymmetric this result also holds when rather than consumers in a third country purchasing the homogeneous good from the north and south consumers in the south instead choose both domestically produced and imported amounts of the good the authors conclude that strong asymmetry among regions can produce self enforcing agreements dijkstra and nentjes 42 compare the nash bargaining and exchange matching lindahl eml solutions where under the eml each agent specifies her demand for and supply of the public good according to her personal exchange rate 8 8 the personal exchange rate for a given agent is based upon how much society as a whole agrees to contribute for each unit of that agent s contribution the agent states how much he will contribute to the public good at this exchange rate in equilibrium the exchange rates are such that each agent demands the same amount of the public good and this amount is the aggregate contribution across all agents with linear or quadratic benefits and quadratic costs eml and the nash bargaining solutions are equivalent in the presence of two agents with more than two agents high benefit low cost agents are better off under eml than nash bargaining taken together the results from these studies suggest that side payments made between agents participating in a nash bargaining scheme or transfers from third party organizations may be necessary to ensure the voluntary participation of all agents as 42 show side payments may be necessary for the nash bargaining scheme to coincide with an unconstrained pareto efficient solution further the extent of asymmetry in the benefits obtained by the agents is likely to impact their willingness to participate these findings serve as points of reference for our ensuing analysis concerning the self enforcing properties of the nash bargaining solution 3 the study area our study area encompasses two regions located in northern utah the wasatch front and cache valley fig 1 located in the north central part of the state comprised of weber davis salt lake utah and box elder counties the wasatch front is utah s largest metropolitan region roughly 80 of utah s population resides in this region which is home to the state s capital salt lake city and accounts for approximately 90 of the state s gross state product 43 the wasatch front stretches along and is hemmed in by the wasatch mountains to the east and great salt lake to the west because of these geographical barriers much of the land along the wasatch front has been developed the wasatch front has experienced considerable growth since the 1950s its population increasing by over 300 to its current 2 5 million residents with projections of the population reaching six million residents by 2065 44 much of the remaining undeveloped land is rapidly being developed forcing local governments and regional authorities to contend with problems of urban sprawl and related transportation issues according to perlich et al s 44 projections just under 30 of utah s population will reside in utah county by 2065 as will 40 of new residents to the state during this 50 year time span just over 20 of new residents will reside in salt lake county currently the wasatch front s most populous county forty and roughly 25 of those employed in the state are projected to be working in salt lake and utah counties respectively by 2065 davis county is projected to experience the state s third highest employment growth rate during this same time frame cache valley s population is also growing rapidly population is expected to roughly double in size from 135 000 currently to 230 000 by 2050 in comparison to most other regions in utah the valley is relatively rich in water jub engineers 45 reports a roughly 30 000 acre feet total supply surplus annually for the valley in terms of the valley s developed water supplies roughly 80 is consumed by irrigated cropland the remaining 20 devoted to municipal and industrial uses 45 the valley is also distinguished by its rich agricultural heritage according to recent usda estimates cache valley s average sales per farm is roughly three times as large as davis salt lake and weber counties and roughly 1 5 times as large as utah county s 46 cache valley is estimated to have slightly more than 37 of its land area in farms while the average for the wasatch front counties is just over 22 46 in 1991 the utah state legislature passed the bear river development act henceforth the act which directed the utah division of water resources udwr to develop up to 220 000 acre feet of the bear river s surface waters and its tributaries as part of the brdp of this amount 160 000 acre feet would be allocated to the wasatch front and the remaining 60 000 acre feet allocated to cache valley 47 as fig 2 shows the main stem of the bear river flows through cache valley to the cutler reservoir from there the river flows unimpeded south through box elder county to the bear river bird refuge near man made willard bay 47 as indicated in fig 2 the project entails constructing a raw water pipeline from cutler dam in cache valley to a proposed pumping station located at the site of a potential reservoir in fielding and the junction vault from there the water is piped to the proposed west haven treatment plant in weber county and subsequently routed through the weber basin and jordan valley water conservancy districts along the wasatch front an additional raw water pipeline is proposed from whites reservoir located in box elder county to the reservoir in fielding and the junction vault the water from whites reservoir represents a transfer of water within the wasatch front from box elder county in the northern region of the front to the more populous weber davis salt lake and utah counties in the southern region to help visualize more generally the type of water sharing arrangement captured by our conceptual and numerical models developed in sections 4 and 5 consider fig 3 panel a depicts the existing water topography between two regions prior to the implementation of a water development project such as the brdp in our case we can think of region 1 as representing the wasatch front and region 2 as cache valley region 1 is larger in size denoted by its larger non water resource base l 1 relative to region 2 s l 2 and is less agricultural denote by the region s lighter shade of green although the two region s available water supplies w 1 and w 2 are roughly equal in size region 1 s is smaller relative to both its non water resource base and population size region 2 s water supply is replenished by a larger river r a e g the bear river in fig 2 and its tributary r b a slightly weaker flowing river r c e g continuation of the bear river in fig 2 flows between the two regions and region 1 s available water supply is replenished by moderate and weaker flowing rivers r d and r e respectively panel b in fig 3 depicts the interregional water topography after the water development project is completed we see that river r c s flow between the two regions is enhanced reflecting the greater amount of water now transferred from region 2 to region 1 e g via the raw water pipeline extending from cutler dam in cache county to the west haven treatment plant in weber county in fig 2 in addition an additional water source is developed in region 1 e g the whites reservoir in fig 2 the water from this new source is piped south within region 1 via river r f as a result of the water transfers within region 1 and between regions 1 and 2 region 1 s main available water supply is now larger udwr s 47 cost estimates for the brdp range from approximately 1 5 billion to 2 8 billion the act requires the state of utah to fund the planning studies design and construction and environmental mitigation costs associated with the project the act also requires that the funding will be repaid by the regions within a period not to exceed 50 years at a 4 interest rate set by the utah board of water resources assuming a total cost estimate of 1 7 billion which includes reservoir and pipeline construction and other facilities to deliver the raw water from storage and diversions to regional delivery points udwr 47 reports annual repayments of just under 22 million for cache valley and slightly more than 58 million for the wasatch front we utilize these cost estimates in our numerical analysis in section 5 9 9 additional costs will be incurred by the regions to deliver and treat water from the brdp e g treatment operation and maintenance costs costs that are not covered by the overall funding provided by the state further potential environmental costs affiliated with the brdp are unaccounted for 4 the conceptual model we begin by setting notation in the context of a baseline autarkic model of two contiguous regions region 1 represents cache valley and region 2 the wasatch front we then specify the nash bargaining model and distinguish its key differences with the baseline model 4 1 baseline model assume region i 1 2 produces good j a c using inputs k w n according to production function 1 q i j f i j z i j k β i j k where input vector z i j k z i a w z i a n z i c w z i c n 0 and parameter vector β i j k β i a w β i a n β i c w β i c n 0 is defined such that function f i j exhibits constant returns to scale in vector z i j k outputs a and c denote composite agricultural and all other non agricultural goods respectively and inputs w and n represent respective amounts of water and a composite of all other inputs e g capital labor and land used to produce q i j 10 10 we distinguish the water input from a composite of non water inputs in order to maintain our focus on the sharing of water between the two regions in the ensuing numerical analysis in section 5 similarly we distinguish the agricultural good from a composite of non agricultural goods to reflect cache valley s relatively large agricultural sector and to simplify our ensuing analysis total cost associated with the production of good j in region i using inputs k is defined as 2 c i j k w i k z i j k i 1 2 j a c k w n where w i k 0 denotes region i s input prices assumed common across sectors a and c in each region 11 11 fixed costs are normalized to zero here in order to facilitate the role they play in section 5 in determining the social net benefits associated with implementing the brdp regional endowments of inputs w i and n i are defined as 12 12 we follow the computational general equilibrium cge literature by endowing the regions themselves rather than the regions consumers with resource levels w i and n i 48 3 w i j z i j w i 1 2 j a c 4 n i j z i j n i 1 2 j a c per capita welfare in region i is represented by utility function 5 u i u i x i α i i 1 2 where x i x i a x i c 0 represents region i s per capita consumption vector and parameter vector α i α i a α i c 0 region i s associated per capita consumption constraint is defined as 6 m i i j p i j x i j i 1 2 j a c where p i j 0 denotes per unit prices of goods j a c produced in region i and m i represents region i s per capita wealth level in the baseline equilibrium as in the nash bargaining model described in section 4 2 region i independently and simultaneously solves its cost minimization and per capita utility maximization problems for cost minimization input vector z i j k is chosen to minimize eq 2 subject to eqs 1 3 and 4 with region i taking input prices w i k as given conceptually the first order conditions for this problem solve for vector z i j and constraints 3 and 4 solve for input prices w i k the production function s curvature conditions in tandem with binding regional resource constraints ensures a unique interior solution to region i s cost minimization problem for utility maximization consumption vector x i is chosen to maximize eq 5 subject to 6 with region i taking prices p i j and per capita wealth level m i as given the utility function s curvature conditions in tandem with a linear consumption constraint likewise ensure a unique interior solution to region i s utility maximization problem two sets of market clearing conditions close the model 7 q i j n i x i j i 1 2 j a c 8 r i n i m i i 1 2 where r i j p i j q i j and n i denotes region i s population size eq 7 states that in equilibrium regional supplies of goods a and c equate with their corresponding consumption demands on a per capita basis which in turn effectively determine equilibrium prices p i j conditions 8 indicate that regional wealth is equal to regional gross domestic product gdp i e the sum of regional revenue levels from the production of goods a and c again on a per capita basis 13 13 following 48 our general equilibrium model abstracts from the household sector s resource allocation decisions i e allocation of z i j k thus regional revenues accruing to the household sector in the form of wealth is consistent with non negative profits obtained at the industry level if its resource allocation decision had instead been explicitly modeled then household sector wealth would accrue in the form of industry costs c i j plus profits the baseline equilibrium is ultimately characterized by the regions respective input demand output supply output demand indirect utility and cost functions as well as their respective regional gdps z i j k 0 z i j k ω i 0 p i j 0 w i k 0 q i j 0 q i j ω i 0 p i j 0 w i k 0 x i j 0 x i j ω i 0 p i j 0 w i k 0 u i 0 u i ω i 0 p i j 0 w i k 0 c i j 0 c i j ω i 0 p i j 0 w i k 0 and r i 0 j p i j 0 q i j 0 where parameter vector ω i 0 α i β i j k w i n i n i and as mentioned previously equilibrium prices p i j 0 and w i k 0 are determined endogenously via eqs 3 4 and 7 i 1 2 j a c k w n the 0 superscript denotes baseline equilibrium values admittedly designating the baseline equilibrium as the status quo is an abstraction from any bilateral economic relationship at any given point in time regions are involved in multiregional economic relationships thus by abstracting to a bilateral relationship we either ignore or exogenize any impacts on that relationship emanating from pre existing internal trade between the two regions as well as external trade between each region and its other trading partners currently the wasatch front and cache valley do not internally trade their respective water supplies the focal point of this study further as we discuss in section 5 the data used to calibrate our numerical model are denominated in dollars which enables us to normalize all prices in the model to one thus mitigating potential bias associated with the prices respective equilibrium values nevertheless to the extent that the wasatch front and cache valley engage in trade relationships with other regions statewide nationwide and globally both our baseline equilibrium and nash bargaining solution likely underestimate the regions respective wealth levels 4 2 nash bargaining solution unlike the 47 engineered regional water allocations resulting from the brdp the nash bargaining solution henceforth nbs explicitly satisfies 33 original desirability properties of pareto optimality symmetry invariance and independence of irrelevant alternatives indeed the nbs uniquely satisfies these properties 49 as such the solution is both normative and positive further the nbs enables us to endogenously determine compensating variation welfare measures for each region associated with the water sharing arrangement although demonstrative in nature the nbs serves as a starting point for obtaining estimates of these measures endogenously via numerical optimization 14 14 of course benefit transfers from previous studies that have estimated water values in agriculture use municipal industrial use and for environmental purposes represent the most expedient method of affixing welfare measures to the specific amounts of water supply generated by the brdp c f 50 to begin the regional costs specified in eqs 2 are now independently minimized subject to 4 and a new interregional version of constraint 3 9 w 1 r 1 w 1 1 r 2 w 2 i j z i j w i 1 2 j a c constraint 9 accounts for the fact that regional water supplies z i j w i 1 2 j a c are tradable in the nbs i e that the two regions now share a common supply of available water priced at a common rate of w w as they would via a project such as the brdp further available water supplies in regions 1 and 2 respectively are augmented by growth factors r 1 r 2 0 mimicking the respective increases in cache valley s and the wasatch front s available water supplies as a result of the brdp in particular that cache valley s percentage increase exceeds the wasatch front s for example in accordance with 47 51 and 52 the brdp is expected to result in roughly 20 and 10 increases in cache valley s and the wasatch front s available water supplies respectively implying r 1 0 2 and r 2 0 1 a pair of per capita regional utility values u 1 u 2 denotes the nbs these are solution values for the interregional maximization problem 10 x 1 x 2 m a x u 1 x 1 α 1 u 1 0 u 2 x 2 α 2 u 2 0 subject to 11 u 1 u 2 u 1 0 u 2 0 and constraints 6 eq 11 constrains the nbs to deliver each region no less per capita welfare than they would otherwise obtain in the baseline equilibrium i e the status quo as depicted in 10 where each region s utility function is unweighted we effectively assign a non discriminatory egalitarian welfare function across the two regions egalitarianism in this sense is epitomized by the resulting nbs allocation u 1 u 2 satisfying u 1 u 1 0 u 2 u 2 0 i e each region retains an equal share of the payoff gain since we have no a priori reason to favor one region s per capita welfare level over the other in the nbs as reflected in 47 and 38 the standard unweighted bargaining function is deemed most appropriate for this normative exercise 15 15 see 34 for a generalization of the standard nash bargaining function market clearing conditions 7 continue to hold in the nbs for each region s composite good c however to account for the possibility of trade in embodied water i e the good produced in cache valley that uses water relatively intensively composite agricultural good a conditions 7 corresponding to good a are now rewritten as 12 i q i a i n i x i a i 1 2 similar to the interregional water constraint specified in 9 market clearing condition 12 accounts for the fact that agricultural composite good a is tradable in the nbs at a common equilibrium price p a market clearing conditions 8 continue to hold in the nbs albeit in modified forms 13 m 1 r 1 n 1 w w 1 r 1 w 1 j z 1 j w n 1 j a c 14 m 2 r 2 n 2 w w 1 r 2 w 2 j z 2 j w n 2 j a c eqs 13 and 14 adjust the regions respective per capita wealth levels to account for the value of water transferred between the regions given that region 1 is initially relatively well endowed with an available water supply and its supply is augmented by a relatively large growth factor i e r 1 r 2 0 we expect w w 1 r 1 w 1 j z 1 j w n 1 0 in 13 and w w 1 r 2 w 2 j z 2 j w n 2 0 in 14 i e that cache valley will export its excess water to the wasatch front in the nbs equilibrium similar to the baseline equilibrium the nbs is ultimately characterized by the regions respective input demand output supply output demand indirect utility and cost functions as well as regional gdps z i j k z i j k ω i p i c p a w i n w w q i

w i n i n i r i and equilibrium prices p i c p a w i n w w are determined endogenously i 1 2 j a c k w n the superscript denoting their nbs values based upon these results we can define per capita regional welfare measures compensating variations and net benefits associated with the regions having chosen to participate in the nbs as a means of allocating water shares arising from the brdp region i s per capita compensating variation c v i solves 15 u i ω i r i c v i u i 0 u i ω i 0 r i 0 i 1 2 eq 15 indicate that c v i is the dollar amount that when subtracted from region i s per capita gdp obtained in the nbs r i reduces the region s nbs per capita utility to its corresponding baseline utility level u i 0 as such c v i represents region i s per capita willingness to pay to participate in the nbs and thereby obtain the solution s water allocation letting c o s t i represent region i s per capita share of the fixed capital costs associated with participating in the brdp these costs are explained in more detail in section 5 the region s net benefit n b i from choosing to participate in the nbs is defined as 16 n b i c v i c o s t i i 1 2 the ultimate goal of our numerical analysis presented below is to derive n b i estimates for cache valley and the wasatch front 5 numerical analysis we begin this section by specifying the respective functional forms chosen for f i j z i j k β i j k i 1 2 j a c k w n and u i x i α i i 1 2 in eqs 1 and 5 next we discuss the model s calibration to available data for the wasatch front and cache valley followed by a presentation of the model s numerical results we finish this section with a sensitivity analysis of the results 16 16 our numerical analyses are performed using gams v 33 2 0 r4f23b21 wex wei x86 64bit ms windows 5 1 model specification we specify the regional production function for q i j in eq 1 as cobb douglas 17 q i j γ i j k z i j k β i j k i 1 2 j a c k w n where parameters γ i j capture the effects of neutral technological change in sectors j a c in region i and marginal productivity parameters satisfy β i j w β i j n 1 i 1 2 j a c we also specify region i s per capita utility function u i in eq 5 as cobb douglas 18 u i δ i j x i j α i j i 1 2 j a c where parameters δ i capture the regional effects of neutral welfare change associated with a bundle of consumption goods j a c consistent with our scale assumption for production and to help ensure a sparse parameter set for calibration purposes we also assume that α i a α i c 1 i 1 2 17 17 our functional forms and parameter restrictions reflect both the simplicity and substitutability typically built into computable general equilibrium cge models particularly cge models aggregated at national or regional levels 48 these models are in turn calibrated to highly aggregated data which often warrant sparse parameter sets cf 53 55 5 2 model calibration model calibration is based upon data obtained from four separate sources water supply and use data are taken from 51 and 52 and the remaining county level economic and production data is obtained from 56 regional population data is taken from 57 column 3 of table 1 compiles the corresponding data for cache valley and column 4 the data for the wasatch front reported here at the per county level i e averaged over the five counties comprising the wasatch front region 18 18 we conducted our analysis using average county values for the wasatch front in order to enhance comparability with the single county level cache valley as noted in the table for simulation purposes the data in table 1 is compiled in a social accounting matrix sam and then scaled according to the procedure recommended in 48 from table 1 we see that the average wasatch front county is indeed relatively well endowed with the composite resource which in turn is allocated primarily to the production of its composite good as a result for our baseline equilibrium the quantity of the composite good produced in the wasatch front is considerably larger than that produced in cache valley further the population size of the average wasatch front county is roughly three times larger than cache valley s based upon eqs 1 8 from section 4 1 with 17 and 18 from section 5 1 substituted for 1 and 5 respectively and the first order conditions for the cost minimization and utility maximization problems described in section 3 calibration of the baseline equilibrium results in the parameter values reported in table 2 we normalized the price of the composite good to one in each region and observed the remaining prices each solve endogenously to one hence in line with 48 all prices in our baseline equilibrium are normalized to one i e p i j w i j k 1 i 1 2 j a c k w n this normalization comports with our numerical analysis since our input and production data in table 1 are denominated in dollars for future reference note that since the calibration exercise is based upon data contained in table 1 and this data defines our baseline equilibrium table 1 represents both the data for calibration and the baseline equilibrium from table 2 we see that cache valley and the average county in the wasatch front share similar values for the neutral technology shift parameters γ i j i 1 2 j a c and substitution parameters in production β i j k i 1 2 j a c k w n cache valley s neutral preference shift parameter δ 1 0 5 exceeds the average wasatch front county s δ 2 0 1 as does cache valley s preference substitution parameter for the agricultural good α 1 a 0 01 versus α 2 a 0 001 also contained in table 2 are the parameter values for r 1 and r 2 respectively the assumed augmentation rates of available water supplies in cache valley and the wasatch front s average county resulting from implementation of the brdp 47 51 52 5 3 numerical results table 3 contains our numerical results for the nbs for the case of r 1 0 2 and r 2 0 1 in addition to the relevant nbs values for the same variables presented table 1 i e z i j k and q i j i 1 2 j a c k w n table 3 includes the values for w i 1 r i w i w i t 1 r i w i j z i j w and c v i i 1 2 j a c recall that w represents the common supply of available water as a result of the brdp s implementation left hand side of constraint 9 variable w i t 0 0 represents the value of region i s water exported imported and c v i denotes region i s per capita compensating variation measure as defined in eq 15 also included in table 3 are the nbs values for per capita consumption levels x i j regional gdp levels r i and prices p a w i n w w i 1 2 j a c we note that because all variables are denominated in dollars these prices should be interpreted as value adjustment factors rather than per unit prices per se 19 19 the composite good s value adjustment factor in each region p i c i 1 2 continues to be normalized to one in the nbs lastly table 3 includes per capita annual repayments on the fixed costs associated with participating in the brdp c o s t i i 1 2 based upon 47 projections for cache valley and the wasatch front although 47 allocates specific repayment cost shares to three of the wasatch front s water conservancy districts the jordan valley weber basin and bear river water conservancy districts and thus attributes these cost shares to respective wasatch front counties we aggregate the cost shares across all wasatch front counties and divide by the front s total population to derive its per capita regional cost share to begin we compare our nbs results for z i j k and q i j with what are effectively the benchmark equilibrium values z i j k 0 and q i j 0 i 1 2 j a c k w n from table 1 recall that the data in table 1 mimic the benchmark equilibrium by design of the calibration exercise we see that as expected the value of water consumption under the nbs for production of both the agricultural and composite goods increases by larger percentages in the typical wasatch front county than in cache valley this outcome is consistent with the pattern of trade in water depicted by the values for w i t i 1 2 in table 3 over 1 3 million worth of water is traded annually in the nbs between cache valley and the average wasatch front county as a result of the brdp relatively minor changes occur in both regions with respect to the value of the composite input used in the production of the agricultural and composite goods interestingly relatively larger increases in the value of agricultural composite good production occur in the wasatch front cache valley most importantly for our purposes are the results for c v i and c o s t i i 1 2 contained in table 3 clearly the net benefits for each region from participating in the nbs as a means of distributing resources resulting from implementation of the brdp are negative appealing to eq 16 we find that cache valley s per capita net benefit is roughly 145 per person 19 22 164 50 and the typical wasatch front county s is approximately 13 per person 9 78 23 12 these results suggest that if cache valley and the wasatch front were to consider participating in an nbs agreement as a means of dividing the expected net surplus resulting from the brdp s expected water augmentation rates and cost share arrangement neither region would voluntarily agree to participate rather than sharing a net surplus the regions would be forced to share a net deficit 5 4 sensitivity analysis we test the sensitivity of our nbs results from section 5 3 in two different settings one assuming current regional population sizes see table 1 the other assuming projected population sizes in 2045 58 20 20 the year 2045 represents the midpoint of 47 50 year planning horizon in both settings we consider each of the following three effects first we measure the sensitivity of regional i s net benefit n b i to successive increases in 47 projected water augmentation rates from their baseline levels of r 1 0 2 and r 2 0 1 see table 2 we assume successive increases in these rates by a factor of 0 05 e g from r 1 0 2 r 2 0 1 to r 1 0 25 r 2 0 15 to r 1 0 3 r 2 0 2 etc given the baseline results of n b i 0 i 1 2 from section 5 3 our goal here is to measure the extent to which the brdp would hypothetically need to costlessly augment the regions available water supplies in order for the baseline results to be reversed i e for n b i 0 i 1 2 second we measure the sensitivity of section 5 3 s baseline results to economy wide aggregation of the brdp s annual repayment costs rather than region wide cost shares recall from section 5 3 that c o s t i i 1 2 is region i s per capita cost share under the brdp agreement here we consider a hypothetical joint per capita cost share arrangement henceforth denoted as c o s t whereby the project s total annual repayment cost of 80 million is divided equally among cache valley s and the wasatch front s aggregated population sizes of 2 642 046 current aggregate population size and 3 750 696 projected aggregate population size by 2045 respectively and third based upon 59 average estimate that resource and environmental costs account for 62 of the typical water development project s total accounting cost we measure the sensitivity of our nbs results to the inclusion of these external costs fig 4 depicts our results for the sensitivity of regional i s net benefit n b i to successive costless increases in 47 projected water augmentation rates from their baseline levels of r 1 0 2 and r 2 0 1 assuming current regional population sizes the figure s horizontal axis charts the successive increases in r 1 r 2 denoted as r c a c h e r w f respectively and its vertical axis measures corresponding per capita regional compensating variation levels relative to both regional and economy wide annual repayment costs each measured in person year cache valley s per capita compensating variation curve denoted c v c a c h e and annual repayment cost curve denoted c o s t c a c h e are depicted in the color gray and the average wasatch front county s compensating variation curve denoted c v w f and annual repayment cost curve denoted c o s t w f are depicted in blue the hypothetical aggregate cost share curve denoted c o s t is depicted in the color red 21 21 the corresponding data table for both figs 4 and 5 is contained in appendix a from fig 4 we see that when facing their respective region specific per capita cost shares i e c o s t c a c h e and c o s t w f cache valley s per capita net benefit is negative at all water augmentation rates and the wasatch front s per capita net benefit becomes positive at point b corresponding roughly to r c a c h e 1 425 r w f 1 325 referring to the corresponding data table in appendix a we see that the wasatch front s per capita net benefit equals 1 40 and cache valley s equals 113 55 at r c a c h e 1 45 r w f 1 35 the closest discrete augmentation rate combination associated with positive net benefits in the wasatch front hence without a side payment made from the wasatch front to cache valley the nbs is unattainable even at noticeably larger albeit hypothetical water augmentation rates to see this we multiply the wasatch front s per capita net benefit of 1 40 by the region s total population size of 2 508 305 referring to table 1 this is equal to the per county population size of 501 661 multiplied by the five counties comprising the wasatch front which equals 3 511 627 we then divide this amount by cache valley s population size of 133 741 which equals 26 26 since this potential per capita side payment from the wasatch front is well below cache valley s negative per capita net benefit of 113 55 we conclude that even with a potential side payment from the wasatch front to cache valley the nbs is not viable to the contrary when facing the hypothetical joint per capita cost share arrangement represented by the hashed horizontal red line at c o s t 30 28 in fig 4 cache valley s per capita net benefit becomes positive at point a corresponding roughly to r c a c h e 1 275 r w f 1 175 however now the wasatch front s per capita net benefit is negative at all water augmentation rates using the same method as was used above to show that no side payment from the wasatch front to cache valley can support the nbs under the brdp s proposed regional cost shares we find that cache valley s maximum per capita side payment of 0 13 is well beneath the wasatch front s negative per capita net benefit of 14 25 indicating that the nbs is unsupportable under hypothetical joint cost sharing as well 22 22 the nbs is unattainable under joint cost sharing even at the highest water augmentation rate combination of r c a c h e 1 5 r w f 1 4 since the highest per capita side payment cache valley is capable of making at this rate combination is 1 40 which is still beneath the wasatch front s negative per capita net benefit of 3 13 fig 5 depicts our results again for the sensitivity of region i s net benefit n b i to successive increases in 47 projected water augmentation rates assuming current regional population sizes but this time in the presence of now internalized environmental costs ecs from the figure we see that when ecs are internalized neither region attains positive per capita net benefits at any water augmentation rate combination when facing the hypothetical joint per capita cost share arrangement represented by the hashed horizontal red line at c o s t 49 05 cache valley s per capita net benefit becomes positive at point a corresponding roughly to r c a c h e 1 43 r w f 1 33 clearly even with a potential side payment from cache valley to the wasatch front at any possible water augmentation rate combination the nbs is not viable lastly we present numerical results for the future population setting for reference purposes we begin by comparing current and future population estimates in table 4 we see that populations in all counties are expected to increase quite significantly with the greatest percentage increase expected for the wasatch front s utah county fig 6 depicts our associated sensitivity results for the future population setting without internalized ecs the corresponding data table for both figs 6 and 7 is contained in appendix b 23 23 for this analysis we assume that the brdp s annual repayment costs as well as regional per capita compensating variations c v i i 1 2 remain constant in the face of growing regional population sizes in general we would expect per capita compensating variations to change in response to changes in production and input use levels as the regions s respective economies grow in comparison with the results presented in fig 4 we again see that when facing their respective region specific per capita cost shares c o s t c a c h e and c o s t w f cache valley s per capita net benefit is negative at all water augmentation rates r c a c h e and r w f the wasatch front s per capita net benefit becomes positive at point b corresponding roughly to r c a c h e 1 3 r w f 1 2 clearly with or without a side payment from the wasatch front to cache valley the nbs is unattainable however when facing the hypothetical joint per capita cost share arrangement represented by the hashed horizontal red line at c o s t 21 33 cache valley s per capita net benefit becomes positive at point a corresponding roughly to r c a c h e 1 225 r w f 1 125 and the wasatch front s per capita net benefit becomes positive at point c corresponding roughly to r c a c h e 1 4 r w f 1 3 from appendix b data table we see that between these two water augmentation rate combinations cache valley is unable to afford the necessary side payment to entice the wasatch front to participate in the nbs thus the nbs is unattainable unless augmentation rates reach the r c a c h e 1 4 r w f 1 3 levels where the wasatch front s per capita net benefit also becomes positive at this water augmentation rate combination the nbs is viable without the need for side payments fig 7 depicts our final set of results in this case for internalized ecs in the presence of future population levels similar to our previous results the nbs is unattainable with or without side payments and whether annual repayment cost shares are region specific as stipulated in 47 or hypothetically administered according to a joint per capita cost share arrangement in the case of region specific cost shares the point at which the wasatch front s net benefit becomes positive point b does not generate a large enough net benefit to fund a side payment to cache valley that would garner its participation in the nbs similarly in the case of a joint cost share arrangement the point at which cache valley s net benefit becomes positive point a does not generate a large enough net benefit to fund a side payment to the wasatch front 6 summary and conclusions in this paper we have extended the axiomatic nash bargaining approach to the context of interregional water sharing in order to assess the approach s normative implications in a general equilibrium framework as 33 showed the nbs uniquely satisfies four properties desired in any sharing agreement pareto efficiency symmetry in the bargainers respective utility levels net of their disagreement points invariance to affine transformations of bargainers utility functions and independence of irrelevant alternatives we have applied our conceptual general equilibrium model to a water development and sharing project proposed for the wasatch front and cache valley regions of utah the bear river development project brdp and demonstrated how an allocation rule and attendant net regional welfare measures are endogenously determined as equilibrium solutions to the bargaining problem numerical analysis based upon a simulation model calibrated to current data reveals that nash bargaining is generally infeasible as a solution mechanism for sharing surplus surface water supplies generated through the implementation of the brdp with or without potential ex post side payments made between cache valley and the wasatch front only in the special case of 1 larger future regional population sizes 2 a hypothetical joint per capita cost share arrangement where total project costs are shared equally across the two regions 3 hypothetically larger water augmentation rates and 4 ignoring potential environmental costs is the nash bargaining solution viable otherwise for all other scenarios the nbs is found to be unattainable as a potential mechanism to share surplus water supplies produced by the brdp it is interesting to note that our admittedly pessimistic findings for the brdp align with those reached for another major water development and sharing agreement proposed for the southern part of utah the lake powell pipeline lpp project in the case of the lpp evidence suggests that washington county which would receive approximately 95 of the project s water supply will incur debt and thereby be forced to increase water rates and or increase impact fees at levels deemed financially unsustainable 60 62 for example 62 estimate annual per capita repayment costs for washington county residents of 369 761 which dwarf those estimated by udwr 47 for the brdp examined in this study although 62 and 60 focus exclusively on the cost side of the ledger the lpp s relatively large per capita repayment costs points to a likely inviability under a nash bargaining framework at least to the extent to which the compensating variation measures calculated in this study for cache valley and the wasatch front apply to residents of washington county the major limitation of our numerical analysis is its reliance on highly aggregated data across industries and sectors of the economies that drive the main uses of water in the two regions our current level of aggregation to the agricultural and composite good sector levels dispels more disaggregated information about the regional economies that could at the very least refine our numerical results as such our numerical results are perhaps at this stage more demonstrative than actionable from a policymaking perspective nevertheless the results are suggestive of issues that should be addressed as a project such as the brdp moves closer to implementation questions concerning the cost share arrangement water augmentation rates and the extent to which environmental costs are explicitly accounted for need to be answered should total project costs be shared equally across the two regions or assigned regionally as they are currently specified in the brdp to what extent can the project s water augmentation rates be increased in order to ensure an economically viable interregional water sharing agreement to what extent should potential environmental costs be incorporated in the analysis upfront while our analysis has not explicitly incorporated potential effects from climate change the framework for our analysis suggests that as river flow diminishes in response to reduced snowpack and higher year round temperatures in both the wasatch front and cache valley as indicated by us environmental protection agency usepa 63 the viability of nash bargaining as a mechanism to share surplus water supplies produced by the brdp will hinge on two opposing influences on the supply side reduced water availability will tend to diminish potential economic surpluses resulting from the nbs however on the demand side it could be that sans aggressive water conservation efforts enacted by regional regulatory authorities household willingness to pay for water supplied via the brdp will increase enough to offset the anticipated supply side effect particularly among wasatch front households the results from this study suggest the offset would need to be considerable a transcendent question is whether surplus sharing mechanisms such as the nash bargaining solution have a place in the public decision making rubric can mechanisms like this be operationalized to inform actual interregional surplus sharing decisions we believe the answer is yes this paper demonstrates how the mechanism can potentially be utilized to generate endogenous measures of net regional welfare which in turn provides a basis upon which to determine the economic viability of water sharing arrangements declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

8654,nitrogen and phosphorus emissions from urban sources degrade aquatic ecosystems reducing these emissions cost effectively in an urban environment is challenging because they are non point source pollutants and abatement strategies range from behaviour change for garden fertilizer use to large scale infrastructure investments this paper analyses policy options for the canning catchment in western australia with a dynamic and spatial hydro economic model currently responsibility for n and p abatement is fragmented across government agencies a coordinated cost effective policy to meet n and p abatement targets in the case study catchment would cost a 0 5 billion over the next fifty years the minimum cost is approximately doubled if the policy set excludes septic tank infill and constructed wetlands costs are significantly reduced if there is a city wide policy to mandate the use of slow release nitrogen fertilizer on public open space we conclude that there is a significant benefit to society from adopting a coordinated approach to nitrogen and phosphorous abatement further in this case study a non point source pollution problem can be addressed by abatement measures such as infrastructure investment that are directly observable keywords urban pollution nitrogen pollution phosphorous pollution non point source pollution urban stormwater environmental policy data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction elevated n and p concentrations in urban freshwater estuarine and coastal waters cause widespread ecological damage due to eutrophication 1 3 examples of catchments where n and p from urban and agricultural sources cause widespread ecological damage and reduce amenity values include chesapeake bay 4 the thames 5 and perth s swan canning catchment 6 the policy response to n and p pollution in the swan canning has followed three stages 7 the first stage commenced with european settlement of western australia wa in the early 19th century the clearance of native vegetation for urban development was concentrated around the estuary untreated sewage degraded water quality and the estuary was viewed as a risk to human health public concern led to the swan river improvement act of 1925 8 which improved sewage treatment in the second stage from the 1940s to the 1970s point source industrial and wastewater pollution was the main source of n and p emissions this was addressed by relocating heavy industry and water treatment plants away from the estuary in the third and current stage the priority is to reduce urban and agricultural non point source emissions of n and p 9 the canning catchment the case study is a rapidly urbanizing catchment with increasing n and p emissions from residential properties and peri urban agriculture urban emissions are determined by land use and management decisions taken by households developers local authorities sports clubs farms and market gardens urban diffuse pollution adds to background emissions from agriculture in the canning urban emissions are the main source of n and p pollution these emissions have a cumulative effect in the swan canning estuary and damage urban streams and wetlands in the catchment 10 the main barrier to regulating non point source pollution npsp cost effectively is that the regulator does not observe the agents emissions 11 12 further the obvious second best alternative of regulating fertilizer applications is costly to implement difficult to observe and may not be directly related to emission levels thus agricultural and urban npsp policies are often based on third best hard to fake measures such as land use change and technology investments for instance the nitrate sensitive area is a command and control policy to reduce nitrate emissions in england restricts land use and livestock stocking rates 13 15 by restricting the policy to observable actions such as land use has led to a policy with relatively high abatement costs 16 similar schemes are found in most developed countries 17 22 most well funded national schemes such as the environmental quality incentives program 23 are targeted at rural land and commercial agriculture rather than urban areas theoretically efficient solutions to npsp have not been widely applied to our knowledge there are no ambient tax 11 based policies despite their potential to achieve ambient water quality targets at least cost the only example of a market based policy for agricultural npsp is the lake taupo nitrogen program in new zealand which is a cap and trade scheme 24 the virginia water quality trading programs is a cap and trade scheme for n emission trading between point source and npsp agricultural polluters 25 urban npsp can be addressed by changing the use of fertilizer by households 26 in the swan canning the great gardens project was implemented in 2006 with the aim of changing household behaviour related to fertilizer use 27 28 it was successful in reducing fertilizer use by persuading households to change to slow release fertilizers and changing their garden palnts to ones with a low fertilizer requirement a further pilot project was implemented in a high emission suburb 29 this project was successful in reducing fertilizer use over a 12 month monitoring period there have been numerous non market valuation and cost and benefits studies of urban water infrastructure 30 related to pollution papers related to this research include polyakov et al 10 who use hedonic pricing in the canning catchment to measure the use value of restoring an urban drain to a living steam wong et al 31 and castonguay et al 32 compare the cost effectiveness of constructed wetlands and rainwater ponds in melbourne as technologies for stripping nitrogen from urban stormwater the objective of this paper is to determine the optimal set of policies to reduce urban non point source pollution the contribution of this paper to the literature is first it is one of a small number of papers also see ref 33 to develop a catchment wide spatial and dynamic cost effectiveness analysis of urban non point source pollution the second contribution is that we analyze a comprehensive set of policies including infrastructure investment third the results provide an assessment of the cost reduction gains to coordinated catchment policies the paper is organized as follows the next section describes the canning catchment section 3 describes the hydro economic model section 4 gives data sources and their interpretation section 5 gives results and discussion with a focus on the cost increase due to uncoordinated policy section 6 concludes 2 case study catchment and pollution policy 2 1 the canning catchment the canning river see figs 1 and 2 drains into perth s iconic swan canning estuary it was selected as a case study catchment as first it provides highly valued ecosystem services 34 to a perth population of around 2 million people 35 second the canning is a rapidly urbanizing catchment categorized as a priority for n and p abatement 22 third it exemplifies the complexity of managing npsp through fertilizer restrictions infrastructure investment and behaviour change abatement cost minimization requires four levels of coordinated action across the catchment first spatial coordination that ensures that abatement occurs in the local government areas lgas with the lowest marginal abatement cost second coordination of actions where the least cost set of abatement actions are selected within lgas third coordination across pollutants that accounts for the correlation between n and p emissions fourth dynamic coordination so that infrastructure investments accounts for increased pollutant loads as land is developed the hydro economic cost minimization described below gives an ideal coordinated policy we also use the cost minimization model to explore the role of state government laws and policies the state government has the power to order lgas to switch their use of n fertilizer on public open space pos especially sport fields and golf courses mandating the use of slow release n fertilizer on pos imposes relatively low costs on local government rate payers but significantly reduces the cost of achieving emission targets the current legislative framework is set out in the swan and canning rivers management act 2006 a recent review of the implementation of the act 36 identifies that progress in improving water quality in the swan canning is hindered by the involvement of 21 local government authorities lgas and 15 state government agencies in decision making further in a critique of the performance of past policies the western australian auditor general 37 identifies a lack of regulatory coordination as a barrier to cost effective pollution abatement the management of the swan canning is currently divided between government departments the department of water and environmental regulation has overall responsibility for water resources and has regulatory oversight of the publicly owned water corporation which is responsible for water supply and urban drainage the department of biodiversity conservation and attractions has responsibility for the environmental protection of the estuary and the department of primary industry and development responsibility for the agricultural catchment local responsibility is devolved down to local government authorities more details are given below the situation has been made more complex over the last seven years by changes in government department names and mergers the regulatory authority for the catchment is divided between four state government departments and a government owned company the department of biodiversity conservation and attractions dbca previously the department of parks and wildlife and swan river trust srt has regulatory oversight for a sub region in the urbanized catchment namely the riverpark and the development control area dbca has no direct regulatory control for emissions over the avon and canning agricultural catchment which covers 2 090 km2 the department of water and environmental regulation dwer previously the department of water has a broad remit to protect water resources in wa dwer provides hydrological modelling of n and p loads and monitors water quality jointly with dbca dwer administers planning approvals over stormwater management in new housing developments 38 dwer also regulates the water corporation the water corporation is a state government owned company responsible for water supplies wastewater management and drainage services including urban drains in the swan canning the water corporation has a program of connecting residential properties with septic tanks to the main urban sewerage system the water corporation also manages water demand through block water pricing garden watering restrictions and garden education programs the department of primary industries and regional development dpird regulates the farming and horticultural sector in the canning dpird is responsible for initiatives related to peri urban agriculture its main educational initiative is the fertilizer partnership which developed phosphorus fertilizer budgets for farms with the aim of reducing phosphorous emissions 39 dpird could also introduce policies to reduce emissions from the agricultural catchment 40 2 2 evidence of policy effectiveness the western australian auditor general s report 37 finds that from 1995 to 2013 there was a deterioration in water quality as measured by chlorophyll a dissolved oxygen total n and total p all these measures failed to meet standards set by the australian and new zealand environment and conservation council anzecc water quality guidelines 41 the swan river trust established two target levels for emissions in the river a short run maximum target which should never be exceeded as it would likely trigger rapid ecological degradation through extreme eutrophication events and a long run maximum target which is the level required to maintain an ecologically stable healthy river fig 3 shows that southern river an urbanized sub catchment of the canning failed to meet its long run n and p targets 22 42 p56 but has consistently met the short run targets high emissions were also found for the bannister creek catchment and other sub catchments in the upper canning 43 44 heavy rainfall often causes a sharp increase in emissions that result in algal blooms and fish kills further evidence on meeting emission targets is given in table a1 appendix 22 p55 biological measures of ecosystem health include algal blooms fish diversity and fish kills the number of algal blooms in the swan canning has declined to around two to three per year from 2010 to 11 to 2014 15 down from a peak of nine events in 2008 09 a fish community index which measures fish numbers and diversity was assessed as fair 45 from 2003 to 2015 there were eight significant fish kill events in the canning recorded by the department of water all occurring in the autumn and linked to heavy rainfall 3 hydro economic model the hydro economic model is a non linear spatial and dynamic model that minimizes the present value of abatement costs to achieve target levels of emissions the target levels of emission are average n and p emissions over ten year periods the planning horizon for abatement cost minimization is divided into three stages the first 10 years years 11 20 and years 21 and onwards during the first 10 years all land planned for residential development in the wa development plan 46 is assumed to be developed infrastructure investment and recurrent abatement can be implemented during this first stage during the second stage only recurrent abatement actions are considered the least cost abatement actions established for years 11 20 are assumed to be repeated indefinitely during the third stage the following sub sections give the modelling assumptions and structure fig 4 outlines the land uses agents and regulators that determine n and p emissions in the catchment agents include farmers peri urban agriculture horticultural producers golf clubs other sports clubs households local government authorities lgas that manage extensive areas of sports turf and public open space and the water corporation developers affect nutrient emissions by designing housing developments and installing stormwater management infrastructure living streams constructed wetlands and biofilters developers can apply soil amendments during landscaping for gardens and public open space pos within developments the regulators dbca dwer dpird and lgas are responsible for establishing and enforcing a legal framework for developments installing and operating in stream abatement technologies such as oxygenation plants and applying phoslock to remove phosphates from freshwater streams the set of actions that agents can apply are classified as either recurrent abatement or structural abatement recurrent abatement actions include fertilizer quantity fertilizer quality conventional or slow release and in stream abatement for example phoslock structural abatement investments include soil amendment biofilters septic tank infill and constructed wetlands behaviour change related to fertilizer use is through educational programs such as the great gardens project 27 28 these schemes develop community awareness about reducing emissions from fertilizer use is through educational campaigns such schemes are equivalent to structural abatement in the sense that they involve an initial investment in education about fertilizer management the effectiveness of education in changing behaviour declines and needs to be reinforced by repetition this result has been found in recent behavioural economics interventions for natural resource conservation 47 the model objective function is to minimize the present value of net cost subject to n and p abatement as a percent of maximum emissions targets costs are net of the direct social benefits of the investment for instance constructed wetlands and living streams contribute to nutrient abatement and provide a significant non market amenity value 10 48 49 the objective function aggregates cost across different agents in the catchment nutrient emissions are calculated by allocating land to treatments that reduce nutrient emissions not all abatement measures strictly relate to land use for instance constructed wetlands relate to locations in the catchment rather than specific land uses and involve a conversion of either bushland or pos to wetland phoslock applications remove bioavailable phosphate directly from rivers by binding it to clay 50 the economic model is linked to a hydrological model that represents nutrient transport from sub catchments to the canning estuary the hydrology of n and p transport in the canning has been modelled in several studies 6 51 55 to allow rapid optimization of the hydro economic model the hydrology of the catchment is represented by transfer coefficients for n and p transport from sub catchments to the estuary derived from the results of the streamflow quality affecting rivers and estuaries square hydrology model developed by the department of water 6 56 59 key assumptions for the hydro economic model are assumption 1 n and p transport in the canning catchment is represented by a linear and deterministic annual load model based on sub catchment transport coefficients and sub catchment and annual emissions from land uses assumption 2 the cost of sewage infill depends on the property size and emissions from all septic tanks are the same for a sub catchment assumption 3 constructed wetlands have a constant construction and maintenance cost per ha assumption 4 behaviour change has a constant adoption rate and decline in adoption across the catchment over time following an initial education campaign assumption 5 the efficacy in terms of abatement of banning standard fertilizers and requiring all local government authorities to use slow

basis are those with a relatively high proportion of urban land use table a2 4 1 investments in structural abatement 4 1 1 septic tank infill typical emissions from septic tanks are given in table a9 the cost of connecting septic tanks to the main sewage system depends on the land area of the residential block the water corporation estimated an average cost of a 30 000 per connection with a lower estimate of a 20 000 and an upper estimate of a 80 000 the cost of connection increases with the distance of the house to the main sewer and the slope of the land see table 1 4 1 2 constructed wetlands phoslock iron man gypsum drainage treatment non market use benefits of constructed wetlands are derived from the hedonic price estimates provided by ref 10 for the bannister creek living stream restoration project it is assumed that the effectiveness of constructed wetlands in terms of removing n and p is permanent table a6 presents n and p reduction when the maximum area of constructed wetlands is included in each sub catchment phoslock has the capacity to remove up to 1 kg of p for every 100 kg applied to the river and it remains active for three years the cost of removing p is a 340 kg 50 63 iron man gypsum img is an amendment of subsoil drains to remove n and p in urban groundwater discharge 64 this action is implemented at the ground preparation stage of greenfield residential developments and permanently reduces emissions detailed assumptions are given in table 1 4 2 recurrent abatement actions most of these abatement actions can be characterized as requiring behaviour change or regulation applied either to households or local government authorities lgas currently the only regulation applied to fertilizer formulations in western australia is a restriction on the maximum p content in fertilizers for domestic use 65 table 1 gives detailed descriptions assumptions and sources for all recurrent abatement actions 4 2 1 household behaviour change from a study in the swan catchment 29 60 programs to educate households about reducing nutrient emissions from gardens can be implemented in two ways intensive campaigns that involve calling on households and face to face interaction and low intensity campaigns through telephone calls and websites assumptions about adoption efficacy and costs are given in table 1 we assume the effectiveness of education declines linearly over time due to dis adoption the level of adoption is increased by repeating a campaign 4 2 2 peri urban agriculture behaviour change the fertilizer partnership is a behaviour change initiative for agricultural and urban properties it encourages improved fertilizer efficiency by reducing the applications of highly water soluble p in bulk fertilizer it also encourages the use of soil testing to reduce excess p use and identify soil constraints that can limit crop productivity and fertilizer uptake by plants 4 2 3 fertilizer policies for public open space we model three types of public open space pos golf courses active sport and passive pos the abatement strategy is to use slow release fertilizers 66 in addition the model allows for a total ban on standard fertilizers on pos 5 results the model gives the least cost combination of actions that achieve the emission standard and is solved using the gams conopt solver 67 chapter 7 5 1 cost effective policy targets are based on the maximum acceptable n and p loads defined by swan river trust 20 given in table 2 for instance the target reduction for n is the current emission baseline column 1 in table 2 less the maximum acceptable load in column 3 we define five targets with 20 increments 20 40 60 80 and 100 the emission targets are 58 1 0 53 3 20 48 6 40 43 9 60 39 1 80 34 4 100 tonnes per year for n emissions and 4 5 0 4 2 20 3 9 40 3 7 60 3 4 80 3 2 100 tonnes per year for p emissions for some solutions with high n reductions the target n reduction is infeasible and due to correlation between n and p emissions p emissions are reduced by more than the target level the results are presented for three scenarios in table 2 scenario 1 minimizes net cost over a currently feasible sub set of abatement actions scenario 2 is the same as scenario 1 except it includes a ban on standard nitrogen fertilizers the scenario 2 policy set has two advantages first it nearly achieves the higher nitrogen abatement target second the increase in fertilizer price to lgas is likely to lead to a reduction in fertilizer use on pos in scenario 3 the cost function is not adjusted for the non market benefits due to constructed wetlands it is a useful comparison for scenario 1 as it gives the present value of costs to residents developers and state and local government the cost effective solutions for the three scenarios are presented in table 2 column c1 gives the emission reduction targets columns c2 and c3 show emissions for each target level columns c4 to c6 give investment in structural abatements during the first decade of the planning horizon namely infill of septic tanks constructed wetlands and imported fill on new developments columns c7 to c12 present average annual levels of abatement actions that are annual recurrent or periodic columns c13 to c15 gives costs c13 total capital cost c14 average annual cost of recurrent and periodic abatement measures over the first decade c15 is the net present cost of the policy net of any public benefits over an infinite time horizon at a 5 discount rate further results are given in fig 5 which indicates the source of abatement in each scenario across all cases septic tank infill is the key policy for n abatement in scenario 2 banning standard fertilizer is a significant source of n abatement across targets in scenario 2 the fertilizer ban substitutes for behaviour change this policy shifts costs onto lgas and through local taxes to households but this increase in cost may be small as the efficacy of slow release fertilizer is higher than that for standard fertilizer and therefore application rates can be reduced 66 scenario 1 allows all abatement actions except banning standard fertilizers and it includes the amenity value of constructed wetlands this scenario can only achieve 60 of the abatement target for n under this scenario the preferred abatement actions are constructed wetlands slow release fertilizers on pos behaviour change and infill of septic tanks as the abatement target increases abatement from behaviour change and septic tank infill increase at the 80 and 100 target optimal solutions include imported fill on new developments and application of phoslock in scenario 2 which allows banning standard fertilizers on pos maximum acceptable n load is nearly achieved with a lower cost than scenario 1 banning standard fertilizer is not selected at the 20 of target when it is selected behaviour change and slow release fertilizers are not selected banning standard fertilizers allows a higher abatement target to be achieved because it is applied to more land uses and unlike behaviour change there is no dis adoption this scenario selects phoslock application to meet the p target scenario 3 is like scenario 1 but it does not account for the amenity value of constructed wetlands the implication is that constructed wetlands become less cost effective and are not selected at the 20 of target instead the target is reached by the infill of septic tanks higher levels of slow release fertilizers and a low level of peri urban agriculture recruited to the fertilizer partnership the net present cost of abatement is 30 higher than scenario 1 costs from scenario 1 of 736 9 million capital cost and an annual cost of 5 7 million are comparable with the estimates provided in the auditor general s report 37 actual expenditure in 2014 was around 100 million a year the wa local government association cited in the auditor general s report indicates that the required expenditure is around 200 million per year for five years on capital investment in urban infrastructure fig 6 presents the abatement cost curve as a function of n abatement abatement costs are largely determined by n abatement n and p are be applied and abated together therefore constructed wetlands and septic tanks are least cost for n abatement and achieve the p target 5 2 costs of uncoordinated policies with uncoordinated policies agencies minimize across the sub set of policies that is within their domain of control we analyze the benefits of coordination by excluding policies in turn and measuring the increase in abatement costs compared to scenario 1 first from fig 7 septic tank infill is a required policy second excluding constructed wetlands shifts abatement costs up by around a 80 million excluding behaviour change has a small effect on abatement costs from figs 5 and 7 the optimal policy set is investment in septic tank infill constructed wetlands and a ban on standard n fertilizer applied to pos by lgas these policies are not prone to the problem of asymmetric information associated with household behaviour change however they do require coordinated investment in the sub catchments at the top and middle of the catchment especially yule brook southern river and upper canning where 90 of the remaining septic tanks are loca1ated see table a9 supplementary appendix constructed wetlands is a cost effective policy at most abatement levels constructed wetlands are restricted to low lying areas of the catchment close to the estuary and 60 of the potential area of constructed wetland is in bannister creek lower canning helm street and ellis brook table a6 banning standard n fertilizer scenario 2 fundamentally changes the optimal policy mix and the cost of this policy falls on lgas with large areas of pos yule brook southern river and upper canning have about 60 of the pos to meet the n and p abatement targets requires the state government to mandate that lgas switch to slow release n fertilizer this would probably require that the lgas with the largest areas of pos are paid some compensation to meet the targets this policy must be combined with investment in septic tank infill and constructed wetlands investing in main sewage is the responsibility of the water corporation investing in constructed wetlands would require state government investment combined with the cooperation of lgas where the wetland is located these policies require that the state government treats environmental water quality as a priority they would need to engage the cooperation of the lgas for septic tank infill in the upper catchment constructed wetlands in the lower catchment and all lgas to change fertilizer practice on pos across the catchment 6 conclusions significant progress has been made in addressing point source emissions of n and p from industry and sewage treatment works progress on addressing agricultural npsp has been slow and in some regions the problem has worsened as urban areas expand into agricultural land and uncultivated native vegetation the problem of urban npsp increases rivers currently degraded by agricultural npsp have n and p emissions further increased by emissions form urban areas urban npsp is an intractable problem in australia and elsewhere for three reasons first the emissions are diffuse and come from many households and firms second the abatement options are complex and third policy is often set in an uncoordinated way with no overall attempt to find a cost effective solution for the canning catchment in western australia we determine the cost effective policy set that includes behaviour change and infrastructure investment through time and across sub catchments the results show that meeting p abatement targets with the current policy set is feasible however it is not feasible to meet n targets without more stringent policies the additional cost of uncoordinated policies that only minimizes cost across a sub set of policies is significant where infrastructure investments are excluded namely septic tank infill and constructed wetlands the cost of meeting n targets could be significantly reduced if the state government mandated that lgas switch to slow release n fertilizer on public open space this shows there is an important role for state regulations as they can change the set of policies available to minimize cost in the canning mandating slow release fertilizer use by lgas fundamentally changes the cost minimizing solution author

8654,nitrogen and phosphorus emissions from urban sources degrade aquatic ecosystems reducing these emissions cost effectively in an urban environment is challenging because they are non point source pollutants and abatement strategies range from behaviour change for garden fertilizer use to large scale infrastructure investments this paper analyses policy options for the canning catchment in western australia with a dynamic and spatial hydro economic model currently responsibility for n and p abatement is fragmented across government agencies a coordinated cost effective policy to meet n and p abatement targets in the case study catchment would cost a 0 5 billion over the next fifty years the minimum cost is approximately doubled if the policy set excludes septic tank infill and constructed wetlands costs are significantly reduced if there is a city wide policy to mandate the use of slow release nitrogen fertilizer on public open space we conclude that there is a significant benefit to society from adopting a coordinated approach to nitrogen and phosphorous abatement further in this case study a non point source pollution problem can be addressed by abatement measures such as infrastructure investment that are directly observable keywords urban pollution nitrogen pollution phosphorous pollution non point source pollution urban stormwater environmental policy data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction elevated n and p concentrations in urban freshwater estuarine and coastal waters cause widespread ecological damage due to eutrophication 1 3 examples of catchments where n and p from urban and agricultural sources cause widespread ecological damage and reduce amenity values include chesapeake bay 4 the thames 5 and perth s swan canning catchment 6 the policy response to n and p pollution in the swan canning has followed three stages 7 the first stage commenced with european settlement of western australia wa in the early 19th century the clearance of native vegetation for urban development was concentrated around the estuary untreated sewage degraded water quality and the estuary was viewed as a risk to human health public concern led to the swan river improvement act of 1925 8 which improved sewage treatment in the second stage from the 1940s to the 1970s point source industrial and wastewater pollution was the main source of n and p emissions this was addressed by relocating heavy industry and water treatment plants away from the estuary in the third and current stage the priority is to reduce urban and agricultural non point source emissions of n and p 9 the canning catchment the case study is a rapidly urbanizing catchment with increasing n and p emissions from residential properties and peri urban agriculture urban emissions are determined by land use and management decisions taken by households developers local authorities sports clubs farms and market gardens urban diffuse pollution adds to background emissions from agriculture in the canning urban emissions are the main source of n and p pollution these emissions have a cumulative effect in the swan canning estuary and damage urban streams and wetlands in the catchment 10 the main barrier to regulating non point source pollution npsp cost effectively is that the regulator does not observe the agents emissions 11 12 further the obvious second best alternative of regulating fertilizer applications is costly to implement difficult to observe and may not be directly related to emission levels thus agricultural and urban npsp policies are often based on third best hard to fake measures such as land use change and technology investments for instance the nitrate sensitive area is a command and control policy to reduce nitrate emissions in england restricts land use and livestock stocking rates 13 15 by restricting the policy to observable actions such as land use has led to a policy with relatively high abatement costs 16 similar schemes are found in most developed countries 17 22 most well funded national schemes such as the environmental quality incentives program 23 are targeted at rural land and commercial agriculture rather than urban areas theoretically efficient solutions to npsp have not been widely applied to our knowledge there are no ambient tax 11 based policies despite their potential to achieve ambient water quality targets at least cost the only example of a market based policy for agricultural npsp is the lake taupo nitrogen program in new zealand which is a cap and trade scheme 24 the virginia water quality trading programs is a cap and trade scheme for n emission trading between point source and npsp agricultural polluters 25 urban npsp can be addressed by changing the use of fertilizer by households 26 in the swan canning the great gardens project was implemented in 2006 with the aim of changing household behaviour related to fertilizer use 27 28 it was successful in reducing fertilizer use by persuading households to change to slow release fertilizers and changing their garden palnts to ones with a low fertilizer requirement a further pilot project was implemented in a high emission suburb 29 this project was successful in reducing fertilizer use over a 12 month monitoring period there have been numerous non market valuation and cost and benefits studies of urban water infrastructure 30 related to pollution papers related to this research include polyakov et al 10 who use hedonic pricing in the canning catchment to measure the use value of restoring an urban drain to a living steam wong et al 31 and castonguay et al 32 compare the cost effectiveness of constructed wetlands and rainwater ponds in melbourne as technologies for stripping nitrogen from urban stormwater the objective of this paper is to determine the optimal set of policies to reduce urban non point source pollution the contribution of this paper to the literature is first it is one of a small number of papers also see ref 33 to develop a catchment wide spatial and dynamic cost effectiveness analysis of urban non point source pollution the second contribution is that we analyze a comprehensive set of policies including infrastructure investment third the results provide an assessment of the cost reduction gains to coordinated catchment policies the paper is organized as follows the next section describes the canning catchment section 3 describes the hydro economic model section 4 gives data sources and their interpretation section 5 gives results and discussion with a focus on the cost increase due to uncoordinated policy section 6 concludes 2 case study catchment and pollution policy 2 1 the canning catchment the canning river see figs 1 and 2 drains into perth s iconic swan canning estuary it was selected as a case study catchment as first it provides highly valued ecosystem services 34 to a perth population of around 2 million people 35 second the canning is a rapidly urbanizing catchment categorized as a priority for n and p abatement 22 third it exemplifies the complexity of managing npsp through fertilizer restrictions infrastructure investment and behaviour change abatement cost minimization requires four levels of coordinated action across the catchment first spatial coordination that ensures that abatement occurs in the local government areas lgas with the lowest marginal abatement cost second coordination of actions where the least cost set of abatement actions are selected within lgas third coordination across pollutants that accounts for the correlation between n and p emissions fourth dynamic coordination so that infrastructure investments accounts for increased pollutant loads as land is developed the hydro economic cost minimization described below gives an ideal coordinated policy we also use the cost minimization model to explore the role of state government laws and policies the state government has the power to order lgas to switch their use of n fertilizer on public open space pos especially sport fields and golf courses mandating the use of slow release n fertilizer on pos imposes relatively low costs on local government rate payers but significantly reduces the cost of achieving emission targets the current legislative framework is set out in the swan and canning rivers management act 2006 a recent review of the implementation of the act 36 identifies that progress in improving water quality in the swan canning is hindered by the involvement of 21 local government authorities lgas and 15 state government agencies in decision making further in a critique of the performance of past policies the western australian auditor general 37 identifies a lack of regulatory coordination as a barrier to cost effective pollution abatement the management of the swan canning is currently divided between government departments the department of water and environmental regulation has overall responsibility for water resources and has regulatory oversight of the publicly owned water corporation which is responsible for water supply and urban drainage the department of biodiversity conservation and attractions has responsibility for the environmental protection of the estuary and the department of primary industry and development responsibility for the agricultural catchment local responsibility is devolved down to local government authorities more details are given below the situation has been made more complex over the last seven years by changes in government department names and mergers the regulatory authority for the catchment is divided between four state government departments and a government owned company the department of biodiversity conservation and attractions dbca previously the department of parks and wildlife and swan river trust srt has regulatory oversight for a sub region in the urbanized catchment namely the riverpark and the development control area dbca has no direct regulatory control for emissions over the avon and canning agricultural catchment which covers 2 090 km2 the department of water and environmental regulation dwer previously the department of water has a broad remit to protect water resources in wa dwer provides hydrological modelling of n and p loads and monitors water quality jointly with dbca dwer administers planning approvals over stormwater management in new housing developments 38 dwer also regulates the water corporation the water corporation is a state government owned company responsible for water supplies wastewater management and drainage services including urban drains in the swan canning the water corporation has a program of connecting residential properties with septic tanks to the main urban sewerage system the water corporation also manages water demand through block water pricing garden watering restrictions and garden education programs the department of primary industries and regional development dpird regulates the farming and horticultural sector in the canning dpird is responsible for initiatives related to peri urban agriculture its main educational initiative is the fertilizer partnership which developed phosphorus fertilizer budgets for farms with the aim of reducing phosphorous emissions 39 dpird could also introduce policies to reduce emissions from the agricultural catchment 40 2 2 evidence of policy effectiveness the western australian auditor general s report 37 finds that from 1995 to 2013 there was a deterioration in water quality as measured by chlorophyll a dissolved oxygen total n and total p all these measures failed to meet standards set by the australian and new zealand environment and conservation council anzecc water quality guidelines 41 the swan river trust established two target levels for emissions in the river a short run maximum target which should never be exceeded as it would likely trigger rapid ecological degradation through extreme eutrophication events and a long run maximum target which is the level required to maintain an ecologically stable healthy river fig 3 shows that southern river an urbanized sub catchment of the canning failed to meet its long run n and p targets 22 42 p56 but has consistently met the short run targets high emissions were also found for the bannister creek catchment and other sub catchments in the upper canning 43 44 heavy rainfall often causes a sharp increase in emissions that result in algal blooms and fish kills further evidence on meeting emission targets is given in table a1 appendix 22 p55 biological measures of ecosystem health include algal blooms fish diversity and fish kills the number of algal blooms in the swan canning has declined to around two to three per year from 2010 to 11 to 2014 15 down from a peak of nine events in 2008 09 a fish community index which measures fish numbers and diversity was assessed as fair 45 from 2003 to 2015 there were eight significant fish kill events in the canning recorded by the department of water all occurring in the autumn and linked to heavy rainfall 3 hydro economic model the hydro economic model is a non linear spatial and dynamic model that minimizes the present value of abatement costs to achieve target levels of emissions the target levels of emission are average n and p emissions over ten year periods the planning horizon for abatement cost minimization is divided into three stages the first 10 years years 11 20 and years 21 and onwards during the first 10 years all land planned for residential development in the wa development plan 46 is assumed to be developed infrastructure investment and recurrent abatement can be implemented during this first stage during the second stage only recurrent abatement actions are considered the least cost abatement actions established for years 11 20 are assumed to be repeated indefinitely during the third stage the following sub sections give the modelling assumptions and structure fig 4 outlines the land uses agents and regulators that determine n and p emissions in the catchment agents include farmers peri urban agriculture horticultural producers golf clubs other sports clubs households local government authorities lgas that manage extensive areas of sports turf and public open space and the water corporation developers affect nutrient emissions by designing housing developments and installing stormwater management infrastructure living streams constructed wetlands and biofilters developers can apply soil amendments during landscaping for gardens and public open space pos within developments the regulators dbca dwer dpird and lgas are responsible for establishing and enforcing a legal framework for developments installing and operating in stream abatement technologies such as oxygenation plants and applying phoslock to remove phosphates from freshwater streams the set of actions that agents can apply are classified as either recurrent abatement or structural abatement recurrent abatement actions include fertilizer quantity fertilizer quality conventional or slow release and in stream abatement for example phoslock structural abatement investments include soil amendment biofilters septic tank infill and constructed wetlands behaviour change related to fertilizer use is through educational programs such as the great gardens project 27 28 these schemes develop community awareness about reducing emissions from fertilizer use is through educational campaigns such schemes are equivalent to structural abatement in the sense that they involve an initial investment in education about fertilizer management the effectiveness of education in changing behaviour declines and needs to be reinforced by repetition this result has been found in recent behavioural economics interventions for natural resource conservation 47 the model objective function is to minimize the present value of net cost subject to n and p abatement as a percent of maximum emissions targets costs are net of the direct social benefits of the investment for instance constructed wetlands and living streams contribute to nutrient abatement and provide a significant non market amenity value 10 48 49 the objective function aggregates cost across different agents in the catchment nutrient emissions are calculated by allocating land to treatments that reduce nutrient emissions not all abatement measures strictly relate to land use for instance constructed wetlands relate to locations in the catchment rather than specific land uses and involve a conversion of either bushland or pos to wetland phoslock applications remove bioavailable phosphate directly from rivers by binding it to clay 50 the economic model is linked to a hydrological model that represents nutrient transport from sub catchments to the canning estuary the hydrology of n and p transport in the canning has been modelled in several studies 6 51 55 to allow rapid optimization of the hydro economic model the hydrology of the catchment is represented by transfer coefficients for n and p transport from sub catchments to the estuary derived from the results of the streamflow quality affecting rivers and estuaries square hydrology model developed by the department of water 6 56 59 key assumptions for the hydro economic model are assumption 1 n and p transport in the canning catchment is represented by a linear and deterministic annual load model based on sub catchment transport coefficients and sub catchment and annual emissions from land uses assumption 2 the cost of sewage infill depends on the property size and emissions from all septic tanks are the same for a sub catchment assumption 3 constructed wetlands have a constant construction and maintenance cost per ha assumption 4 behaviour change has a constant adoption rate and decline in adoption across the catchment over time following an initial education campaign assumption 5 the efficacy in terms of abatement of banning standard fertilizers and requiring all local government authorities to use slow release n fertilizer on public open space assumes no slow release n fertilizer is currently used assumption 6 the planning horizon is infinite assumption 7 land currently designated for new housing is developed by the end of the first 10 years in the planning horizon the model represents n and p emissions m n p in m sub catchments i 1 m and l land uses l 1 l where s i l t is the area of a land use l in catchment i in year t land use in the catchment changes over the planning horizon on the basis that land currently under development is converted to urban residential by the end of the first 10 years in line with the development plan for the sub catchments 46 the areas of land uses are constant after the first decade the input of nutrient m in fertilizers in catchment i land use l in year t

basis are those with a relatively high proportion of urban land use table a2 4 1 investments in structural abatement 4 1 1 septic tank infill typical emissions from septic tanks are given in table a9 the cost of connecting septic tanks to the main sewage system depends on the land area of the residential block the water corporation estimated an average cost of a 30 000 per connection with a lower estimate of a 20 000 and an upper estimate of a 80 000 the cost of connection increases with the distance of the house to the main sewer and the slope of the land see table 1 4 1 2 constructed wetlands phoslock iron man gypsum drainage treatment non market use benefits of constructed wetlands are derived from the hedonic price estimates provided by ref 10 for the bannister creek living stream restoration project it is assumed that the effectiveness of constructed wetlands in terms of removing n and p is permanent table a6 presents n and p reduction when the maximum area of constructed wetlands is included in each sub catchment phoslock has the capacity to remove up to 1 kg of p for every 100 kg applied to the river and it remains active for three years the cost of removing p is a 340 kg 50 63 iron man gypsum img is an amendment of subsoil drains to remove n and p in urban groundwater discharge 64 this action is implemented at the ground preparation stage of greenfield residential developments and permanently reduces emissions detailed assumptions are given in table 1 4 2 recurrent abatement actions most of these abatement actions can be characterized as requiring behaviour change or regulation applied either to households or local government authorities lgas currently the only regulation applied to fertilizer formulations in western australia is a restriction on the maximum p content in fertilizers for domestic use 65 table 1 gives detailed descriptions assumptions and sources for all recurrent abatement actions 4 2 1 household behaviour change from a study in the swan catchment 29 60 programs to educate households about reducing nutrient emissions from gardens can be implemented in two ways intensive campaigns that involve calling on households and face to face interaction and low intensity campaigns through telephone calls and websites assumptions about adoption efficacy and costs are given in table 1 we assume the effectiveness of education declines linearly over time due to dis adoption the level of adoption is increased by repeating a campaign 4 2 2 peri urban agriculture behaviour change the fertilizer partnership is a behaviour change initiative for agricultural and urban properties it encourages improved fertilizer efficiency by reducing the applications of highly water soluble p in bulk fertilizer it also encourages the use of soil testing to reduce excess p use and identify soil constraints that can limit crop productivity and fertilizer uptake by plants 4 2 3 fertilizer policies for public open space we model three types of public open space pos golf courses active sport and passive pos the abatement strategy is to use slow release fertilizers 66 in addition the model allows for a total ban on standard fertilizers on pos 5 results the model gives the least cost combination of actions that achieve the emission standard and is solved using the gams conopt solver 67 chapter 7 5 1 cost effective policy targets are based on the maximum acceptable n and p loads defined by swan river trust 20 given in table 2 for instance the target reduction for n is the current emission baseline column 1 in table 2 less the maximum acceptable load in column 3 we define five targets with 20 increments 20 40 60 80 and 100 the emission targets are 58 1 0 53 3 20 48 6 40 43 9 60 39 1 80 34 4 100 tonnes per year for n emissions and 4 5 0 4 2 20 3 9 40 3 7 60 3 4 80 3 2 100 tonnes per year for p emissions for some solutions with high n reductions the target n reduction is infeasible and due to correlation between n and p emissions p emissions are reduced by more than the target level the results are presented for three scenarios in table 2 scenario 1 minimizes net cost over a currently feasible sub set of abatement actions scenario 2 is the same as scenario 1 except it includes a ban on standard nitrogen fertilizers the scenario 2 policy set has two advantages first it nearly achieves the higher nitrogen abatement target second the increase in fertilizer price to lgas is likely to lead to a reduction in fertilizer use on pos in scenario 3 the cost function is not adjusted for the non market benefits due to constructed wetlands it is a useful comparison for scenario 1 as it gives the present value of costs to residents developers and state and local government the cost effective solutions for the three scenarios are presented in table 2 column c1 gives the emission reduction targets columns c2 and c3 show emissions for each target level columns c4 to c6 give investment in structural abatements during the first decade of the planning horizon namely infill of septic tanks constructed wetlands and imported fill on new developments columns c7 to c12 present average annual levels of abatement actions that are annual recurrent or periodic columns c13 to c15 gives costs c13 total capital cost c14 average annual cost of recurrent and periodic abatement measures over the first decade c15 is the net present cost of the policy net of any public benefits over an infinite time horizon at a 5 discount rate further results are given in fig 5 which indicates the source of abatement in each scenario across all cases septic tank infill is the key policy for n abatement in scenario 2 banning standard fertilizer is a significant source of n abatement across targets in scenario 2 the fertilizer ban substitutes for behaviour change this policy shifts costs onto lgas and through local taxes to households but this increase in cost may be small as the efficacy of slow release fertilizer is higher than that for standard fertilizer and therefore application rates can be reduced 66 scenario 1 allows all abatement actions except banning standard fertilizers and it includes the amenity value of constructed wetlands this scenario can only achieve 60 of the abatement target for n under this scenario the preferred abatement actions are constructed wetlands slow release fertilizers on pos behaviour change and infill of septic tanks as the abatement target increases abatement from behaviour change and septic tank infill increase at the 80 and 100 target optimal solutions include imported fill on new developments and application of phoslock in scenario 2 which allows banning standard fertilizers on pos maximum acceptable n load is nearly achieved with a lower cost than scenario 1 banning standard fertilizer is not selected at the 20 of target when it is selected behaviour change and slow release fertilizers are not selected banning standard fertilizers allows a higher abatement target to be achieved because it is applied to more land uses and unlike behaviour change there is no dis adoption this scenario selects phoslock application to meet the p target scenario 3 is like scenario 1 but it does not account for the amenity value of constructed wetlands the implication is that constructed wetlands become less cost effective and are not selected at the 20 of target instead the target is reached by the infill of septic tanks higher levels of slow release fertilizers and a low level of peri urban agriculture recruited to the fertilizer partnership the net present cost of abatement is 30 higher than scenario 1 costs from scenario 1 of 736 9 million capital cost and an annual cost of 5 7 million are comparable with the estimates provided in the auditor general s report 37 actual expenditure in 2014 was around 100 million a year the wa local government association cited in the auditor general s report indicates that the required expenditure is around 200 million per year for five years on capital investment in urban infrastructure fig 6 presents the abatement cost curve as a function of n abatement abatement costs are largely determined by n abatement n and p are be applied and abated together therefore constructed wetlands and septic tanks are least cost for n abatement and achieve the p target 5 2 costs of uncoordinated policies with uncoordinated policies agencies minimize across the sub set of policies that is within their domain of control we analyze the benefits of coordination by excluding policies in turn and measuring the increase in abatement costs compared to scenario 1 first from fig 7 septic tank infill is a required policy second excluding constructed wetlands shifts abatement costs up by around a 80 million excluding behaviour change has a small effect on abatement costs from figs 5 and 7 the optimal policy set is investment in septic tank infill constructed wetlands and a ban on standard n fertilizer applied to pos by lgas these policies are not prone to the problem of asymmetric information associated with household behaviour change however they do require coordinated investment in the sub catchments at the top and middle of the catchment especially yule brook southern river and upper canning where 90 of the remaining septic tanks are loca1ated see table a9 supplementary appendix constructed wetlands is a cost effective policy at most abatement levels constructed wetlands are restricted to low lying areas of the catchment close to the estuary and 60 of the potential area of constructed wetland is in bannister creek lower canning helm street and ellis brook table a6 banning standard n fertilizer scenario 2 fundamentally changes the optimal policy mix and the cost of this policy falls on lgas with large areas of pos yule brook southern river and upper canning have about 60 of the pos to meet the n and p abatement targets requires the state government to mandate that lgas switch to slow release n fertilizer this would probably require that the lgas with the largest areas of pos are paid some compensation to meet the targets this policy must be combined with investment in septic tank infill and constructed wetlands investing in main sewage is the responsibility of the water corporation investing in constructed wetlands would require state government investment combined with the cooperation of lgas where the wetland is located these policies require that the state government treats environmental water quality as a priority they would need to engage the cooperation of the lgas for septic tank infill in the upper catchment constructed wetlands in the lower catchment and all lgas to change fertilizer practice on pos across the catchment 6 conclusions significant progress has been made in addressing point source emissions of n and p from industry and sewage treatment works progress on addressing agricultural npsp has been slow and in some regions the problem has worsened as urban areas expand into agricultural land and uncultivated native vegetation the problem of urban npsp increases rivers currently degraded by agricultural npsp have n and p emissions further increased by emissions form urban areas urban npsp is an intractable problem in australia and elsewhere for three reasons first the emissions are diffuse and come from many households and firms second the abatement options are complex and third policy is often set in an uncoordinated way with no overall attempt to find a cost effective solution for the canning catchment in western australia we determine the cost effective policy set that includes behaviour change and infrastructure investment through time and across sub catchments the results show that meeting p abatement targets with the current policy set is feasible however it is not feasible to meet n targets without more stringent policies the additional cost of uncoordinated policies that only minimizes cost across a sub set of policies is significant where infrastructure investments are excluded namely septic tank infill and constructed wetlands the cost of meeting n targets could be significantly reduced if the state government mandated that lgas switch to slow release n fertilizer on public open space this shows there is an important role for state regulations as they can change the set of policies available to minimize cost in the canning mandating slow release fertilizer use by lgas fundamentally changes the cost minimizing solution author
