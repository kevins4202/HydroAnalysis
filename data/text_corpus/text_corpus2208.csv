11040,millions of small reservoirs built across semi arid areas present a potential to support agricultural livelihoods of rural smallholders the scale and geographical dispersion of these multiple lakes restrict the understanding of these coupled human water systems and the identification of adequate strategies to support riparian farmers this research developed a multi scalar interdisciplinary approach to characterise the hydrological and wider drivers of agricultural water use around multiple small reservoirs in semi arid central tunisia the combination of field surveys quantitative questionnaires and qualitative semi structured interviews confirmed minimal withdrawals but highlighted the diversification of practices the rise in fruit farming and peripheral benefits generated here by the development of 56 lakes 48 of lakes provide residual benefits for the occasional watering of on average 300 fruit trees and support to downstream wells exploited for irrigation a further 13 lakes 23 provide high levels of benefits 900 fruit trees each albeit with low equity supporting essentially established farmers the analysis of surface water assessments every 8 days from landsat 5 8 imagery over 1999 2014 provides unprecedented insights into the significant water scarcity and unreliability that impedes agricultural intensification on 86 of small lakes limited storage capacities and prolonged droughts highlight the need for small reservoirs in this climatic context to retain a supplementary irrigation objective and not strive to support widespread intensification of irrigated practices many farmers lack the capabilities to increase their withdrawals and suffer physical and economic water access difficulties mismanagement compounded through limited and short term government assistance individual successes resulted from farmers economic resilience and means to secure alternate water supplies during dry spells keywords socio hydrology remote sensing small reservoirs water harvesting tunisia 1 introduction 1 1 agricultural water uses in small reservoirs by harvesting scarce and unreliable rainfall for local inhabitants small reservoirs have the potential to supplement water resources and extend the growing season of farmers within poor rural areas wisser et al 2010 their reduced costs and ability to be implemented at the scale of individual farms or clusters notably supports recent efforts to recognise and promote irrigation and water management practices of millions of smallholders vincent 2003 studies revealed multi use systems ayantunde et al 2018 de fraiture et al 2014 with diverse benefits including watering livestock irrigation fish production as well as recreational and cultural importance agricultural production remained sometimes limited faulkner et al 2008 habi and morsli 2011 khlifi et al 2010 mugabe et al 2003 leading to concerns by donors and investors despite the strong demand and apparent affection for reservoirs by users venot and hirvonen 2013 this contradiction highlighted the difficulty in identifying and quantifying the real outputs of these systems partly due to the inherently subjective and restrictive frameworks used centred on issues of agricultural performance efficiency or productivity venot and krishnan 2011 literature on the reasons which constrain or favour agricultural water use in small reservoirs remains scarce hydrological limitations and user uncertainties over water availability have been highlighted mugabe et al 2003 however other observations pointed to insufficient resources to cover investment maintenance costs lack of adequate management structures zairi et al 2005 or the consequence of government strategies and siting criteria talineau et al 1994 the overlapping interactions between drivers of agricultural water use remain poorly understood often as a result of mono disciplinary studies considering agronomic social i e cultural economic institutional and hydrological factors separately 1 2 investigating socio hydrosystems the recent surge in scientific literature in socio hydrology di baldassarre et al 2013 king et al 2012 montanari et al 2013 riaux 2013 sivakumar 2012 sivapalan et al 2012 highlights the growing recognition of the importance and difficulties in studying the mutual interactions in human water systems despite the popularity for the recently coined term the concept refers to common contemporary approaches which recognise the importance of human interactions within hydrological systems falkenmark 1977 as in other socio ecological systems ostrom 1990 this begun with considering human influences such as withdrawals impoundments and other human induced changes on hydrological systems moving away from theoretically undisturbed natural systems thompson et al 2013 conversely it also focussed on the influence of hydrological systems on human interests notably water variability on water food security and the consequences of flood dynamics di baldassarre et al 2013 and droughts socio hydrology represents a step further to provide new insights on the broad complex interactions and retroactions braden et al 2009 wesselink et al 2017 of coupled human water systems understanding the finer workings of these socio hydrosystems notably requires in depth field investigations massuel et al 2018 which must be transcribed into operational approaches modus operandi hale et al 2015 sivapalan et al 2012 suitable approaches must notably seek to extract value from incorporating the approach and viewpoints of other disciplines rather than simply combining their results by exploring and borrowing different tools such interdisciplinary approaches may address water and society issues from a different perspective and allow new topics and new questions to be investigated and generated massuel et al 2018 riaux and massuel 2014 this field based comparative sociohydrology may then identify key variables to account for when upscaling or transposing such investigations and according to pande and sivapalan 2016 may feed into wider socio hydrological modelling research an original socio hydrological approach is developed here to investigate the agricultural water uses around multiple small reservoirs and the drivers which foster or constrain agricultural development on their banks understanding the dynamics around small reservoirs requires a comprehensive framework to study the reservoir s hydrology the riparian community and the way they are interlinked 2 methods research combined hydrological monitoring numerical modelling remote sensing ethnographic enquiry and qualitative analysis while developing a nested scale approach to provide varying depth of analysis as we proceeded to upscale observations on individual small reservoirs to more than 50 small reservoirs scattered across a 1200 km2 catchment in semi arid tunisia 2 1 case study site the study site is the merguellil upper catchment 1200 km² fig 12 situated in semi arid central tunisia 329 mm year 131 mm where 56 small reservoirs were built as a result of successive water and soil conservation programmes since the 1960s khlifi et al 2010 selmi et al 2001 following a nationwide strategy setting ambitious objectives of 1000 small reservoirs 700 small reservoirs were built nationally by the late 1990s for an estimated capacity of 70 mm3 around kairouan this 1 st phase led to the construction of 39 small reservoirs followed by a second phase after 2002 supported through a host of additional international projects cnea 2006 the 56 lakes were inventoried through the combination and cross referencing of records from local authorities literature cnea 2006 kingumbi 2006 lacombe 2007 satellite imagery and field visits ogilvie et al 2016 the area has been the focus of numerous agricultural surveys and a vast hydrological and climatic observation network albergel and rejeb 1997 leduc et al 2007 which included the monitoring of 13 small reservoirs considering the importance of climatic and human changes on the downstream irrigated kairouan plain initial design capacities of small reservoirs in the catchment range between 17 000 m3 and 1 590 000 m3 though the median size only reaches 66 000 m3 land uses in the catchment are dominated by traditional mediterranean crops mostly rainfed cereals 30 of catchment surface area and fruit trees 20 especially olive groves suited to the extended dry season grasslands cover 30 forest 19 and towns and watercourses the remaining 1 dridi et al 2001 3 500 ha fruit trees and market gardening are irrigated mostly from unregulated groundwater resources le goulven et al 2009 2 2 assessing water availability water resources were assessed across 48 lakes based on surface water assessments acquired from 546 landsat 5 8 images over 1999 2014 the method described in ogilvie et al 2018 uses a fixed threshold modified normalised difference water index xu 2006 calibrated against extensive field data surface area are converted to volumes using a locally derived surface volume rating curve where the b and β model parameters were incremented over time to account for silting based on known maximum capacity and construction date ogilvie et al 2016 time series were spline interpolated and gap filled using the tsgf extension forkel et al 2013 in order to allow water availability statistics to be calculated over time rmse on mean annual volumes reaches 20 600 m3 lakes built recently daoud 3 mdinia 2 in 2012 as well as 6 minor lakes e g bouksab 2 for which maximum capacity data was not available were excluded from the water availability analysis to allow unbiased comparison of all lakes interannual water availability was also assessed over the common period 2007 2014 when all 48 lakes were in operation 2 2 1 characterising agricultural water availability considering water uses depend on the amplitude but also the timing and duration of the flood the number of days that water levels exceed a given volume were calculated for each lake to highlight the irrigation potential values were calculated over the whole year and the 6 months of dry season april october when potential watering needs are greatest a 5000 m3 threshold was chosen based on interviews as it reflected sufficient water availability to promote irrigated activities by two farmers these farmers developed market gardening or fruit trees withdrawing water for 8 h day 3 or more days week significantly it also complies based on the height surface volume hsv rating curves with a minimal water depth of 1 m required according to interviews by users to operate pumps without silt from the lake floor bed clogging the pumps aggregating a minimum of 6 landsat pixels also reduced the presence of single outliers whilst remaining inferior to the size of the smallest lakes 0 5 ha the 48 lakes were then categorised based on the length of time they succeeded or failed to meet the required water threshold 2 3 characterisation of water uses water uses associated with small reservoirs were examined through a combination of field surveys quantitative questionnaires as well as semi structured interviews borrowed from ethnographic methodologies a multi stage sampling methodology mushtaq et al 2007 was used to identify broad water use characteristics at the catchment scale and define with greater detail water uses and profile water users on a selection of lakes fig 1 2 3 1 water use field surveys on 56 lakes field surveys enabled preliminary scoping of the type of water uses across all 56 reservoirs surveys undertaken between april and june 2011 noted the presence and number of pumps watering pipes bergater and cisterns which allow watering from the lake they also qualitatively listed the presence of nearby habitations fruit trees market gardening rainfed crops grazing and watering livestock nearby flood recession cropping on the banks of the lake to benefit from increased and prolonged soil moisture was also recorded as were nearby wells under the influence of lakes considering their potential benefit for groundwater recharge selmi and zekri 1995 furthermore all water supply sources spring boreholes wadi were inventoried to highlight the role of these lakes in supplementary irrigation information collected through these water use surveys on 56 reservoirs was compared with previous inventories undertaken in 1999 and 2005 at similar periods of the year lacombe 2007 in 1999 interviews focussed on 43 reservoirs while in 2005 extensive agricultural use surveys were carried out on 25 lakes in the region additional local studies selmi et al 2001 selmi and zekri 1995 and reports including original project documents and evaluation reports e g cnea 2006 were used notably to identify the original objectives of lakes and the wider assistance provided to riparian farmers 2 3 2 agricultural questionnaires on 22 lakes preliminary scoping on all 56 lakes distinguished 24 lakes with motor pumps and 23 lakes without a further 9 lakes potentially supported the recharge of nearby wells the latter were differentiated considering the different dynamics in terms of water resources access government support involvement in water use association prior irrigation experience etc selmi and talineau 1994 a sample of 22 reservoirs was then chosen to carry out quantitative questionnaires about agricultural practices and water uses 16 lakes studied in 2005 were included to provide diachronic assessments of agricultural water uses and management additional lakes were randomly selected to investigate a total of 17 lakes 75 equipped with motorpumps 4 lakes with no apparent withdrawals were investigated to specifically explore the reasons behind these one further lake supporting the recharge of nearby wells was included all 48 farmers on the 22 lakes were interviewed on the following topics household and livelihood strategies farm characteristics agricultural practices across each plot crop types surface areas yields watering regimes livestock water access and water uses lake withdrawals water management and future perspectives additional questions on land rights and government assistance to draw out potential constraints influencing water use were also included based upon the insights gained in the semi structured interviews 2 3 3 semi structured in depth interviews on 4 lakes 25 semi structured in depth interviews were undertaken over 2011 2013 with farmers on four reservoirs presenting a cross section of water use availability and issues identified through initial surveys riaux et al 2014 as a qualitative tool semi structured interviews were not intended to be multiplied for the sake of increasing representativity and instead sought to illustrate and shed light on specific complex issues which other faster methods are unable to beaud 1996 longhurst 2009 this technique combined with observations and literature review to form an ethnographic framework seeks to build greater trust with the interviewee and allow for more personal confidential or sensitive information to be disclosed relating here to conflicts or political and economic constraints the open framework also allowed for a comprehensive assessment of wider unsuspected uses benefits and issues to be captured in contrary to predetermined constrained and subjective framework becker 1998 venot and cecchi 2011 discussions focussed around predetermined topics identified from the literature and initial visits to the reservoirs which sought to paint a portrait of how lives had evolved around the reservoir after its construction life story denzin and lincoln 1994 based only on the assumption that people exploit the available resources this work followed the grounded theory approach glaser and strauss 1967 to understand the drivers which explain the apparent low agricultural water use lacombe 2007 riaux et al 2014 focusing on the history of the site the origins of the small reservoir and its management and water uses discussions sought to understand in greater detail the influence of water user associations land and water rights government incentives economic difficulties and conflicts high resolution digital globe and astrium satellite imagery available in google earth and bing maps were used as a visual aid to represent the location of plots and pumps and stimulate discussions carte parlée collard and burte 2014 interviews were not recorded but transcribed and typed up collectively to iron out uncertainties or incoherences beaud 1996 2 4 deducing socio hydrological constraints to water use the information extracted through quantitative agricultural interviews and qualitative semi structured interviews were combined to characterise the users and their agricultural practices on 22 small reservoirs based on the information gathered through rapid surveys across all reservoirs key water use characteristics of each lake and their statistical distribution were identified leading to a typology of the 56 lakes agricultural benefits withdrawal patterns including average pumping duration and frequencies during the dry and rainy seasons for each category of lakes were calculated from the questionnaire data ogilvie 2015 higher resolution in the withdrawals estimates was not relevant considering the high uncertainties observed in the number of pumps in operation each year and on each lake the water uses and water availability typologies were then crossed on the common subset of 48 lakes to identify where water availability is constraining or supporting agricultural water use the incoherences highlighted associated with the in depth knowledge gained through ethnographic enquiry then helped shed light on the multiple social cultural historical political institutional and economic drivers which influence agricultural development around small reservoirs interpretation of the dynamics around reservoirs followed an iterative process whereby initial hypotheses deduced from observations were gradually confirmed or invalidated through the interviews and hydrological assessments interviews trigger new questions and hypotheses which progressively reorient refine and nuance our evolving understanding of this socio hydrological system the multiple replies obtained allow us to triangulate the information e g who shares the pumps did the government assist what happened to the water user associations conflicts etc until we reach a saturation point where the additional information only reinforces the confidence in our interpretation of the system but ceases to provide new insights olivier de sardan 2005 feeding the insights gained from interviews into the design of the questionnaires e g questions on land rights water user associations allowed us to identify the spatial statistical distribution of these drivers and help upscale local observations 3 results and discussion 3 1 supporting and diversifying livelihoods around small reservoirs the introduction of small reservoirs was first and foremost accompanied by a change in agro pastoral activities notably the development and expansion of irrigated practices sometimes at the expense of other livelihood strategies 3 1 1 fruit tree farming fruit trees were observed on the banks of over 80 of all lakes these were cultivated by all interviewed farmers 58 of which declared taking up arboriculture activities following the construction of the lake the number of fruit trees ranged from 4400 over 20 ha to 13 trees on 0 5 ha mean 720 trees on 6 3 ha highlighting the variability across farms and lakes fig 2 only a few farmers strive to expand the number of trees on their land el maiz sidi sofiane 2 mahbes morra with most others having already exploited all their land and only planting new trees to replace dead ones olive trees dominate 61 2 of fruit trees and yield around 1 2 galba tree 1 galba is equivalent to 1 l of oil or 14 kg providing for the family consumption and additional revenue during good years for 65 of people surveyed values are consistent with selmi et al 2001 mean 8 ha on 57 lakes in the wider kairouan governorate but significantly lower than those in cnea 2006 2000 3000 fruit trees on 20 ha partly due to the greater proportion of lakes with large exploitations in their sample in jendouba northern tunisia khlifi et al 2010 reported an increase in the average surface area for trees from 3 ha to 23 ha over 8 years following the introduction of small reservoirs however this region benefits from comparatively higher rainfall 450 950 mm from south to north not accounting for additional socio economic differences which may explain this dynamic farmers rely on motor driven pumps to draw water from the lake which is conveyed to the plots using bergater pipes and a network of trenches and impoundments to channel water to each tree some farmers had built a basin and practised gravity fed irrigation mahbes daoued while drip irrigation was only recorded on three exploitations sidi sofiane fadden boras and el kraroub the filling of cisterns was only allowed on 45 of lakes surveyed and on half of these their use was restricted to riparian farmers which reached as many as 20 families garia s skhira 3 o el haffar or el mahbes on the other half cisterns were also provided to farmers from further afield for supplementary irrigation for free 50 cisterns year at morra 100 at skhira 4 or sold as on o daoued 3 where 4 cisterns of 3000 l at a time operate and up to 50 cisterns per day are withdrawn during summer months 3 1 2 market gardening market gardening had been attempted at some stage on 80 of lakes surveyed and by 65 of farmers interviewed but only 20 of these continue this activity today fig 3 surface areas were typically small under 0 5 ha and mostly for personal consumption except for two farmers surveyed for whom market gardening became and remains today an income generating activity ain smili guettar these values are close to those observed by selmi et al 2001 who had previously observed an average of 0 25 ha for market gardening on lakes in the region and similarly observed a rapid decline of activity within three years 3 1 3 cereals in very rare instances morra and sidi sofiane farmers had installed sprinklers up to 9 over 3 ha to exploit water from the lake during the early phases of cereal growth in both cases the practice ceased rapidly as unreliable rainfall during the rest of the growth period during which they chose not to continue watering reduced all benefit similar practices in the jendouba region had also been observed on a handful 3 out of 18 of reservoirs but again only over the first two years khlifi et al 2010 cereal cropping continues to be practised by 70 of farmers around small reservoirs but 20 declared ceasing rainfed cereals after the lake s construction to concentrate on fruit trees this conversion remains much less significant than around small reservoirs around jendouba where in 2 years people reportedly all converted to fruit farming and market gardening khlifi et al 2010 in certain cases skhira soil humidity on the contours of lake were used to advantage by farmers to grow cereals flood recession cropping however benefits can be outweighed by potential flooding and several farmers preferred to refrain from cropping near the reservoirs to reduce risk of damage to their crops 3 1 4 livestock livestock is a major traditional activity and 70 of lakes surveyed were reportedly used to water livestock in certain remote areas with limited alternate water supply lakes reduce the distance livestock must travel thereby increasing productivity of the herd 27 of farmers declared abandoning this activity following the construction of the lake as farmers reported having less time to water and feed their stock but also due to increasing pressure on land leading certain years to conflicts over fodder as well as increased theft since the 2011 revolution 3 1 5 groundwater recharge and peripheral water use farmers on 12 lakes witnessed the positive influence of the lake on the level and recovery times of their wells which support fruit tree and market gardening activities this positive effect was notably documented selmi and talineau 1994 selmi and zekri 1995 on two wells downstream of gouazine where groundwater levels rose by 11 m and 4 m respectively after the dam was built as well as in other parts of tunisia zairi et al 2005 geochemical studies in the region gay 2004 montoroi et al 2002 showed that infiltration reached 300 m3 day on the gouazine lake and that this signal was observed on wells exploiting shallow aquifers 350 m downstream within 100 days fig 4 eight reservoirs were specifically designed to favour recharge cf table a1 of the local bou hafna cherichira aquifers cnea 2006 3 1 6 protecting downstream areas reservoirs as part of the national water and soil conservation strategy were also designed to contain silt and reduce silting of downstream areas and lakes based on mean sedimentation rates across 14 reservoirs in the region over 200 000 m3 sediment may be collected annually by reservoirs in the catchment cnea 2006 ogilvie 2015 this corresponds to a reduction of the order of 15 of silting in the downstream el haouareb dam estimated around 1 33 to 1 48 mm3 year other lakes were also designed to protect roads bouksab 2 3 or plots fidh ben nasseur situated directly downstream from floods reducing available capacities over time the captured silt causes discontent from farmers and problems were also reported due to the detrimental flushing of accumulated silt and debris onto the land of farmers situated below bouchaha fidh ben nasseur 3 1 7 other social and economic benefits people interviewed also mentioned the wider value of lakes including the contribution to landscape shaded ecosystems recreational benefits swimming duck populations attracting hunters bee keepers placing their hives guettar mahbes water for house construction and washing wool morra guettar household use was only mentioned on 8 out of 22 lakes surveyed as public fountains are relatively widespread though can be used during common water shortages biodiversity benefits have yet to be investigated farmers notably expressed attachment to their lakes which were also for some a source of prestige e g ain smili significantly in addition to being a material resource capable of increasing local production lakes appeared as an immaterial resource that plays a key role in structuring and maintaining local social groups riaux et al 2014 3 2 typology of lakes agricultural benefits based upon the qualification of water uses across 22 lakes and the rapid surveys carried out across the 56 lakes the benefits of lakes from the farmers perspective were characterised into three categories tables 1 and a 1 3 2 1 lakes with negligible benefits to users these 16 lakes currently support negligible agricultural withdrawals and do not visibly recharge any nearby wells these include 9 lakes which never did support agriculture and have essentially a protective value reducing erosion and flooding of downstream areas in certain cases this corresponds to their primary objective table a 1 but a few larger lakes failed to develop irrigated practices largely due to their isolated location chaouba el hamra and marrouki 2 other lakes ceased to support agriculture after becoming completely silted ben houria bouchaha b or sufficiently to be abandoned skhira a or now only allow for the occasional watering of a few trees up to 100 3 2 2 lakes with residual benefits to users these 27 lakes support occasional withdrawals and provide small irregular but noticeable benefits to nearby farmers these support agriculture directly through motor pumps 13 or through cisterns 8 while a total of 10 also support water levels of nearby wells exploited for irrigation the number of pumps remains low 1 per lake on average and withdrawals essentially support the occasional watering of fruit trees sampled exploitations possess on average 300 up to 1000 fruit trees 7 ha of cereals between 10 and 50 heads of sheep and when availability is greater occasional small scale market gardening 0 5 ha for domestic consumption continues to be observed this largest category includes lakes of all sizes including very small lakes under 40 000 m3 capacity where single riparian farmers continue to occasionally pump on the lake to large lakes over 800 000 m3 capacity where the low number of pumps installed 2 3 reflect the low exploitation of these lakes several of these lakes were built to support irrigation while others skhira 4 5 built in the 1960s to protect from soil erosion have supported the development of several orchards through direct pumping and nearby wells 3 2 3 lakes with isolated high benefits these 13 lakes support modest regular withdrawals and have assisted the development of isolated but significant exploitations two of these are currently exploited using only cisterns while the others withdraw using motor pumps 2 5 pumps per lake on average and two lakes also contribute to recharging nearby wells activities focus essentially around fruit trees which reached 900 on average across our sample and up to 4400 15 ha of cereals and between 10 and 50 heads of livestock essentially sheep commercial market gardening of 2 5 ha was attempted but farmers preferred to focus on fruit trees even using drip irrigation on three lakes lakes were often large table a 1 but also include two smaller lakes 40 000 m3 in most cases though the benefits are the results of individual entrepreneurs and the lakes and pumps appear to have contributed in reinforcing existing capabilities these lakes suffer from low equity where benefits are confined to single users who possessed existing capital or reliable sources of income e g fadden boras 3 3 agricultural water availability characterisation analysis from landsat observations in ogilvie et al 2016 highlighted the high variability of mean water availability across 48 small reservoirs ranging from 100 m3 day to 255 000 m3 day on larger lakes mean 28 000 m3 day over the 6 months of the dry season interannual variations were high on the smallest lakes variation coefficient 2 but remarkably the variation coefficient also reached 0 75 on large lakes over 1 mm3 capacity such as kraroub and en mel by considering the number of days water volumes exceed 5000 m3 three classes of lakes were here distinguished according to their capacity to support agricultural intensification 3 3 1 negligible water availability the first category consists of lakes with negligible water potential a minimum of 45 days during the dry season where water resources exceeded 5000 m3 month was considered necessary to support market gardening activities based on minimal crop cycles lengths when accounting for silting 27 lakes never reached the required water availability and a further 6 met this requirement for less than 45 days during the 6 dry months i e below 25 of dry season days for 20 of these fig 6 confirmed that uncertainties over silting rates were not significant as even under the best case scenario of maintaining initial capacity through dredging or building new dams at these locations and dimensions these continued to fail to meet the defined availability requirements on the other 13 lakes sensitivity to the silting model was much greater e g chaouba el hamra fig 6 and as field visits confirmed minimal storage capacity and occasional pumping these 13 lakes were therefore classed in the unreliable availability category these confirm the difficulties of modelling over space and more than 30 years discrete silting phenomena ogilvie et al 2016 influenced by topography lithology rainfall regimes and land uses on these 20 lakes water availability is limited and unreliable providing inopportune conditions to develop more intense irrigated activities but when not silted allow for limited watering e g ain faouar on fig 9 several were designed for protection or recharge and appear under dimensioned for water uses despite farmers having planted trees and installed a pump besides these with a mean initial capacity 44 000 m3 many lakes are unable to hold water for any length of time due to low depths and greater exposure to evaporation other larger lakes suffered from progressive silting bouchaha b garia 3 haffar or like hoshas 130 000 m3 experienced very short floods due to high infiltration fig 7 highlights how water availability patterns vary rapidly when lowering the thresholds i e for very small lakes habsa a and fidh zitoune water availability around 2000 m3 rises significantly pointing to reliable but limited water volumes a further four lakes would reach this lower threshold of 2000 m3 fig 8 conversely where agricultural water needs were greater e g 10 000 m3 for at least 45 days 6 additional lakes would not reach this raised target 3 3 2 good water availability the 7 lakes in this category displayed water availability exceeding 5000 m3 for more than 4 5 months during the 6 dry months i e over 75 of days with a mean initial capacity of 1 mm3 these lakes support the notion that storage is determinant in semi arid areas where floods are rare however exceptions exist with el maiz suffering despite its similar capacity 500 000 m3 from greater water insecurity variation coefficient 0 97 conversely fadden boras with its modest size 84 000 m3 displayed in the absence of silting reduced variability and field visits confirmed its reliable availability the mean availability of lakes is indeed only partly correlated r² 0 6 with the maximum capacity of lakes due to the influence of the rainfall variability and differences in runoff coefficients and lake characteristics notably high infiltration ogilvie et al 2016 these lakes remain affected by interannual variability fig 5 but not to the point of affecting local irrigation practices significantly these lakes are the ones which can realistically provide year round irrigation i e support farmers through the critical dry periods in line with their objective in many semi arid regions fig 8 highlights the modest decline in the number of these lakes if agricultural water availability requirements in terms of volume or number of days increase 3 3 3 unreliable water availability these 21 lakes display the greatest uncertainties over water availability and fail to meet the required threshold between 1 5 and 4 5 months out of the 6 dry months with a mean capacity of 129 000 m3 these lakes include large lakes gouazine and el maiz 230 000 m3 and 500 000 m3 respectively whose average resources largely exceed the threshold fig 5 however these lakes suffer from significant variability and extended periods where resources become insufficient to meet these basic watering demands fig 9 years where availability is good more intense localised irrigation of vegetables becomes possible but farmers must compose with this uncertainty through other resources be they physical other watering points or economic means to purchase cisterns as mentioned earlier silting uncertainties were high for 13 of these lakes indicating the sites where updating topographic surveys may provide the most benefit ogilvie et al 2016 3 4 wider socio hydrological drivers no correlations were observed between water availability and water use levels assessed as the number of fruit trees grown or number of pumps around lakes fig 12 these discrepancies between water use and availability classes of each lake illustrated in fig 10 confirmed the need to look beyond purely hydrological factors 3 4 1 economic water access difficulties only 43 of lakes were equipped with motor pumps while on 23 of lakes withdrawals consisted of occasional cisterns the number of motor pumps ranged between 1 and 7 mean 2 5 but across all 56 lakes the average number reduced to barely 1 per lake fig 11 their presence reduced since 2005 on 19 of lakes due to irreparable damages or the decline in irrigated activities en mel but on others 33 additional pumps had been acquired and replaced over time signalling a continued or increased interest in the lake s resources by farmers or local projects a noteworthy 27 of pumps were out of order at the time of visit due to lack of regular maintenance or direct damage from floods the absence of spare parts and difficulties to cover repair costs led to extended periods before pumps were repaired over half 54 of these pumps were provided by the government following the construction of the lakes while the others had been purchased by farmers who shared the costs with 2 3 brothers or cousins these were typically wealthier exploitations having inherited large plots of land or farmers who had additional external resources regular employment or family cash flows though a third of the private pumps had been purchased without such assistance credits are notably difficult to obtain due to the absence of official land titles titre bleu on 73 of exploitations surveyed 3 4 2 managing hydrological uncertainty farmers faced with uncertainty over water resources variability managed in certain instances to develop successful enterprises due partly to their ability to deal with water shortages to save 1 ha of fruit trees farmers reported needing 10 cisterns of 3000 4000 l 2 5 times per year representing a cost of 500dt 1250dt 1dt 0 5 at the time depending on rainfall and the age of the trees these additional costs were difficult to bear by many farmers who lost part of their younger fruit trees 60 of farmers interviewed had attempted market gardening but more than half of these ceased after losing their first crop limited capabilities sen 1999 affects the willingness to take on risks and most users around these lakes now focus exclusively on olive and other fruit trees uncertainties can also prevent farmers from planting or lead them to reduce investments e g applying minimal inputs hence reducing their production levels khlifi et al 2010 mugabe et al 2003 conversely farmers with increased financial resilience and ability to access alternate water supplies such as nearby wells 15 farmers or cisterns 17 farmers were capable of bearing these risks and developed greater irrigated activities 3 4 3 local water mismanagement the limited number of pumps were shared between 2 9 beneficiaries on average though sometimes up to 8 initially and were to be managed through water user associations wuas as requested by the government over 22 reservoirs 11 had formally created an association but by 2014 all had dissolved due to conflicts the declining number of users or pump failures on other lakes wuas had not been created due to the low number of users and the existence of family ties frequent conflicts were reported often due to the heads of wuas unfairly restricting access to the pump kraroub maiz or even preventing access to the lake to riparian families entitled to the resource according to the traditional bind between land and water rights in many cases the position of head of wua and often dam operator were given to local government employees living on site or others with close links to the former ruling party the rassemblement constitutionnel démocratique rcd the importance of ties with government officials and bribes were highlighted by several interviewees and allegedly influenced the number of pumps but also tree saplings that farmers benefited from over time several government pumps became private due to members acquiring these after reportedly paying for repairs other farmers resorted to private pumps shared amongst family members but conflicts endure over water turns or maintenance and repair costs in the absence of an active wua management and access to the lake is done through informal gatherings where established influences dam operator and or head of wuas continue to play a role the absence of clear management leads to unregulated withdrawals where farmers reported withdrawing what they can afford while water is available replicating the tragedy of the commons hardin 1968 already observed selmi and talineau 1994 the resulting rapid decline in resources led to certain farmers calling for instating control and fees over water access but coordinated by an external government engineer 3 4 4 local participation and development strategy while farmers agreed gouazine or even requested fidh mbarek guettar and fidh zitoune certain lakes

somewhat fuzzy riaux et al 2014 and in many cases argue that irrigation remained merely an implicit objective selmi and zekri 1995 behind the priority protection of downstream infrastructure criteria in project documents referred to physical parameters however failed to include social selection criteria relating to water use despite the stated irrigation objectives farmers confirmed no pre assessment to identify local resources and challenges was carried out reducing ownership and participation by end users habi and morsli 2011 selmi and talineau 1994 selmi and zekri 1995 talineau et al 1994 wisser et al 2010 numerous incoherences were also observed in the siting of dams chaouba el hamra el marrouki 2 where the clear absence of beneficiaries around the lake appears to contradict the stated objectives of developing irrigation on others no pumps or trees were provided or sometimes only at a much later stage therefore losing out on the impetus created by the construction of the lake intended for irrigation larger irrigation projects morra and kraroub never materialised due for instance to a failed electrification strategy leading to a built yet inoperative pumping station incoherences were also reported by farmers in policies forbidding lake users to sell market gardening products gbatis en mel and mahbes or advising farmers that water use would be forbidden to favour recharge hoshas but only after the construction placing undue expectations on the lake 3 4 5 limited ongoing government assistance 15 out of 22 lakes investigated had benefited from a pump provided by the government or the funding body e g eu project and 45 of farmers had obtained fruit trees saplings farmers interviewed expected further support however and several regularly placed requests with the local authorities for subsidies for additional pumps bergater piping or repairs to the dam whose maintenance over time is poorly budgeted selmi and talineau 1994 in the remote merguellil upper catchment public action for development is limited compared to the downstream kairouan plain and is compensated for through subventions and individualised small grants riaux et al 2014 government assistance appears to have been too limited and punctual for many users to make the transition from traditional rainfed activities to irrigated activities which demand additional investments and knowledge oweis and hachum 2006 selmi and talineau 1994 zairi et al 2005 monitoring over time by authorities may have also helped solve some of the incongruities and mismanagement observed around lakes the continued reference to the local government by farmers emphasised how engrained the government s presence is possibly as a result of the historically interventionist government this also seemed to reflect a posture whereby farmers are merely managing a government lake where they gained rights instead of appropriating their lake 3 4 6 conflicting livelihood strategies of those who abandoned market gardening 19 stated that water supply was the dominant constraint however 15 identified other reasons which included the costs and low profits obtained the intense labour and the presence required small farmers notably struggled to cope financially until the harvest and with the minimal return on investment from fruit trees in the first years leading them to pursue complementary livelihoods a subset of farmers 7 with large herds of sheep between 50 and 60 and significant surface area 10 60 ha of cereals showed no real interest in intensifying their fruit farming activities preferring to rely on traditional agricultural livelihoods other farmers had already started to diversify their income due to land surface area reducing through inheritance and soil fertility declining over time and work as labourers cnea 2006 selmi et al 2001 many when they have interesting opportunities including abroad in libya or cameroon pursue these activities and when contracts are scarce and or water levels were high choose to focus on agriculture and seek to intensify their production market gardening fertilisers etc out of 28 people who previously had a secondary source of income 25 continue to have a secondary activity implying that only three people were able to move towards agriculture exclusively here high value fruit cherry fig apricots and some market gardening 4 conclusions the multi scale interdisciplinary approach developed here highlighted the vast disparities in the benefits and practices between lakes farmers and over time diachronic perspectives highlighted crop diversification and an increase in fruit trees supported in part by watering from the lakes olive harvests provide non negligible revenue to families and during good years farmers can develop limited lucrative activities isolated successful enterprises based around intensive fruit farming were also observed the wide framework also identified support to livestock nearby wells and immaterial benefits attempts to develop market gardening and intensifying fruit farming on 56 of lakes bear witness to the level of interest in this additional resource but most farmers were deceived due to the unfavourable hydro meteorological conditions exploiting the landsat derived water availability patterns provided unprecedented insights into the hydrological constraints on 86 of small lakes on some of the smallest lakes due to their size or rapid infiltration their initial potential was already negligible and communication with the riparian communities would have avoided disappointments and associated disaffection on lakes where volumes can be significant and irrigated activities can be developed farmers must be equipped with strategies to cope with the variability and associated uncertainty for the lake to cease to be both a help and a threat for most this was limiting and led to the loss of production while those with sufficient economic resilience or other water supplies survived the droughts though a limiting condition water availability was indeed not a sufficient condition to understand the disparities in practices on lakes where water availability is high individual successes are reported and again occurred as a result of individual capabilities inadequate ongoing government support to develop and structure agricultural activities and water management limited the number of beneficiaries due largely to problems over access to pumps pipes repairs and to wua failures farmers were in certain cases excluded from the start selmi and talineau 1994 and others more subtly over time through conflicts mismanagement and appropriation of the pumps where the local government was proactive this led to wider levels of exploitation compared to other similar lakes but benefits remained confined to a select few investments in small reservoirs have supported remote rural areas affected by erosion poor soils and low and irregular rainfall albeit with often low equity and incoherences they probably contributed to slow the inevitable fate of rural exodus and investments helping local upstream smallholders vincent 2003 should be encouraged the majority of small reservoirs which depend on erratic rainfall volumes are however limited in their ability to develop irrigated agriculture on any significant scale lakes can support dry spells during the rainy season and on good rainfall years intensification during dry months if supported adequately to optimise production and minimise risks could be performed however fundamentally small reservoirs despite gradual shifts in the discourse venot and krishnan 2011 are designed for supplementary irrigation and their limited storage does not address the years when rainfall is low preventing a long term transition to irrigated agriculture in any case reservoirs by capturing silt have a dedicated lifespan and must not be perceived as a perennial solution 30 years

11040,millions of small reservoirs built across semi arid areas present a potential to support agricultural livelihoods of rural smallholders the scale and geographical dispersion of these multiple lakes restrict the understanding of these coupled human water systems and the identification of adequate strategies to support riparian farmers this research developed a multi scalar interdisciplinary approach to characterise the hydrological and wider drivers of agricultural water use around multiple small reservoirs in semi arid central tunisia the combination of field surveys quantitative questionnaires and qualitative semi structured interviews confirmed minimal withdrawals but highlighted the diversification of practices the rise in fruit farming and peripheral benefits generated here by the development of 56 lakes 48 of lakes provide residual benefits for the occasional watering of on average 300 fruit trees and support to downstream wells exploited for irrigation a further 13 lakes 23 provide high levels of benefits 900 fruit trees each albeit with low equity supporting essentially established farmers the analysis of surface water assessments every 8 days from landsat 5 8 imagery over 1999 2014 provides unprecedented insights into the significant water scarcity and unreliability that impedes agricultural intensification on 86 of small lakes limited storage capacities and prolonged droughts highlight the need for small reservoirs in this climatic context to retain a supplementary irrigation objective and not strive to support widespread intensification of irrigated practices many farmers lack the capabilities to increase their withdrawals and suffer physical and economic water access difficulties mismanagement compounded through limited and short term government assistance individual successes resulted from farmers economic resilience and means to secure alternate water supplies during dry spells keywords socio hydrology remote sensing small reservoirs water harvesting tunisia 1 introduction 1 1 agricultural water uses in small reservoirs by harvesting scarce and unreliable rainfall for local inhabitants small reservoirs have the potential to supplement water resources and extend the growing season of farmers within poor rural areas wisser et al 2010 their reduced costs and ability to be implemented at the scale of individual farms or clusters notably supports recent efforts to recognise and promote irrigation and water management practices of millions of smallholders vincent 2003 studies revealed multi use systems ayantunde et al 2018 de fraiture et al 2014 with diverse benefits including watering livestock irrigation fish production as well as recreational and cultural importance agricultural production remained sometimes limited faulkner et al 2008 habi and morsli 2011 khlifi et al 2010 mugabe et al 2003 leading to concerns by donors and investors despite the strong demand and apparent affection for reservoirs by users venot and hirvonen 2013 this contradiction highlighted the difficulty in identifying and quantifying the real outputs of these systems partly due to the inherently subjective and restrictive frameworks used centred on issues of agricultural performance efficiency or productivity venot and krishnan 2011 literature on the reasons which constrain or favour agricultural water use in small reservoirs remains scarce hydrological limitations and user uncertainties over water availability have been highlighted mugabe et al 2003 however other observations pointed to insufficient resources to cover investment maintenance costs lack of adequate management structures zairi et al 2005 or the consequence of government strategies and siting criteria talineau et al 1994 the overlapping interactions between drivers of agricultural water use remain poorly understood often as a result of mono disciplinary studies considering agronomic social i e cultural economic institutional and hydrological factors separately 1 2 investigating socio hydrosystems the recent surge in scientific literature in socio hydrology di baldassarre et al 2013 king et al 2012 montanari et al 2013 riaux 2013 sivakumar 2012 sivapalan et al 2012 highlights the growing recognition of the importance and difficulties in studying the mutual interactions in human water systems despite the popularity for the recently coined term the concept refers to common contemporary approaches which recognise the importance of human interactions within hydrological systems falkenmark 1977 as in other socio ecological systems ostrom 1990 this begun with considering human influences such as withdrawals impoundments and other human induced changes on hydrological systems moving away from theoretically undisturbed natural systems thompson et al 2013 conversely it also focussed on the influence of hydrological systems on human interests notably water variability on water food security and the consequences of flood dynamics di baldassarre et al 2013 and droughts socio hydrology represents a step further to provide new insights on the broad complex interactions and retroactions braden et al 2009 wesselink et al 2017 of coupled human water systems understanding the finer workings of these socio hydrosystems notably requires in depth field investigations massuel et al 2018 which must be transcribed into operational approaches modus operandi hale et al 2015 sivapalan et al 2012 suitable approaches must notably seek to extract value from incorporating the approach and viewpoints of other disciplines rather than simply combining their results by exploring and borrowing different tools such interdisciplinary approaches may address water and society issues from a different perspective and allow new topics and new questions to be investigated and generated massuel et al 2018 riaux and massuel 2014 this field based comparative sociohydrology may then identify key variables to account for when upscaling or transposing such investigations and according to pande and sivapalan 2016 may feed into wider socio hydrological modelling research an original socio hydrological approach is developed here to investigate the agricultural water uses around multiple small reservoirs and the drivers which foster or constrain agricultural development on their banks understanding the dynamics around small reservoirs requires a comprehensive framework to study the reservoir s hydrology the riparian community and the way they are interlinked 2 methods research combined hydrological monitoring numerical modelling remote sensing ethnographic enquiry and qualitative analysis while developing a nested scale approach to provide varying depth of analysis as we proceeded to upscale observations on individual small reservoirs to more than 50 small reservoirs scattered across a 1200 km2 catchment in semi arid tunisia 2 1 case study site the study site is the merguellil upper catchment 1200 km² fig 12 situated in semi arid central tunisia 329 mm year 131 mm where 56 small reservoirs were built as a result of successive water and soil conservation programmes since the 1960s khlifi et al 2010 selmi et al 2001 following a nationwide strategy setting ambitious objectives of 1000 small reservoirs 700 small reservoirs were built nationally by the late 1990s for an estimated capacity of 70 mm3 around kairouan this 1 st phase led to the construction of 39 small reservoirs followed by a second phase after 2002 supported through a host of additional international projects cnea 2006 the 56 lakes were inventoried through the combination and cross referencing of records from local authorities literature cnea 2006 kingumbi 2006 lacombe 2007 satellite imagery and field visits ogilvie et al 2016 the area has been the focus of numerous agricultural surveys and a vast hydrological and climatic observation network albergel and rejeb 1997 leduc et al 2007 which included the monitoring of 13 small reservoirs considering the importance of climatic and human changes on the downstream irrigated kairouan plain initial design capacities of small reservoirs in the catchment range between 17 000 m3 and 1 590 000 m3 though the median size only reaches 66 000 m3 land uses in the catchment are dominated by traditional mediterranean crops mostly rainfed cereals 30 of catchment surface area and fruit trees 20 especially olive groves suited to the extended dry season grasslands cover 30 forest 19 and towns and watercourses the remaining 1 dridi et al 2001 3 500 ha fruit trees and market gardening are irrigated mostly from unregulated groundwater resources le goulven et al 2009 2 2 assessing water availability water resources were assessed across 48 lakes based on surface water assessments acquired from 546 landsat 5 8 images over 1999 2014 the method described in ogilvie et al 2018 uses a fixed threshold modified normalised difference water index xu 2006 calibrated against extensive field data surface area are converted to volumes using a locally derived surface volume rating curve where the b and β model parameters were incremented over time to account for silting based on known maximum capacity and construction date ogilvie et al 2016 time series were spline interpolated and gap filled using the tsgf extension forkel et al 2013 in order to allow water availability statistics to be calculated over time rmse on mean annual volumes reaches 20 600 m3 lakes built recently daoud 3 mdinia 2 in 2012 as well as 6 minor lakes e g bouksab 2 for which maximum capacity data was not available were excluded from the water availability analysis to allow unbiased comparison of all lakes interannual water availability was also assessed over the common period 2007 2014 when all 48 lakes were in operation 2 2 1 characterising agricultural water availability considering water uses depend on the amplitude but also the timing and duration of the flood the number of days that water levels exceed a given volume were calculated for each lake to highlight the irrigation potential values were calculated over the whole year and the 6 months of dry season april october when potential watering needs are greatest a 5000 m3 threshold was chosen based on interviews as it reflected sufficient water availability to promote irrigated activities by two farmers these farmers developed market gardening or fruit trees withdrawing water for 8 h day 3 or more days week significantly it also complies based on the height surface volume hsv rating curves with a minimal water depth of 1 m required according to interviews by users to operate pumps without silt from the lake floor bed clogging the pumps aggregating a minimum of 6 landsat pixels also reduced the presence of single outliers whilst remaining inferior to the size of the smallest lakes 0 5 ha the 48 lakes were then categorised based on the length of time they succeeded or failed to meet the required water threshold 2 3 characterisation of water uses water uses associated with small reservoirs were examined through a combination of field surveys quantitative questionnaires as well as semi structured interviews borrowed from ethnographic methodologies a multi stage sampling methodology mushtaq et al 2007 was used to identify broad water use characteristics at the catchment scale and define with greater detail water uses and profile water users on a selection of lakes fig 1 2 3 1 water use field surveys on 56 lakes field surveys enabled preliminary scoping of the type of water uses across all 56 reservoirs surveys undertaken between april and june 2011 noted the presence and number of pumps watering pipes bergater and cisterns which allow watering from the lake they also qualitatively listed the presence of nearby habitations fruit trees market gardening rainfed crops grazing and watering livestock nearby flood recession cropping on the banks of the lake to benefit from increased and prolonged soil moisture was also recorded as were nearby wells under the influence of lakes considering their potential benefit for groundwater recharge selmi and zekri 1995 furthermore all water supply sources spring boreholes wadi were inventoried to highlight the role of these lakes in supplementary irrigation information collected through these water use surveys on 56 reservoirs was compared with previous inventories undertaken in 1999 and 2005 at similar periods of the year lacombe 2007 in 1999 interviews focussed on 43 reservoirs while in 2005 extensive agricultural use surveys were carried out on 25 lakes in the region additional local studies selmi et al 2001 selmi and zekri 1995 and reports including original project documents and evaluation reports e g cnea 2006 were used notably to identify the original objectives of lakes and the wider assistance provided to riparian farmers 2 3 2 agricultural questionnaires on 22 lakes preliminary scoping on all 56 lakes distinguished 24 lakes with motor pumps and 23 lakes without a further 9 lakes potentially supported the recharge of nearby wells the latter were differentiated considering the different dynamics in terms of water resources access government support involvement in water use association prior irrigation experience etc selmi and talineau 1994 a sample of 22 reservoirs was then chosen to carry out quantitative questionnaires about agricultural practices and water uses 16 lakes studied in 2005 were included to provide diachronic assessments of agricultural water uses and management additional lakes were randomly selected to investigate a total of 17 lakes 75 equipped with motorpumps 4 lakes with no apparent withdrawals were investigated to specifically explore the reasons behind these one further lake supporting the recharge of nearby wells was included all 48 farmers on the 22 lakes were interviewed on the following topics household and livelihood strategies farm characteristics agricultural practices across each plot crop types surface areas yields watering regimes livestock water access and water uses lake withdrawals water management and future perspectives additional questions on land rights and government assistance to draw out potential constraints influencing water use were also included based upon the insights gained in the semi structured interviews 2 3 3 semi structured in depth interviews on 4 lakes 25 semi structured in depth interviews were undertaken over 2011 2013 with farmers on four reservoirs presenting a cross section of water use availability and issues identified through initial surveys riaux et al 2014 as a qualitative tool semi structured interviews were not intended to be multiplied for the sake of increasing representativity and instead sought to illustrate and shed light on specific complex issues which other faster methods are unable to beaud 1996 longhurst 2009 this technique combined with observations and literature review to form an ethnographic framework seeks to build greater trust with the interviewee and allow for more personal confidential or sensitive information to be disclosed relating here to conflicts or political and economic constraints the open framework also allowed for a comprehensive assessment of wider unsuspected uses benefits and issues to be captured in contrary to predetermined constrained and subjective framework becker 1998 venot and cecchi 2011 discussions focussed around predetermined topics identified from the literature and initial visits to the reservoirs which sought to paint a portrait of how lives had evolved around the reservoir after its construction life story denzin and lincoln 1994 based only on the assumption that people exploit the available resources this work followed the grounded theory approach glaser and strauss 1967 to understand the drivers which explain the apparent low agricultural water use lacombe 2007 riaux et al 2014 focusing on the history of the site the origins of the small reservoir and its management and water uses discussions sought to understand in greater detail the influence of water user associations land and water rights government incentives economic difficulties and conflicts high resolution digital globe and astrium satellite imagery available in google earth and bing maps were used as a visual aid to represent the location of plots and pumps and stimulate discussions carte parlée collard and burte 2014 interviews were not recorded but transcribed and typed up collectively to iron out uncertainties or incoherences beaud 1996 2 4 deducing socio hydrological constraints to water use the information extracted through quantitative agricultural interviews and qualitative semi structured interviews were combined to characterise the users and their agricultural practices on 22 small reservoirs based on the information gathered through rapid surveys across all reservoirs key water use characteristics of each lake and their statistical distribution were identified leading to a typology of the 56 lakes agricultural benefits withdrawal patterns including average pumping duration and frequencies during the dry and rainy seasons for each category of lakes were calculated from the questionnaire data ogilvie 2015 higher resolution in the withdrawals estimates was not relevant considering the high uncertainties observed in the number of pumps in operation each year and on each lake the water uses and water availability typologies were then crossed on the common subset of 48 lakes to identify where water availability is constraining or supporting agricultural water use the incoherences highlighted associated with the in depth knowledge gained through ethnographic enquiry then helped shed light on the multiple social cultural historical political institutional and economic drivers which influence agricultural development around small reservoirs interpretation of the dynamics around reservoirs followed an iterative process whereby initial hypotheses deduced from observations were gradually confirmed or invalidated through the interviews and hydrological assessments interviews trigger new questions and hypotheses which progressively reorient refine and nuance our evolving understanding of this socio hydrological system the multiple replies obtained allow us to triangulate the information e g who shares the pumps did the government assist what happened to the water user associations conflicts etc until we reach a saturation point where the additional information only reinforces the confidence in our interpretation of the system but ceases to provide new insights olivier de sardan 2005 feeding the insights gained from interviews into the design of the questionnaires e g questions on land rights water user associations allowed us to identify the spatial statistical distribution of these drivers and help upscale local observations 3 results and discussion 3 1 supporting and diversifying livelihoods around small reservoirs the introduction of small reservoirs was first and foremost accompanied by a change in agro pastoral activities notably the development and expansion of irrigated practices sometimes at the expense of other livelihood strategies 3 1 1 fruit tree farming fruit trees were observed on the banks of over 80 of all lakes these were cultivated by all interviewed farmers 58 of which declared taking up arboriculture activities following the construction of the lake the number of fruit trees ranged from 4400 over 20 ha to 13 trees on 0 5 ha mean 720 trees on 6 3 ha highlighting the variability across farms and lakes fig 2 only a few farmers strive to expand the number of trees on their land el maiz sidi sofiane 2 mahbes morra with most others having already exploited all their land and only planting new trees to replace dead ones olive trees dominate 61 2 of fruit trees and yield around 1 2 galba tree 1 galba is equivalent to 1 l of oil or 14 kg providing for the family consumption and additional revenue during good years for 65 of people surveyed values are consistent with selmi et al 2001 mean 8 ha on 57 lakes in the wider kairouan governorate but significantly lower than those in cnea 2006 2000 3000 fruit trees on 20 ha partly due to the greater proportion of lakes with large exploitations in their sample in jendouba northern tunisia khlifi et al 2010 reported an increase in the average surface area for trees from 3 ha to 23 ha over 8 years following the introduction of small reservoirs however this region benefits from comparatively higher rainfall 450 950 mm from south to north not accounting for additional socio economic differences which may explain this dynamic farmers rely on motor driven pumps to draw water from the lake which is conveyed to the plots using bergater pipes and a network of trenches and impoundments to channel water to each tree some farmers had built a basin and practised gravity fed irrigation mahbes daoued while drip irrigation was only recorded on three exploitations sidi sofiane fadden boras and el kraroub the filling of cisterns was only allowed on 45 of lakes surveyed and on half of these their use was restricted to riparian farmers which reached as many as 20 families garia s skhira 3 o el haffar or el mahbes on the other half cisterns were also provided to farmers from further afield for supplementary irrigation for free 50 cisterns year at morra 100 at skhira 4 or sold as on o daoued 3 where 4 cisterns of 3000 l at a time operate and up to 50 cisterns per day are withdrawn during summer months 3 1 2 market gardening market gardening had been attempted at some stage on 80 of lakes surveyed and by 65 of farmers interviewed but only 20 of these continue this activity today fig 3 surface areas were typically small under 0 5 ha and mostly for personal consumption except for two farmers surveyed for whom market gardening became and remains today an income generating activity ain smili guettar these values are close to those observed by selmi et al 2001 who had previously observed an average of 0 25 ha for market gardening on lakes in the region and similarly observed a rapid decline of activity within three years 3 1 3 cereals in very rare instances morra and sidi sofiane farmers had installed sprinklers up to 9 over 3 ha to exploit water from the lake during the early phases of cereal growth in both cases the practice ceased rapidly as unreliable rainfall during the rest of the growth period during which they chose not to continue watering reduced all benefit similar practices in the jendouba region had also been observed on a handful 3 out of 18 of reservoirs but again only over the first two years khlifi et al 2010 cereal cropping continues to be practised by 70 of farmers around small reservoirs but 20 declared ceasing rainfed cereals after the lake s construction to concentrate on fruit trees this conversion remains much less significant than around small reservoirs around jendouba where in 2 years people reportedly all converted to fruit farming and market gardening khlifi et al 2010 in certain cases skhira soil humidity on the contours of lake were used to advantage by farmers to grow cereals flood recession cropping however benefits can be outweighed by potential flooding and several farmers preferred to refrain from cropping near the reservoirs to reduce risk of damage to their crops 3 1 4 livestock livestock is a major traditional activity and 70 of lakes surveyed were reportedly used to water livestock in certain remote areas with limited alternate water supply lakes reduce the distance livestock must travel thereby increasing productivity of the herd 27 of farmers declared abandoning this activity following the construction of the lake as farmers reported having less time to water and feed their stock but also due to increasing pressure on land leading certain years to conflicts over fodder as well as increased theft since the 2011 revolution 3 1 5 groundwater recharge and peripheral water use farmers on 12 lakes witnessed the positive influence of the lake on the level and recovery times of their wells which support fruit tree and market gardening activities this positive effect was notably documented selmi and talineau 1994 selmi and zekri 1995 on two wells downstream of gouazine where groundwater levels rose by 11 m and 4 m respectively after the dam was built as well as in other parts of tunisia zairi et al 2005 geochemical studies in the region gay 2004 montoroi et al 2002 showed that infiltration reached 300 m3 day on the gouazine lake and that this signal was observed on wells exploiting shallow aquifers 350 m downstream within 100 days fig 4 eight reservoirs were specifically designed to favour recharge cf table a1 of the local bou hafna cherichira aquifers cnea 2006 3 1 6 protecting downstream areas reservoirs as part of the national water and soil conservation strategy were also designed to contain silt and reduce silting of downstream areas and lakes based on mean sedimentation rates across 14 reservoirs in the region over 200 000 m3 sediment may be collected annually by reservoirs in the catchment cnea 2006 ogilvie 2015 this corresponds to a reduction of the order of 15 of silting in the downstream el haouareb dam estimated around 1 33 to 1 48 mm3 year other lakes were also designed to protect roads bouksab 2 3 or plots fidh ben nasseur situated directly downstream from floods reducing available capacities over time the captured silt causes discontent from farmers and problems were also reported due to the detrimental flushing of accumulated silt and debris onto the land of farmers situated below bouchaha fidh ben nasseur 3 1 7 other social and economic benefits people interviewed also mentioned the wider value of lakes including the contribution to landscape shaded ecosystems recreational benefits swimming duck populations attracting hunters bee keepers placing their hives guettar mahbes water for house construction and washing wool morra guettar household use was only mentioned on 8 out of 22 lakes surveyed as public fountains are relatively widespread though can be used during common water shortages biodiversity benefits have yet to be investigated farmers notably expressed attachment to their lakes which were also for some a source of prestige e g ain smili significantly in addition to being a material resource capable of increasing local production lakes appeared as an immaterial resource that plays a key role in structuring and maintaining local social groups riaux et al 2014 3 2 typology of lakes agricultural benefits based upon the qualification of water uses across 22 lakes and the rapid surveys carried out across the 56 lakes the benefits of lakes from the farmers perspective were characterised into three categories tables 1 and a 1 3 2 1 lakes with negligible benefits to users these 16 lakes currently support negligible agricultural withdrawals and do not visibly recharge any nearby wells these include 9 lakes which never did support agriculture and have essentially a protective value reducing erosion and flooding of downstream areas in certain cases this corresponds to their primary objective table a 1 but a few larger lakes failed to develop irrigated practices largely due to their isolated location chaouba el hamra and marrouki 2 other lakes ceased to support agriculture after becoming completely silted ben houria bouchaha b or sufficiently to be abandoned skhira a or now only allow for the occasional watering of a few trees up to 100 3 2 2 lakes with residual benefits to users these 27 lakes support occasional withdrawals and provide small irregular but noticeable benefits to nearby farmers these support agriculture directly through motor pumps 13 or through cisterns 8 while a total of 10 also support water levels of nearby wells exploited for irrigation the number of pumps remains low 1 per lake on average and withdrawals essentially support the occasional watering of fruit trees sampled exploitations possess on average 300 up to 1000 fruit trees 7 ha of cereals between 10 and 50 heads of sheep and when availability is greater occasional small scale market gardening 0 5 ha for domestic consumption continues to be observed this largest category includes lakes of all sizes including very small lakes under 40 000 m3 capacity where single riparian farmers continue to occasionally pump on the lake to large lakes over 800 000 m3 capacity where the low number of pumps installed 2 3 reflect the low exploitation of these lakes several of these lakes were built to support irrigation while others skhira 4 5 built in the 1960s to protect from soil erosion have supported the development of several orchards through direct pumping and nearby wells 3 2 3 lakes with isolated high benefits these 13 lakes support modest regular withdrawals and have assisted the development of isolated but significant exploitations two of these are currently exploited using only cisterns while the others withdraw using motor pumps 2 5 pumps per lake on average and two lakes also contribute to recharging nearby wells activities focus essentially around fruit trees which reached 900 on average across our sample and up to 4400 15 ha of cereals and between 10 and 50 heads of livestock essentially sheep commercial market gardening of 2 5 ha was attempted but farmers preferred to focus on fruit trees even using drip irrigation on three lakes lakes were often large table a 1 but also include two smaller lakes 40 000 m3 in most cases though the benefits are the results of individual entrepreneurs and the lakes and pumps appear to have contributed in reinforcing existing capabilities these lakes suffer from low equity where benefits are confined to single users who possessed existing capital or reliable sources of income e g fadden boras 3 3 agricultural water availability characterisation analysis from landsat observations in ogilvie et al 2016 highlighted the high variability of mean water availability across 48 small reservoirs ranging from 100 m3 day to 255 000 m3 day on larger lakes mean 28 000 m3 day over the 6 months of the dry season interannual variations were high on the smallest lakes variation coefficient 2 but remarkably the variation coefficient also reached 0 75 on large lakes over 1 mm3 capacity such as kraroub and en mel by considering the number of days water volumes exceed 5000 m3 three classes of lakes were here distinguished according to their capacity to support agricultural intensification 3 3 1 negligible water availability the first category consists of lakes with negligible water potential a minimum of 45 days during the dry season where water resources exceeded 5000 m3 month was considered necessary to support market gardening activities based on minimal crop cycles lengths when accounting for silting 27 lakes never reached the required water availability and a further 6 met this requirement for less than 45 days during the 6 dry months i e below 25 of dry season days for 20 of these fig 6 confirmed that uncertainties over silting rates were not significant as even under the best case scenario of maintaining initial capacity through dredging or building new dams at these locations and dimensions these continued to fail to meet the defined availability requirements on the other 13 lakes sensitivity to the silting model was much greater e g chaouba el hamra fig 6 and as field visits confirmed minimal storage capacity and occasional pumping these 13 lakes were therefore classed in the unreliable availability category these confirm the difficulties of modelling over space and more than 30 years discrete silting phenomena ogilvie et al 2016 influenced by topography lithology rainfall regimes and land uses on these 20 lakes water availability is limited and unreliable providing inopportune conditions to develop more intense irrigated activities but when not silted allow for limited watering e g ain faouar on fig 9 several were designed for protection or recharge and appear under dimensioned for water uses despite farmers having planted trees and installed a pump besides these with a mean initial capacity 44 000 m3 many lakes are unable to hold water for any length of time due to low depths and greater exposure to evaporation other larger lakes suffered from progressive silting bouchaha b garia 3 haffar or like hoshas 130 000 m3 experienced very short floods due to high infiltration fig 7 highlights how water availability patterns vary rapidly when lowering the thresholds i e for very small lakes habsa a and fidh zitoune water availability around 2000 m3 rises significantly pointing to reliable but limited water volumes a further four lakes would reach this lower threshold of 2000 m3 fig 8 conversely where agricultural water needs were greater e g 10 000 m3 for at least 45 days 6 additional lakes would not reach this raised target 3 3 2 good water availability the 7 lakes in this category displayed water availability exceeding 5000 m3 for more than 4 5 months during the 6 dry months i e over 75 of days with a mean initial capacity of 1 mm3 these lakes support the notion that storage is determinant in semi arid areas where floods are rare however exceptions exist with el maiz suffering despite its similar capacity 500 000 m3 from greater water insecurity variation coefficient 0 97 conversely fadden boras with its modest size 84 000 m3 displayed in the absence of silting reduced variability and field visits confirmed its reliable availability the mean availability of lakes is indeed only partly correlated r² 0 6 with the maximum capacity of lakes due to the influence of the rainfall variability and differences in runoff coefficients and lake characteristics notably high infiltration ogilvie et al 2016 these lakes remain affected by interannual variability fig 5 but not to the point of affecting local irrigation practices significantly these lakes are the ones which can realistically provide year round irrigation i e support farmers through the critical dry periods in line with their objective in many semi arid regions fig 8 highlights the modest decline in the number of these lakes if agricultural water availability requirements in terms of volume or number of days increase 3 3 3 unreliable water availability these 21 lakes display the greatest uncertainties over water availability and fail to meet the required threshold between 1 5 and 4 5 months out of the 6 dry months with a mean capacity of 129 000 m3 these lakes include large lakes gouazine and el maiz 230 000 m3 and 500 000 m3 respectively whose average resources largely exceed the threshold fig 5 however these lakes suffer from significant variability and extended periods where resources become insufficient to meet these basic watering demands fig 9 years where availability is good more intense localised irrigation of vegetables becomes possible but farmers must compose with this uncertainty through other resources be they physical other watering points or economic means to purchase cisterns as mentioned earlier silting uncertainties were high for 13 of these lakes indicating the sites where updating topographic surveys may provide the most benefit ogilvie et al 2016 3 4 wider socio hydrological drivers no correlations were observed between water availability and water use levels assessed as the number of fruit trees grown or number of pumps around lakes fig 12 these discrepancies between water use and availability classes of each lake illustrated in fig 10 confirmed the need to look beyond purely hydrological factors 3 4 1 economic water access difficulties only 43 of lakes were equipped with motor pumps while on 23 of lakes withdrawals consisted of occasional cisterns the number of motor pumps ranged between 1 and 7 mean 2 5 but across all 56 lakes the average number reduced to barely 1 per lake fig 11 their presence reduced since 2005 on 19 of lakes due to irreparable damages or the decline in irrigated activities en mel but on others 33 additional pumps had been acquired and replaced over time signalling a continued or increased interest in the lake s resources by farmers or local projects a noteworthy 27 of pumps were out of order at the time of visit due to lack of regular maintenance or direct damage from floods the absence of spare parts and difficulties to cover repair costs led to extended periods before pumps were repaired over half 54 of these pumps were provided by the government following the construction of the lakes while the others had been purchased by farmers who shared the costs with 2 3 brothers or cousins these were typically wealthier exploitations having inherited large plots of land or farmers who had additional external resources regular employment or family cash flows though a third of the private pumps had been purchased without such assistance credits are notably difficult to obtain due to the absence of official land titles titre bleu on 73 of exploitations surveyed 3 4 2 managing hydrological uncertainty farmers faced with uncertainty over water resources variability managed in certain instances to develop successful enterprises due partly to their ability to deal with water shortages to save 1 ha of fruit trees farmers reported needing 10 cisterns of 3000 4000 l 2 5 times per year representing a cost of 500dt 1250dt 1dt 0 5 at the time depending on rainfall and the age of the trees these additional costs were difficult to bear by many farmers who lost part of their younger fruit trees 60 of farmers interviewed had attempted market gardening but more than half of these ceased after losing their first crop limited capabilities sen 1999 affects the willingness to take on risks and most users around these lakes now focus exclusively on olive and other fruit trees uncertainties can also prevent farmers from planting or lead them to reduce investments e g applying minimal inputs hence reducing their production levels khlifi et al 2010 mugabe et al 2003 conversely farmers with increased financial resilience and ability to access alternate water supplies such as nearby wells 15 farmers or cisterns 17 farmers were capable of bearing these risks and developed greater irrigated activities 3 4 3 local water mismanagement the limited number of pumps were shared between 2 9 beneficiaries on average though sometimes up to 8 initially and were to be managed through water user associations wuas as requested by the government over 22 reservoirs 11 had formally created an association but by 2014 all had dissolved due to conflicts the declining number of users or pump failures on other lakes wuas had not been created due to the low number of users and the existence of family ties frequent conflicts were reported often due to the heads of wuas unfairly restricting access to the pump kraroub maiz or even preventing access to the lake to riparian families entitled to the resource according to the traditional bind between land and water rights in many cases the position of head of wua and often dam operator were given to local government employees living on site or others with close links to the former ruling party the rassemblement constitutionnel démocratique rcd the importance of ties with government officials and bribes were highlighted by several interviewees and allegedly influenced the number of pumps but also tree saplings that farmers benefited from over time several government pumps became private due to members acquiring these after reportedly paying for repairs other farmers resorted to private pumps shared amongst family members but conflicts endure over water turns or maintenance and repair costs in the absence of an active wua management and access to the lake is done through informal gatherings where established influences dam operator and or head of wuas continue to play a role the absence of clear management leads to unregulated withdrawals where farmers reported withdrawing what they can afford while water is available replicating the tragedy of the commons hardin 1968 already observed selmi and talineau 1994 the resulting rapid decline in resources led to certain farmers calling for instating control and fees over water access but coordinated by an external government engineer 3 4 4 local participation and development strategy while farmers agreed gouazine or even requested fidh mbarek guettar and fidh zitoune certain lakes others regretted not being consulted on their interest for a dam which was eventually imposed sometimes at the expense of their land and livelihoods out of 29 exploitations with land under the 22 lakes and 12 with land titles to prove it only 2 reported obtaining some compensation garia s el kraroub generating disaffection for the project government strategies to develop water use appear somewhat fuzzy riaux et al 2014 and in many cases argue that irrigation remained merely an implicit objective selmi and zekri 1995 behind the priority protection of downstream infrastructure criteria in project documents referred to physical parameters however failed to include social selection criteria relating to water use despite the stated irrigation objectives farmers confirmed no pre assessment to identify local resources and challenges was carried out reducing ownership and participation by end users habi and morsli 2011 selmi and talineau 1994 selmi and zekri 1995 talineau et al 1994 wisser et al 2010 numerous incoherences were also observed in the siting of dams chaouba el hamra el marrouki 2 where the clear absence of beneficiaries around the lake appears to contradict the stated objectives of developing irrigation on others no pumps or trees were provided or sometimes only at a much later stage therefore losing out on the impetus created by the construction of the lake intended for irrigation larger irrigation projects morra and kraroub never materialised due for instance to a failed electrification strategy leading to a built yet inoperative pumping station incoherences were also reported by farmers in policies forbidding lake users to sell market gardening products gbatis en mel and mahbes or advising farmers that water use would be forbidden to favour recharge hoshas but only after the construction placing undue expectations on the lake 3 4 5 limited ongoing government assistance 15 out of 22 lakes investigated had benefited from a pump provided by the government or the funding body e g eu project and 45 of farmers had obtained fruit trees saplings farmers interviewed expected further support however and several regularly placed requests with the local authorities for subsidies for additional pumps bergater piping or repairs to the dam whose maintenance over time is poorly budgeted selmi and talineau 1994 in the remote merguellil upper catchment public action for development is limited compared to the downstream kairouan plain and is compensated for through subventions and individualised small grants riaux et al 2014 government assistance appears to have been too limited and punctual for many users to make the transition from traditional rainfed activities to irrigated activities which demand additional investments and knowledge oweis and hachum 2006 selmi and talineau 1994 zairi et al 2005 monitoring over time by authorities may have also helped solve some of the incongruities and mismanagement observed around lakes the continued reference to the local government by farmers emphasised how engrained the government s presence is possibly as a result of the historically interventionist government this also seemed to reflect a posture whereby farmers are merely managing a government lake where they gained rights instead of appropriating their lake 3 4 6 conflicting livelihood strategies of those who abandoned market gardening 19 stated that water supply was the dominant constraint however 15 identified other reasons which included the costs and low profits obtained the intense labour and the presence required small farmers notably struggled to cope financially until the harvest and with the minimal return on investment from fruit trees in the first years leading them to pursue complementary livelihoods a subset of farmers 7 with large herds of sheep between 50 and 60 and significant surface area 10 60 ha of cereals showed no real interest in intensifying their fruit farming activities preferring to rely on traditional agricultural livelihoods other farmers had already started to diversify their income due to land surface area reducing through inheritance and soil fertility declining over time and work as labourers cnea 2006 selmi et al 2001 many when they have interesting opportunities including abroad in libya or cameroon pursue these activities and when contracts are scarce and or water levels were high choose to focus on agriculture and seek to intensify their production market gardening fertilisers etc out of 28 people who previously had a secondary source of income 25 continue to have a secondary activity implying that only three people were able to move towards agriculture exclusively here high value fruit cherry fig apricots and some market gardening 4 conclusions the multi scale interdisciplinary approach developed here highlighted the vast disparities in the benefits and practices between lakes farmers and over time diachronic perspectives highlighted crop diversification and an increase in fruit trees supported in part by watering from the lakes olive harvests provide non negligible revenue to families and during good years farmers can develop limited lucrative activities isolated successful enterprises based around intensive fruit farming were also observed the wide framework also identified support to livestock nearby wells and immaterial benefits attempts to develop market gardening and intensifying fruit farming on 56 of lakes bear witness to the level of interest in this additional resource but most farmers were deceived due to the unfavourable hydro meteorological conditions exploiting the landsat derived water availability patterns provided unprecedented insights into the hydrological constraints on 86 of small lakes on some of the smallest lakes due to their size or rapid infiltration their initial potential was already negligible and communication with the riparian communities would have avoided disappointments and associated disaffection on lakes where volumes can be significant and irrigated activities can be developed farmers must be equipped with strategies to cope with the variability and associated uncertainty for the lake to cease to be both a help and a threat for most this was limiting and led to the loss of production while those with sufficient economic resilience or other water supplies survived the droughts though a limiting condition water availability was indeed not a sufficient condition to understand the disparities in practices on lakes where water availability is high individual successes are reported and again occurred as a result of individual capabilities inadequate ongoing government support to develop and structure agricultural activities and water management limited the number of beneficiaries due largely to problems over access to pumps pipes repairs and to wua failures farmers were in certain cases excluded from the start selmi and talineau 1994 and others more subtly over time through conflicts mismanagement and appropriation of the pumps where the local government was proactive this led to wider levels of exploitation compared to other similar lakes but benefits remained confined to a select few investments in small reservoirs have supported remote rural areas affected by erosion poor soils and low and irregular rainfall albeit with often low equity and incoherences they probably contributed to slow the inevitable fate of rural exodus and investments helping local upstream smallholders vincent 2003 should be encouraged the majority of small reservoirs which depend on erratic rainfall volumes are however limited in their ability to develop irrigated agriculture on any significant scale lakes can support dry spells during the rainy season and on good rainfall years intensification during dry months if supported adequately to optimise production and minimise risks could be performed however fundamentally small reservoirs despite gradual shifts in the discourse venot and krishnan 2011 are designed for supplementary irrigation and their limited storage does not address the years when rainfall is low preventing a long term transition to irrigated agriculture in any case reservoirs by capturing silt have a dedicated lifespan and must not be perceived as a perennial solution 30 years

matter digestibility gas methane production of sorghum sudangrass silage plants were grown under combinations of three different irrigation levels i100 100 i75 75 and i50 50 of depleted water from field capacity and three different nitrogen doses n1 100 n2 200 n3 300 kg ha 1 experiments were conducted in randomized blocks split plots design for two years in 2013 and 2014 harvested plants were ensilaged silage samples were opened after 60 days and relevant analyses were performed on silage samples irrigation treatments increased green herbage yield yield components acid detergent fiber adf neutral detergent fiber ndf dry matter and crude ash and decreased crude protein gas production and organic matter digestibility increasing nitrogen doses increased panicle and leaf ratio crude protein ratio and green herbage yield and decreased dry matter and ph levels the greatest adf ndf metabolic energy gas production and organic matter digestibility values were obtained from 200 kg ha 1 treatment current findings revealed that increasing yield but decreasing quality values were observed with increasing irrigation levels appropriate nitrogen doses had positive impacts on green herbage yield and feed quality there were not significant differences between n3 i100 and n2 i75 treatments therefore a slight water deficit i75 and normal nitrogen supply 200 kg ha 1 is recommended for sorghum sudangrass culture without any significant losses in yield and quality parameters keywords sorghum sudangrass silage irrigation levels nitrogen nutritive value fermentation gas methane production 1 introduction sorghum is one of the five main plants cultivated throughout the earth due to its multiple uses in food feed bio fuel and cellulose industries tari et al 2013 sorghum is relatively more resistant to environmental stress conditions than the other c4 plants can easily be adapted to low input environments li et al 2010 and has some superior characteristics like satisfactory yield and quality under stress conditions to certain extend sorghum has considerably high resistance to both drought and salinity stresses and can produce a notable yield as compared to many other plants just because of well developed root system tari et al 2013 it was emphasized by many authors that sorghum plant uses water bean et al 2002 and plant nutrients n p k more efficiently and thus had higher dry matter yields than maize and many other cereals bean et al 2002 yosef et al 2009 again just because of two times larger root system than that of maize house 1985 such a case makes sorghum a superior ground crop in areas with limited water and nutrients fertilization and irrigation are the primary inputs in agricultural production and they have significant impacts on both yield and quality islam et al 2012 khelil et al 2013 nitrogen afzal et al 2013 and irrigation treatments saini 2012 were reported to improve significantly herbage yield and quality as well as nutritional composition of sorghum grains excessive water and fertilizer will increase production costs have various negative impacts on soil and environment and ultimately may result in significant losses in yield levels excess and improper use of chemical fertilizers ultimately result in significant economic losses for producers khelil et al 2013 crop response to water deficiency and nitrogen vary with the local conditions thus it is quite significant to test sorghum response to different irrigation regimes and nitrogen treatments under local conditions it was declared in previous studies that irrigation levels influenced lignin and water soluble sugar content thus altered in vitro digestibility of sorghum silage carmi et al 2006 yosef et al 2009 therefore water and nitrogenous fertilizers should be so properly applied that they should improve efficient use of plant nutrients produce high yields kim et al 2008 and preserve silage quality as well as feed digestibility in vitro gas production is a cheap rapid and time saving technique used to determine nutritive values of various feeds therefore this technique has recently been used in researches about nutritive values of roughage kamalak and canbolat 2010 methane reduction potential of forage and feeds are also determined with in vitro gas production technique lin et al 2013 serious amount of methane is produced during rumen fermentation lassey 2007 and such a large production has then great contributions to global warming even though many researches have been done about the potential effects of irrigation and fertilization on sorghum forage yield and feed quality the studies about the effects of such treatments on silage quality digestibility and methane production potential are quite limited therefore the present study was conducted to determine the potential impacts of irrigation and nitrogen treatments on i yield and yield components ii silage chemical composition and fermentation iii gas methane

39 48 n 38 73 e for two years in 2013 and 2014 sugar grazer ii sorghum sudangrass cultivar was used as the crop material of the experiments plot sizes were arranged as 6 4 2 m with a row spacing of 70 cm and on row plant spacing of 15 cm experiments were conducted in randomized blocks split plots design with three replications three irrigation levels i100 100 i75 75 and i50 50 of depleted water from field capacity were placed in main plots and three nitrogen treatments n1 100 n2 200 and n3 300 kg ha 1 n were placed in sub plots there were 27 plots 3 3 3 nitrogen doses were selected based on the findings of restelatto et al 2014 who applied seven doses from 0 to 375 kg ha 1 and suggested different nitrogen doses for dry matter dm yield crude protein cp content or in vitro dm digestibility soil analyses were performed before nitrogen treatments and the amount of nitrogen to be applied was calculated based on soil available nitrogen contents total nitrogen was applied in two equal portions composite fertilizer 20 20 0 was used for first half of nitrogen at sowing and urea 46 n was used for the second half of nitrogen when plants reached to a height of 50 cm totally 180 kg ha 1 p2o5 was applied at sowing irrigation water level was calculated based on soil moisture content which was determined instantly by neutron probe cpn 503 dr hydroprobe moisture gauge in previously placed in access tubes and drip lines were used for irrigation since the lower soil layer was stony soil moisture was monitored through 60 cm root depth a lateral line with 4 l h 1 drippers was placed for two rows dripper spacing was 33 cm in each plot soil moisture was measured from two points one from the place with lateral line and the other from a place without lateral line and average of two measurements was considered as the soil moisture content of that plot for control treatments amount of irrigation water to be applied as to bring soil moisture level to the field capacity was calculated soil moisture levels were monitored on every other day with a neutron meter and irrigation was initiated when 35 40 of available water within the root zone was depleted in i75 and i50 treatments 75 and 50 of the amount applied in control treatment was applied the amount of water to be applied was placed in irrigation tanks and applied to experimental plots in a measured fashion irrigation water use efficiency iwue and water use efficiency wue values were calculated with the aid of following equations howell et al 1992 i w u e y i w u e y e t where iwue irrigation water use

and climate characteristics of the research site seeds were sown on 23rd april in the first year and on 28th april in the second one temperatures of the experimental years were quite similar with the long term averages compared to long term data the first year precipitation was lower while that of the second year was higher relative humidity values of both years were lower than the long term averages table 1 experimental soils 0 60 cm profile were sandy loam in texture with high potassium and phosphorus content low organic matter and lime contents non saline and slightly alkaline table 2

were compared with lsd test 3 results 3 1 plant water consumption and irrigation as the average of two years plant evapotranspiration et of i100 i75 and i50 treatments were determined as 890 5 701 0 and 511 5 mm respectively amount of irrigation water applied to i100 i75 and i50 treatments were 778 0 584 5 and 391 5 mm respectively the root zone soil moisture differences between the sowing and harvest were determined as 14 5 18 5 and 22 0 mm for i100 i75 and i50 treatments respectively mean precipitation of two experimental years was recorded as 98 mm therefore i75 and i50 treatments consumed 21 3 and 42 6 less water than the control treatment consequently it was concluded that i75 and i50 treatments experienced slight and moderate water stress water use efficiency and irrigation water use efficiency of the i100 i75 and i50 treatments were calculated 11 73 13 40 and 15 45 kg m 3 and 13 43 16 07 and 20 18 kg m 3 respectively table 3 sorghum sudangrass yield response factor ky was calculated as 0 55 fig 1 3 2 yield morphological and chemical properties interactions had significant effects on green herbage yield and plant height green herbage yields varied between 56 37 118

treatments were not significantly different plant heights varied 175 78 255 45 cm with the greatest value from i100 n2 and the lowest value from i50 n1 treatments the differences in plants heights of i100 n3 255 35 cm i100 n2 255 45 cm and i75 n3 244 61 cm treatments were not found to be significant while irrigation levels and nitrogen doses had significant effects on stem diameter effects of interactions were not found to be significant the greatest stem diameters were observed in i100 18 88 mm and n2 19 97 mm treatments table 4 while individual irrigation and nitrogen treatments had significant effects on panicle leaf and stem ratios effects of interaction on plant parts were not found to be significant with increasing irrigation levels panicle and stem ratios increased but leaf ratios decreased with increasing nitrogen doses panicle and leaf ratios increased but stem ratios initially increased then decreased with the greatest stem ratio in n2 treatment table 4 again irrigation nitrogen interactions did not have any significant effects on silage chemical parameters however individual years irrigation and nitrogen treatments had significant effects on all silage chemical parameters except for the effects of nitrogen treatments on ph levels table 4 silage dm contents decreased with increasing nitrogen treatments and increased with increasing irrigation treatments increasing nitrogen doses caused significant increases in cp contents but significant decreases in adf ndf ca and ph levels table 5 dry matter contents of nitrogen and irrigation treatments varied between 25 21 29 26 and 25 50 28 01 respectively with the greatest values in i100 and n1 treatments significant decreases were observed in ph values with increasing nitrogen doses 4 02 3 95 adf and ndf contents increased with increasing irrigation levels and decreased with increasing nitrogen doses the lowest adf and ndf ratios of nitrogen treatments were respectively observed as 35 60 and 58 48 from n1 treatment and the highest values were respectively observed as 38 22 and 60 45 from n2 treatment considering the irrigation treatments the lowest adf and ndf ratios were 36 09 58 03 from i50 treatment while the highest values were respectively 37 74 60 06 from i100 treatment while increasing nitrogen treatments increased crude protein ratios increasing irrigation levels decreased this value however crude protein ratios of n2 and n3 nitrogen treatments and i50 and i70 irrigation treatments were placed into the same statistical group the highest crude protein ratio was 6 29 in n3 and 6 05 in i50 treatments the effects of nitrogen treatments on lactic acid content of the silage were found to be highly significant p 0 01 while the effects on acetic acid propionic acid and butyric acid were not significant p 0 05 lactic acid content of nitrogen treatments varied between 37 7 45 3 g kg 1 dm table 6 lactic acid production of n2 treatment was higher than that of n1 and n3 treatments methane productions were not influenced significantly by irrigation levels nitrogen treatments and water nitrogen interactions p 0 05 contrary to gas production which was significantly affected by the years nitrogen and irrigation treatments p 0 01 table 7 the effects irrigation nitrogen interactions on gas production were not found to be significant p 0 05 gas production

these parameters gas production values varied between 29 16 30 47 ml me varied between 6 52 6 66 mj kg dm and omd varied between 44 45 45 41 4 discussions this study was conducted to determine the effects of different irrigation levels and nitrogen doses on yield yield components silage quality attributes gas methane production metabolic energy and organic matter digestibility of sorghum sudangrass irrigation nitrogen interactions did not have any significant effects on investigated parameters except for green herbage yield and plant height yield and yield components increased but nutritional parameters decreased with increasing irrigation levels increasing nitrogen doses also increased yield yield components crude protein content but decreased adf ndf gas methane production irrigation treatment of i100 and nitrogen treatment of n3 were recommended for desired yield and quality in sorghum sudangrass the yield response factor ky of 0 55 indicated that sorghum sudangrass was quite resistant to water stress doorenbos and kassam 1986 so it can be stated that sorghum sudangrass was quite tolerant to drought with regard to green herbage yield plant height diameter and stem ratios increased with increasing irrigation water quantities and nitrogen doses thus green herbage yield increased with the increasing treatments previous researchers also reported increasing

sorghum sudangrass culture without any significant losses in yield and quality parameters keywords sorghum sudangrass silage irrigation levels nitrogen nutritive value fermentation gas methane production 1 introduction sorghum is one of the five main plants cultivated throughout the earth due to its multiple uses in food feed bio fuel and cellulose industries tari et al 2013 sorghum is relatively more resistant to environmental stress conditions than the other c4 plants can easily be adapted to low input environments li et al 2010 and has some superior characteristics like satisfactory yield and quality under stress conditions to certain extend sorghum has considerably high resistance to both drought and salinity stresses and can produce a notable yield as compared to many other plants just because of well developed root system tari et al 2013 it was emphasized by many authors that sorghum plant uses water bean et al 2002 and plant nutrients n p k more efficiently and thus had higher dry matter yields than maize and many other cereals bean et al 2002 yosef et al 2009 again just because of two times larger root system than that of maize house 1985 such a case makes sorghum a superior ground crop in areas with limited water and nutrients fertilization and irrigation are the primary inputs in agricultural production and they have significant impacts on both yield and quality islam et al 2012 khelil et al 2013 nitrogen afzal et al 2013 and irrigation treatments saini 2012 were reported to improve significantly herbage yield and quality as well as nutritional composition of sorghum grains excessive water and fertilizer will increase production costs have various negative impacts on soil and environment and ultimately may result in significant losses in yield levels excess and improper use of chemical fertilizers ultimately result in significant economic losses for producers khelil et al 2013 crop response to water deficiency and nitrogen vary with the local conditions thus it is quite significant to test sorghum response to different irrigation regimes and nitrogen treatments under local conditions it was declared in previous studies that irrigation levels influenced lignin and water soluble sugar content thus altered in vitro digestibility of sorghum silage carmi et al 2006 yosef et al 2009 therefore water and nitrogenous fertilizers should be so properly applied that they should improve efficient use of plant nutrients produce high yields kim et al 2008 and preserve silage quality as well as feed digestibility in vitro gas production is a cheap rapid and time saving technique used to determine nutritive values of various feeds therefore this technique has recently been used in researches about nutritive values of roughage kamalak and canbolat 2010 methane reduction potential of forage and feeds are also determined with in vitro gas production technique lin et al 2013 serious amount of methane is produced during rumen fermentation lassey 2007 and such a large production has then great contributions to global warming even though many researches have been done about the potential effects of irrigation and fertilization on sorghum forage yield and feed quality the studies about the effects of such treatments on silage quality digestibility and methane production potential are quite limited therefore

the findings of restelatto et al 2014 who applied seven doses from 0 to 375 kg ha 1 and suggested different nitrogen doses for dry matter dm yield crude protein cp content or in vitro dm digestibility soil analyses were performed before nitrogen treatments and the amount of nitrogen to be applied was calculated based on soil available nitrogen contents total nitrogen was applied in two equal portions composite fertilizer 20 20 0 was used for first half of nitrogen at sowing and urea 46 n was used for the second half of nitrogen when plants reached to a height of 50 cm totally 180 kg ha 1

placed in access tubes and drip lines were used for irrigation since the lower soil layer was stony soil moisture was monitored through 60 cm root depth a lateral line with 4 l h 1 drippers was placed for two rows dripper spacing was 33 cm in each plot soil moisture was measured from two points one from the place with lateral line and the other from a place without lateral line and average of two measurements was considered as the soil moisture content of that plot for control treatments amount of irrigation water to be applied as to bring soil moisture level to the field capacity was calculated soil moisture levels were monitored on every other day with a neutron meter and irrigation was initiated when 35 40 of available water within the root zone was depleted in i75 and i50 treatments 75 and 50 of the amount applied in control treatment was applied the amount of water to be applied was placed in irrigation tanks and applied to experimental plots in a measured fashion

11042,using high sand surface water in agricultural irrigation has become an alternative way to release groundwater stress although drip irrigation is considered as the most appropriate irrigation method for high sand water application as it is precise and controllable it easily leads to emitter clogging the clogging issue couldn t be well controlled if merely focused on the sand size and concentration therefore figuring out whether microorganisms significantly affect the clogging process is important for appropriate high sand water utilization based on these the phospholipid fatty acids plfas was applied as the biological indicator of the microorganisms and an in site drip irrigation experiment using eight types of flat emitters was carried out the results indicated that there were more than 10 types of plfas in emitter clogging substances using high sand water brackish water and their 1 1 mixed water in volume as plfas contents showed significant positive linear correlations with emitter clogging degree cd r2 0 89 p 0 05 it demonstrated that microorganism variations directly affected emitter clogging process among the plfas obtained pseudomonas 16 0 and heavy pyrolysis hydrogen bacillus 18 0 were the plfas those fully distributed during the clogging process which occupied 66 0 87 0 of the total contents of plfas and they both displayed significant linear correlations with cd r2 0 72 p 0 05 therefore they were considered as the critical bacteria to emitter clogging their competition and the effects on the other types of plfas determined the evolution and variation characteristics of the microorganism community and the ecological parameters of microorganism community including diversity evenness and dominance indexes all had significant quadratic patterns with cd r2 0 56 p 0 05 although mixing high sand water and brackish water in equal volume reduced both the sediment and salinity in the water source the plfas obviously increased and resulted in the more intense biological clogging process and thus enhanced the physical chemical biological coupling effects consequently the operating cycle of mixed water treatment decreased by 8 9 22 0 the results in this paper aim to provide theoretical references to drip irrigation emitter clogging mechanism using high sand surface water and to offer guidelines for appropriate high sand water utilization in agriculture keywords high sand surface water application drip irrigation emitter clogging microorganism community ecological evaluation 1 introduction water shortage and water pollution continue to be the worldwide challenge especially in the arid regions that cover 42 of the planet s surface tal 2016 according to unesco 2014 agricultural irrigation used 69 of the water utilized by humans therefore two ways were proceeded to relieve the water consumption in agriculture one of them was energetically developing and promoting the water saving irrigation technologies including drip irrigation and sprinkle irrigation especially the drip irrigation system by utilizing the enclosed pipelines supplied water and fertilizer to the root area of plants in a relatively tiny and steady flow which avoided the unnecessary evaporation and thus increased the water use efficiency the other one was taking full advantage of the low quality water in agricultural irrigation such as high sand water reclaimed water brackish water and surface lake water rather than merely pumping out the ground water from deeper aquifer liu and huang 2009 pei et al 2014 but the multiple substances in these water sources would have potential risks to plant soil or even human health if not utilized appropriately although drip irrigation is considered as the most appropriate way to utilize the low quality water sources as it is precisely controllable the multiple substances in the water would easily result in drip irrigation emitter clogging due to the narrow emitter flow path merely 0 5 1 2 mm and complex geometrical construction clogging issue directly affects irrigation uniformity and its service life or even disabling the whole system liu and huang 2009 pei et al 2014 according to the main water quality elements induced emitter clogging is classified as physical chemical and biological bucks et al 1979 when using the reclaimed water in agriculture using drip irrigation technology the clogging issue was regarded as the typical biological clogging this was mainly because the large amounts of microorganisms in the reclaimed water were not only the main components of the clogging substances but also secreted sticky extracellular polymeric substance eps to maintain its structure stable zhou et al 2017 although effluent recycling is an ideal way to relieve water stress especially in agriculture the reclaimed water is always available in the developed countries or around the urban areas in the developing countries mainly due to the initial high input of reclaimed water treatment plant large amounts of wastewater sources and economic and ecological benefits of reclaimed water application most arid regions are located at the rural or relatively desolate areas and high sand water is one of the typical water sources in these regions apart from the ground water based on previous studies drip irrigation using high sand water was regarded as the typical physical clogging as the clogging substances mainly consisted of solid particles related studies mainly focused on the effects of sand concentrations and sizes on the clogging process and tried to solve it through appropriate filtration equipment and optimized emitter products niu et al 2013 bounoua et al 2016 the results were not as expected this was because large amounts of microorganisms and organic matters were included in the high sand water due to the human activities and emitter clogging process were highly related to the multiple matters and their interactions in the water source zhou et al 2016a then were microorganisms significantly affecting drip irrigation clogging process using surface high sand water if so how the impacts were reflected and which kind of microorganism played the decisive role all these were unknown and needed to be studied therefore the objectives of this paper were to 1 study the dynamic variations of microorganisms in clogging substances in drip irrigation emitters using surface high sand water 2 identify the critical bacteria in the microorganism community that are closely related to emitter clogging process 2 materials and methods 2 1 water source used in the experiment the in site field experiment was conducted at the irrigation experimental station located at ulanbuhe arid area in bayinaoer inner mongolia china 106 98 e 40 39 n there were 4 water treatments in total the yellow river water imported from wushen main canal was regarded as the surface high sand water hsw the local lake water was brought in as the brackish water ssw and their 1 1 mixed water in volume as the mixed water source mxw these 3 treatments were proceeded with lateral flushing and the other treatment surface high sand water without lateral flushing hso was considered as the contrast the laterals in the 3 flushing treatments were flushed once the system cumulatively operated for 60 h and the flushing water velocity was 0 45 m s their water qualities were monitored every 14 days and the ranges of values are shown in table 1 2 2 experiment layout 4 separate testing systems were set up for 4 treatments and the detailed in site experiment layout is displayed in fig 1 each testing system had 2 subunits and each subunit was built in 4 layers in every individual layer 1 type of flat emitter was installed with 8 replications to satisfy the demands of clogging substances samples with targeted clogging degrees there were 8 types of flat emitters labeled as fe1 fe8 in total for each treatment and their detailed parameters are shown in table 2 driplines used in the experiment were 16 mm in internal diameter with the constant spacing of 30 cm and the dripline was 15 m in length there were 50 emitters per lateral numbered 1 50 from the inlet to the outlet one 125 μm screen filter and one 125 μm disc filter were put in series as the filtration equipment the shunt principle was adopted to control the water supply to keep the constant inlet pressure at 0 1 mpa and the average water velocity at the outlet was 0 40 0 60 m s correspondingly according to the definition of emitter clogging proposed by iso standard 2003 we defined the emitter lifecycle as the period when clogging degree cd was within 50 the operation of each type of emitter would be stopped once its cd 50 based on this the experiment started from july 1 2015 and lasted to october 3 2015 when the cd of every type of emitter reached 50 the total operating period was 855 h according to the daily schedule of 7 00 am 12 00 pm and 2 00 pm 6 00 pm 2 3 clogging substances sampling and microorganism community testing methods the weighing method was applied to measure the outflow of each emitter every 36 h along with the water temperature and then the outflow data were calibrated by temperature modification model as eq 1 pei et al 2014 1 q i t q t i 57 35 x 28 24 100 t i 20 20 q i 0 where q i t indicates the outflows after the temperature modification l h 1 q i 0 indicates the initial outflow targeted to be tested at 20 iso 2003 which is measured before the experiment l h 1 x is the flow index of the emitters which is offered by the manufacturer or measured before the experiment ti is the water temperature tested q t i indicates the outflow tested under ti l h 1 then the dra was calculated using eq 2 to represent emitter clogging degree cd which was calculated with eq 3 2 d r a i n q i t q i 0 n 100 3 cd 100 dra where n is the number of emitters tested and the other parameters are the same with those in eq 1 when cd dropped to 95 90 85 80 75 70 60 50 of the initial outflow one lateral with the most similar cd in each treatment was selected respectively and then 5 emitters which were close to the target cd were cut off from each part of the head no 1 10 middle no 21 30 and tail no 41 50 locations of the drip irrigation lateral respectively the samples were put in the bags and 20 ml deionized water was added to remove the clogging substances for 60 min using the ultrasonic cleaner manufacture chaowei type gvs 10 l working rate of power 240 w frequency 60 hz the turbid liquid after the treatment was mixed altogether to test phospholipid fatty acids plfas plfas as an important component in the cell membrane differed obviously in different microorganisms and decomposed rapidly after the cell death therefore it could be considered as the biomarkers to monitor the microorganism communities sun and liu 2004 the testing method referred to pennanen et al 1999 and the detailed procedures included plfas extraction purification methylation gas chromatography mass spectroscopic gc ms analysis biomass assessment bacterial plfas determination and data analysis the classification criterion was based on the results summarized by zhou et al 2013 according to previous studying results as shown in table 3 2 4 ecological characteristics of microorganism community the plfas testing results were used as quantitative estimation of the ecological characteristics of microorganism community and the ecological parameters including shannon wiener s diversity index h shannon 1948 pielou s evenness index j mulder et al 2004 and simpson s dominance index d simpson 1949 1 shannon wiener s diversity index h more species in the microorganism community would increase its complexity which means more diverse microorganisms included it can be calculated with eq 4 4 h i 1 s n i n ln n i n where s stands for the number of species of plfas n stands for the total number of individuals ni stands for the amount of each plfas and ni n stands for the proportion of each type of plfas 2 pielou s evenness index j the distribution evenness was higher when the number of individuals is virtually equal and it is calculated with eq 5 5 j h l n s where h stands for shannon wiener s diversity index and s is the same as that of eq 4 3 simpson s dominance index d higher dominance index indicates the higher dominant position the type of microorganism is in and the index is calculated with eq 6 6 d 1 i 1 s n i n 2 where the parameters indicate the same meanings of those in eq 4 2 5 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova was conducted to explore the differences among different water sources and emitter types applied regression analysis was used to quantify the correlations among bacteria proportions ecological parameters h j d emitter parameters including emitter initial outflow q flow path length l width w depth d and average cross section velocity v as well as 2 dimensionless parameters we studied in previous studies a1 2 l and rw d zhou et al 2016b feng et al 2018 and the degree of emitter clogging cd during these statistical analysis mentioned above the significance of the independent variable was determined at p 0 05 the statistical analysis was carried out using spss ver 17 0 ibm analytics 3 results 3 1 plfas accumulation in clogging substances in emitters the dynamic variations of plfas in clogging substances within the lifecycles of emitters in 4 treatments and their correlations with cd are shown in figs 2 and 3 and the significant analysis results are summarized in tables 4 and 5 seen from fig 2 the lifecycles of emitters under different types of water source showed obvious differences as the average lifecycles of 8 types of emitters were 667 5 h 46 8 h 747 5 h 51 9 h 612 5 h 61 6 h and 607 5 h 63 2 h in the hsw ssw mxw and hso treatments respectively emitters drip irrigated with ssw showed longer lifecycles than those with hsw by 12 0 in average but when hsw was mixed with the same volume of ssw as mxw the emitter lifecycles dropped by 8 9 22 0 however the lifecycles of hsw ssw mxw were longer than that of hso treatment without flushing which were larger by 9 9 23 0 and 0 8 respectively according to the anova analysis results table 4 the emitter lifestyles of ssw were significantly different from the other treatments p 0 05 while the differences among the other three water sources failed to reach the significant level among the 8 types of emitters applied in the experiment fe4 showed the weakest anti clogging ability as its lifecycle was merely 585 h 49 7 h fe3 and fe5 were slightly better with the lifecycle of 615 h 61 6 h and 615 h 77 9 h fe8 had the strongest anti clogging ability as its lifecycle was 745 h 55 5 h followed by fe1 710 h 57 4 h and fe7 700 h 42 4 h based on the anova results obtained from all water sources treatments those summarized in table 5 the differences of lifecycles of 8 types of emitters failed to reach the significant level except those between fe1 and fe4 as well as between fe4 and fe8 at the end of the experiment plfas in different types of emitters under hsw ssw mxw and hso treatments reached 0 06 0 49 mg 0 05 0 42 mg 0 08 0 60 mg and 0 06 0 57 mg respectively obvious differences were obtained among different water sources and emitter types but the plfas all showed significant positive linear correlations with cd fig 3 r2 0 89 p 0 05 the results indicated that more serious emitter clogging was closely related to plfas increment which meant there were bio clogging process in all treatments 3 2 critical bacteria of microorganism community different types of plfas and their distributions inside emitters are shown in fig 4 taking results acquired in hsw treatment as example and the correlations between the proportions of the gram positive bacteria pseudomonas 16 0 and bacillus 18 0 and their correlations with cd are shown in fig 5 there were 11 10 14 and 11 types of plfas in clogging substances in emitters under hsw ssw mxw and hso treatments respectively the plfas found in hsw and hso treatments were the same but were different from those in ssw and mxw treatments after mixing high sand water hsw and brackish water ssw in equal volume the types of plfas increased by 3 4 therefore the types of plfas obtained in the clogging substances were mainly affected by the water source applied in the drip irrigation system rather than whether the system had flushing treatment among all types of plfas gram positive bacteria 16 0 pseudomonas belonging to bacilli and 18 0 heavy pyrolysis hydrogen bacillus belonging to bacilli as well as bacteria 14 0 and 20 0 were found in all treatments their differences varied in gram positive bacteria i16 0 gram negative bacteria 16 1ω7c 18 1ω7 t bacteria 13 0 i14 0 and a15 0 fungi 16 1w9t and i17 1w7 furthermore only the pseudomonas 16 0 and the heavy pyrolysis hydrogen bacillus 18 0 were obtained all through the whole clogging process and their total contents occupied 75 8 86 7 72 6 80 9 66 0 80 0 and 70 4 87 0 of the whole microorganisms in hsw ssw mxw and hso treatments respectively on the other hand the proportion of pseudomonas 16 0 decreased slightly at the preliminary stage and increased rapidly afterwards the minimum proportion of pseudomonas 16 0 28 1 40 4 were acquired when cd 10 15 and the maximum ones 44 3 56 0 were obtained when cd increased to 40 50 however the variations of bacillus 18 0 were on the contrary as their maximum 45 2 52 9 and minimum 22 7 33 7 proportions were found when cd 10 and cd 40 50 separately according to the results in fig 5 they both had significant linear correlations with cd r2 0 72 p 0 05 which again verified that emitter clogging process was significantly affect by their proportion variation therefore the pseudomonas 16 0 and bacillus 18 0 were believed to be the critical bacteria in emitter clogging process 3 3 ecological parameters of microorganism community in clogging substances ecological parameters of microorganism community in clogging substances inside emitters including shannon wiener s diversity index h pielou s evenness index j and simpson s dominance index d and their correlations with cd are shown in fig 6 while their influential factors are showed in table 6 according to the results acquired in fig 6 h and j of the microorganism community in 4 treatments all decreased at first and increased afterwards as cd increased the dominance index d on the contrary increased at the initial stage and then decreased but h r2 0 67 p 0 05 j r2 0 56 p 0 05 and d r2 0 72 p 0 05 all had significant quadratic patterns with cd when cd 25 30 h and j reached the minimum values of 0 81 1 07 and 0 65 0 73 separately while maximum d was 0 54 0 64 at the end of the experiment i e cd 50 h j and d were 1 00 1 23 0 72 0 81 and 0 52 0 61 respectively obviously water sources and emitter flow path parameters had significant impacts on the ecological parameters of microorganism communities among them h and d in 4 treatments all showed positive correlations with the initial outflow q besides h in mxw treatment also had negative correlations with average cross section velocity v however different water sources showed more obvious impacts on j j in hsw and hso treatments both had positive correlations with emitter flow path length l but j showed positive correlations with flow path depth d in ssw treatment and similar to that of h in mxw treatment j also negatively correlated to v 4 discussion according to the results acquired in this paper there were large amounts of microorganisms marked by plfas contents in the clogging substances in all 4 treatments which were 2 3 times of those found in the reclaimed water zhou et al 2017 unfortunately the biological load of water sources applied in this paper were not determined and it was not possible to further explore the coupling effect of solid particles chemical precipitates and microorganisms in emitter clogging in this paper however the plfas contents in the 4 treatments applied in this paper all showed significant positive correlations with cd fig 3 r2 0 89 p 0 05 emitter clogging issue under these 4 treatments were not only related to the plfas contents but also was affected by the microorganism community distribution characteristics in clogging substances according to the results obtained in this paper there were more than 10 types of plfas in 4 treatments including gram positive bacteria i16 0 16 0 and 18 0 gram negative bacteria 16 1ω7c 18 1ω7 t bacteria 13 0 i14 0 and a15 0 fungi 16 1w9t and i17 1w7 etc among all types of plfas obtained only pseudomonas 16 0 and the heavy pyrolysis hydrogen bacillus 18 0 were fully distributed during the whole period and their total contents were more than 66 0 of all the plfas meanwhile they both had significant linear correlations with cd fig 5 r2 0 72 p 0 05 which verified their directly connections to emitter clogging process this was mainly because the disinfecting tank and aeration tank used for reclaimed water treatment was a controlled environment with strict thresholds in water quality and microorganisms were relatively stable under this condition but the water sources used in the experiment were available in a relatively open environment and resulting in larger diversity and complexity of microorganism community therefore the pseudomonas 16 0 and bacillus 18 0 were considered as the critical bacteria in emitter clogging the results were consistent with those obtained using reclaimed water except lacking the gram positive bacteria i15 0 zhou et al 2017 consequently the competitions between pseudomonas 16 0 and bacillus 18 0 and their impacts on the other plfas resulted in the microorganism community variations these characteristics were reflected in their ecological parameters shannon wiener s diversity index h pielou s evenness index j and simpson s dominance index d as they all showed significant quadratic patterns with cd fig 6 r2 0 56 p 0 05 this was mainly because microorganism contents in clogging substances were relatively low at the preliminary stage the nutrition supplied along with the water transportation was enough for their growth and resulted in relatively higher diversity and evenness afterwards pseudomonas 16 0 and bacillus 18 0 gained the advantages in amounts gradually this also indicated that more types of other microorganisms lost in the competition and the diversity and evenness of microorganism community decreased correspondingly this period lasted until cd reached 25 30 when h and j obtained the minimum values while d reached the maximum one thereafter pseudomonas 16 0 took advantage over bacillus 18 0 and increased continuously due to the stronger ability to utilize organic matters mavrodi et al 1998 some other microorganisms finally adopt to the competitive environment and somehow gained limited living space as a result the diversity and evenness began to increase and the dominance of pseudomonas 16 0 relatively decreased although mixing high sand water hsw and brackish water ssw in equal volume reduced both the sediment and salinity in the water source the contents and types of plfas increased and the coupling effect of biological physical chemical clogging was enhanced consequently the operating life of mxw decreased by 8 9 22 0 but it s still slightly longer than those of hso without significant difference which again verified lateral flushing was an effective way to deal with clogging issue li et al 2015 puig bargue s et al 2010 on the other hand h and d in 4 treatments all showed positive correlations with the q only h in mxw treatment also had negative correlations with v this was mainly because q directly determined the water nutrition and microorganisms entered the emitter per unit time the complexity of microorganism community in clogging substances was highly related to those substances in the water source zhou et al 2016a in the mxw treatment more microorganisms showed patterns and coupling effect larger v meant higher turbulence inside emitter flow path feng et al 2018 and due to larger water shear force microorganisms were more likely to detach along with the clogging substances chang et al 1991 nicolella et al 1996 under this condition the dominance index of the microorganism community decreased as microorganism was much harder to maintain their superiority in amounts meanwhile the randomness of microorganism detachment resulted in lower evenness in mxw treatment although microorganism played important role in hsw and hso treatments solid particles still occupied most of the clogging substances the solid particles could deposit more stable on the internal surface of longer flow path and led to higher evenness of the microorganism community then the similar reason could explain why j in ssw treatment had positive correlation with d in conclusion meaningful results were acquired in this paper based on the experiment however there were still some issues to study in the future 1 the experiment was carried out with high sand water brackish water and their mixed water and resulted in significant differences in microorganism community variations among them studies with more high sand water sources are required for further analysis 2 integrating high throughput sequencing testing methods to proceed more comprehensive and detailed analysis of microorganism community variation during the whole clogging process 5 conclusions for the 4 water sources applied in this paper which always represented as physical clogging and chemical clogging there were large amounts of microorganisms measured using plfas analysis method in the clogging substances the plfas contents all showed significant positive linear correlations with cd r2 0 89 p 0 05 which indicated direct impacts on emitters clogging process more than 10 types of plfas were identified in the clogging substances among which pseudomonas 16 0 and heavy pyrolysis hydrogen bacillus 18 0 were fully distributed during the whole clogging process and they occupied 66 0 87 0 of the total content as their proportions were also significantly correlated to cd r2 0 72 p 0 05 they were regarded as the critical bacteria in clogging process they both belonged to the gram positive bacteria and needed to be focused on during the regular maintenance of the drip irrigation system accordingly the ecological parameters of microorganism community all showed significant quadratic patterns with cd r2 0 56 p 0 05 when cd was 25 30 the minimum h and j were obtained as 0 81 1 07 and 0 65 0 73 separately while d reached the maximum value of 0 54 0 64 it s possible to control the emitter clogging based on the variation characteristics and controlling the corresponding ecological parameters of the microorganism community unlike what we imagined mixing hsw and ssw in equal volume increased the plfas contents and emitter clogging degree although the sand and salt concentrations were reduced this was mainly because of the microorganisms enhanced the physical chemical biological coupling interaction which offered one alert to the low quality water application acknowledgements we are grateful for the financial support from the national key research project of china 2017yfd0201504 and the national

11042,using high sand surface water in agricultural irrigation has become an alternative way to release groundwater stress although drip irrigation is considered as the most appropriate irrigation method for high sand water application as it is precise and controllable it easily leads to emitter clogging the clogging issue couldn t be well controlled if merely focused on the sand size and concentration therefore figuring out whether microorganisms significantly affect the clogging process is important for appropriate high sand water utilization based on these the phospholipid fatty acids plfas was applied as the biological indicator of the microorganisms and an in site drip irrigation experiment using eight types of flat emitters was carried out the results indicated that there were more than 10 types of plfas in emitter clogging substances using high sand water brackish water and their 1 1 mixed water in volume as plfas contents showed significant positive linear correlations with emitter clogging degree cd r2 0 89 p 0 05 it demonstrated that microorganism variations directly affected emitter clogging process among the plfas obtained pseudomonas 16 0 and heavy pyrolysis hydrogen bacillus 18 0 were the plfas those fully distributed during the clogging process which occupied 66 0 87 0 of the total contents of plfas and they both displayed significant linear correlations with cd r2 0 72 p 0 05 therefore they were considered as the critical bacteria to emitter clogging their competition and the effects on the other types of plfas determined the evolution and variation characteristics of the microorganism community and the ecological parameters of microorganism community including diversity evenness and dominance indexes all had significant quadratic patterns with cd r2 0 56 p 0 05 although mixing high sand water and brackish water in equal volume reduced both the sediment and salinity in the water source the plfas obviously increased and resulted in the more intense biological clogging process and thus enhanced the physical chemical biological coupling effects consequently the operating cycle of mixed water treatment decreased by 8 9 22 0 the results in this paper aim to provide theoretical references to drip irrigation emitter clogging mechanism using high sand surface water and to offer guidelines for appropriate high sand water utilization in agriculture keywords high sand surface water application drip irrigation emitter clogging microorganism community ecological evaluation 1 introduction water shortage and water pollution continue to be the worldwide challenge especially in the arid regions that cover 42 of the planet s surface tal 2016 according to unesco 2014 agricultural irrigation used 69 of the water utilized by humans therefore two ways were proceeded to relieve the water consumption in agriculture one of them was energetically developing and promoting the water saving irrigation technologies including drip irrigation and sprinkle irrigation especially the drip irrigation system by utilizing the enclosed pipelines supplied water and fertilizer to the root area of plants in a relatively tiny and steady flow which avoided the unnecessary evaporation and thus increased the water use efficiency the other one was taking full advantage of the low quality water in agricultural irrigation such as high sand water reclaimed water brackish water and surface lake water rather than merely pumping out the ground water from deeper aquifer liu and huang 2009 pei et al 2014 but the multiple substances in these water sources would have potential risks to plant soil or even human health if not utilized appropriately although drip irrigation is considered as the most appropriate way to utilize the low quality water sources as it is precisely controllable the multiple substances in the water would easily result in drip irrigation emitter clogging due to the narrow emitter flow path merely 0 5 1 2 mm and complex geometrical construction clogging issue directly affects irrigation uniformity and its service life or even disabling the whole system liu and huang 2009 pei et al 2014 according to the main water quality elements induced emitter clogging is classified as physical chemical and biological bucks et al 1979 when using the reclaimed water in agriculture using drip irrigation technology the clogging issue was regarded as the typical biological clogging this was mainly because the large amounts of microorganisms in the reclaimed water were not only the main components of the clogging substances but also secreted sticky extracellular polymeric substance eps to maintain its structure stable zhou et al 2017 although effluent recycling is an ideal way to relieve water stress especially in agriculture the reclaimed water is always available in the developed countries or around the urban areas in the developing countries mainly due to the initial high input of reclaimed water treatment plant large amounts of wastewater sources and economic and ecological benefits of reclaimed water application most arid regions are located at the rural or relatively desolate areas and high sand water is one of the typical water sources in these regions apart from the ground water based on previous studies drip irrigation using high sand water was regarded as the typical physical clogging as the clogging substances mainly consisted of solid particles related studies mainly focused on the effects of sand concentrations and sizes on the clogging process and tried to solve it through appropriate filtration equipment and optimized emitter products niu et al 2013 bounoua et al 2016 the results were not as expected this was because large amounts of microorganisms and organic matters were included in the high sand water due to the human activities and emitter clogging process were highly related to the multiple matters and their interactions in the water source zhou et al 2016a then were microorganisms significantly affecting drip irrigation clogging process using surface high sand water if so how the impacts were reflected and which kind of microorganism played the decisive role all these were unknown and needed to be studied therefore the objectives of this paper were to 1 study the dynamic variations of microorganisms in clogging substances in drip irrigation emitters using surface high sand water 2 identify the critical bacteria in the microorganism community that are closely related to emitter clogging process 2 materials and methods 2 1 water source used in the experiment the in site field experiment was conducted at the irrigation experimental station located at ulanbuhe arid area in bayinaoer inner mongolia china 106 98 e 40 39 n there were 4 water treatments in total the yellow river water imported from wushen main canal was regarded as the surface high sand water hsw the local lake water was brought in as the brackish water ssw and their 1 1 mixed water in volume as the mixed water source mxw these 3 treatments were proceeded with lateral flushing and the other treatment surface high sand water without lateral flushing hso was considered as the contrast the laterals in the 3 flushing treatments were flushed once the system cumulatively operated for 60 h and the flushing water velocity was 0 45 m s their water qualities were monitored every 14 days and the ranges of values are shown in table 1 2 2 experiment layout 4 separate testing systems were set up for 4 treatments and the detailed in site experiment layout is displayed in fig 1 each testing system had 2 subunits and each subunit was built in 4 layers in every individual layer 1 type of flat emitter was installed with 8 replications to satisfy the demands of clogging substances samples with targeted clogging degrees there were 8 types of flat emitters labeled as fe1 fe8 in total for each treatment and their detailed parameters are shown in table 2 driplines used in the experiment were 16 mm in internal diameter with the constant spacing of 30 cm and the dripline was 15 m in length there were 50 emitters per lateral numbered 1 50 from the inlet to the outlet one 125 μm screen filter and one 125 μm disc filter were put in series as the filtration equipment the shunt principle was adopted to control the water supply to keep the constant inlet pressure at 0 1 mpa and the average water velocity at the outlet was 0 40 0 60 m s correspondingly according to the definition of emitter clogging proposed by iso standard 2003 we defined the emitter lifecycle as the period when clogging degree cd was within 50 the operation of each type of emitter would be stopped once its cd 50 based on this the experiment started from july 1 2015 and lasted to october 3 2015 when the cd of every type of emitter reached 50 the total operating period was 855 h according to the daily schedule of 7 00 am 12 00 pm and 2 00 pm 6 00 pm 2 3 clogging substances sampling and microorganism community testing methods the weighing method was applied to measure the outflow of each emitter every 36 h along with the water temperature and then the outflow data were calibrated by temperature modification model as eq 1 pei et al 2014 1 q i t q t i 57 35 x 28 24 100 t i 20 20 q i 0 where q i t indicates the outflows after the temperature modification l h 1 q i 0 indicates the initial outflow targeted to be tested at 20 iso 2003 which is measured before the experiment l h 1 x is the flow index of the emitters which is offered by the manufacturer or measured before the experiment ti is the water temperature tested q t i indicates the outflow tested under ti l h 1 then the dra was calculated using eq 2 to represent emitter clogging degree cd which was calculated with eq 3 2 d r a i n q i t q i 0 n 100 3 cd 100 dra where n is the number of emitters tested and the other parameters are the same with those in eq 1 when cd dropped to 95 90 85 80 75 70 60 50 of the initial outflow one lateral with the most similar cd in each treatment was selected respectively and then 5 emitters which were close to the target cd were cut off from each part of the head no 1 10 middle no 21 30 and tail no 41 50 locations of the drip irrigation lateral respectively the samples were put in the bags and 20 ml deionized water was added to remove the clogging substances for 60 min using the ultrasonic cleaner manufacture chaowei type gvs 10 l working rate of power 240 w frequency 60 hz the turbid liquid after the treatment was mixed altogether to test phospholipid fatty acids plfas plfas as an important component in the cell membrane differed obviously in different microorganisms and decomposed rapidly after the cell death therefore it could be considered as the biomarkers to monitor the microorganism communities sun and liu 2004 the testing method referred to pennanen et al 1999 and the detailed procedures included plfas extraction purification methylation gas chromatography mass spectroscopic gc ms analysis biomass assessment bacterial plfas determination and data analysis the classification criterion was based on the results summarized by zhou et al 2013 according to previous studying results as shown in table 3 2 4 ecological characteristics of microorganism community the plfas testing results were used as quantitative estimation of the ecological characteristics of microorganism community and the ecological parameters including shannon wiener s diversity index h shannon 1948 pielou s evenness index j mulder et al 2004 and simpson s dominance index d simpson 1949 1 shannon wiener s diversity index h more species in the microorganism community would increase its complexity which means more diverse microorganisms included it can be calculated with eq 4 4 h i 1 s n i n ln n i n where s stands for the number of species of plfas n stands for the total number of individuals ni stands for the amount of each plfas and ni n stands for the proportion of each type of plfas 2 pielou s evenness index j the distribution evenness was higher when the number of individuals is virtually equal and it is calculated with eq

previous studies a1 2 l and rw d zhou et al 2016b feng et al 2018 and the degree of emitter clogging cd during these statistical analysis mentioned above the significance of the independent variable was determined at p 0 05 the statistical analysis was carried out using spss ver 17 0 ibm analytics 3 results 3 1 plfas accumulation in clogging substances in emitters the dynamic variations of plfas in clogging substances within the lifecycles of emitters in 4 treatments and their correlations with cd are shown in figs 2 and 3 and the significant analysis results are summarized in tables 4 and 5 seen from fig 2 the lifecycles of emitters under different types of water source showed obvious differences as the average lifecycles of 8 types of emitters were 667 5 h 46 8 h 747 5 h 51 9 h 612 5 h 61 6 h and 607 5 h 63 2 h in the hsw ssw mxw and hso treatments respectively emitters drip irrigated with ssw showed longer lifecycles than those with hsw by 12 0 in average but when hsw was mixed with the same volume of ssw as mxw the emitter lifecycles dropped by 8 9 22 0 however the lifecycles of hsw ssw mxw were longer than that of hso treatment without flushing which were larger by 9 9 23 0 and 0 8 respectively according to the anova analysis results table 4 the emitter lifestyles of ssw were significantly different from the other treatments p 0 05 while the differences among the other three water sources failed to reach the significant level among the 8 types of emitters applied in the experiment fe4 showed the weakest anti clogging ability as its lifecycle was merely 585 h 49 7 h fe3 and fe5 were slightly better with the lifecycle of 615 h 61 6 h and 615 h 77 9 h fe8 had the strongest anti clogging ability as its lifecycle was 745 h 55 5 h followed by fe1 710 h 57 4 h and fe7 700 h 42 4 h based on the anova results obtained from all water sources treatments those summarized in table 5 the differences of lifecycles of 8 types of emitters failed to reach the significant level except those between fe1 and fe4 as well as between fe4 and fe8 at the end of the experiment plfas in different types of emitters under hsw ssw mxw and hso treatments reached 0 06 0 49 mg 0 05 0 42 mg 0 08 0 60 mg and 0 06 0 57 mg respectively obvious differences were obtained among different water sources and emitter types but the plfas all showed significant positive linear correlations with cd fig 3 r2 0 89 p 0 05 the results indicated that more serious emitter clogging was closely related to plfas increment which meant there were bio clogging process in all treatments 3 2 critical bacteria of microorganism community different types of plfas and their distributions inside emitters are shown in fig 4 taking results acquired in hsw treatment as example and the correlations between the proportions of the gram positive bacteria pseudomonas 16 0 and bacillus 18 0 and their correlations with cd are shown in fig 5 there were 11 10 14 and 11 types of plfas in clogging substances in emitters under hsw ssw mxw and hso treatments respectively the plfas found in hsw and hso treatments were the same but were different from those in ssw and mxw treatments after mixing high sand water hsw and brackish water ssw in equal volume the types of plfas increased by 3 4 therefore the types of plfas obtained in the clogging substances were mainly affected by the water source applied in the drip irrigation system rather than whether the system had flushing treatment among all types of plfas gram positive bacteria 16 0 pseudomonas belonging to bacilli and 18 0 heavy pyrolysis hydrogen bacillus belonging to bacilli as well as bacteria 14 0 and 20 0 were found in all treatments their differences varied in gram positive bacteria i16 0 gram negative bacteria 16 1ω7c 18 1ω7 t bacteria 13 0 i14 0 and a15 0 fungi 16 1w9t and i17 1w7 furthermore only the pseudomonas 16 0 and the heavy pyrolysis hydrogen bacillus 18 0 were obtained all through the whole clogging process and their total contents occupied 75 8 86 7 72 6 80 9 66 0 80 0 and 70 4 87 0 of the whole microorganisms in hsw ssw mxw and hso treatments respectively on the other hand the proportion of pseudomonas 16 0 decreased slightly at the preliminary stage and increased rapidly afterwards the minimum proportion of pseudomonas 16 0 28 1 40 4 were acquired when cd 10 15 and the maximum ones 44 3 56 0 were obtained when cd increased to 40 50 however the variations of bacillus 18 0 were on the contrary as their maximum 45 2 52 9 and minimum 22 7 33 7 proportions were found when cd 10 and cd 40 50 separately according to the results in fig 5 they both had significant linear correlations with cd r2 0 72 p 0 05 which again verified that emitter clogging process was significantly affect by their proportion variation therefore the pseudomonas 16 0 and bacillus 18 0 were believed to be the critical bacteria in emitter clogging process 3 3 ecological parameters of microorganism community in clogging substances ecological parameters of microorganism community in clogging substances inside emitters including shannon wiener s diversity index h pielou s evenness index j and simpson s dominance index d and their correlations with cd are shown in fig 6 while their influential factors are showed in table 6 according to the results acquired in fig 6 h and j of the microorganism community in 4 treatments all decreased at first and increased afterwards as cd increased the dominance index d on the contrary increased at the initial stage and then decreased but h r2 0 67 p 0 05 j r2 0 56 p 0 05 and d r2 0 72 p 0 05 all had significant quadratic patterns with cd when cd 25 30 h and j reached the minimum values of 0 81 1 07 and 0 65 0 73 separately while maximum d was 0 54 0 64 at the end of the experiment i e cd 50 h j and d were 1 00 1 23 0 72 0 81 and 0 52 0 61 respectively obviously water sources and emitter flow path parameters had significant impacts on the ecological parameters of microorganism communities among them h and d in 4 treatments all showed positive correlations with the initial outflow q besides h in mxw treatment also had negative correlations with average cross section velocity v however different water sources showed more obvious impacts on j j in hsw and hso treatments both had positive correlations with emitter flow path length l but j showed positive correlations with flow path depth d in ssw treatment and similar to that of h in mxw treatment j also negatively correlated to v 4 discussion according to the results acquired in this paper there were large amounts of microorganisms marked by plfas contents in the clogging substances in all 4 treatments which were 2 3 times of those found in the reclaimed water zhou et al 2017 unfortunately the biological load of water sources applied in this paper were not determined and it was not possible to further explore the coupling effect of solid particles chemical precipitates and microorganisms in emitter clogging in this paper however the plfas contents in the 4 treatments applied in this paper all showed significant positive correlations with cd fig 3 r2 0 89 p 0 05 emitter clogging issue under these 4 treatments were not only related to the plfas contents but also was affected by the microorganism community distribution characteristics in clogging substances according to the results obtained in this paper there were more than 10 types of plfas in 4 treatments including gram positive bacteria i16 0 16 0 and 18 0 gram negative bacteria 16 1ω7c 18 1ω7 t bacteria 13 0 i14 0 and a15 0 fungi 16 1w9t and i17 1w7 etc among all types of plfas obtained only pseudomonas 16 0 and the heavy pyrolysis hydrogen bacillus 18 0 were fully distributed during the whole period and their total contents were more than 66 0 of all the plfas meanwhile they both had significant linear correlations with cd fig 5 r2 0 72 p 0 05 which verified their directly connections to emitter clogging process this was mainly because the disinfecting tank and aeration tank used for reclaimed water treatment was a controlled environment with strict thresholds in water quality and microorganisms were relatively stable under this condition but the water sources used in the experiment were available in a relatively open environment and resulting in larger diversity and complexity of microorganism community therefore the pseudomonas 16 0 and bacillus 18 0 were considered as the critical bacteria in emitter clogging the results were consistent with those obtained using reclaimed water except lacking the gram positive bacteria i15 0 zhou et al 2017 consequently the competitions between pseudomonas 16 0 and bacillus 18 0 and their impacts on the other plfas resulted in the microorganism community variations these characteristics were reflected in their ecological parameters shannon wiener s diversity index h pielou s evenness index j and simpson s dominance index d as they all showed significant quadratic patterns with cd fig 6 r2 0 56 p 0 05 this was mainly because microorganism contents in clogging substances were relatively low at the preliminary stage the nutrition supplied along with the water transportation was enough for their growth and resulted in relatively higher diversity and evenness afterwards pseudomonas 16 0 and bacillus 18 0 gained the advantages in amounts gradually this also indicated that more types of other microorganisms lost in the competition and the diversity and evenness of microorganism community decreased correspondingly this period lasted until cd reached 25 30 when h and j obtained the minimum values while d reached the maximum one thereafter pseudomonas 16 0 took advantage over bacillus 18 0 and increased continuously due to the stronger ability to utilize organic matters mavrodi et al 1998 some other microorganisms finally adopt to the competitive environment and somehow gained limited living space as a result the diversity and evenness began to increase and the dominance of pseudomonas 16 0 relatively decreased although mixing high sand water hsw and brackish water ssw in equal volume reduced both the sediment and salinity in the water source the contents and types of plfas increased and the coupling effect of biological physical chemical clogging was enhanced consequently the operating life of mxw decreased by 8 9 22 0 but it s still slightly longer than those of hso without significant difference which again verified lateral flushing was an effective way to deal with clogging issue li et al 2015 puig bargue s et al 2010 on the other hand h and d in 4 treatments all showed positive correlations with the q only h in mxw treatment also had negative correlations with v this was mainly because q directly determined the water nutrition and microorganisms entered the emitter per unit time the complexity of microorganism community in clogging substances was highly related to those substances in the water source zhou et al 2016a in the mxw treatment more microorganisms showed patterns and coupling effect larger v meant higher turbulence inside emitter flow path feng et al 2018 and due to larger water shear force microorganisms were more likely to detach along with the clogging substances chang et al 1991 nicolella et al 1996 under this condition the dominance index of the microorganism community decreased as microorganism was much harder to maintain their superiority in amounts meanwhile the randomness of microorganism detachment resulted in lower evenness in mxw treatment although microorganism played important role in hsw and hso treatments solid particles still occupied most of the clogging substances the solid particles could deposit more stable on the internal surface of longer flow path and led to higher evenness of the microorganism community then the similar reason could explain why j in ssw treatment had positive correlation with d in conclusion meaningful results were acquired in this paper based on the experiment however there were still some issues to study in the future 1 the experiment was carried out with high sand water brackish water and their mixed water and resulted in significant differences in microorganism community variations among them studies with more high sand water sources are required for further analysis 2 integrating high throughput sequencing testing methods to proceed more comprehensive and detailed analysis of microorganism community variation during the whole clogging process 5 conclusions for the 4 water sources applied in this paper which always represented as physical clogging and chemical clogging there were large amounts of microorganisms measured using plfas analysis method in the clogging substances the plfas contents all showed significant positive linear correlations with cd r2 0 89 p 0 05 which indicated direct impacts on emitters clogging process more than 10 types of plfas were identified in the clogging substances among which pseudomonas 16 0 and heavy pyrolysis hydrogen bacillus 18 0 were fully distributed during the whole clogging process and they occupied 66 0 87 0 of the total content as their proportions were also significantly correlated to cd r2 0 72 p 0 05 they were regarded as the critical bacteria in clogging process they both belonged to the gram positive bacteria and needed to be focused on during the regular maintenance of the drip irrigation system accordingly the ecological parameters of microorganism community all showed significant quadratic patterns with cd r2 0 56 p 0 05 when cd was 25 30 the minimum h and j were obtained as 0 81 1 07 and 0 65 0 73 separately while d reached the maximum value of 0 54 0 64 it s possible to control the emitter clogging based on the variation characteristics and controlling the corresponding ecological parameters of the microorganism community unlike what we imagined mixing hsw and ssw in equal volume increased the plfas contents and emitter clogging degree although the sand and salt concentrations were reduced this was mainly because of the microorganisms enhanced the physical chemical biological coupling interaction which offered one alert to the low quality water application acknowledgements we are grateful for the financial support from the national key research project of china 2017yfd0201504 and the national

11043,poly γ glutamic acid γ pga is a promising environmentally friendly non toxic biodegradable and super water absorbable polymer using γ pga in agriculture is of great significance to promote crop growth save irrigation water and cope with water scarcity problems the objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of application of different γ pga amounts on soil water storage cotton growth water use efficiency wue cotton yield and fiber quality under plastic mulched drip irrigation conditions a 2 year potted experiment in a cotton field were conducted in the sandy soil of southern xinjiang china five different amounts of γ pga consisted of 0 kg ha 1 p0 20 kg ha 1 p20 40 kg ha 1 p40 80 kg ha 1 p80 and 160 kg ha 1 p160 were applied to these potted plots all treatments were arranged in a randomized block designed with three replicates the result showed that using γ pga significantly increased soil water storage and soil profile water content in the 0 40 cm soil layers compared to p0 γ pga significantly increased cotton stem diameter boll numbers per plant plant height and leaf area index compared to the p0 furthermore cotton yield was significantly increased as well as wue and fiber length however no influence was found on the fiber quality of cotton quadratic relationships were found between the different amount of γ pga applied and wue and between the different applied amounts of γ pga and seed cotton yield high wue 7 48 8 19 kg ha 1 mm 1 and cotton yield 4376 4682 5 kg ha 1 were obtained under the p80 treatment the study suggested that γ pga improved soil water holding capacity promoted cotton growth and enhanced wue and cotton yield therefore these results recommend using γ pga at a dose of 80 kg ha 1 for dealing with drought conditions in the sandy soil of southern xinjiang china keywords poly γ glutamic acid water use efficiency cotton sandy soil fiber quality 1 introduction the agriculture of xinjiang is based on cotton as the main cash crop and the region is one of the most important irrigated agriculture production regions of china hou et al 2009 wang et al 2011 2012 due to the typical continental desert climate the region regularly suffers from extreme climatic conditions boyer and westgate 2004 xu et al 2010 haddeland et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 for example the average annual rainfall is below 80 mm while the average annual potential evaporation is above 2700 mm tan et al 2017 irrigation is an indispensable agricultural management measure because of this large difference between evaporation and precipitation cotton yield is a direct guarantee for farmers to obtain economic benefits however the cultivated field in xinjiang is dominated by sandy soil with poor water holding capacity thus excessive amounts of irrigation water are used by farmers to ensure maximum yield leading to low economic return and wue tan et al 2017 kang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 studies showed that the improvement of wue and grain yield in xinjiang depended on efficient water conserving measures and effective use of limited water resources deng et al 2006 zhou et al 2012 recently high crop yields and large wue have been realized by applying water saving superabsorbent polymers wsaps to arid and semiarid regions güneş et al 2016 banedjschafie et al 2015 mahalleh et al 2011 and nazarli et al 2010 a large number of wsaps were used for agricultural production such as sodium polyacrylate and polyacrylamide pam for example geesing and schmidhalter 2004 reported that sodium polyacrylate enhanced crop growth and increased soil water retention however its degradation products contained sodium ions which likely increase the risk of soil hardening and secondary salinization feigin et al 1991 rasouli et al 2013 moreover studies indicated that polyacrylamide pam was an effective wsap and significantly increased crop yield levy et al 1991 wei et al 2011 however guo et al 2012 reported that its degradation product was a toxic acrylamide monomer am which was harmful to microorganisms when it was applied in natural environments therefore finding an environmentally friendly water saving superabsorbent polymer is essential to maintain the sustainable development of agriculture a study by ogunleye et al 2015 reported poly γ glutamic acid γ pga as a very promising polymer with non immunogenic non toxic and biodegradable properties due to these properties it has been successfully applied to various fields such as the food industry lim et al 2012 bhat et al 2013 cosmetics ben zur and goldman 2007 medicine tsao et al 2011 stephen et al 2012 and wastewater treatment hajdu et al 2012 many scientists found that γ pga could be used for various purposes e g as super water absorbing agent soil conditioner and fertilizer synergist in the field of agriculture for example gonzales et al 1996 reported that γ pga in water saturation could form a hydrogel which was wrapped in the surface of plant seeds to promote germination seedling growth and development and played an active role in the soilless cultivation and nursery stock transplantation a study by doran and zeiss 2000 showed that γ pga had the ability to effectively balance the acidity and alkalinity of the soil while avoiding acidification and compaction of the soil caused by long term use of chemical fertilizers tarui et al 2005 reported that the addition of γ pga to soil could promote the formation of soil aggregates and prevent soil erosion some studies showed that γ pga effectively suppressed cucumber wilts wang et al 2008 and a fertilizer synergist significantly improved the shoot length and dry weight of watermelon seedlings yao et al 2012 most importantly studies reported by sung et al 2005 and ho et al 2010 found γ pga was a super water absorbable polymer with the ability to absorb thousands of times more water than its own weight if the ability of γ pga would be used in arid regions γ pga would be likened to a miniature reservoir moreover bajaj et al 2011 and cesaro et al 2014 reported that the degradation product of γ pga was glutamate which is non toxic and harmless to humans and the environment γ pga can serve as an environmentally friendly water saving super water absorbable polymer at present shi et al 2015 reported that the addition of γ pga to soil could improve the soil water holding capacity and increase the soil moisture content zhai et al 2013 also reported that γ pga promoted the accumulation of dry matter and increased boll numbers per plant and single boll weight despite all the above few study focused on the effects of γ pga on soil water holding capacity wue and grain yield γ pga is an environmentally friendly super water absorbable polymer which may have a high potential to improve soil water holding capacity wue and crop yield therefore our study focused on the relationships and influencing effects between the amount of γ pga applied and the resulting soil water storage soil profile moisture cotton growth wue cotton yield and fiber length and the resulting coping with drought conditions in particular our study aimed to 1 investigate the effects of γ pga on soil water storage and the distribution of soil profile moisture during the 2015 and 2016 cotton growing seasons 2 evaluate the influences of different amounts of γ pga applied on the growth of cotton seed wue cotton yield and fiber length 3 determine the optimal amount of γ pga applied to obtain maximum wue and cotton yield in the sandy soil of southern xinjiang china 2 materials and methods 2 1 details of experimental site and potted experiment the potted experiments in a cotton field were conducted from 10 april to 15 september 2015 and from 15 april to 14 september 2016 respectively at the bazhou irrigation experiment station 41 36 n 86 12 e 901 m a s l in korla city xinjiang province northwest china fig 1 the station has a continental desert climate with a mean annual temperature and total sunshine duration of 11 48 c and 3036 h respectively the mean annual precipitation was 70 mm in the area whereas the mean annual potential evaporation was approximately 2788 mm tan et al 2017 thus water loss caused by evaporation was extraordinarily severe each potted plot consisted of a rectangular soil box system with lengths widths and heights of 210 140 and 110 cm respectively fig 2 a b the boundaries of the soil box system consisted of four pieces of polyethylene sheets which were designed to limit the lateral migration of soil water and solute the soil box system was buried in the middle of a nearby cotton field the buried depth of the soil box system is 100 cm fig 2b the plastic plate at the outer boundary of the soil box system was 10 cm above the surface of the cotton field there were many drainage holes in the 10 cm plastic plate on the one hand these holes were blocked by rubber stoppers to prevent the irrigation water in the cotton field from flowing into the soil box system fig 2b on the other hand if surface runoff occurred in the potted plots during irrigation these rubber stoppers would be removed to facilitate surface runoff into the outer area of the potted plots through these drainage holes for eliminating surface runoff the cotton field areas outside the potted plots were managed by local farmers who used their drip irrigation system to irrigate the area experimental soil in the soil box system was collected from the cotton field the physical and chemical properties of the experimental soil in the cotton field were showed in table 1 according to the table 1 average bulk density in 0 60 cm soil layer was 1 6 g cm 3 thus the soil samples were collected from the soil in 0 60 cm soil layer in the cotton field then soil samples were air dried and sieved through a 2 mm screen and then compacted into every soil box system in 20 cm thick layers at the field bulk density of 1 6 g cm 3 all soil box systems were equally irrigated before the trial to ensure identical initial conditions cotton seeds were sowed on the 20 april 2015 and 25 april 2016 and harvested from september to november 2015 and 2016 respectively the planting pattern in the whole potted area was the same as the cotton planting pattern in the field the drip line arrangement and cotton planting in the whole potted area were referred to as the one mulch two drip lines and four rows of cotton arrangement indicating that two drip lines beneath the mulch were located in the middle of narrow rows zone fig 2a b the width of the mulch was 110 cm the wide rows zone was 40 cm the narrow rows zone was 20 cm and the no mulch zone was 30 cm fig 2a b the one mulch two drip lines and four rows mode which was the only style in the whole potted region could conveniently provide irrigation water for the roots and reduce deep percolation the irrigation water originated from groundwater the electrical conductivity ec of groundwater was 2 8 3 1 ms cm 1 and so it could be considered as brackish water the irrigation schedule in 2015 and 2016 is summarized in table 2 the total irrigation amounts were 435 mm and 412 5 mm during the 2015 and 2016 entire cotton growing season respectively our irrigation schedule was determined by local farmers who scheduled irrigation each year according to their own experiment however farmers scheduled more irrigation water each irrigation event during the growing period of cotton in order to achieve the purpose of saving water and adapting to local conditions our irrigation was scheduled by 80 of irrigation amount determined by farmer s experience at each irrigation event table 2 2 2 poly γ glutamic acid γ pga is edible and non toxic for humans and the environment and is a water soluble biodegradable high molecular weight polymer shi et al 2015 γ pga with high molecular weight of 20 thousands was selected for experiments as it functions as a super absorbent polymer and moisturizing agent and is produced by xi an realin biotechnology co ltd 2 3 experimental design five different amounts of γ pga consisted of 0 kg ha 1 p0 20 kg ha 1 p20 40 kg ha 1 p40 80 kg ha 1 p80 and 160 kg ha 1 p160 were applied to these potted plots all treatments were arranged in a randomized block designed with three replicates each potted plot was equipped with an independent gravity type irrigation system which consisted of a plastic barrel 300 l a ball valve a main pipe two drip tapes and a steel frame with a height of 1 8 m the plastic barrel filled irrigation water was placed on the steel frame to maintain adequate water pressure in the irrigation system the ball valve was installed at the bottom of the barrel to control the irrigation amount moreover the cotton field areas outside the potted plots were managed by local farmers who used their drip irrigation system to irrigate the area 2 4 agronomic practices the potted experiments in the cotton field were conducted during the entire cotton growing season of 2015 and 2016 γ pga and dry soil were firstly mixed with the above mentioned five different application amounts of γ pga the mixed soil samples were uniformly applied to the surface soil in the potted plot before the time of plowing and then uniformly buried under the surface soil via plowing 0 40 cm soil layer was plowed in these potted plots after plowing 0 40 cm soil layer we re measured the soil bulk density of the 0 40 cm soil layer in the potted plots and the soil bulk density was 1 53 g cm 3 cotton seeds were sowed after γ pga application local agronomic operation such as fertilizer was followed for each potted plot nitrogen p and k were applied at 300 105 27 kg ha 1 respectively organic fertilizer with organic matter content above 45 was applied at 450 kg ha 1 as base fertilizer to the whole potted plot the amount of fertilizer applied was in accordance with agronomic operation of local farmers according to their local experience before each irrigation contents of urea phosphate and potassium dihydrogen phosphate corresponding to the growth of cotton were added into the barrel to apply fertilizer to the irrigation water 2 5 measurements 2 5 1 soil water retention characteristics swrcs measurement swrcs were obtained commonly by the centrifuge method xing and ma 2017 tan et al 2016 khanzode et al 2002 soil samples were collected from xinjiang the physical and chemical properties of the soil samples were showed in table 1 the soil samples treated by four different γ pga application rates 0 control 3 6 and 1 2 were compacted into cutting rings 100 cm3 at the designed bulk density of 1 6 g cm 3 then saturated in distilled water for 48 h then the soil samples were placed into a centrifuge h 1400pf japan to determine the data for soil water content and pressure head then the swrcs were expressed as soil suction h versus volumetric soil moisture θ the speed and equilibrium time for each tested the pressure head h were listed in table 3 2 5 2 measurement and calibration of soil moisture volumetric soil moisture contents at the soil profile 0 100 cm of wide rows and narrow rows were monitored in each potted plot from the second day after each irrigation to the day before the next irrigation for 5 days using the pr2 soil moisture monitoring system pr2 6 ward precision technology co ltd u k pr2 was a sensor based on frequency domain reflection fdr technology and it could be used in conjunction with the dl6 data collector to achieve continuous dynamic monitoring of soil moisture the measurement depths of the pr2 were 10 20 30 40 60 and 100 cm respectively five tubes of pr2 measured soil moisture were buried in the narrow row and wide row zone of each potted plot at 15 cm intervals and the monitored locations of the pr2 are shown in fig 2b the monitored soil water contents were calibrated via an oven drying method close to the profiles of the monitored locations of the pr2 soil samples were collected with a manual auger in the wide rows and narrow rows of each potted plot moreover the holes after taking soil samples were backfilled with spare soil the depths of soil samples were 0 10 20 30 40 60 80 and 100 cm respectively all soil samples were dried to a constant weight at 105 c and then the soil water contents were measured via the gravimetric method the volumetric soil moisture contents monitored via pr2 and the estimated soil water contents via oven drying were regressed into a significant linear equation y 0 7646x 2 2378 r² 0 6032 n 540 p 0 01 which was used to calibrate all measurements of soil water content fig 3 a typical irrigation event at blossoming and boll forming stage was chosen to obtain the detailed dynamics of soil moisture content the date of soil moisture contents for consecutive 19 days were monitored via pr2 and the changes of soil water storage were calculated every day during the consecutive 19 days 2 5 3 precipitation and air temperature a davis wireless vantage pro2 weather station davis instruments califonia usa was used to monitor microclimatic factors such as precipitation air temperature solar radiation and wind speed 2 5 4 plant growth yield and fiber quality assessments during the entire cotton growing seasons of 2015 and 2016 six plants were randomly selected per potted plot and marked for measuring of plant height and leaf area seed cotton was manually harvested at crop maturity for each potted plot to determine the cotton yield at harvest time seed cotton samples were selected from the middle rows of the potted plots these samples were transported to the institute of agricultural quality standards and detection technology xinjiang academy of agricultural sciences iaqsdtxaas to obtain cotton fiber quality such as fiber length fl mm fiber strength fs g tex 1 micronaire mr fiber fineness and uniformity index ui the fiber quality index fqi was a useful parameter reflecting the technological value of cotton and fqi fl fs ui mr 2 6 calculation methods 2 6 1 evapotranspiration evapotranspiration et was calculated via the water balance method 1 e t s w c p i g r 0 d p where swc represents the change of soil water storage in 100 cm soil during growing season mm wang et al 2009 p represents the precipitation mm i represents the irrigation amount mm g represents the groundwater recharge mm r0 represents the surface runoff mm dp represents the amount of water loss due to deep drainage mm here the groundwater level in the test area was below 7 5 m rainfall was small and the plots were flat therefore g r0 and dp were negligible in this study respectively consequently eq 1 can be rewritten as 2 e t s w c p i 2 6 2 soil water storage soil water storage sws can be defined as the amount of water stored in the soil it can be expressed as 3 s w s θ 0 10 c m 10 θ 10 20 c m 10 θ 60 100 c m 40 10 θ 0 10 c m 1 2 θ w 0 10 c m θ n 0 10 c m θ 10 20 c m 1 2 θ w 10 20 c

moisture content of wide and narrow rows in 0 10 cm soil layer cm3 cm 3 respectively the average soil moisture content of other soil layers is similar to that of the above mentioned expression 2 6 3 water use efficiency at harvest time the cotton of every pot was harvested and air dried yield was then calculated according to the area of the whole pot wue was calculated as cotton yield in kg ha 1 divided by the total water use i e et in mm water use efficiency was calculated as follows 4 wue y e t where wue represents the water use efficiency kg ha 1 mm 1 y represents the cotton yield kg ha 1 et is the same as in eq 1 2 6 4 van genuchten model the van genuchten model was proposed by van genuchten 1980 these equations are given as follows 5 θ θ θ s θ r 1 1 α h n m h 0 6 θ θ s h 0 where h soil water pressure head cm θ water content cm3 cm 3 θr the residual water content cm3 cm 3 θs saturated water content cm3 cm 3 α coefficient associated with intake value n shape coefficient and m 1 1 n and when h is equal to 33kpa h 336 5 cm and 1500kpa h 15 295 8 cm respectively the soil moisture content is the field water holding capacity fc θfc cm3 cm 3 and the permanent wilting point pwp θpwp cm3 cm 3 moreover the total available water content taw is equal to fc minus pwp the parameters of van genuchten model were estimated by using the retention curve code retc van genuchten et al 1991 2 7 statistical analyses the relationships between the soil moisture contents monitored via pr2 and the measured soil water contents monitored via oven drying were determined via linear regression analysis method at p 0 01 analysis of variance anova was performed via spss 17 0 multiple comparisons were performed using duncan s test to determine the mean differences in the soil water storage of different soil layers stem diameter boll numbers per plant fruit branches numbers lai plant height cotton fiber quality yield and wue among γ pga treatments 3 results 3 1 weather conditions fig 4 shows the meteorological data for precipitation and daily mean air temperatures in the study area during the cotton growing seasons of 2015 and 2016 in addition to the abnormal precipitation on july 11 2016 rainfall was similar during these cotton growing periods the total rainfall during cotton growing periods was only 62 2 mm in 2015 and 82 0 mm in 2016 the data indicated rare rainfall in both years which could not meet the growing needs of crops the daily mean air temperatures during the cotton growing seasons varied between 14 c and 32 c in 2015 and 2016 and the largest daily mean air temperature was 31 7 c in 2015 and 32 1 c in 2016 fig 4 from seedling to harvesting stage the average air temperatures were 22 4 c in 2015 and 23 c in 2016 fig 4 the daily mean air temperatures during the cotton growing seasons were above 20 c for 119 days in 2015 and for 125 days in 2016 accounting for 82 07 and 86 21 respectively these variations indicated that the study area had long been affected by extreme drought therefore water saving irrigation was essential for crop growth 3 2 effects of γ pga on soil water retention characteristics the swrcs reflected the fundamental relationship between the matric potential and volumetric soil water content the relationship can reflect clearly soil water holding capacity the swrcs were measured at the four different γ pga concentrations in fig 5 and table 4 the volumetric water content was slightly higher for soil with adding γ pga than that of soil without adding γ pga fig 5 the saturated volumetric water content residual water content fc pwp and taw was higher for soil with adding γ pga than that of soil without adding γ pga respectively table 4 these results indicated γ pga can improve soil water holding capacity 3 3 effects of γ pga on soil moisture the dynamic change of the sws for 19 consecutive days in different soil layers showed the effect of applying γ pga on the sws in sandy soil fig 6 during both years the sws varied with the applied amount of γ pga and soil depth the sws for 19 consecutive days in 0 60 cm soil layer was always large because the depth of infiltration under mulched drip irrigation was within the range of the 0 60 cm soil layer however in the 0 40 cm soil layer the sws was greater in γ pga treatments than that of the p0 treatment without adding γ pga p 0 05 and first increased and then decreased with increasing γ pga amount in 2015 and 2016 fig 6a 6d the difference of the sws in γ pga treatments was significant p 0 05 the application of γ pga mainly caused a difference of sws in the 0 40 cm soil layer however in the subsoil layers 40 60 cm depth the difference decreased and disappeared in the deep soil layers 60 100 cm fig 6b 6c 6e 6f fig 7 shows changes of soil moisture content in soil profile 0 100 cm after the irrigation events the soil moisture content at a depth of 0 100 cm was large on april 25 2015 five days after planting and may 1 2016 six days after planting fig 7a 7b respectively due to pre sowing irrigation management the soil moisture content at a depth of 0 100 cm was lower on june 13 2015 and june 20 2016 fig 7a 7b from the end of april or early may to mid june onwards cotton emerged and entered the seedling stage and soil moisture content significantly decreased in the stage this may be due to the following reasons spring irrigation was carried out in mid april there was sufficient soil moisture in cotton field to promote cotton germination after cotton sowing in late april or early may soil moisture in the cotton field was high in late april or early may thus the potted plots were not irrigated from the end of april or early may to mid june onwards however the air temperature in xinjiang was high during the period and the water holding capacity of sandy soil was poor moreover on the one hand although it was covered by mulch in the potted plots there was still a certain opening degree on the mulch on the other hand there were no mulch strips in the potted plots thus evaporation loss of soil moisture was high furthermore cotton germination and seedling growth required considerable soil moisture supply in the growth period therefore these reasons might result in a decrease in soil moisture during the stage one day after irrigated 45 mm at july 9 2015 and july 21 2016 soil moisture content in the top 0 40 cm layer was larger in γ pga treatments than that of the p0 fig 7c d then four days after irrigated 45 mm at july 12 2015 and july 24 2016 soil water content for all treatments decreased however the soil moisture content in the 0 40 cm soil depth was still larger in γ pga treatments compared to p0 in fig 7c d fig 7e f also show a similar result in the top 40 layer the difference between soil water content in γ pga treatments and that of the p0 was significant however in the subsoil layers 40 60 cm depth the difference decreased and disappeared in the deep soil layers 60 100 cm these results implied that the application of γ pga increased the sws and soil profile water content in the 0 40 cm soil layer and reduced the loss of soil water while prolonging the soil water retention time after each irrigation event 3 4 effects of γ pga on yield compositions of cotton plant height and lai γ pga application significantly p 0 05 affected cotton stem diameter and boll number per plant table 5 compared to the p0 stem diameter increased by 0 68 18 2 3 68 and 2 46 in 2015 and by 3 7 14 7 24 8 and 0 25 in 2016 for p20 p40 p80 and p160 respectively maximal boll numbers per plant were obtained at the p40 treatment in 2015 and p80 treatment in 2016 respectively with boll numbers per plant in the order of p40 p80 p20 p160 p0 in 2015 p80 p40 p20 p160 p0 in 2016 compared to p0 treatment boll numbers per plant increased by 20 7 58 6 31 and 13 8 in 2015 and 25 28 6 60 7 and 10 7 in 2016 respectively for p20 p40 p80 and p160 during both years the effects of γ pga application on the plant height and lai of cotton were not significant at seedling and squaring stage but was significant p 0 05 at flowering stage and bolls and boll opening stage fig 8 in addition with increasing cotton plant height the leaf area index showed a trend of single peak curve however the time of lai peak appearance in p40 and p80 treatments differed from that of p0 p20 and p160 treatments in 2015 and 2016 in 2015 lai peak in p40 and p80 treatments occurred about 23 days later for p0 p20 and p160 treatments in 2016 the lai peak in p40 and p80 treatments occurred about 20 days later for p0 p20 and p160 treatments during the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons lai and plant height were lower in the p0 treatment than that of applying γ pga treatments and the maximal lai and plant height were obtained in p40 and p80 treatments these results implied that γ pga significantly p 0 05 promoted cotton growth 3 5 effects of γ pga on cotton yield and wue γ pga significantly increased p 0 05 seed cotton yield and wue during the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons table 6 seed cotton yields and wue were larger in γ pga treatments than that of the p0 treatment without γ pga application p 0 05 in 2015 and 2016 largest seed yields were obtained with the p80 treatment in 2015 and the p40 in 2016 respectively the lowest in p0 table 6 compared to p0 treatment seed cotton yields increased by 5 2 19 3 16 1 and 7 1 in 2015 and 4 06 17 7 15 9 and 9 1 in 2016 respectively for p20 p40 p80 and p160 table 6 in 2015 and 2016 the maximum wue was achieved at the p80 treatment with wue in the order of p80 p40 p20 p160 p0 in 2015 and 80 p40 p160 p20 p0 in 2016 in 2015 wue was 21 3 in p80 18 2 in p40 7 9 in p20 and 4 9 in p160 significantly larger than in the p0 p 0 05 respectively in 2016 wue was 19 7 in p80 16 6 in p40 9 2 in p160 and 7 3 in p20 p 0 05 significantly higher than the p0 table 6 respectively we found the relationships between the applied amount of γ pga and seed cotton yield and between the applied amount of γ pga and wue could be described with quadratic curves fig 9 seed cotton yield and wue first increased and then decreased with increasing applied amount of γ pga especially the yield and wue for the p160 treatment significantly decreased compared to that of the p80 when taking optimal cotton yield and wue we found that the optimal yield and wue were approximately obtained in the p80 treatment by analyzing the quadratic curves 3 6 effects of γ pga on cotton fiber quality effects of γ pga on fiber quality of cotton are shown in table 7 the application of γ pga did not affect cotton fiber quality parameters micronaire strength uniformity index and fiber quality index in 2015 and 2016 but fiber length was significantly influenced in 2015 p 0 05 by γ pga table 7 compared to p0 treatment fiber length increased by 1 23 2 9 1 9 and 1 71 in 2015 for p20 p40 p80 and p160 respectively 4 discussion in the current study we hypothesized the potential ability of γ pga to improve soil water holding capacity and increase wue and yield in sandy soil of southern xinjiang china our data presented in figs 5 9 and tables 4 7 supports these hypotheses for example in 2015 and 2016 we found that γ pga can significantly increase soil water storage and soil water content in soil profile in 0 40 cm soil depth compared to p0 treatment without adding γ pga figs 6 and 7 moreover the application of γ pga can also significantly promote the growth of cotton fig 8 and increase the stem diameter by 0 25 24 8 number of bolls per plant by 10 7 60 7 table 5 fiber length by 1 23 2 9 table 7 seed cotton yields by 4 06 19 3 and wue by 4 9 21 3 compared to p0 treatment table 6 in the 2 yr potted experiments in the cotton field the average amount of irrigation for all treatments p0 p20 p40 p80 and p160 was 412 5 435 mm during the entire cotton growing season high seed cotton yield in γ pga treatments was 4445 5 4682 5 kg ha 1 correspondingly high wue 1 02 1 14 kg m 3 in contrast the amount of irrigation obtained by local farmers was approximately 580 620 mm during the entire cotton growing season seed cotton yields obtained by the farmers without using γ pga in cotton field were about 5250 6000 kg ha 1 thus wue of local farmers without applying γ pga was 0 85 1 03 kg m 3 compared to the local irrigation practice without using γ pga wue applied γ pga in cotton field was almost 1 35 times higher than that of local farmers the application of γ pga can save up to 20 35 water moreover compared to the yield and wue obtained by the local farmers yield in γ pga treatments was slightly lower but the γ pga treatments obtained the largest wue in our study experimental soil was sandy soil with low water holding capacity grant et al 2017 reported that cotton yield decreased with apparent over irrigation in the low water holding capacity soil therefore the amount of irrigation was high for local farmers who received optimal cotton yield but they don t receive optimal wue moreover grant et al 2017 observed that cotton yields were unaffected by irrigation in high water holding capacity soil and optimal yields were obtained by optimizing irrigation amount in our study γ pga improved water holding capacity of sandy soil compared to the soil without adding γ pga thus we recommended local farmers to use γ pga in cotton field for saving irrigation water and achieving optical cotton yield for different application amounts of γ pga cotton yield and wue were increased for the high amount of γ pga however the p80 treatment obtained the highest yield and wue in both years instead of the p160 treatment fig 9 yield and wue of the p160 treatment were reduced by 9 5 and 16 1 respectively compared to the p80 treatment these results may be attributed to the following influencing effects of γ pga on soil water movement on the one hand γ pga was able to form a hydrogel after saturation with absorbed water gonzales et al 1996 montesano et al 2015 reported that the hydrogel had the function of storing irrigation water it can serve as a miniature reservoir and ameliorating water availability for plants therefore in the current study compared to the p0 treatment without using γ pga in cotton field γ pga increased the sws and soil moisture content in 0 40 cm soil depth figs 6 and 7 promoted the growth of cotton lai plant height stem diameter fruit branches numbers and boll numbers per plant fig 8 and table 5 and improved cotton yield and wue on the other hand according to the analysis of the effect of different γ pga application rates on soil water retention characteristics we thought that γ pga might absorb a part of soil moisture and store the moisture in itself and the stored moisture could not be used by crop for example the saturated volumetric water content residual water content fc pwp and total available soil water content taw were higher for soil with adding γ pga than that of soil without adding γ pga table 4 however taw was the highest in 0 6 γ pga application amount and taw was lower for 1 2 γ pga application amount than that of 0 6 γ pga application amount the result indicated that adding excess γ pga to the soil might reduce the taw thus reducing crop yields this was consistent with the results of montesano et al 2015 therefore yield and wue of the p160 decreased compared to that of the p80 this may imply that the suitable application amount of γ pga the p80 treatment 80 kg ha 1 can improve cotton yield and wue similar studies reported that γ pga effectively suppressed crop wilts wang et al 2008 and significantly improved shoot length and dry weight of crop seedlings yao et al 2012 moreover zhai et al 2013 reported that γ pga could also be used as fertilizer synergist which increased dry matter accumulation of cotton reproductive organs and seed cotton yield when it was applied at 70 of the conventional amount thus in the current study the increase of cotton yield and wue may be partly explained by the synergistic fertilizer effect of γ pga yao et al 2012 however the synergistic mechanisms between γ pga and fertilizer remain unclear and our future studies will focus on this point furthermore ogunleye et al 2015 reported that γ pga was a biodegradable polymer thus fertilizer synergistic and super absorbent capacity of γ pga depended on its biodegradability properties the time dependent properties of γ pga should be thoroughly investigated in the future bradow and davidonis 2000 suggested that fiber quality was mainly influenced by genotype however cotton fiber length depended on the duration of water stress papastylianou et al 2014 and moisture shortage shortly bradow and davidonis 2000 balkcom et al 2006 dağdelen et al 2009 during the fiber elongation stage in this study the increase of fiber length may be due to γ pga contributing to improving soil water holding capacity and thus increasing soil water content the application of γ pga played an important role in improving the soil water holding capacity cotton yield and wue the optimal application amount of γ pga is usually proposed to take these components into account in our experiments the relationships between cotton yield and the amount of γ pga application and between wue and the amount of γ pga applied followed quadratic curves fig 9 the determinate coefficients of the two curves were 0 8 and 0 69 for cotton yield and wue respectively the γ pga production function fig 9 for different treatments showed that the highest yield and highest wue were obtained at a γ pga application amount of 90 kg ha 1 and 80 kg ha 1 respectively compared to a dose of 90 kg γ pga ha 1 the p80 treatment a dose of 80 kg γ pga ha 1 can obtain the highest wue with acceptable yield decrease from 4599 9 kg ha 1 to 4589 1 kg ha 1 in our study the quadratic relationships indicated 80 kg ha 1 as an optimal application amount of γ pga for plastic mulched drip irrigation in sandy soil at the southern xinjiang china 5 conclusions under plastic mulched drip irrigation conditions wue and yield of cotton were noticeably affected by different amounts of applied γ pga in the sandy soil in southern xinjiang china during the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons compared to the p0 treatment using γ pga led to higher seed cotton yield and wue seed cotton yields were 4 06 19 3 greater and wues were 4 9 21 3 higher respectively than for treatments without using γ pga moreover γ pga treatments significantly increased boll numbers per plant stem diameter lai and plant height and enhanced cotton fiber length but did not affect cotton quality seed cotton yield and wue were analyzed via the γ pga production function fig 9 for different treatments during both years we found that the p80 treatment a dose of 80 kg γ pga ha 1 can obtain the highest wue and yield compared to a dose of 90 kg γ pga ha 1 therefore when using the γ pga super absorbent polymer a dose of 80 kg γ pga ha 1 was recommended for promoting the growth of cotton improving soil water holding capacity and increasing cotton yield wue and cotton fiber length in the sandy soil of southern xinjiang china moreover in xinjiang agricultural areas where rainfall is scarce and freshwater resources are scarce we recommend that the application of brackish irrigation water maybe be also regarded as an effective solution to copy with the shortage of freshwater resources and precipitation deficit acknowledgements this study was supported by the national natural science foundation of china no 51379173 the key laboratory

11043,poly γ glutamic acid γ pga is a promising environmentally friendly non toxic biodegradable and super water absorbable polymer using γ pga in agriculture is of great significance to promote crop growth save irrigation water and cope with water scarcity problems the objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of application of different γ pga amounts on soil water storage cotton growth water use efficiency wue cotton yield and fiber quality under plastic mulched drip irrigation conditions a 2 year potted experiment in a cotton field were conducted in the sandy soil of southern xinjiang china five different amounts of γ pga consisted of 0 kg ha 1 p0 20 kg ha 1 p20 40 kg ha 1 p40 80 kg ha 1 p80 and 160 kg ha 1 p160 were applied to these potted plots all treatments were arranged in a randomized block designed with three replicates the result showed that using γ pga significantly increased soil water storage and soil profile water content in the 0 40 cm soil layers compared to p0 γ pga significantly increased cotton stem diameter boll numbers per plant plant height and leaf area index compared to the p0 furthermore cotton yield was significantly increased as well as wue and fiber length however no influence was found on the fiber quality of cotton quadratic relationships were found between the different amount of γ pga applied and wue and between the different applied amounts of γ pga and seed cotton yield high wue 7 48 8 19 kg ha 1 mm 1 and cotton yield 4376 4682 5 kg ha 1 were obtained under the p80 treatment the study suggested that γ pga improved soil water holding capacity promoted cotton growth and enhanced wue and cotton yield therefore these results recommend using γ pga at a dose of 80 kg ha 1 for dealing with drought conditions in the sandy soil of southern xinjiang china keywords poly γ glutamic acid water use efficiency cotton sandy soil fiber quality 1 introduction the agriculture of xinjiang is based on cotton as the main cash crop and the region is one of the most important irrigated agriculture production regions of china hou et al 2009 wang et al 2011 2012 due to the typical continental desert climate the region regularly suffers from extreme climatic conditions boyer and westgate 2004 xu et al 2010 haddeland et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 for example the average annual rainfall is below 80 mm while the average annual potential evaporation is above 2700 mm tan et al 2017 irrigation is an indispensable agricultural management measure because of this large difference between evaporation and precipitation cotton yield is a direct guarantee for farmers to obtain economic benefits however the cultivated field in xinjiang is dominated by sandy soil with poor water holding capacity thus excessive amounts of irrigation water are used by farmers to ensure maximum yield leading to low economic return and wue tan et al 2017 kang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 studies showed that the improvement of wue and grain yield in xinjiang depended on efficient water conserving measures and effective use of limited water resources deng et al 2006 zhou et al 2012 recently high crop yields and large wue have been realized by applying water saving superabsorbent polymers wsaps to arid and semiarid regions güneş et al 2016 banedjschafie et al 2015 mahalleh et al 2011 and nazarli et al 2010 a large number of wsaps were used for agricultural production such as sodium polyacrylate and polyacrylamide pam for example geesing and schmidhalter 2004 reported that sodium polyacrylate enhanced crop growth and increased soil water retention however its degradation products contained sodium ions which likely increase the risk of soil hardening and secondary salinization feigin et al 1991 rasouli et al 2013 moreover studies indicated that polyacrylamide pam was an effective wsap and significantly increased crop yield levy et al 1991 wei et al 2011 however guo et al 2012 reported that its degradation product was a toxic acrylamide monomer am which was harmful to microorganisms when it was applied in natural environments therefore finding an environmentally friendly water saving superabsorbent polymer is essential to maintain the sustainable development of agriculture a study by ogunleye et al 2015 reported poly γ glutamic acid γ pga as a very promising polymer with non immunogenic non toxic and biodegradable properties due to these properties it has been successfully applied to various fields such as the food industry lim et al 2012 bhat et al 2013 cosmetics ben zur and goldman 2007 medicine tsao et al 2011 stephen et al 2012 and wastewater treatment hajdu et al 2012 many scientists found that γ pga could be used for various purposes e g as super water absorbing agent soil conditioner and fertilizer synergist in the field of agriculture for example gonzales et al 1996 reported that γ pga in water saturation could form a hydrogel which was wrapped in the surface of plant seeds to promote germination seedling growth and development and played an active role in the soilless cultivation and nursery stock transplantation a study by doran and zeiss 2000 showed that γ pga had the ability to effectively balance the acidity and alkalinity of the soil while avoiding acidification and compaction of the soil caused by long term use of chemical fertilizers tarui et al 2005 reported that the addition of γ pga to soil could promote the formation of soil aggregates and prevent soil erosion some studies showed that γ pga effectively suppressed cucumber wilts wang et al 2008 and a fertilizer synergist significantly improved the shoot length and dry weight of watermelon seedlings yao et al 2012 most importantly studies reported by sung et al 2005 and ho et al 2010 found γ pga was a super water absorbable polymer with the ability to absorb thousands of times more water than its own weight if the ability of γ pga would be used in arid regions γ pga would be likened to a miniature reservoir moreover bajaj et al 2011 and cesaro et al 2014 reported that the degradation product of γ pga was glutamate which is non toxic and harmless to humans and the environment γ pga can serve as an environmentally friendly water saving super water absorbable polymer at present shi et al 2015 reported that the addition of γ pga to soil could improve the soil water holding capacity and increase the soil moisture content zhai et al 2013 also reported that γ pga promoted the accumulation of dry matter and increased boll numbers per plant and single boll weight despite all the above few study focused on the effects of γ pga on soil water holding capacity wue and grain yield γ pga is an environmentally friendly super water absorbable polymer which may have a high potential to improve soil water holding capacity wue and crop yield therefore our study focused on the relationships and influencing effects between the amount of γ pga applied and the resulting soil water storage soil profile moisture cotton growth wue cotton yield and fiber length and the resulting coping with drought conditions in particular our study aimed to 1 investigate the effects of γ pga on soil water storage and the distribution of soil profile moisture during the 2015 and 2016 cotton growing seasons 2 evaluate the influences of different amounts of γ pga applied on the growth of cotton seed wue cotton yield and fiber length 3 determine the optimal amount of γ pga applied to obtain maximum wue and cotton yield in the sandy soil of southern xinjiang china 2 materials and methods 2 1 details of experimental site and potted experiment the potted experiments in a cotton field were conducted from 10 april to 15 september 2015 and from 15 april to 14 september 2016 respectively at the bazhou irrigation experiment station 41 36 n 86 12 e 901 m a s l in korla city xinjiang province northwest china fig 1 the station has a continental desert climate with a mean annual temperature and total sunshine duration of 11 48 c and 3036 h respectively the mean annual precipitation was 70 mm in the area whereas the mean annual potential evaporation was approximately 2788 mm tan et al 2017 thus water loss caused by evaporation was extraordinarily severe each potted plot consisted of a rectangular soil box system with lengths widths and heights of 210 140 and 110 cm respectively fig 2 a b the boundaries of the soil box system consisted of four pieces of polyethylene sheets which were designed to limit the lateral migration of soil water and solute the soil box system was buried in the middle of a nearby cotton field the buried depth of the soil box system is 100 cm fig 2b the plastic plate at the outer boundary of the soil box system was 10 cm above the surface of the cotton field there were many drainage holes in the 10 cm plastic plate on the one hand these holes were blocked by rubber stoppers to prevent the irrigation water in the cotton field from flowing into the soil box system fig 2b on the other hand if surface runoff occurred in the potted plots during irrigation these rubber stoppers would be removed to facilitate surface runoff into the outer area of the potted plots through these drainage holes for eliminating surface runoff the cotton field areas outside the potted plots were managed by local farmers who used their drip irrigation system to irrigate the area experimental soil in the soil box system was collected from the cotton field the physical and chemical properties of the experimental soil in the cotton field were showed in table 1 according to the table 1 average bulk density in 0 60 cm soil layer was 1 6 g cm 3 thus the soil samples were collected from the soil in 0 60 cm soil layer in the cotton field then soil samples were air dried and sieved through a 2 mm screen and then compacted into every soil box system in 20 cm thick layers at the field bulk density of 1 6 g cm 3 all soil box systems were equally irrigated before the trial to ensure identical initial conditions cotton seeds were sowed on the 20 april 2015 and 25 april 2016 and harvested from september to november 2015 and 2016 respectively the planting pattern in the whole potted area was the same as the cotton planting pattern in the field the drip line arrangement and cotton planting in the whole potted area were referred to as the one mulch two drip lines and four rows of cotton arrangement indicating that two drip lines beneath the mulch were located in the middle of narrow rows zone fig 2a b the width of the mulch was 110 cm the wide rows zone was 40 cm the narrow rows zone was 20 cm and the no mulch zone was 30 cm fig 2a b the one mulch two drip lines and four rows mode which was the only style in the whole potted region could conveniently provide irrigation water for the roots and reduce deep percolation the irrigation water originated from groundwater the electrical conductivity ec of groundwater was 2 8 3 1 ms cm 1 and so it could be considered as brackish water the irrigation schedule in 2015 and 2016 is summarized in table 2 the total irrigation amounts were 435 mm and 412 5 mm during the 2015 and 2016 entire cotton growing season respectively our irrigation schedule was determined by local farmers who scheduled irrigation each year according to their own experiment however farmers scheduled more irrigation water each irrigation event during the growing period of cotton in order to achieve the purpose of saving water and adapting to local conditions our irrigation was scheduled by 80 of irrigation amount determined by farmer s experience at each irrigation event table 2 2 2 poly γ glutamic acid γ pga is edible and non toxic for humans and the environment and is a water soluble biodegradable high molecular weight polymer shi et al 2015 γ pga with high molecular weight of 20 thousands was selected for experiments as it functions as a super absorbent polymer and moisturizing agent and is produced by xi an realin biotechnology co ltd 2 3 experimental design five different amounts of γ pga consisted of 0 kg ha 1 p0 20 kg ha 1 p20 40 kg ha 1 p40 80 kg ha 1 p80 and 160 kg ha 1 p160 were applied to these potted plots all treatments were arranged in a randomized block designed with three replicates each potted plot was equipped with an independent gravity type irrigation system which consisted of a plastic barrel 300 l a ball valve a main pipe two drip tapes and a steel frame with a height of 1 8 m the plastic barrel filled irrigation water was placed on the steel frame to maintain adequate water pressure in the irrigation system the ball valve was installed at the bottom of the barrel to control the irrigation amount moreover the cotton field areas outside the potted plots were managed by local farmers who used their drip irrigation system to irrigate the area 2 4 agronomic practices the potted experiments in the cotton field were conducted during the entire cotton growing season of 2015 and 2016 γ pga and dry soil were firstly mixed with the above mentioned five different application amounts of γ pga the mixed soil samples were uniformly applied to the surface soil in the potted plot before the time of plowing and then uniformly buried under the surface soil via plowing 0 40 cm soil layer was plowed in these potted plots after plowing 0 40 cm soil layer we re measured the soil bulk density of the 0 40 cm soil layer in the potted plots and the soil bulk density was 1 53 g cm 3 cotton seeds were sowed after γ pga application local agronomic operation such as fertilizer was followed for each potted plot nitrogen p and k were applied at 300 105 27 kg ha 1 respectively organic fertilizer with organic matter content above 45 was applied at 450 kg ha 1 as base fertilizer to the whole potted plot the amount of fertilizer applied was in accordance with agronomic operation of local farmers according to their local experience before each irrigation contents of urea phosphate and potassium dihydrogen phosphate corresponding to the growth of cotton were added into the barrel to apply fertilizer to the irrigation water 2 5 measurements 2 5 1 soil water retention characteristics swrcs measurement swrcs were obtained commonly by the centrifuge method xing and ma 2017 tan et al 2016 khanzode et al 2002 soil samples were collected from xinjiang the physical and chemical properties of the soil samples were showed in table 1 the soil samples treated by four different γ pga application rates 0 control 3 6 and 1 2 were compacted into cutting rings 100 cm3 at the designed bulk density of 1 6 g cm 3 then saturated in distilled water for 48 h then the soil samples were placed into a centrifuge h 1400pf japan to determine the data for soil water content and pressure head then the swrcs were expressed as soil suction h versus volumetric soil moisture θ the speed and equilibrium time for each tested the pressure head h were listed in table 3 2 5 2 measurement and calibration of soil moisture volumetric soil moisture contents at the soil profile 0 100 cm of wide rows and narrow rows were monitored in each potted plot from the second day after each irrigation to the day before the next irrigation for 5 days using the pr2 soil moisture monitoring system pr2 6 ward precision technology co ltd u k pr2 was a sensor based on frequency domain reflection fdr technology and it could be used in conjunction with the dl6 data collector to achieve continuous dynamic monitoring of soil moisture the measurement depths of the pr2 were 10 20 30 40 60 and 100 cm respectively five tubes of pr2 measured soil moisture were buried in the narrow row and wide row zone of each potted plot at 15 cm intervals and the monitored locations of the pr2 are shown in fig 2b the monitored soil water contents were calibrated via an oven drying method close to the profiles of the monitored locations of the pr2 soil samples were collected with a manual auger in the wide rows and narrow rows of each potted plot moreover the holes after taking soil samples were backfilled with spare soil the depths of soil samples were 0 10 20 30 40 60 80 and 100 cm respectively all soil samples were dried to a constant weight at 105 c and then the soil water contents were measured via the gravimetric method the volumetric soil moisture contents monitored via pr2 and the estimated soil water contents via oven drying were regressed into a significant linear equation y 0 7646x 2 2378 r² 0 6032 n 540 p 0 01 which was used to calibrate all measurements of soil water content fig 3 a typical irrigation event at blossoming and boll forming stage was chosen to obtain the detailed dynamics of soil moisture content the date of soil moisture contents for consecutive 19 days were monitored via pr2 and the changes of soil water storage were calculated every day during the consecutive 19 days 2 5 3 precipitation and air temperature a davis wireless vantage pro2 weather station davis instruments califonia usa was used to monitor microclimatic factors such as precipitation air temperature solar radiation and wind speed 2 5 4 plant growth yield and fiber quality assessments during the entire cotton growing seasons of 2015 and 2016 six plants were randomly selected per potted plot and marked for measuring of plant height and leaf area seed cotton was manually harvested at crop maturity for each potted plot to determine the cotton yield at harvest time seed cotton samples were selected from the middle rows of the potted plots these samples were transported to the institute of agricultural quality standards and detection technology xinjiang academy of agricultural sciences iaqsdtxaas to obtain cotton fiber quality such as fiber length fl mm fiber strength fs g tex 1 micronaire mr fiber fineness and uniformity index ui the fiber quality index fqi was a useful parameter reflecting the technological value of cotton and fqi fl fs ui mr 2 6 calculation methods 2 6 1 evapotranspiration evapotranspiration et was calculated via the water balance method 1 e t s w c p i g r 0 d p where swc represents the change of soil water storage in 100 cm soil during growing season mm wang et al 2009 p represents the precipitation mm i represents the irrigation amount mm g represents the groundwater recharge mm r0 represents the surface runoff mm dp represents the amount of water loss due to deep drainage mm here the groundwater level in the test area was below 7 5 m rainfall was small and the plots were flat therefore g r0 and dp were negligible in this study respectively consequently eq 1 can be rewritten as 2 e t s w c p i 2 6 2 soil water storage soil water storage sws can be defined as the amount of water stored in the soil it can be expressed as 3 s w s θ 0 10 c m 10 θ 10 20 c m 10 θ 60 100 c m 40 10 θ 0 10 c m 1 2 θ w 0 10 c m θ n 0 10 c m θ 10 20 c m 1 2 θ w 10 20 c

water use efficiency at harvest time the cotton of every pot was harvested and air dried yield was then calculated according to the area of the whole pot wue was calculated as cotton yield in kg ha 1 divided by the total water use i e et in mm water use efficiency was calculated as follows 4 wue y e t where wue represents the water use efficiency kg ha 1 mm 1 y represents the cotton yield kg ha 1 et is the same as in eq 1 2 6 4 van genuchten model the van genuchten model was proposed by van genuchten 1980 these equations are given as follows 5 θ θ θ s θ r 1 1 α h n m h 0 6 θ θ s h 0 where h

cm3 cm 3 moreover the total available water content taw is equal to fc minus pwp the parameters of van genuchten model were estimated by using the retention curve code retc van genuchten et al 1991 2 7 statistical analyses the relationships between the soil moisture contents monitored via pr2 and the measured soil water contents monitored via oven drying were determined via linear regression analysis method at p 0 01 analysis of variance anova was performed via spss 17 0 multiple comparisons were performed using duncan s test to determine the mean differences in the soil water storage of different soil layers stem diameter boll numbers per plant fruit branches numbers lai plant height cotton fiber quality yield and wue among γ pga treatments 3 results 3 1 weather conditions fig 4 shows the meteorological data for precipitation and daily mean air temperatures in the study area during the cotton growing seasons of 2015 and 2016 in addition to the abnormal precipitation on july 11 2016 rainfall was similar during these cotton growing periods the total rainfall during cotton growing periods was only 62 2 mm in 2015 and 82 0 mm in 2016 the data indicated rare rainfall in both years which could not meet the growing needs of crops the daily mean air temperatures during the cotton growing seasons varied between 14 c and 32 c in 2015 and 2016 and the largest daily mean air temperature was 31 7 c in 2015 and 32 1 c in 2016 fig 4 from seedling to harvesting stage the average air temperatures were 22 4 c in 2015 and 23 c in 2016 fig 4 the daily mean air temperatures during the cotton growing seasons were above 20 c for 119 days in 2015 and for 125 days in 2016 accounting for 82 07 and 86 21 respectively these variations indicated that the study area had long been affected by extreme drought therefore water saving irrigation was essential for crop growth 3 2 effects of γ pga on soil water retention characteristics the swrcs reflected the fundamental relationship between the matric potential and volumetric soil water content the relationship can reflect clearly soil water holding capacity the swrcs were measured at the four different γ pga concentrations in fig 5 and table 4 the volumetric water content was slightly higher for soil with adding γ pga than that of soil without adding γ pga fig 5 the saturated volumetric water content residual water content fc pwp and taw was higher for soil with adding γ pga than that of soil without adding γ pga respectively table 4 these results indicated γ pga can improve soil water holding capacity 3 3 effects of γ pga on soil moisture the dynamic change of the sws for 19 consecutive days in different soil layers showed the effect of applying γ pga on the sws in sandy soil fig 6 during both years the sws varied with the applied amount of γ pga and soil depth the sws for 19 consecutive days in 0 60 cm soil layer was always large because the depth of infiltration under mulched drip irrigation was within the range of the 0 60 cm soil layer however in the 0 40 cm soil layer the sws was greater in γ pga treatments than that of the p0 treatment without adding γ pga p 0 05 and first increased and then decreased with increasing γ pga amount in 2015 and 2016 fig 6a 6d the difference of the sws in γ pga treatments was significant p 0 05 the application of γ pga mainly caused a difference of sws in the 0 40 cm soil layer however in the subsoil layers 40 60 cm depth the difference decreased and disappeared in the deep soil layers 60 100 cm fig 6b 6c 6e 6f fig 7 shows changes of soil moisture content in soil profile 0 100 cm after the irrigation events the soil moisture content at a depth of 0 100 cm was large on april 25 2015 five days after planting and may 1 2016 six days after planting fig 7a 7b respectively due to pre sowing irrigation management the soil moisture content at a depth of 0 100 cm was lower on june 13 2015 and june 20 2016 fig 7a 7b from the end of april or early may to mid june onwards cotton emerged and entered the seedling stage and soil moisture content significantly decreased in the stage this may be due to the following reasons spring irrigation was carried out in mid april there was sufficient soil moisture in cotton field to promote cotton germination after cotton sowing in late april or early may soil moisture in the cotton field was high in late april or early may thus the potted plots were not irrigated from the end of april or early may to mid june onwards however the air temperature in xinjiang was high during the period and the water holding capacity of sandy soil was poor moreover on the one hand although it was covered by mulch in the potted plots there was still a certain opening degree on the mulch on the other hand there were no mulch strips in the potted plots thus evaporation loss of soil moisture was high furthermore cotton germination and seedling growth required considerable soil moisture supply in the growth period therefore these reasons might result in a decrease in soil moisture during the stage one day after irrigated 45 mm at july 9 2015 and july 21 2016 soil moisture content in the top 0 40 cm layer was larger in γ pga treatments than that of the p0 fig 7c d then four days after irrigated 45 mm at july 12 2015 and july 24 2016 soil water content for all treatments decreased however the soil moisture content in the 0 40 cm soil depth was still larger in γ pga treatments compared to p0 in fig 7c d fig 7e f also show a similar result in the top 40 layer the difference between soil water content in γ pga treatments and that of the p0 was significant however in the subsoil layers 40 60 cm depth the difference decreased and disappeared in the deep soil layers 60 100 cm these results implied that the application of γ pga increased the sws and soil profile water content in the 0 40 cm soil layer and reduced the loss of soil water while prolonging the soil water retention time after each irrigation event 3 4 effects of γ pga on yield compositions of cotton plant height and lai γ pga application significantly p 0 05 affected cotton stem diameter and boll number per plant table 5 compared to the p0 stem diameter increased by 0 68 18 2 3 68 and 2 46 in 2015 and by 3 7 14 7 24 8 and 0 25 in 2016 for p20 p40 p80 and p160 respectively maximal boll numbers per plant were obtained at the p40 treatment in 2015 and p80 treatment in 2016 respectively with boll numbers per plant in the order of p40 p80 p20 p160 p0 in 2015 p80 p40 p20 p160 p0 in 2016 compared to p0 treatment boll numbers per plant increased by 20 7 58 6 31 and 13 8 in 2015 and 25 28 6 60 7 and 10 7 in 2016 respectively for p20 p40 p80 and p160 during both years the effects of γ pga application on the plant height and lai of cotton were not significant at seedling and squaring stage but was significant p 0 05 at flowering stage and bolls and boll opening stage fig 8 in addition with increasing cotton plant height the leaf area index showed a trend of single peak curve however the time of lai peak appearance in p40 and p80 treatments differed from that of p0 p20 and p160 treatments in 2015 and 2016 in 2015 lai peak in p40 and p80 treatments occurred about 23 days later for p0 p20 and p160 treatments in 2016 the lai peak in p40 and p80 treatments occurred about 20 days later for p0 p20 and p160 treatments during the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons lai and plant height were lower in the p0 treatment than that of applying γ pga treatments and the maximal lai and plant height were obtained in p40 and p80 treatments these results implied that γ pga significantly p 0 05 promoted cotton growth 3 5 effects of γ pga on cotton yield and wue γ pga significantly increased p 0 05 seed cotton yield and wue during the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons table 6 seed cotton yields and wue were larger in γ pga treatments than that of the p0 treatment without γ pga application p 0 05 in 2015 and 2016 largest seed yields were obtained with the p80 treatment in 2015 and the p40 in 2016 respectively the lowest in p0 table 6 compared to p0 treatment seed cotton yields increased by 5 2 19 3 16 1 and 7 1 in 2015 and 4 06 17 7 15 9 and 9 1 in 2016 respectively for p20 p40 p80 and p160 table 6 in 2015 and 2016 the maximum wue was achieved at the p80 treatment with wue in the order of p80 p40 p20 p160 p0 in 2015 and 80 p40 p160 p20 p0 in 2016 in 2015 wue was 21 3 in p80 18 2 in p40 7 9 in p20 and 4 9 in p160 significantly larger than in the p0 p 0 05 respectively in 2016 wue was 19 7 in p80 16 6 in p40 9 2 in p160 and 7 3 in p20 p 0 05 significantly higher than the p0 table 6 respectively we found the relationships between the applied amount of γ pga and seed cotton yield and between the applied amount of γ pga and wue could be described with quadratic curves fig 9 seed cotton yield and wue first increased and then decreased with increasing applied amount of γ pga especially the yield and wue for the p160 treatment significantly decreased compared to that of the p80 when taking optimal cotton yield and wue we found that the optimal yield and wue were approximately obtained in the p80 treatment by analyzing the quadratic curves 3 6 effects of γ pga on cotton fiber quality effects of γ pga on fiber quality of cotton are shown in table 7 the application of γ pga did not affect cotton fiber quality parameters micronaire strength uniformity index and fiber quality index in 2015 and 2016 but fiber length was significantly influenced in 2015 p 0 05 by γ pga table 7 compared to p0 treatment fiber length increased by 1 23 2 9 1 9 and 1 71 in 2015 for p20 p40 p80 and p160 respectively 4 discussion in the current study we hypothesized the potential ability of γ pga to improve soil water holding capacity and increase wue and yield in sandy soil of southern xinjiang china our data presented in figs 5 9 and tables 4 7 supports these hypotheses for example in 2015 and 2016 we found that γ pga can significantly increase soil water storage and soil water content in soil profile in 0 40 cm soil depth compared to p0 treatment without adding γ pga figs 6 and 7 moreover the application of γ pga can also significantly promote the growth of cotton fig 8 and increase the stem diameter by 0 25 24 8 number of bolls per plant by 10 7 60 7 table 5 fiber length by 1 23 2 9 table 7 seed cotton yields by 4 06 19 3 and wue by 4 9 21 3 compared to p0 treatment table 6 in the 2 yr potted experiments in the cotton field the average amount of irrigation for all treatments p0 p20 p40 p80 and p160 was 412 5 435 mm during the entire cotton growing season high seed cotton yield in γ pga treatments was 4445 5 4682 5 kg ha 1 correspondingly high wue 1 02 1 14 kg m 3 in contrast the amount of irrigation obtained by local farmers was approximately 580 620 mm during the entire cotton growing season seed cotton yields obtained by the farmers without using γ pga in cotton field were about 5250 6000 kg ha 1 thus wue of local farmers without applying γ pga was 0 85 1 03 kg m 3 compared to the local irrigation practice without using γ pga wue applied γ pga in cotton field was almost 1 35 times higher than that of local farmers the application of γ pga can save up to 20 35 water moreover compared to the yield and wue obtained by the local farmers yield in γ pga treatments was slightly lower but the γ pga treatments obtained the largest wue in our study experimental soil was sandy soil with low water holding capacity grant et al 2017 reported that cotton yield decreased with apparent over irrigation in the low water holding capacity soil therefore the amount of irrigation was high for local farmers who received optimal cotton yield but they don t receive optimal wue moreover grant et al 2017 observed that cotton yields were unaffected by irrigation in high water holding capacity soil and optimal yields were obtained by optimizing irrigation amount in our study γ pga improved water holding capacity of sandy soil compared to the soil without adding γ pga thus we recommended local farmers to use γ pga in cotton field for saving irrigation water and achieving optical cotton yield for different application amounts of γ pga cotton yield and wue were increased for the high amount of γ pga however the p80 treatment obtained the highest yield and wue in both years instead of the p160 treatment fig 9 yield and wue of the p160 treatment were reduced by 9 5 and 16 1 respectively compared to the p80 treatment these results may be attributed to the following influencing effects of γ pga on soil water movement on the one hand γ pga was able to form a hydrogel after saturation with absorbed water gonzales et al 1996 montesano et al 2015 reported that the hydrogel had the function of storing irrigation water it can serve as a miniature reservoir and ameliorating water availability for plants therefore in the current study compared to the p0 treatment without using γ pga in cotton field γ pga increased the sws and soil moisture content in 0 40 cm soil depth figs 6 and 7 promoted the growth of cotton lai plant height stem diameter fruit branches numbers and boll numbers per plant fig 8 and table 5 and improved cotton yield and wue on the other hand according to the analysis of the effect of different γ pga application rates on soil water retention characteristics we thought that γ pga might absorb a part of soil moisture and store the moisture in itself and the stored moisture could not be used by crop for example the saturated volumetric water content residual water content fc pwp and total available soil water content taw were higher for soil with adding γ pga than that of soil without adding γ pga table 4 however taw was the highest in 0 6 γ pga application amount and taw was lower for 1 2 γ pga application amount than that of 0 6 γ pga application amount the result indicated that adding excess γ pga to the soil might reduce the taw thus reducing crop yields this was consistent with the results of montesano et al 2015 therefore yield and wue of the p160 decreased compared to that of the p80 this may imply that the suitable application amount of γ pga the p80 treatment 80 kg ha 1 can improve cotton yield and wue similar studies reported that γ pga effectively suppressed crop wilts wang et al 2008 and significantly improved shoot length and dry weight of crop seedlings yao et al 2012 moreover zhai et al 2013 reported that γ pga could also be used as fertilizer synergist which increased dry matter accumulation of cotton reproductive organs and seed cotton yield when it was applied at 70 of the conventional amount thus in the current study the increase of cotton yield and wue may be partly explained by the synergistic fertilizer effect of γ pga yao et al 2012 however the synergistic mechanisms between γ pga and fertilizer remain unclear and our future studies will focus on this point furthermore ogunleye et al 2015 reported that γ pga was a biodegradable polymer thus fertilizer synergistic and super absorbent capacity of γ pga depended on its biodegradability properties the time dependent properties of γ pga should be thoroughly investigated in the future bradow and davidonis 2000 suggested that fiber quality was mainly influenced by genotype however cotton fiber length depended on the duration of water stress papastylianou et al 2014 and moisture shortage shortly bradow and davidonis 2000 balkcom et al 2006 dağdelen et al 2009 during the fiber elongation stage in this study the increase of fiber length may be due to γ pga contributing to improving soil water holding capacity and thus increasing soil water content the application of γ pga played an important role in improving the soil water holding capacity cotton yield and wue the optimal application amount of γ pga is usually proposed to take these components into account in our experiments the relationships between cotton yield and the amount of γ pga application and between wue and the amount of γ pga applied followed quadratic curves fig 9 the determinate coefficients of the two curves were 0 8 and 0 69 for cotton yield and wue respectively the γ pga production function fig 9 for different treatments showed that the highest yield and highest wue were obtained at a γ pga application amount of 90 kg ha 1 and 80 kg ha 1 respectively compared to a dose of 90 kg γ pga ha 1 the p80 treatment a dose of 80 kg γ pga ha 1 can obtain the highest wue with acceptable yield decrease from 4599 9 kg ha 1 to 4589 1 kg ha 1 in our study the quadratic relationships indicated 80 kg ha 1 as an optimal application amount of γ pga for plastic mulched drip irrigation in sandy soil at the southern xinjiang china 5 conclusions under plastic mulched drip irrigation conditions wue and yield of cotton were noticeably affected by different amounts of applied γ pga in the sandy soil in southern xinjiang china during the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons compared to the p0 treatment using γ pga led to higher seed cotton yield and wue seed cotton yields were 4 06 19 3 greater and wues were 4 9 21 3 higher respectively than for treatments without using γ pga moreover γ pga treatments significantly increased boll numbers per plant stem diameter lai and plant height and enhanced cotton fiber length but did not affect cotton quality seed cotton yield and wue were analyzed via the γ pga production function fig 9 for different treatments during both years we found that the p80 treatment a dose of 80 kg γ pga ha 1 can obtain the highest wue and yield compared to a dose of 90 kg γ pga ha 1 therefore when using the γ pga super absorbent polymer a dose of 80 kg γ pga ha 1 was recommended for promoting the growth of cotton improving soil water holding capacity and increasing cotton yield wue and cotton fiber length in the sandy soil of southern xinjiang china moreover in xinjiang agricultural areas where rainfall is scarce and freshwater resources are scarce we recommend that the application of brackish irrigation water maybe be also regarded as an effective solution to copy with the shortage of freshwater resources and precipitation deficit acknowledgements this study was supported by the national natural science foundation of china no 51379173 the key laboratory

11044,better understanding on the photosynthetic regulation of yield will be useful to improve agricultural water use efficiency under straw mulching the yield photosynthetic parameters and related leaf traits were measured and compared between straw mulching sm and non mulching nm treatments in a maize field of north china plain in 2013 2015 total aboveground biomass of the sm treatment increased by 7 1 11 2 and 14 7 and grain yield increased by 11 5 6 8 and 12 1 respectively for the three years comparing to those of the nm treatment such increases were related to higher leaf area index lai and leaf area duration photosynthetic capacity per unit of area a max and the apparent quantum efficiency α for the sm treatment maximum lai of the sm treatment were 17 2 19 2 and 20 higher than those of the nm treatment respectively for the three years a max and α of the sm treatment were 7 9 36 8 and 7 7 16 7 higher than those of the nm treatment during different growth stages in the three years a max and α were linearly correlated to leaf nitrogen content on mass basis n mass liner regressions between a max and n mass and between α and n mass were affected by straw mulching treatment under which the slopes were similar but the intercepts were higher with no significant increase of n mass in most measurements the results suggested that the sm treatment improved n use efficiency which may be due to lower leakiness of the bundle sheath cells to co2 l under the sm treatment collectively the results help understanding the physiological basis of positive effect of the straw mulching on yield and quantified the photosynthetic parameters of summer maize in this area keywords summer maize straw mulching biomass photosynthetic capacity leaf n content 1 introduction the north china plain produces 1 4 of the total grain yield in china liu et al 2005 straw mulching and no tillage is a common agronomic measure to improve soil water content reduce soil evaporation and improve water use efficiency in the annual double cropping system of winter wheat triticum aestivum l summer maize zea mays l in this area fang et al 2011 most studies showed that straw mulching in this area increased yield of summer maize chen et al 2002 yan et al 2017 some studies have shown that straw mulching and no tillage can lead to crop yield reduction main reasons are that long term no tillage limits the extension of roots guan et al 2014 and straw mulching reduces soil temperature at the early growing season chen et al 2013 lu et al 2015 in contrast the growing season of summer maize is generally from the middle june to end of september and lower temperature may have positive effect on its growth the formation of crop yield involves many physiological processes in which photosynthesis is the basis of biomass formation understanding the photosynthetic physiological basis of the effect of straw mulching on yield will help improve agricultural water use efficiency braune et al 2009 photosynthetic characteristics of summer maize with straw mulching is also useful to improve the crop model accuracy and the practice of precision agriculture yin and struik 2009 in addition determination of the intrinsic photosynthetic parameters such as the photosynthetic capacity instead of only the instantaneous values could give transferable results among different studies zhang et al 2017a b the comparison of instantaneous photosynthetic rate is difficult among different planting areas crop varieties and agronomic management as it is easily affected by weather conditions when it was measured foulkes et al 2009 intrinsic photosynthetic parameters are linked to related biochemical properties such as leaf nitrogen content and the leakiness of the bundle sheath cells leaf nitrogen content is one of the important biochemical characteristics of leaves evans 1983 1989 li et al 2013a b there is a significant correlation between photosynthetic parameters and leaf nitrogen content hikosaka 2004 however how the relationship is affected by straw mulching remains unclear furthermore in c4 plants the leakiness of the bundle sheath cells to co2 l defined as the ratio of co2 leak rate out of the bundle sheath to the rate of pep carboxylation assumed to be in equilibrium with the rate of c4 acid decarboxylation quantifies the efficiency of c4 photosynthesis von caemmerer and furbank 2003 which means that photosynthetic rate is negatively related to l saliendra et al 1996 studies in maize sorghum and other c4 grasses have shown that l would be affected by field management and environmental stresses e g severe drought stress could significantly increase l williams et al 2001 grzesiak et al 2016 however it remains unknown whether leaf nitrogen content and l is increased or decreased by agricultural water management such as straw mulching without severe drought stress these results would be useful to better understanding on the photosynthetic regulation of yield under straw mulching in this study summer maize photosynthesis and yield in north china plain was studied under the straw mulching sm and non mulching nm treatments in three growing seasons in 2013 2015 plant growth yield and intrinsic photosynthetic parameters under the two treatments were measured and leaf nitrogen content was measured at the same time to answer the following questions 1 whether or not straw mulching can promote the growth and increase the yield of summer maize in this area 2 how does the intrinsic photosynthetic parameters respond to straw mulching 3 is the relationship between photosynthetic parameters and leaf nitrogen content affected by straw mulching and what are the possible reasons therefore the objective of the study was to elucidate physiological basis of straw mulching effect on yield and provide photosynthetic parameters of summer maize under straw mulching 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment

treatments were set with each area being 8 m 10 m and arranged randomly the crushed straw coverage amount was about 6000 kg hm 2 field management irrigation and fertilization scheduling were the same for the sm and nm treatments summer maize were sown in the last ten days of june and harvested in the first ten days of october each year summer maize z mays l was sowed artificially after winter wheat harvest in the middle ten days of june with row spacing of 50 cm and plant spacing of 30 cm because of heavy rainfalls after the sowing season of summer maize no basal fertilizer applied when sowing only topdressing n applied in the field drip irrigation systems were used to irrigate and topdressing the total topdressing n application rate was 184 kg hm 2 as urea applied 50 in jointing stage and 50 around tasseling and silking stage based on local management experience the n fertilizer application rate was similar to the recommendation optimal n rate of this area 181 kg hm 2 wu et

stage in 2014 where there was no significant difference between treatments fig 2 p 0 1 a max means of the sm treatment in the jointing and silking stages in 2013 increased by 8 4 and 24 3 respectively comparing to those of the nm treatment a max means of the sm treatment increased by 19 2 and 38 6 in the milk and dent stages in 2014 and increased by 9 8 and 7 9 in the silking and milk stages in 2015 respectively overall a max decreased with the growth stage ranging from 33 8 to 52 3 μmol m 2 s 1 and from 27 3 to 48 5 μmol m 2 s 1 respectively for the sm and nm treatments over the 3 years there were four significant differences in the apparent quantum efficiency α of seven measurements in 2013 2015 fig 3 p 0 1 mean α of the sm treatment in the silking stage in 2013 increased by 7 7 comparing to that of the nm treatment α means of the sm treatment increased by 15 9 and 9 1 respectively in the tasseling and dent stages in 2014 and increased by 16 7 in the silking and stage in 2015 no significant difference between treatments was found in the other measurements α also decreased with the growth stage ranging from 0 037 to 0 0585 and from 0 035 to 0 0621 respectively for the sm and nm treatments over the 3 years there were two significant differences in the respiration rate r d of seven measurements in 2013 2015 fig 4 p 0 1 straw mulching treatment significantly increased r

obviously seasonal trends with the mean values of 2 63 and 2 52 μmol m 2 s 1 respectively for the sm and nm treatments over the 3 years significant differences of leaf n content n mass between treatments were only found once of seven measurements in 2013 2015 fig 5 p 0 1 straw mulching didn t increase n mass significantly in other measurements n mass means of the sm treatment increased by 10 1 in the silking stage in 2013 the effect of straw mulching on leakiness of the bundle sheath cells to co2 l was significant with an exception of the measurement at the tasseling stage in 2014 where there was no significant difference between treatments fig 6 p 0 1 l means of the sm treatment increased by 12 5 and 9 1 in the milk and dent stages in 2014 and increased by 9 6 and 13 3 in the silking and milk stages in 2015 respectively comparing to those of the nm treatment 3 3 variation source of photosynthetic parameters a max was significantly correlated with n mass for the three years and the sm treatment significantly affected the correlation between the two parameters the intercept of the regression line 18 10 was significantly increased in the sm treatment p 0 001 fig 7 which

regression were 0 8793 and 0 3640 respectively n mass could explain 57 2 of the variation of r d 4 discussion 4 1 plant growth and yield straw mulching increased summer maize yield and biomass accumulation in leaves stems and ears in this region table 2 the increase in yield and biomass accumulation induced by straw mulching was associated with an improvement in leaf area index and leaf area duration fig 1 li et al 2013a b photosynthetic capacity a max and apparent quantum efficiency α per unit of area fig 2 and 3 efthimiadou et al 2010 straw mulch with the amount of 3000 12 000 kg hm 2 had been reported to applied in maize field when only those with over 6000 kg hm 2 mulching straw had significantly improvement on yield zhang et al 2007 2014 in our study straw mulch amount of 6000 kg hm 2 with sufficient irrigation increased grain yield by 6 8 12 1 aboveground biomass by 7 1 14 7 compared to the nm treatment the increase percentage of our study is similar to those reported by tolk et al 1999 with 6700 kg hm 2 mulching straw and more frequent irrigations high lai under the sm treatment during the critical period 15d before and after the silking stage may explain why the final yield was higher than that of the nm treatment an improvement in lai produced by straw mulching e g fig 1 increased the ability of the crop to intercept more radiation during the critical period where 95 of the radiation should be intercepted to maximize growth rate per plant puntel 2012 the potential kernel number the main component of maize yield is strongly related to the light intercepted during the critical period otegui et al 1995 the improvement of plant growth were the results of the comprehensive interaction of soil moisture soil temperature and nutrient changes under the sm treatment we think that the soil temperature change in the sm treatment may be the main reasons to promote maize growth in our study but it still needs further test with controlled experiments in our study soil water and soil n fertilization were both assumed sufficient thus the differences of soil water content and soil n between sm and nm may not lead to much difference in growth according to the soil temperature measurements the sm treatment decreased the daily maximum t s and increased the minimum t s thus decreased the diurnal variation range data no shown the growing season of summer maize characterized with high soil temperature as high as 31 9 c on august 12nd of 2014 data no shown the optimal growing soil temperature were around 20 25 c barber et al 1988 higher t s may accelerate apical maturation and lignification decrease the absorption efficiency of root surface kovar et al 1992 karandish and shahnazari 2016 t s of the sm treatment were more close to the optimal growing soil temperature thus maize may grow better with the sm treatment higher photosynthetic capacity and apparent quantum efficiency produce higher carbon assimilation which is another reason for higher yield with the sm treatment straw mulching effects on the photosynthetic parameters and related leaf traits were discussed below 4 2 photosynthetic parameters and related leaf traits field grown maize plants had a max ranging from18 2 to 59 6 μmol m 2 s 1 with leaf n content of 1 51 4 66 puntel 2012 our data from 27 3 to 52 3 μmol m 2 s 1 fig 2 were within that range and with similar leaf n content from 2 47 to 4 38 fig 5 mean value of α reported for plants with c4 photosynthesis pathways measured under ambient concentration of atmospheric co2 and o2 was 0 057 0 006 skillman 2008 in the present study overall average for α ranged from 0 035 to 0 062 fig 3 which is slightly lower than the published data measured in controlled conditions lower values of α measured in the late growth stages in our study was also related the leaf n content reduction mean values of r d for both treatments were 2 57 μmol m 2 s 1 fig 4 which is in good agreement with the value range 2 25 3 1 μmol m 2 s 1 of the field measurements on leaves with the same positions puntel 2012 several studies in north china showed that photosynthetic parameters and leaf nitrogen content under straw mulching treatments increased cai et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 tao et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 guo et al 2017 in our study for more than half measurements straw mulching increased the a max and α fig 2 and 3 which are similar to most other studies but didn t increase n mass fig 5 which are different with most other studies whereas reduced the l fig 6 which are the first observation in field with the sm treatment so far as we know maize plant with the sm treatment strives for higher lai instead of higher leaf n content this result is similar to the finding that maize strives for higher leaf area at the expense of decreased n content per unit of leaf area vos et al 2005 other possible reasons for higher a max and α of the sm treatment with similar leaf n content are discussed below the relationships between a max and n mass and between α and n mass were found to be linear in both treatments fig 7 and 8 in accordance with numerous studies mccullough et al 1994 paponov et al 2005 vos et al 2005 however the intercepts of the linear fit lines were affected by straw mulching that means the same leaf n content support higher a max and α the higher leaf n use efficiency under both lower and higher par condition in the sm treatment this was different with the results we found in a c3 plant winter wheat in the same field with the same treatment zhang et al 2017a b in that study even though the a max and n mass were significantly different between treatments the relationship between the two weren t with different intercepts and slopes maize as a c4 plants the possible reason of higher leaf n use efficiency may be the lower l with the sm treatments as we find under sufficient irrigation and n fertilizer fig 5 greater investment of n in rubisco was associated with higher rates of photosynthesis and growth at similar or slightly lower leaf n content indicating that greater relative investment of n in rubisco activity also led to higher leaf n use efficiency and lower l kromdijk et al 2014 the lower l we found might also related to the leaf n distribution among organelles and photosynthetic enzymes but needs further measurements to confirm the results suggest that regulation of the ratio of c3 to c4 pathway activity and its consequences for l may play a key role in the photosynthetic performance and growth of c4 plants even under favorable conditions ghannoum 2009 thus a slight increase of n content in maize leaves of the sm treatment significantly enhanced the photosynthetic capacity r d was significantly related to n mass and the correlation between the two wasn t significantly affected by straw mulching fig 9 this is in agreement with osaki et al 2001 that found an increase in r d as increasing leaf n concentration in maize however a greenhouse study conducted by wang et al 2012 showed no significant effect of n treatments on r d in maize therefore the coupling of n and r d of leaves of c4 plants may be of only minor importance byrd et al 1992 5 conclusions according to the three year study on comparing plant growth and related photosynthetic parameters between the sm and nm treatments we conclude that 1 straw mulching increased summer maize yield biomass accumulation in leaves stems and ears in this region the increases were associated with an improvement in leaf area index lai and leaf area duration photosynthetic capacity a max and the apparent quantum efficiency α per unit of area with the sm treatment 2 a max α and respiration rate r d were linear correlation to leaf nitrogen content on mass basis n mass the liner regressions between a max and n mass and between α and n mass were affected by straw mulching under which the slopes were similar but the intercepts were higher whereas the liner regressions between r d and n mass were not affected by straw mulching 3 higher n use efficiency were first found in field experiment with straw mulching treatment as we know so far even though n mass wasn t significant increase with the sm treatment for most measurements the likely reason of higher n use efficiency was the lower leakiness of the bundle sheath cells to co2 l of the sm treatment acknowledgements this

11044,better understanding on the photosynthetic regulation of yield will be useful to improve agricultural water use efficiency under straw mulching the yield photosynthetic parameters and related leaf traits were measured and compared between straw mulching sm and non mulching nm treatments in a maize field of north china plain in 2013 2015 total aboveground biomass of the sm treatment increased by 7 1 11 2 and 14 7 and grain yield increased by 11 5 6 8 and 12 1 respectively for the three years comparing to those of the nm treatment such increases were related to higher leaf area index lai and leaf area duration photosynthetic capacity per unit of area a max and the apparent quantum efficiency α for the sm treatment maximum lai of the sm treatment were 17 2 19 2 and 20 higher than those of the nm treatment respectively for the three years a max and α of the sm treatment were 7 9 36 8 and 7 7 16 7 higher than those of the nm treatment during different growth stages in the three years a max and α were linearly correlated to leaf nitrogen content on mass basis n mass liner regressions between a max and n mass and between α and n mass were affected by straw mulching treatment under which the slopes were similar but the intercepts were higher with no significant increase of n mass in most measurements the results suggested that the sm treatment improved n use efficiency which may be due to lower leakiness of the bundle sheath cells to co2 l under the sm treatment collectively the results help understanding the physiological basis of positive effect of the straw mulching on yield and quantified the photosynthetic parameters of summer maize in this area keywords summer maize straw mulching biomass photosynthetic capacity leaf n content 1 introduction the north china plain produces 1 4 of the total grain yield in china liu et al 2005 straw mulching and no tillage is a common agronomic measure to improve soil water content reduce soil evaporation and improve water use efficiency in the annual double cropping system of winter wheat triticum aestivum l summer maize zea mays l in this area fang et al 2011 most studies showed that straw mulching in this area increased yield of summer maize chen et al 2002 yan et al 2017 some studies have shown that straw mulching and no tillage can lead to crop yield reduction main reasons are that long term no tillage limits the extension of roots guan et al 2014 and straw mulching reduces soil temperature at the early growing season chen et al 2013 lu et al 2015 in contrast the growing season of summer maize is generally from the middle june to end of september and lower temperature may have positive effect on its growth the formation of crop yield involves many physiological processes in which photosynthesis is the basis of biomass formation understanding the photosynthetic physiological basis of the effect of straw mulching on yield will help improve agricultural water use efficiency braune et al 2009 photosynthetic characteristics of summer maize with straw mulching is also useful to improve the crop model accuracy and the practice of precision agriculture yin and struik 2009 in addition determination of the intrinsic photosynthetic parameters such as the photosynthetic capacity instead of only the instantaneous values could give transferable results among different studies zhang et al 2017a b the comparison of instantaneous photosynthetic rate is difficult among different planting areas crop varieties and agronomic management as it is easily affected by weather conditions when it was measured foulkes et al 2009 intrinsic photosynthetic parameters are linked to related biochemical properties such as leaf nitrogen content and the leakiness of the bundle sheath cells leaf nitrogen content is one of the important biochemical characteristics of leaves evans 1983 1989 li et al 2013a b there is a significant correlation between photosynthetic parameters and leaf nitrogen content hikosaka 2004 however how the relationship is affected by straw mulching remains unclear furthermore in c4 plants the leakiness of the bundle sheath cells to co2 l defined as the ratio of co2 leak rate out of the bundle sheath to the rate of pep carboxylation assumed to be in equilibrium with the rate of c4 acid decarboxylation quantifies the efficiency of c4 photosynthesis von caemmerer and furbank 2003 which means that photosynthetic rate is negatively related to l saliendra et al 1996 studies in maize sorghum and other c4 grasses have shown that l would be affected by field management and environmental stresses e g severe drought stress could significantly increase l williams et al 2001 grzesiak et al 2016 however it remains unknown whether leaf nitrogen content and l is increased or decreased by agricultural water management such as straw mulching without severe drought stress these results would be useful to better understanding on the photosynthetic regulation of yield under straw mulching in this study summer maize photosynthesis and yield in north china plain was studied under the straw mulching sm and non mulching nm treatments in three growing seasons in 2013 2015 plant growth yield and intrinsic photosynthetic parameters under the two treatments were measured and leaf nitrogen content was measured at the same time to answer the following questions 1 whether or not straw mulching can promote the growth and increase the yield of summer maize in this area 2 how does the intrinsic photosynthetic parameters respond to straw mulching 3 is the relationship between photosynthetic parameters and leaf nitrogen content affected by straw mulching and what are the possible reasons therefore the objective of the study was to elucidate physiological basis of straw mulching effect on yield and provide photosynthetic parameters of summer maize under straw mulching 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment

leaves were removed and the 40 cm part of the middle segment was intercepted and the veins were removed the left leaves were dried at 105 c for 20 min then dried at 65 c to constant mass after the determination of dry mass the leaves were ground and passed through a 100 mesh sieve the samples were distillated with sulfuric acid and salicylic acid and the leaf n content on mass basis dry weight

leaf length and width were measured using a meter after which the product was multiplied by a conversion coefficient of 0 74 to obtain the actual leaf area plant leaf area was summed from the area of all the leaves the lai was calculated by dividing the leaf area by the plant spacing three plants were selected from each plot and a total of 12 plants for each treatment were measured and averaged for lai determination the aboveground biomass allocation were determined in mature stage by collecting three plants each plot 12 plants totally for each treatment separating for leaves stems and ears and dried to the constant weight at the harvest three subplots with an area of 3 m 1 m were selected for each plot and the grain weight of all plants in the subplot was determined and converted to yield of the plot y t hm 2 2 7 statistical analysis the fitting of photosynthetic and light response curves were fitted by the custom nonlinear fitting of spss18 0 software ibm spss software new york usa after the parameters were determined the independent samples t test was applied in the mean comparison of spss18 0 software to analyze the difference between treatments when analyzing the relationship between photosynthetic parameters and leaf nitrogen content the covariance analysis of spss18 0 software is applied to determine whether there is a significant difference in the slope and intercept of regression lines between treatments if the difference is significant the sigma plot12 0 software is used to fit the regression lines separately for the sm and nm treatments respectively if the difference is not significant the regression equation and statistical parameters will be determined together for the sm and nm treatments all the figures in this manuscript are drew with sigma plot12 0 software 3 results 3 1 dry biomass allocation yield and leaf area index straw mulching greatly affected leaf and stem biomass allocation table 2 statistically significant differences at p 0 1 were found between treatments in dry biomass for leaves stem and ear for the three years with an exception of stem dry biomass in 2013 the sm treatment produced more dry matter production of leaves stems and ears than the nm treatment by 5 5 11 2 3 8 14 9 and 9 7 14 8 respectively total aboveground biomass increased by 7 1 11 2 and 14 7 respectively for the three years however the ratio of ear to total aboveground dry biomass wasn t affected by the sm treatment with the mean of 0 597 between the treatments for the three years straw mulching significantly affected grain yield of summer maize table 2 grain yields for the sm treatment were 11819 4 11024 6 and 12429 0 kg hm 2 for the year of 2013 2015 respectively greater than the nm treatment by 11 5 6 8 and 12 1 straw mulching significantly increased lai and leaf area duration fig 1 the maximum lai values of the sm treatment were 4 55 4 77 and 4 48 in the year of 2013 2015 which appeared at the stage of silking and were 17 2 19 2 and 20 higher than those of the nm treatment 3 88 4 00 and 3 73 respectively the difference between the two treatments at the stage of r5 increased with lai of the sm treatment increasing by 21

stage in 2014 where there was no significant difference between treatments fig 2 p 0 1 a max means of the sm treatment in the jointing and silking stages in 2013 increased by 8 4 and 24 3 respectively comparing to those of the nm treatment a max means of the sm treatment increased by 19 2 and 38 6 in the milk and dent stages in 2014 and increased by 9 8 and 7 9 in the silking and milk stages in 2015 respectively overall a max decreased with the growth stage ranging from 33 8 to 52 3 μmol m 2 s 1 and from 27 3 to 48 5 μmol m 2 s 1 respectively for the sm and nm treatments over the 3 years there were four significant differences in the apparent quantum efficiency α of seven measurements in 2013 2015 fig 3 p 0 1 mean α of the sm treatment in the silking stage in 2013 increased by 7 7 comparing to that of the nm treatment α means of the sm treatment increased by 15 9 and 9 1 respectively in the tasseling and dent stages in 2014 and increased by 16 7 in the silking and stage in 2015 no significant difference between treatments was found in the other measurements α also decreased with the growth stage ranging from 0 037 to 0 0585 and from 0 035 to 0 0621 respectively for the sm and nm treatments over the 3 years there were two significant differences in the respiration rate r d of seven measurements in 2013 2015 fig 4 p 0 1 straw mulching treatment significantly increased r d means by 16 7 and 39 6 respectively in the silking stage in 2013 and in the dent stage in 2014 no significant difference between treatments was found in the other measurements r d didn t show obviously seasonal trends with the mean values of 2 63 and 2 52 μmol m 2 s 1 respectively for the sm and nm treatments over the 3 years significant differences of leaf n content n mass between treatments were only found once of seven measurements in 2013 2015 fig 5 p 0 1 straw mulching didn t increase n mass significantly in other measurements n mass means of the sm treatment increased by 10 1 in the silking stage in 2013 the effect of straw mulching on leakiness of the bundle sheath cells to co2 l was significant with an exception of the measurement at the tasseling stage in 2014

and the sm treatment significantly affected the correlation between the two parameters the intercept of the regression line 18 10 was significantly increased in the sm treatment p 0 001 fig 7 which was 38 9 higher than that of the nm 13 03 whereas the slope was not significant difference between the treatments 6 62 and 6 85 respectively for the sm and nm treatments the determination coefficients

regression were 0 8793 and 0 3640 respectively n mass could explain 57 2 of the variation of r d 4 discussion 4 1 plant growth and yield straw mulching increased summer maize yield and biomass accumulation in leaves stems and ears in this region table 2 the increase in yield and biomass accumulation induced by straw mulching was associated with an improvement in leaf area index and leaf area duration fig 1 li et al 2013a b photosynthetic capacity a max and apparent quantum efficiency α per unit of area fig 2 and 3 efthimiadou et al 2010 straw mulch with the amount of 3000 12 000 kg hm 2 had been reported to applied in maize field when only those with over 6000 kg hm 2 mulching straw had significantly improvement on yield zhang et al 2007 2014 in our study straw mulch amount of 6000 kg hm 2 with sufficient irrigation increased grain yield by 6 8 12 1 aboveground biomass by 7 1 14 7 compared to the nm treatment the increase percentage of our study is similar to those reported by tolk et al 1999 with 6700 kg hm 2 mulching straw and more frequent irrigations high lai under the sm treatment during the critical period 15d before and after the silking stage may explain why the final yield was higher than that of the nm treatment an improvement in lai produced by straw mulching e g fig 1 increased the ability of the crop to intercept more radiation during the critical period where 95 of the radiation should be intercepted to maximize growth rate per plant puntel 2012 the potential kernel number the main component of maize yield is strongly related to the light intercepted during the critical period otegui et al 1995 the improvement of plant growth were the results of the comprehensive interaction of soil moisture soil temperature and nutrient changes under the sm treatment we think that the soil temperature change in the sm treatment may be the main reasons to promote maize growth in our study but it still needs further test with controlled experiments in our study soil water and soil n fertilization were both assumed sufficient thus the differences of soil water content and soil n between sm and nm may not lead to much difference in growth according to the soil temperature measurements the sm treatment decreased the daily maximum t s and increased the minimum t s thus decreased the diurnal variation range data no shown the growing season of summer maize characterized with high soil temperature as high as 31 9 c on august 12nd of 2014 data no shown the optimal growing soil temperature were around 20 25 c barber et al 1988 higher t s may accelerate apical maturation and lignification decrease the absorption efficiency of root surface kovar et al 1992 karandish and shahnazari 2016 t s of the sm treatment were more close to the optimal growing soil temperature thus maize may grow better with the sm treatment higher photosynthetic capacity and apparent quantum efficiency produce higher carbon assimilation which is another reason for higher yield with the sm treatment straw mulching effects on the photosynthetic parameters and related leaf traits were discussed below 4 2 photosynthetic parameters and related leaf traits field grown maize plants had a max ranging from18 2 to 59 6 μmol m 2 s 1 with leaf n content of 1 51 4 66 puntel 2012 our data from 27 3 to 52 3 μmol m 2 s 1 fig 2 were within that range and with similar leaf n content from 2 47 to 4 38 fig 5 mean value of α reported for plants with c4 photosynthesis pathways measured under ambient concentration of atmospheric co2 and o2 was 0 057 0 006 skillman 2008 in the present study overall average for α ranged from 0 035 to 0 062 fig 3 which is slightly lower than the published data measured in controlled conditions lower values of α measured in the late growth stages in our study was also related the leaf n content reduction mean values of r d for both treatments were 2 57 μmol m 2 s 1 fig 4 which is in good agreement with the value range 2 25 3 1 μmol m 2 s 1 of the field measurements on leaves with the same positions puntel 2012 several studies in north china showed that photosynthetic parameters and leaf nitrogen content under straw mulching treatments increased cai et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 tao et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 guo et al 2017 in our study for more than half measurements straw mulching increased the a max and α fig 2 and 3 which are similar to most other studies but didn t increase n mass fig 5 which are different with most other studies whereas reduced the l fig 6 which are the first observation in field with the sm treatment so far as we know maize plant with the sm treatment strives for higher lai instead of higher leaf n content this result is similar to the finding that maize strives for higher leaf area at the expense of decreased n content per unit of leaf area vos et al 2005 other possible reasons for higher a max and α of the sm treatment with similar leaf n content are discussed below the relationships between a max and n mass and between α and n mass were found to be linear in both treatments fig 7 and 8 in accordance with numerous studies mccullough et al 1994 paponov et al 2005 vos et al 2005 however the intercepts of the linear fit lines were affected by straw mulching that means the same leaf n content support higher a max and α the higher leaf n use efficiency under both lower and higher par condition in the sm treatment this was different with the results we found in a c3 plant winter wheat in the same field with the same treatment zhang et al 2017a b in that study even though the a max and n mass were significantly different between treatments the relationship between the two weren t with different intercepts and slopes maize as a c4 plants the possible reason of higher leaf n use efficiency may be the lower l with the sm treatments as we find under sufficient irrigation and n fertilizer fig 5 greater investment of n in rubisco was associated with higher rates of photosynthesis and growth at similar or slightly lower leaf n content indicating that greater relative investment of n in rubisco activity also led to higher leaf n use efficiency and lower l kromdijk et al 2014 the lower l we found might also related to the leaf n distribution among organelles and photosynthetic enzymes but needs further measurements to confirm the results suggest that regulation of the ratio of c3 to c4 pathway activity and its consequences for l may play a key role in the photosynthetic performance and growth of c4 plants even under favorable conditions ghannoum 2009 thus a slight increase of n content in maize leaves of the sm treatment significantly enhanced the photosynthetic capacity r d was significantly related to n mass and the correlation between the two wasn t significantly affected by straw mulching fig 9 this is in agreement with osaki et al 2001 that found an increase in r d as increasing leaf n concentration in maize however a greenhouse study conducted by wang et al 2012 showed no significant effect of n treatments on r d in maize therefore the coupling of n and r d of leaves of c4 plants may be of only minor importance byrd et al 1992 5 conclusions according to the three year study on comparing plant growth and related photosynthetic parameters between the sm and nm treatments we conclude that 1 straw mulching increased summer maize yield biomass accumulation in leaves stems and ears in this region the increases were associated with an improvement in leaf area index lai and leaf area duration photosynthetic capacity a max and the apparent quantum efficiency α per unit of area with the sm treatment 2 a max α and respiration rate r d were linear correlation to leaf nitrogen content on mass basis n mass the liner regressions between a max and n mass and between α and n mass were affected by straw mulching under which the slopes were similar but the intercepts were higher whereas the liner regressions between r d and n mass were not affected by straw mulching 3 higher n use efficiency were first found in field experiment with straw mulching treatment as we know so far even though n mass wasn t significant increase with the sm treatment for most measurements the likely reason of higher n use efficiency was the lower leakiness of the bundle sheath cells to co2 l of the sm treatment acknowledgements this
