7435,in a karstic field the flow paths are very complex as they globally follow the conduit network the responses generated from an investigation in this type of aquifer can be spatially highly variable therefore the aim of the investigation in this case is to define a degree of connectivity between points of the field in order to understand these flow paths harmonic pumping tests represent a possible investigation method for characterizing the subsurface flow of groundwater they have several advantages compared to a constant rate pumping more signal possibilities ease of extracting the signal in the responses and possibility of closed loop investigation we show in this work that interpreting the responses from a harmonic pumping test is very useful for delineating a degree of connectivity between measurement points we have firstly studied the amplitude and phase offset of responses from a harmonic pumping test in a theoretical synthetic modeling case in order to define a qualitative interpretation method in the time and frequency domains three different type of responses have been separated a conduit connectivity response a matrix connectivity and a dual connectivity response of a point in the matrix but close to a conduit we have then applied this method to measured responses at a field research site our interpretation method permits a quick and easy reconstruction of the main flow paths and the whole set of field responses appear to give a similar range of responses to those seen in the theoretical synthetic case keywords oscillatory signal heterogeneity characterization aquifer frequency domain karst 1 introduction characterization of the hydrodynamic properties of porous or fractured aquifers is a common challenge in many areas including exploitation and protection of water resources oil production geothermal energy extraction civil engineering remediation engineering and storage of radioactive waste among many approaches tracer tests slug tests geophysical investigations etc this characterization can be accomplished using pumping tests in which the values of the transmissivity and storativity parameters are derived from the analysis of the hydraulic responses to the aquifer stimulation butler 2005 however in field conditions many noise sources are unmanageable hydraulic contributions that can contaminate the signal induced by pumping such as aquifer recharge river aquifer interactions evapotranspiration by plants tidal fluctuations or unplanned unknown pumping at nearby water supply boreholes for example in unconfined aquifers evapotranspiration occurring during pumping tests may result in a spurious signal see e g cardiff et al 2009 to address this difficulty harmonic pumping tests have been suggested as an efficient approach to characterize the hydraulic properties by making the hydraulic signal exploitable even for low signal amplitudes and noises corruptions cardiff and barrash 2015 the oscillations in the hydraulic responses caused by a harmonic excitation with a known frequency can in fact be more easily extracted from the ambient noises by applying filtering techniques bakhos et al 2014 than the hydraulic responses generated by a constant rate pumping harmonic pumping tests also offer the possibility of avoiding the non linear regimes of groundwater flow by controlling the characteristics of the periodic excitation this excitation can be conducted through a pumping reinjection system rasmussen et al 2003 or even without any pumping or injection by only using a moving mass guiltinan and becker 2015 harmonic pulse tests by using cyclic injection rates have also been conducted by sun et al 2015 2016 in a deep subsurface aquifer for leakage detection harmonic pumping tests have been especially investigated for their abilities for characterizing aquifers properties the analysis and interpretation of the harmonic data for a characterization are most often realized with analytical solutions renner and messar 2006 dagan and rabinovich 2014 rabinovich et al 2015 among these attempts black and kipp 1981 proposed solutions for analytical models under the homogeneity assumption to derive the average transmissivity and storativity parameters from harmonic test analysis rasmussen et al 2003 applied an analytical model expressed in frequency form to interpret the piezometric data generated from harmonic pumping tests in a porous contaminated aquifer in order to estimate the average values of the hydraulic properties the numerical models have also been used particularly in the frequency domain instead of the time domain in order to reduce the computing time and to take into account the spatial heterogeneity of the hydraulic properties black and kipp 1981 cardiff et al 2013 modeling and imaging potential of harmonic pumping tests data were also already addressed in the literature for the reconstruction of the spatial variability of hydraulic properties lavenue and de marsily 2001 cardiff et al 2013 zhou et al 2016 soueid ahmed et al 2016 some works have focused more specifically on the capacity of harmonic pumping for characterizing fractured aquifers renner and messar 2006 applied harmonic pumping tests on a fractured sandstone aquifer to deduce the average values of transmissivity and storativity fields using a cyclical hydraulic excitation by alternating pumping no flow and injection periods at the same study site maineult et al 2008 used the self potential method to monitor remotely at the ground surface the piezometric fluctuations caused by these harmonic excitations more recently guiltinan and becker 2015 similarly conducted periodic slug tests on isolated fractures without any extraction or injection only by oscillating a slug at different depths of the water column in the well to characterize the hydraulic connectivity of the fracture using analysis of phase shift and attenuation of the signal with an analytical model schuite et al 2017 used tilt data recorded at the ground surface to follow the oscillatory deformations induced by harmonic pulses performed in a fractured aquifer among the works previously cited and dealing with this subject none have sought to model the impact of spatial high contrasts of hydraulic property variations on oscillatory testing in karstic aquifers where low transmissivity host rocks are directly adjacent to sparsely distributed high transmissivity fractures and conduits such a scenario is clearly present and leads to flow paths particularly constrained wells in karstic aquifers therefore may be expected to have drastically different responses depending on whether they are located on or near a fracture or a conduit in fact the main flow paths in subsurface karstic field follow the conduit and fracture network and one would need to have an idea of its positioning for understanding the flow behavior white 2002 saller et al 2013 commonly karstic fields are described by their connectivity whether the flows between wells follows a highly conductive path or not jazayeri noushabadi et al 2011 defined three types of hydrodynamic response to pumping and pulse tests as a function of the degree of conductivity of the flow path network in the investigated karstic aquifer the authors assumed that a short time lag and a high amplitude hydrodynamic response conduit type hydrodynamic response was the consequence of a high permeability and high connectivity between the observation well and the main flow path network karst conduits that generate the large scale permeability of the aquifer while fracture type and matrix type hydrodynamic responses were related to both a lower permeability and lower connectivity between the observation wells and the main flow path network to be more consistent with previous works this connectivity must be defined in term of property distribution as a static or topological connectivity and in term of physical flow transport processes as a dynamical connectivity renard and allard 2013 tyukhova and willmann 2016 in this work we propose an oscillatory signal analysis method based on a synthetic and simplified model for qualitatively interpreting hydraulic responses of a karstic field to a harmonic pumping test performed at different frequencies this method consists in interpreting the dynamical connectivity information from the responses in terms of topological connectivity within the karstic field in the first section of the manuscript we present the mathematical framework used to simulate numerically in both temporal and frequency domains the groundwater flow responses to a sinusoidal excitation in a fractured aquifer these numerical approaches are applied in the second section to a hypothetical karstic aquifer characterized by the presence of a simple karstic network in the third section we perform signal analysis by comparing point measurements of spatial amplitude decay and phase shift values with respect to the source of the oscillating signal at the pumping well to determine a conduit conduit network dual fissure conduit proximity or matrix flow connectivity finally we apply the same analysis method on real field data acquired on a karstic field located in southern france this signal analysis method permits an easy fast and coherent interpretation of the preferential flow paths location on this site 2 theoretical background in this article we use several terms such as harmonic oscillatory periodic or sinusoidal signals which all refer to the same idea of a signal defined by amplitude a mean value and a period repeating over time the harmonic pumping signal q used in this manuscript is mathematically defined as 1 q t q a cos ω t q m where t is the time s q is the time dependent flow rate signal m3 s qa is the amplitude of the oscillatory portion of the flowrate signal m3 s qm is the flow rate signal mean value m3 s and ω 2 π t is the angular frequency where t denotes the period of the pumping signal s we note that this flow formulation reproduces only the extraction of water with a flow rate sinusoidally fluctuating around the mean value qm this flow rate signal can also be rewritten in a complex form 2 q t q osc t q m with q osc t re q a e i ω t and i representing the imaginary unit in order to describe the hydraulic drawdown responses of a confined karstic aquifer in 2d to a harmonic pumping signal we represent the aquifer in a model domain ω with a coupled discrete continuum concept for more details about the coupled discrete continuum modeling see teutsch 1993 liedl et al 2003 we combine darcy s law and the law of conservation of mass in a 2d matrix domain intact rock containing a 1d discrete conduits domain which gives us the following partial differential equations both defined in the cartesian coordinates dimension 3 s s mat h t k mat h q t v el δ x x s in the 2 d matrix s s cond h t t k cond t h q t v el δ x x s in the 1 d conduits where h represents the hydraulic drawdown which links the 1d and the 2d domains m q is the harmonic pumping rate m3 s in an elementary volume v el m3 of the matrix or the fractures δ x x s represents the dirac distribution where xs denotes the coordinates of the pumping well that can be positioned in the matrix domain or in a conduit s s mat and s s cond are the specific storages in the matrix and the conduits m 1 k mat and k cond are the conductivities in the matrix and the conduits m s and t is the tangential gradient operator for the hydraulic equation in the conduits described as discrete elements at the internal boundaries of the domain both governing equations can be solved numerically by following no drawdowns initial and boundary conditions 4 h x y t 0 x y ω when t 0 h x y t 0 t 0 when x y ω boundary a sufficiently large equivalent porous media buffer zone encloses the model in order to reduce the effects of the boundaries ω boundary on the flows within the model area of interest the nature of the excitation signal applied at the pumping borehole creates hydraulic responses h t composed of a sinusoidal signature hosc t and a non sinusoidal signature hlin t which must be eliminated to deal only with the harmonic component 5 h x y t h osc x y t h lin x y t the hydraulic periodic signature hosc can be expressed in a complex formulation 6 h osc x y t re h ω x y e i ω t where h ω is a complex number representing the wave phasor at the given frequency therefore we can compute numerically the harmonic responses due to the sinusoidal signal of the pumping rate by a reformulation of the time domain groundwater equation in a frequency domain black and kipp 1981 cardiff et al 2013 7 i ω s s mat h ω k mat h ω q a v

reconstructed as 10 h osc x y t a x y cos ω t φ x y π 180 thus the frequency domain solver permits to reproduce periodic time dependent responses while avoiding the use of a time domain solver 3 synthetic application 3 1 model structure in order to interpret drawdown responses to harmonic pumping tests in a real karstic aquifer terrieu southern france we have studied the spatial drawdown responses from a synthetic case model of dimensions 50 m 50 m this synthetic case model was built in consideration of our current understanding of the terrieu karstic field presented more specifically in section 4 1 and our pumping signals during investigations at the field site a simple karstic network is represented in the model as a 1d discrete geometry in a 2d continuum homogeneous matrix fig 1 the homogeneous matrix is associated with a 10 6 m s conductivity value and a 10 4 m 1 specific storage value the karstic network is composed of a large conduit with a 0 1 m s equivalent hydraulic conductivity and two thin conduits with a 0 01 m s equivalent hydraulic conductivity the whole conduit network is associated with a 10 8 m 1 specific storage eight different boreholes have been placed in this model at different strategic positions table 1 three boreholes are located in the large conduit lc p5 p6 p8 two in the thin conduit tc p2 p3 two in the matrix but near to the conduit network m nc p1 p4 and one in the matrix distant from the conduit network m p7 we applied a 5 min period harmonic pumping signal as defined in eq 1 in each of these boreholes alternatively while measuring the drawdown responses in the seven other boreholes different values of pumping amplitudes and mean flow rates were chosen according to the positioning of the pumping borehole in a conduit or the matrix in order to simulate a difference of productivity at each location the synthetic case model is enclosed in a 1 000 m 1 000 m buffer zone with a global 10 3 m s conductivity value and a 10 4 m 1 specific storage value the boundaries of the buffer zone are associated with a no drawdown condition thus the buffer zone reduces boundaries effects on drawdowns simulated within the central area of the model the governing equation eqs 3 and 7 for the simulation in the model were solved with the software comsol multiphysics using a finite element method on a triangular adaptive grid with a mesh refinement around the model discrete structures the linear conduits and the boreholes points presented in fig 1 considering the initial and boundary conditions described in eqs 4 and 8 3 2 modeling in time domain we firstly solved the synthetic case model in the time domain eq 3 the top graphic in fig 2 shows the time domain drawdown response in all boreholes for a harmonic pumping in p3 in a thin conduit except for p7 we notice a periodic signal in the responses of each borehole moreover past the first signal period the drawdown responses can be represented as the sum of a linear drawdown extracted by linear regression and a purely oscillatory signal fig 2 this oscillatory signal can be parameterized for each borehole by a value of amplitude and a value of phase offset in the particular case of p7 its oscillatory signal is almost null 1 mm thus its drawdown response is composed almost exclusively of a linear signal from the observations made in fig 2 the drawdown response at a given position after the first signal period can be mathematically approximated as the sum of a linear function and an oscillatory function 11 h t at h 0 h lin t a cos 2 π t t φ π 180 h osc t h 0 with h m the time domain drawdown response h lin m the linear part of the response with its slope a m min and its intercept values h0 m h osc m the oscillatory part of the response with a m φ and t min its amplitude phase offset and period values and h0 m the initial water level in our synthetic case this value is considered as 0 for the interpretation of the responses we will be more specifically interested in the oscillatory response h osc 3 3 modeling in frequency domain 3 3 1 frequency time domains comparison we also solved the synthetic case in the frequency domain eq 7 in this way instead of spatial drawdown values we calculate the spatial variation of amplitude and phase offset values in the response signal we can then reconstruct for a given position the oscillatory signal h osc in the drawdown response from these amplitude and phase offset values as described in eq 10 by comparing the reconstructed frequency domain signals to the time domain oscillatory ones we show that they are almost identical see the example for pumping in p3 in fig 3 and appendix 1 except for the first signal period see fig 2 in which the time domain signals have not reached a stationary behavior because of the pumping signal oscillating around a non null mean rate we can simulate the same oscillatory responses signals to a harmonic pumping test either with a time domain solver or with a frequency domain solver if we put aside the first period where the time domain responses have not reach their stationary behavior and thus are not reproducible in the frequency domain however in our case the frequency domain solver is more useful as it provides directly the spatial distribution of the oscillatory responses amplitude and phase offset values that interest us for the interpretation part there is no need of signal decomposition as in the time domain simulations the frequency domain solver is also faster than the time domain one as we don t have to simulate different time steps for the simulations on the presented synthetic case the frequency domain solver was approximately 120 times faster than the time domain one therefore for the interpretation of the responses oscillatory signals h osc we have used the frequency domain simulations and more specifically the responses amplitude and phase offset values at the position of the different boreholes 3 3 2 analysis of the harmonic hydraulic responses in order to interpret the spatial responses to harmonic pumping at a point in the karstic synthetic case we have specifically studied the amplitude and phase offset values in these oscillatory signal responses we have observed that depending on the pumping borehole location the responses could be highly variable from fig 4 we first state that the oscillatory signal amplitude response is not proportional to the distance between the measurement points and the pumping point as it would be expected in a purely homogeneous aquifer in our synthetic case the spatial responses were controlled by the degree of connectivity between the pumping point the flow path induced by the pumping and the measurement point in particular cases if the pumping borehole is positioned in the matrix no oscillatory responses can be seen in the other boreholes see case p7 in fig 4 four representative examples of response are presented in fig 4 with the complete table of responses amplitudes and phases offsets for these cases presented in appendix 2 from the analysis of the 8 different pumping cases in the synthetic model if we pump in or near to a conduit three degree of connectivity can be interpreted by comparing the spatial oscillatory responses relatively to the pumping signal amplitude responses associated with a low phase shift see p2 p3 p5 p8 responses for a pumping in p3 or p6 in fig 4 the pumping point is in a conduit and the measurement point has a conduit connection to it through a flow path in the karstic network amplitude responses associated with a high phase shift the measurement point and the pumping point have a dual connection a prevailing part of the flow path follows the karstic network and another part is in the matrix the response phase offset value is proportional to the matrix flow path importance then either the pumping point is in the matrix near to a karstic network see p2 p3 p5 p8 responses for a pumping in p4 in fig 4 or the measurement point is in the matrix near to the network see p1 and p4 responses for a pumping in p3 or p6 or both with a higher phase offset see p1 response for a pumping in p4 negligible amplitude responses almost no oscillatory signal see p7 responses in fig 4 the prevailing part of the flow path between the measurement point and the pumping point is located in the matrix it generates a matrix connection response further information can be interpreted from the relative amplitude value of the measured signals for the responses with the same phase offset if the flow path follows a thin conduit in the network the amplitude of the signal will decrease along the flow path away from the pumping point see the responses in the thin conduit for the pumping case p6 the rate of decay in the responses amplitude becomes less important when the signal reaches more conductive conduits of the network see the amplitude decay of the responses in the large conduit for the pumping case p3 the decay rate is inversely proportional to the conductivity of the conduits the choice of the harmonic pumping period is important for a good interpretation of the oscillatory responses we show in fig 5 the spatial responses signal differences for harmonic pumping in p6 and p3 with a same signal amplitude qa 2 l s but two different periods 1 5 min the main effect of changing the period duration affects specifically the measurement boreholes that have a dual connection to the pumping borehole while the other boreholes will have little consequent response differences decreasing the period from 5 min to 1 min will produce a relative decrease of the amplitude and a relative phase offset increase in the response signal of the boreholes with a dual conduit matrix connection globally this would tend to bring a dual connectivity response closer to a matrix connectivity response this can be clearly seen in the oscillatory responses reconstructed from eq 10 fig 6 for a 1 min pumping period there is no significant signal changes for the boreholes in the conduits but the oscillatory signals for the boreholes in the matrix tend to disappear compared to their responses to a 5 min pumping period signal especially for p1 that becomes closer to the p7 matrix connectivity signal from the previous observation we have studied the evolution of the relative amplitude and phase offset responses more specifically in the points with a dual connection to the network p1 p4 for increasing periods table 2 it appears that the most important factor impacting the responses in these points is their distances to the network independently from the importance of the conduit in which the pumping is performed the more a measurement point is distant from the network the more its phase offset response will evolve with a period change see in table 1 p1 distant from 1 m compared to p4 distant from 50 cm on the contrary the relative amplitude of the response seems to be related to the productivity of the pumping location but is therefore less interesting for delineating the position of the measurement point globally for a good characterization of the conduits positioning it is important to choose at least two different periods in order to compare the evolution of the phase offset in the responses these periods should be sufficiently high to avoid the risks related to a too low amplitude response unreadable response or a phase offset value exceeding one cycle see table 2 that may lead to incorrect interpretations to summarize when pumping in the network studying the amplitude of the responses provides some information about the conductivity of the conduits along the flow path while studying the phase offset of the responses permits to characterize the degree of connectivity between the measurement points a low period pumping high frequency tends to highlight more specifically the boreholes directly connected to the pumping point by conduits network flow propagation a high period pumping low frequency tends to generate responses in boreholes with a conduit or a dual connectivity to the pumping point part of network and part of diffusive flows propagation in order to locate only the boreholes directly connected through the conduit network a high frequency pumping is necessary but adding in combination responses from a lower frequency permits the identification of boreholes close to this network which is useful information for imaging the karstic network arrangement 3 3 3 spatial analysis on simulation maps the previous interpretation of the oscillatory signal responses to pumping signal with a 5 min period can be generalized in maps of spatial distribution of the amplitude fig 7 and phase offset fig 8 responses the case of a pumping in p7 in the matrix in fig 7 shows a typical response map that would be expected from a homogeneous aquifer with an amplitude response decreasing with the distance to the pumping point forming a circle in the case of a pumping in p4 in the matrix this response circle reaches the karstic network and the signal can propagate in the conduits with a subdued amplitude if the pumping point is directly located in a conduit of the network p6 and p3 the oscillatory signal propagates uniquely through the flows of the conduits highlighting the karstic network a linear decrease of the signal amplitude is visible in the thin conduits along the flow path but in the most conductive conduits the signal easily propagates at a site scale without attenuation concerning the spatial phase offset distribution in fig 8 the case of a pumping in p7 in the matrix highlights what would be expected from a homogeneous aquifer the phase offset value varies in function of the distance to the pumping point forming a circle in the figure as this circle reaches the network its homogeneous behavior gets stopped but at this position the signal has already lost its whole amplitude see p7 in fig 7 the same homogeneous behavior can also be seen locally in the case of a pumping in p4 in the matrix but the phase offset variation gets quickly controlled by the conduit s disposition the phase offset remains then roughly constant along the network geometry with a value dependent on the pumping point s distance to the network for a direct pumping in the network p6 p3 independently of the conduits conductivities as long as these conductivities are significantly higher than the matrix there is no significant phase shifting along the conduits of the network for all cases once the signal has reached the karstic network its phase shifting value will stay constant along the conduits but it will increase rapidly in flow paths orthogonal to the conduit conduit to matrix flows the effect of the signal period already described in the previous part can be generalized by using these same maps fig 9 fig 9 shows that a shorter period high frequency highlights more specifically the conduit network the signal amplitude quickly decreases and the phase offset quickly increases when the signal enters the matrix thus the propagation of the signal through diffusive flows in the matrix is almost absent on the contrary a longer period signal can propagate at longer distances along matrix diffusive flows and with less phase shifting which permits the boreholes in the matrix to respond by comparing the cases of p6 in the figure for a 5 min period the diffusive behavior of this signal seems to blur the karstic network in fact the responses associated to boreholes located near the conduits become undistinguishable from the responses of boreholes located directly in the conduits and thus a precise localization of the conduit will become more difficult concretely this behavior is seen for p1 or p4 their responses are close to the ones of in the conduits network for a 5 min period but their responses for a 1 min period clearly show that they are located in the matrix 4 example of harmonic pumping investigation 4 1 site presentation we now apply the lessons learned from our analysis of synthetic data trends to a true field case we have performed an oscillatory pumping test on the well studied terrieu karstic field approximately 2 500 m2 near to montpellier in southern france the oscillations in the pumping rate were controlled by a programmable electrical device based on a dimmer linked to the pump this site has been studied in two recent thesis jazayeri noushabadi 2009 dausse 2015 and several articles jourde et al 2002 jazayeri noushabadi et al 2011 wang et al 2016 wang et al 2017 the property values used in the synthetic model are inspired from conduits fractures matrix and regional property estimations issued from investigations presented in dausse 2015 the terrieu karstic field is part of the medycyss observatory jourde et al 2011 and an experimental site of the french national karst observatory sno karst www sokarst org this site is investigated through 22 boreholes fig 10 and lies on a confined aquifer observed conduits through downhole videos jazayeri noushabadi et al 2011 located between 35 m and 45 m under the surface have been generated at a sloped and fractured interface between marly cretaceous and massive jurassic limestones both units have very low permeability which permits to consider the karstic aquifer to be confined at the time of the field investigation karst features located at the sloped interface were fully saturated these conduits have an aperture that can reach 20 50 cm previous field investigations packer tests temperature and electrical conductivity logging have permitted to highlight a preferential flow path see blue line in fig 10 within this karstified interface crossing several boreholes jazayeri noushabadi 2009 dausse 2015 this preferential flow path could the consequence of a network of conduits directly connecting these points a pumping investigation was conducted with an electronical automata device connected to the pump and generating oscillations in the pumping rate a harmonic pumping test was led for 30 min on the borehole p15 with a period of 5 min with flow rates that varied between 3 2 m3 h and 7 4 m3 h in other words the signal from this pumping can be represented as a constant rate pumping test of magnitude 5 3 m3 h qm convolved with an oscillatory net zero pumping signal with period 5 min and amplitude 2 1 m3 h qa the signal drawdown responses were measured in 12 other boreholes additionally to a measurement in the pumping borehole itself 4 2 example of typical responses the upper graph in fig 11 shows the drawdown measurement in the pumping borehole p15 and example of measured responses in three other boreholes p2 p9 and p10 these three boreholes are approximately at the same distance from the pumping point this graph shows that the field measured responses have the same behavior as the theoretical ones with additional noise the drawdown responses if we pass over the first pumping period can be approximately decomposed as an addition of a purely linear signal and a purely oscillatory signal of the form of eq 10 shown in the lower graph of fig 11 the amplitude and phase offset analysis of the oscillatory signal of the three chosen measured responses examples also show that we have the same type of responses in this field case as seen in the theoretical case responses with measurable amplitude and a low phase offset p2 responses with similar amplitude but a high phase offset p9 and responses that contain no measurable oscillatory component p10 therefore it seems acceptable to test the same interpretation that we made on the theoretical case for the field data 4 3 interpretation of the responses we decomposed the entire set of measured drawdowns following eq 11 in order to keep only their oscillatory signal the oscillatory responses in each borehole are presented in fig 12 we have then fit these oscillatory signals to function of the form of eq 10 with amplitude and phase offset as variable parameters as for the interpretation of the amplitude and phase offset values from the frequency domain modeling of the theoretical case in part 3 3 2 we have produced in fig 13 a map of the measured amplitude and phase offset values from the oscillatory responses to pumping at a point within the karstic network the relative amplitude values of the responses vary between 0 no oscillatory response and 35 and the relative phase offset values vary between 30 and 140 relatively to the pumping signal from downhole observations and productivity estimations on the pumping well p15 jazayeri noushabadi et al 2011 we know that this well is located in a conduit of the network by analyzing the phase offset value we note that the lower phase offset values are around 30 50 and that several points have this same phase shift this would indicate the presence of a network of conduits directly connecting these boreholes conduit connectivity p0 p2 p11 p19 p20 to the pumping point p15 a possible network of conduits is proposed within the zone delineated by the violet dotted boundaries in fig 13 then the other boreholes dual connectivity p1 p5 p9 p21 matrix connectivity p4 p10 would have coherent responses toward this conduit network similar to those seen in the study of the synthetic case dual or matrix connectivity the more a borehole is distant to this possible conduit network the more its response signal relatively to the pumping signal has a low amplitude and a high phase shift for the more distant boreholes p4 and p10 the oscillatory signal disappear which indicate a matrix connectivity only p13 would present an incoherent response with both a high amplitude response and a high phase shift but its true signal was too noisy to permit a good amplitude and phase offset parameters fitting see p13 in fig 12 this incoherent result can be attributed to a bad signal measurement except this point the other 11 measured responses on the field are coherent with the behaviors interpreted in the theoretical study case the conduit connectivity highlighted from the method presented in this article is coherent with the direct connectivity already highlighted from previous investigations blue line in fig 13 which tend to strengthen the validity of this interpretation furthermore p19 which was not found as connected in the previous investigation appears to be directly connected in this work however this connectivity information would require a supplementary validation in the next field campaigns we have finally made quantitative estimation on the property values in the field relatively to each response in order to compare these estimations to the previously found degree of connectivity these estimations were made by finding for each response an equivalent homogeneous model k eq and s s eq reproducing the response amplitude and phase offset the optimization of k eq and s s eq in each case was performed through a classical least square minimization criterion inversion it appears that p0 p2 p11 p20 interpret as connected through conduits and p13 require high k eq values 10 2 10 m s and low s s eq 10 8 10 7 m 1 p5 p9 p21 interpret as dual connectivity responses and p19 interpreted as directly connected require high k eq values 10 3 10 2 m s and high s s eq 10 4 10 3 m 1 finally p1 interpreted as dual connectivity response and p4 and p10 interpreted as a prevailing matrix connection require low k eq values 10 6 m s and high s s eq 10 4 m 1 globally three categories of estimated equivalent properties can also be highlighted and would correspond to the previously described degree of connectivity conduit connectivity high k eq low s s eq dual connectivity high k eq high s s eq and matrix connectivity low k eq high s s eq in this case only p19 appears to be rather connected in a dual manner and p1 rather as a matrix point which nuance the interpretation of some responses at the limit of the defined categories from these results we believe that the qualitative method of interpretation of harmonic signal responses developed in this work can facilitate interpreting the degree of connectivity of karstic field responses to an oscillatory signal especially in order to characterize and localize the conduits network through the boreholes connectivity this interpretation can be led manually as shown in this field example however the next step would be to use this interpretation in an inverse modeling approach associated to a frequency domain modeling and by considering the amplitude and phase offset values of the observed and simulated responses this approach becomes in fact very useful when the amount and complexity of responses to interpret is important the cellular automata based deterministic inversion developed in fischer et al 2017 would provide in this case interesting results as it would permit to generate both adequate conduits network and property distributions conductivity and specific storage for the reproduction of the responses and thus go further in the quantitative analysis of the harmonic data in karstic fields 5 discussion and conclusion we have studied the responses to harmonic pumping in a theoretical synthetic study by applying a time domain solver and a frequency domain solver we have firstly demonstrated that the harmonic result from the frequency domain simulation was very similar to the time domain oscillatory part and thus as the frequency domain solver is much faster it is more useful for the simulation of periodic responses from an analysis of the amplitude and the phase offset of the response relative to the pumping signal and its positioning in the model we have proposed a global method for qualitatively interpreting a degree of hydraulic connectivity between each borehole the amplitude and phase offset values permit to distinguish either a conduit connectivity between boreholes flow path in the conduit network or a dual connectivity flow path partly in the matrix for boreholes near to a conduit but not directly in it or a matrix connectivity majority of flow associated with flow in the matrix by modifying the period of the pumping signal we can dissociate more precisely the conduit connectivity and the connectivity and obtain some information about the distance of a measurement point relatively to the karstic network a high frequency signal will more specifically highlight the conduit flows while a low frequency signal will give more importance to the matrix diffusive flows in previous works renner and messar 2006 and guiltinan and becker 2015 used analytical solutions to show that in a fractured aquifer increasing the pumping period decreased the estimates of effective hydraulic diffusivity due to the increase of the values of estimated storativity while the transmissivity estimations remained almost unchanged which was associated to a mobilization of the surrounding fracture void spaces in our karstic model this observation would be related to the behavior of a well in the matrix near to a conduit where the signal can better propagate within the high storage that represents the matrix when the pumping period is increased as it has been noticed by rabinovich et al 2015 with the use of a heterogeneity model for a porous aquifer flows by extension the harmonic signal will preferentially propagate in the most conductive media especially at lower pumping period which is also what we observe in our karstic model between conduits and matrix flows when pumping at different periods the results we present in this article between amplitude ratio and phase shifting and the degree of connectivity of boreholes show equivalent relations in a more accentuated way than those presented by guiltinan and becker 2015 in a fractured aquifer the harmonic signal will arrive with an important attenuation and phase shift between areas badly connected and on the contrary almost unchanged when fractures or in our case a conduit connect two boreholes in order to test the validity of our signal analysis method we have confronted the same interpretation for a set of responses from a true karstic field to a harmonic pumping the interpretation permitted to delineate the main flow paths easily and quickly by satisfying all measurement this method could be generalized for a manual interpretation of a set of field responses the benefits brought here by the harmonic tests compared to the other connectivity investigations done on the same site packers temperature and electrical conductivity and to constant rate pumping can be found in the easier extraction of the signal in the responses with filtering techniques even when responses are noised and from the possibility to simulate the responses with a modeling in a frequency domain much quicker than the time domain furthermore the possibility of simulating the amplitude and phase offset values in the responses using a frequency domain modeling permits a more affordable application of this interpretation method in an inversion approach we have presented in the field part only the results from one pumping test associated to one period selected from a campaign of pumping tests in which several different boreholes and different period values were tested in order to interpret simultaneously all responses from all harmonic pumping tests we have to use an inverse modeling this technique is already widely used to characterize and quantify the heterogeneity in fractured and karstic fields by interpreting the responses to constant rate pumping hydraulic tomography hao et al 2008 illman et al 2009 castagna et al 2011 illman 2014 zha et al

7435,in a karstic field the flow paths are very complex as they globally follow the conduit network the responses generated from an investigation in this type of aquifer can be spatially highly variable therefore the aim of the investigation in this case is to define a degree of connectivity between points of the field in order to understand these flow paths harmonic pumping tests represent a possible investigation method for characterizing the subsurface flow of groundwater they have several advantages compared to a constant rate pumping more signal possibilities ease of extracting the signal in the responses and possibility of closed loop investigation we show in this work that interpreting the responses from a harmonic pumping test is very useful for delineating a degree of connectivity between measurement points we have firstly studied the amplitude and phase offset of responses from a harmonic pumping test in a theoretical synthetic modeling case in order to define a qualitative interpretation method in the time and frequency domains three different type of responses have been separated a conduit connectivity response a matrix connectivity and a dual connectivity response of a point in the matrix but close to a conduit we have then applied this method to measured responses at a field research site our interpretation method permits a quick and easy reconstruction of the main flow paths and the whole set of field responses appear to give a similar range of responses to those seen in the theoretical synthetic case keywords oscillatory signal heterogeneity characterization aquifer frequency domain karst 1 introduction characterization of the hydrodynamic properties of porous or fractured aquifers is a common challenge in many areas including exploitation and protection of water resources oil production geothermal energy extraction civil engineering remediation engineering and storage of radioactive waste among many approaches tracer tests slug tests geophysical investigations etc this characterization can be accomplished using pumping tests in which the values of the transmissivity and storativity parameters are derived from the analysis of the hydraulic responses to the aquifer stimulation butler 2005 however in field conditions many noise sources are unmanageable hydraulic contributions that can contaminate the signal induced by pumping such as aquifer recharge river aquifer interactions evapotranspiration by plants tidal fluctuations or unplanned unknown pumping at nearby water supply boreholes for example in unconfined aquifers evapotranspiration occurring during pumping tests may result in a spurious signal see e g cardiff et al 2009 to address this difficulty harmonic pumping tests have been suggested as an efficient approach to characterize the hydraulic properties by making the hydraulic signal exploitable even for low signal amplitudes and noises corruptions cardiff and barrash 2015 the oscillations in the hydraulic responses caused by a harmonic excitation with a known frequency can in fact be more easily extracted from the ambient noises by applying filtering techniques bakhos et al 2014 than the hydraulic responses generated by a constant rate pumping harmonic pumping tests also offer the possibility of avoiding the non linear regimes of groundwater flow by controlling the characteristics of the periodic excitation this excitation can be conducted through a pumping reinjection system rasmussen et al 2003 or even without any pumping or injection by only using a moving mass guiltinan and becker 2015 harmonic pulse tests by using cyclic injection rates have also been conducted by sun et al 2015 2016 in a deep subsurface aquifer for leakage detection harmonic pumping tests have been especially investigated for their abilities for characterizing aquifers properties the analysis and interpretation of the harmonic data for a characterization are most often realized with analytical solutions renner and messar 2006 dagan and rabinovich 2014 rabinovich et al 2015 among these attempts black and kipp 1981 proposed solutions for analytical models under the homogeneity assumption to derive the average transmissivity and storativity parameters from harmonic test analysis rasmussen et al 2003 applied an analytical model expressed in frequency form to interpret the piezometric data generated from harmonic pumping tests in a porous contaminated aquifer in order to estimate the average values of the hydraulic properties the numerical models have also been used particularly in the frequency domain instead of the time domain in order to reduce the computing time and to take into account the spatial heterogeneity of the hydraulic properties black and kipp 1981 cardiff et al 2013 modeling and imaging potential of harmonic pumping tests data were also already addressed in the literature for the reconstruction of the spatial variability of hydraulic properties lavenue and de marsily 2001 cardiff et al 2013 zhou et al 2016 soueid ahmed et al 2016 some works have focused more specifically on the capacity of harmonic pumping for characterizing fractured aquifers renner and messar 2006 applied harmonic pumping tests on a fractured sandstone aquifer to deduce the average values of transmissivity and storativity fields using a cyclical hydraulic excitation by alternating pumping no flow and injection periods at the same study site maineult et al 2008 used the self potential method to monitor remotely at the ground surface the piezometric fluctuations caused by these harmonic excitations more recently guiltinan and becker 2015 similarly conducted periodic slug tests on isolated fractures without any extraction or injection only by oscillating a slug at different depths of the water column in the well to characterize the hydraulic connectivity of the fracture using analysis of phase shift and attenuation of the signal with an analytical model schuite et al 2017 used tilt data recorded at the ground surface to follow the oscillatory deformations induced by harmonic pulses performed in a fractured aquifer among the works previously cited and dealing with this subject none have sought to model the impact of spatial high contrasts of hydraulic property variations on oscillatory testing in karstic aquifers where low transmissivity host rocks are directly adjacent to sparsely distributed high transmissivity fractures and conduits such a scenario is clearly present and leads to flow paths particularly constrained wells in karstic aquifers therefore may be expected to have drastically different responses depending on whether they are located on or near a fracture or a conduit in fact the main flow paths in subsurface karstic field follow the conduit and fracture network and one would need to have an idea of its positioning for understanding the flow behavior white 2002 saller et al 2013 commonly karstic fields are described by their connectivity whether the flows between wells follows a highly conductive path or not jazayeri noushabadi et al 2011 defined three types of hydrodynamic response to pumping and pulse tests as a function of the degree of conductivity of the flow path network in the investigated karstic aquifer the authors assumed that a short time lag and a high amplitude hydrodynamic response conduit type hydrodynamic response was the consequence of a high permeability and high connectivity between the observation well and the main flow path network karst conduits that generate the large scale permeability of the aquifer while fracture type and matrix type hydrodynamic responses were related to both a lower permeability and lower connectivity between the observation wells and the main flow path network to be more consistent with previous works this connectivity must be defined in term of property distribution as a static or topological connectivity and in term of physical flow transport processes as a dynamical connectivity renard and allard 2013 tyukhova and willmann 2016 in this work we propose an oscillatory signal analysis method based on a synthetic and simplified model for qualitatively interpreting hydraulic responses of a karstic field to a harmonic pumping test performed at different frequencies this method consists in interpreting the dynamical connectivity information from the responses in terms of topological connectivity within the karstic field in the first section of the manuscript we present the mathematical framework used to simulate numerically in both temporal and frequency domains the groundwater flow responses to a sinusoidal excitation in a fractured aquifer these numerical approaches are applied in the second section to a hypothetical karstic aquifer characterized by the presence of a simple karstic network in the third section we perform signal analysis by comparing point measurements of spatial amplitude decay and phase shift values with respect to the source of the oscillating signal at the pumping well to determine a conduit conduit network dual fissure conduit proximity or matrix flow connectivity finally we apply the same analysis method on real field data acquired on a karstic field located in southern france this signal analysis method permits an easy fast and coherent interpretation of the preferential flow paths location on this site 2 theoretical background in this article we use several terms such as harmonic oscillatory periodic or sinusoidal signals which all refer to the same idea of a signal defined by amplitude a mean value and a period repeating over time the harmonic pumping signal q used in this manuscript is mathematically defined as 1 q t q a cos ω t q m where t is the time s q is the time dependent flow rate signal m3 s qa is the amplitude of the oscillatory portion of the flowrate signal m3 s qm is the flow rate signal mean value m3 s and ω 2 π t is the angular frequency where t denotes the period of the pumping signal s we note that this flow formulation reproduces only the extraction of water with a flow rate sinusoidally fluctuating around the mean value qm this flow rate signal can also be rewritten in a complex form 2 q t q osc t q m with q osc t re q a e i ω t and i representing the imaginary unit in order to describe the hydraulic drawdown responses of a confined karstic aquifer in 2d to a harmonic pumping signal we represent the aquifer in a model domain ω with a coupled discrete continuum concept for more details about the coupled discrete continuum modeling see teutsch 1993 liedl et al 2003 we combine darcy s law and the law of conservation of mass in a 2d matrix domain intact rock containing a 1d discrete conduits domain which gives us the following partial differential equations both defined in the cartesian coordinates dimension 3 s s mat h t k mat h q t v el δ x x s in the 2 d matrix s s cond h t t

the matrix or the fractures δ x x s represents the dirac distribution where xs denotes the coordinates of the pumping well that can be positioned in the matrix domain or in a conduit s s mat and s s cond are the specific storages in the matrix and the conduits m 1 k mat and k cond are the conductivities in the matrix and the conduits m s and t is the tangential gradient operator for the hydraulic equation in the conduits described as discrete elements at the internal boundaries of the domain both governing equations can be solved numerically by following no drawdowns initial and boundary conditions 4 h x y t 0 x y ω when t 0 h x y t 0 t 0 when x y ω boundary a sufficiently large equivalent porous media buffer zone encloses the model in order to reduce the effects of the boundaries ω boundary on the flows within the model area of interest the nature of the excitation signal applied at the pumping borehole creates hydraulic responses h t composed of a sinusoidal signature hosc t and a non sinusoidal signature hlin t which must be eliminated to deal only with the harmonic component 5 h x y t h osc x y t h lin x y t the hydraulic periodic signature hosc can be expressed in a complex formulation 6 h osc x y t re h ω x y e i ω t where h ω is a complex number representing the wave phasor at the given frequency therefore we can compute numerically the harmonic responses due to the sinusoidal signal of the pumping rate by a reformulation of the time domain groundwater equation in a frequency domain black and kipp 1981 cardiff et al 2013 7 i ω s s mat h ω k mat h ω q a v

reconstructed as 10 h osc x y t a x y cos ω t φ x y π 180 thus the frequency domain solver permits to reproduce periodic time dependent responses while avoiding the use of a time domain solver 3 synthetic application 3 1 model structure in order to interpret drawdown responses to harmonic pumping tests in a real karstic aquifer terrieu southern france we have studied the spatial drawdown responses from a synthetic case model of dimensions 50 m 50 m this synthetic case model was built in consideration of our current understanding of the terrieu karstic field presented more specifically in section 4 1 and our pumping signals during investigations at the field site a simple karstic network is represented in the model as a 1d discrete geometry in a 2d continuum homogeneous matrix fig 1 the homogeneous matrix is associated with a 10 6 m s conductivity value and a 10 4 m 1 specific storage value the karstic network is composed of a large conduit with a 0 1 m s equivalent hydraulic conductivity and two thin conduits with a 0 01 m s equivalent hydraulic conductivity the whole conduit network is associated with a 10 8 m 1 specific storage eight different boreholes have been placed in this model at different strategic positions table 1 three boreholes are located in the large conduit lc p5 p6 p8 two in the thin conduit tc p2 p3 two in the matrix but near to the conduit network m nc p1 p4 and one in the matrix distant from the conduit network m p7 we applied a 5 min period harmonic pumping signal as defined in eq 1 in each of these boreholes alternatively while measuring the drawdown responses in the seven other boreholes different values of pumping amplitudes and mean flow rates were chosen according to the positioning of the pumping borehole in a conduit or the matrix in order to simulate a difference of productivity at each location the synthetic case model is enclosed in a 1 000 m 1 000 m buffer zone with a global 10 3 m s conductivity value and a 10 4 m 1 specific storage value the boundaries of the buffer zone are associated with a no drawdown condition thus the buffer zone reduces boundaries effects on drawdowns simulated within the central area of the model the governing equation eqs 3 and 7 for the simulation in the model were solved with the software comsol multiphysics using a finite element method on a triangular adaptive grid with a mesh refinement around the model discrete structures the linear conduits and the boreholes points presented in fig 1 considering the initial and boundary conditions described in eqs 4 and 8 3 2 modeling in time domain we firstly solved the synthetic case model in the time domain eq 3 the top graphic in fig 2 shows the time domain drawdown response in all boreholes for a harmonic pumping in p3 in a thin conduit except for p7 we notice a periodic signal in the responses of each borehole moreover past the first signal period the drawdown responses can be represented as the sum of a linear drawdown extracted by linear regression and a purely oscillatory signal fig 2 this oscillatory signal can be parameterized for each borehole by a value of amplitude and a value of phase offset in the particular case of p7 its oscillatory signal is almost null 1 mm thus its drawdown response is composed almost exclusively of a linear signal from the observations made in fig 2 the drawdown response at a given position after the first signal period can be mathematically approximated as the sum of a linear function and an oscillatory function 11 h t at h 0 h lin t a cos 2 π t t φ π 180 h osc t h 0 with h m the time domain drawdown response h lin m the linear part of the response with its slope a m min and its intercept values h0 m h osc m the oscillatory part of the response with a m φ and t min its amplitude phase offset and period values and h0 m the initial water level in our synthetic case this value is considered as 0 for the interpretation of the responses we will be more specifically interested in the oscillatory response h osc 3 3 modeling in frequency domain 3 3 1 frequency time domains comparison we also solved the synthetic case in the frequency domain eq 7 in this way instead of spatial drawdown values we calculate the spatial variation of amplitude and phase offset values in the response signal we can then reconstruct for a given position the oscillatory signal h osc in the drawdown response from these amplitude and phase offset values as described in eq 10 by comparing the reconstructed frequency domain signals to the time domain oscillatory ones we show that they are almost identical see the example for pumping in p3 in fig 3 and appendix 1 except for the first signal period see fig 2 in which the time domain signals have not reached a stationary behavior because of the pumping signal oscillating around a non null mean rate we can simulate the same oscillatory responses signals to a harmonic pumping test either with a time domain solver or with a frequency domain solver if we put aside the first period where the time domain responses have not reach their stationary behavior and thus are not reproducible in the frequency domain however in our case the frequency domain solver is more useful as it provides directly the spatial distribution of the oscillatory responses amplitude and phase offset values that interest us for the interpretation part there is no need of signal decomposition as in the time domain simulations the frequency domain solver is also faster than the time domain one as we don t have to simulate different time steps for the simulations on the presented synthetic case the frequency domain solver was approximately 120 times faster than the time domain one therefore for the interpretation of the responses oscillatory signals h osc we have used the frequency domain simulations and more specifically the responses amplitude and phase offset values at the position of the different boreholes 3 3 2 analysis of the harmonic hydraulic responses in order to interpret the spatial responses to harmonic pumping at a point in the karstic synthetic case we have specifically studied the amplitude and phase offset values in these oscillatory signal responses we have observed that depending on the pumping borehole location the responses could be highly variable from fig 4 we first state that the oscillatory signal amplitude response is not proportional to the distance between the measurement points and the pumping point as it would be expected in a purely homogeneous aquifer in our synthetic case the spatial responses were controlled by the degree of connectivity between the pumping point the flow path induced by the pumping and the measurement point in particular cases if the pumping borehole is positioned in the matrix no oscillatory responses can be seen in the other boreholes see case p7 in fig 4 four representative examples of response are presented in fig 4 with the complete table of responses amplitudes and phases offsets for these cases presented in appendix 2 from the analysis of the 8 different pumping cases in the synthetic model if we pump in or near to a conduit three degree of connectivity can be interpreted by comparing the spatial oscillatory responses relatively to the pumping signal amplitude responses associated with a low phase shift see p2 p3 p5 p8 responses for a pumping in p3 or p6 in fig 4 the pumping point is in a conduit and the measurement point has a conduit connection to it through a flow path in the karstic network amplitude responses associated with a high phase shift the measurement point and the pumping point have a dual connection a prevailing part of the flow path follows the karstic network and another part is in the matrix the response phase offset value is proportional to the matrix flow path importance then either the pumping point is in the matrix near to a karstic network see p2 p3 p5 p8 responses for a pumping in p4 in fig 4 or the measurement point is in the matrix near to the network see p1 and p4 responses for a pumping in p3 or p6 or both with a higher phase offset see p1 response for a pumping in p4 negligible amplitude responses almost no oscillatory signal see p7 responses in fig 4 the prevailing part of the flow path between the measurement point and the pumping point is located in the matrix it generates a matrix connection response further information can be interpreted from the relative amplitude value of the measured signals for the responses with the same phase offset if the flow path follows a thin conduit in the network the amplitude of the signal will decrease along the flow path away from the pumping point see the responses in the thin conduit for the pumping case p6 the rate of decay in the responses amplitude becomes less important when the signal reaches more conductive conduits of the network see the amplitude decay of the responses in the large conduit for the pumping case p3 the decay rate is inversely proportional to the conductivity of the conduits the choice of the harmonic pumping period is important for a good interpretation of the oscillatory responses we show in fig 5 the spatial responses signal differences for harmonic pumping in p6 and p3 with a same signal amplitude qa 2 l s but two different periods 1 5 min the main effect of changing the period duration affects specifically the measurement boreholes that have a dual connection to the pumping borehole while the other boreholes will have little consequent response differences decreasing the period from 5 min to 1 min will produce a relative decrease of the amplitude and a relative phase offset increase in the response signal of the boreholes with a dual conduit matrix connection globally this would tend to bring a dual connectivity response closer to a matrix connectivity response this can be clearly seen in the oscillatory responses reconstructed from eq 10 fig 6 for a 1 min pumping period there is no significant signal changes for the boreholes in the conduits but the oscillatory signals for the boreholes in the matrix tend to disappear compared to their responses to a 5 min pumping period signal especially for p1 that becomes closer to the p7 matrix connectivity signal from the previous observation we have studied the evolution of the relative amplitude and phase offset responses more specifically in the points with a dual connection to the network p1 p4 for increasing periods table 2 it appears that the most important factor impacting the responses in these points is their distances to the network independently from the importance of the conduit in which the pumping is performed the more a measurement point is distant from the network the more its phase offset response will evolve with a period change see in table 1 p1 distant from 1 m compared to p4 distant from 50 cm on the contrary the relative amplitude of the response seems to be related to the productivity of the pumping location but is therefore less interesting for delineating the position of the measurement point globally for a good characterization of the conduits positioning it is important to choose at least two different periods in order to compare the evolution of the phase offset in the responses these periods should be sufficiently high to avoid the risks related to a too low amplitude response unreadable response or a phase offset value exceeding one cycle see table 2 that may lead to incorrect interpretations to summarize when pumping in the network studying the amplitude of the responses provides some information about the conductivity of the conduits along the flow path while studying the phase offset of the responses permits to characterize the degree of connectivity between the measurement points a low period pumping high frequency tends to highlight more specifically the boreholes directly connected to the pumping point by conduits network flow propagation a high period pumping low frequency tends to generate responses in boreholes with a conduit or a dual connectivity to the pumping point part of network and part of diffusive flows propagation in order to locate only the boreholes directly connected through the conduit network a high frequency pumping is necessary but adding in combination responses from a lower frequency permits the identification of boreholes close to this network which is useful information for imaging the karstic network arrangement 3 3 3 spatial analysis on simulation maps the previous interpretation of the oscillatory signal responses to pumping signal with a 5 min period can be generalized in maps of spatial distribution of the amplitude fig 7 and phase offset fig 8 responses the case of a pumping in p7 in the matrix in fig 7 shows a typical response map that would be expected from a homogeneous aquifer with an amplitude response decreasing with the distance to the pumping point forming a circle in the case of a pumping in p4 in the matrix this response circle reaches the karstic network and the signal can propagate in the conduits with a subdued amplitude if the pumping point is directly located in a conduit of the network p6 and p3 the oscillatory signal propagates uniquely through the flows of the conduits highlighting the karstic network a linear decrease of the signal amplitude is visible in the thin conduits along the flow path but in the most conductive conduits the signal easily propagates at a site scale without attenuation concerning the spatial phase offset distribution in fig 8 the case of a pumping in p7 in the matrix highlights what would be expected from a homogeneous aquifer the phase offset value varies in function of the distance to the pumping point forming a circle in the figure as this circle reaches the network its homogeneous behavior gets stopped but at this position the signal has already lost its whole amplitude see p7 in fig 7 the same homogeneous behavior can also be seen locally in the case of a pumping in p4 in the matrix but the phase offset variation gets quickly controlled by the conduit s disposition the phase offset remains then roughly constant along the network geometry with a value dependent on the pumping point s distance to the network for a direct pumping in the network p6 p3 independently of the conduits conductivities as long as these conductivities are significantly higher than the matrix there is no significant phase shifting along the conduits of the network for all cases once the signal has reached the karstic network its phase shifting value will stay constant along the conduits but it will increase rapidly in flow paths orthogonal to the conduit conduit to matrix flows the effect of the signal period already described in the previous part can be generalized by using these same maps fig 9 fig 9 shows that a shorter period high frequency highlights more specifically the conduit network the signal amplitude quickly decreases and the phase offset quickly increases when the signal enters the matrix thus the propagation of the signal through diffusive flows in the matrix is almost absent on the contrary a longer period signal can propagate at longer distances along matrix diffusive flows and with less phase shifting which permits the boreholes in the matrix to respond by comparing the cases of p6 in the figure for a 5 min period the diffusive behavior of this signal seems to blur the karstic network in fact the responses associated to boreholes located near the conduits become undistinguishable from the responses of boreholes located directly in the conduits and thus a precise localization of the conduit will become more difficult concretely this behavior is seen for p1 or p4 their responses are close to the ones of in the conduits network for a 5 min period but their responses for a 1 min period clearly show that they are located in the matrix 4 example of harmonic pumping investigation 4 1 site presentation we now apply the lessons learned from our analysis of synthetic data trends to a true field case we have performed an oscillatory pumping test on the well studied terrieu karstic field approximately 2 500 m2 near to montpellier in southern france the oscillations in the pumping rate were controlled by a programmable electrical device based on a dimmer linked to the pump this site has been studied in two recent thesis jazayeri noushabadi 2009 dausse 2015 and several articles jourde et al 2002 jazayeri noushabadi et al 2011 wang et al 2016 wang et al 2017 the property values used in the synthetic model are inspired from conduits fractures matrix and regional property estimations issued from investigations presented in dausse 2015 the terrieu karstic field is part of the medycyss observatory jourde et al 2011 and an experimental site of the french national karst observatory sno karst www sokarst org this site is investigated through 22 boreholes fig 10 and lies on a confined aquifer observed conduits through downhole videos jazayeri noushabadi et al 2011 located between 35 m and 45 m under the surface have been generated at a sloped and fractured interface between marly cretaceous and massive jurassic limestones both units have very low permeability which permits to consider the karstic aquifer to be confined at the time of the field investigation karst features located at the sloped interface were fully saturated these conduits have an aperture that can reach 20 50 cm previous field investigations packer tests temperature and electrical conductivity logging have permitted to highlight a preferential flow path see blue line in fig 10 within this karstified interface crossing several boreholes jazayeri noushabadi 2009 dausse 2015 this preferential flow path could the consequence of a network of conduits directly connecting these points a pumping investigation was conducted with an electronical automata device connected to the pump and generating oscillations in the pumping rate a harmonic pumping test was led for 30 min on the borehole p15 with a period of 5 min with flow rates that varied between 3 2 m3 h and 7 4 m3 h in other words the signal from this pumping can be represented as a constant rate pumping test of magnitude 5 3 m3 h qm convolved with an oscillatory net zero pumping signal with period 5 min and amplitude 2 1 m3 h qa the signal drawdown responses were measured in 12 other boreholes additionally to a measurement in the pumping borehole itself 4 2 example of typical responses the upper graph in fig 11 shows the drawdown measurement in the pumping borehole p15 and example of measured responses in three other boreholes p2 p9 and p10 these three boreholes are approximately at the same distance from the pumping point this graph shows that the field measured responses have the same behavior as the theoretical ones with additional noise the drawdown responses if we pass over the first pumping period can be approximately decomposed as an addition of a purely linear signal and a purely oscillatory signal of the form of eq 10 shown in the lower graph of fig 11 the amplitude and phase offset analysis of the oscillatory signal of the three chosen measured responses examples also show that we have the same type of responses in this field case as seen in the theoretical case responses with measurable amplitude and a low phase offset p2 responses with similar amplitude but a high phase offset p9 and responses that contain no measurable oscillatory component p10 therefore it seems acceptable to test the same interpretation that we made on the theoretical case for the field data 4 3 interpretation of the responses we decomposed the entire set of measured drawdowns following eq 11 in order to keep only their oscillatory signal the oscillatory responses in each borehole are presented in fig 12 we have then fit these oscillatory signals to function of the form of eq 10 with amplitude and phase offset as variable parameters as for the interpretation of the amplitude and phase offset values from the frequency domain modeling of the theoretical case in part 3 3 2 we have produced in fig 13 a map of the measured amplitude and phase offset values from the oscillatory responses to pumping at a point within the karstic network the relative amplitude values of the responses vary between 0 no oscillatory response and 35 and the relative phase offset values vary between 30 and 140 relatively to the pumping signal from downhole observations and productivity estimations on the pumping well p15 jazayeri noushabadi et al 2011 we know that this well is located in a conduit of the network by analyzing the phase offset value we note that the lower phase offset values are around 30 50 and that several points have this same phase shift this would indicate the presence of a network of conduits directly connecting these boreholes conduit connectivity p0 p2 p11 p19 p20 to the pumping point p15 a possible network of conduits is proposed within the zone delineated by the violet dotted boundaries in fig 13 then the other boreholes dual connectivity p1 p5 p9 p21 matrix connectivity p4 p10 would have coherent responses toward this conduit network similar to those seen in the study of the synthetic case dual or matrix connectivity the more a borehole is distant to this possible conduit network the more its response signal relatively to the pumping signal has a low amplitude and a high phase shift for the more distant boreholes p4 and p10 the oscillatory signal disappear which indicate a matrix connectivity only p13 would present an incoherent response with both a high amplitude response and a high phase shift but its true signal was too noisy to permit a good amplitude and phase offset parameters fitting see p13 in fig 12 this incoherent result can be attributed to a bad signal measurement except this point the other 11 measured responses on the field are coherent with the behaviors interpreted in the theoretical study case the conduit connectivity highlighted from the method presented in this article is coherent with the direct connectivity already highlighted from previous investigations blue line in fig 13 which tend to strengthen the validity of this interpretation furthermore p19 which was not found as connected in the previous investigation appears to be directly connected in this work however this connectivity information would require a supplementary validation in the next field campaigns we have finally made quantitative estimation on the property values in the field relatively to each response in order to compare these estimations to the previously found degree of connectivity these estimations were made by finding for each response an equivalent homogeneous model k eq and s s eq reproducing the response amplitude and phase offset the optimization of k eq and s s eq in each case was performed through a classical least square minimization criterion inversion it appears that p0 p2 p11 p20 interpret as connected through conduits and p13 require high k eq values 10 2 10 m s and low s s eq 10 8 10 7 m 1 p5 p9 p21 interpret as dual connectivity responses and p19 interpreted as directly connected require high k eq values 10 3 10 2 m s and high s s eq 10 4 10 3 m 1 finally p1 interpreted as dual connectivity response and p4 and p10 interpreted as a prevailing matrix connection require low k eq values 10 6 m s and high s s eq 10 4 m 1 globally three categories of estimated equivalent properties can also be highlighted and would correspond to the previously described degree of connectivity conduit connectivity high k eq low s s eq dual connectivity high k eq high s s eq and matrix connectivity low k eq high s s eq in this case only p19 appears to be rather connected in a dual manner and p1 rather as a matrix point which nuance the interpretation of some responses at the limit of the defined categories from these results we believe that the qualitative method of interpretation of harmonic signal responses developed in this work can facilitate interpreting the degree of connectivity of karstic field responses to an oscillatory signal especially in order to characterize and localize the conduits network through the boreholes connectivity this interpretation can be led manually as shown in this field example however the next step would be to use this interpretation in an inverse modeling approach associated to a frequency domain modeling and by considering the amplitude and phase offset values of the observed and simulated responses this approach becomes in fact very useful when the amount and complexity of responses to interpret is important the cellular automata based deterministic inversion developed in fischer et al 2017 would provide in this case interesting results as it would permit to generate both adequate conduits network and property distributions conductivity and specific storage for the reproduction of the responses and thus go further in the quantitative analysis of the harmonic data in karstic fields 5 discussion and conclusion we have studied the responses to harmonic pumping in a theoretical synthetic study by applying a time domain solver and a frequency domain solver we have firstly demonstrated that the harmonic result from the frequency domain simulation was very similar to the time domain oscillatory part and thus as the frequency domain solver is much faster it is more useful for the simulation of periodic responses from an analysis of the amplitude and the phase offset of the response relative to the pumping signal and its positioning in the model we have proposed a global method for qualitatively interpreting a degree of hydraulic connectivity between each borehole the amplitude and phase offset values permit to distinguish either a conduit connectivity between boreholes flow path in the conduit network or a dual connectivity flow path partly in the matrix for boreholes near to a conduit but not directly in it or a matrix connectivity majority of flow associated with flow in the matrix by modifying the period of the pumping signal we can dissociate more precisely the conduit connectivity and the connectivity and obtain some information about the distance of a measurement point relatively to the karstic network a high frequency signal will more specifically highlight the conduit flows while a low frequency signal will give more importance to the matrix diffusive flows in previous works renner and messar 2006 and guiltinan and becker 2015 used analytical solutions to show that in a fractured aquifer increasing the pumping period decreased the estimates of effective hydraulic diffusivity due to the increase of the values of estimated storativity while the transmissivity estimations remained almost unchanged which was associated to a mobilization of the surrounding fracture void spaces in our karstic model this observation would be related to the behavior of a well in the matrix near to a conduit where the signal can better propagate within the high storage that represents the matrix when the pumping period is increased as it has been noticed by rabinovich et al 2015 with the use of a heterogeneity model for a porous aquifer flows by extension the harmonic signal will preferentially propagate in the most conductive media especially at lower pumping period which is also what we observe in our karstic model between conduits and matrix flows when pumping at different periods the results we present in this article between amplitude ratio and phase shifting and the degree of connectivity of boreholes show equivalent relations in a more accentuated way than those presented by guiltinan and becker 2015 in a fractured aquifer the harmonic signal will arrive with an important attenuation and phase shift between areas badly connected and on the contrary almost unchanged when fractures or in our case a conduit connect two boreholes in order to test the validity of our signal analysis method we have confronted the same interpretation for a set of responses from a true karstic field to a harmonic pumping the interpretation permitted to delineate the main flow paths easily and quickly by satisfying all measurement this method could be generalized for a manual interpretation of a set of field responses the benefits brought here by the harmonic tests compared to the other connectivity investigations done on the same site packers temperature and electrical conductivity and to constant rate pumping can be found in the easier extraction of the signal in the responses with filtering techniques even when responses are noised and from the possibility to simulate the responses with a modeling in a frequency domain much quicker than the time domain furthermore the possibility of simulating the amplitude and phase offset values in the responses using a frequency domain modeling permits a more affordable application of this interpretation method in an inversion approach we have presented in the field part only the results from one pumping test associated to one period selected from a campaign of pumping tests in which several different boreholes and different period values were tested in order to interpret simultaneously all responses from all harmonic pumping tests we have to use an inverse modeling this technique is already widely used to characterize and quantify the heterogeneity in fractured and karstic fields by interpreting the responses to constant rate pumping hydraulic tomography hao et al 2008 illman et al 2009 castagna et al 2011 illman 2014 zha et al 2016 wang et al 2017 in a future work we plan to focus more specifically our discussion on the quantitative analysis of the harmonic pumping responses in a karstic field by associating them to a conduit network hydraulic imagery based on an inverse modeling approach and its ability to reproduce the complete set of responses with a given distribution of properties conflict of interest none

7436,cosmic ray neutron probes crnps have footprint radii for measuring soil water content swc the theoretical radius is much larger at high altitude such as the northern tibetan plateau than the radius at sea level the most probable practical radius of crnps for the northern tibetan plateau however is not known due to the lack of swc data in this hostile environment we calculated the theoretical footprint of the crnp based on a recent simulation and analyzed the practical radius of a crnp for the northern tibetan plateau by measuring swc at 113 sampling locations on 21 measuring occasions to a depth of 30 cm in a 33 5 ha plot in an alpine meadow at 4600 m a s l the temporal variability and spatial heterogeneity of swc within the footprint were then analyzed the theoretical footprint radius was between 360 and 420 m after accounting for the influences of air humidity soil moisture vegetation and air pressure a comparison of swcs measured by the crnp and a neutron probe from access tubes in circles with different radii conservatively indicated that the most probable experimental footprint radius was 200 m swc within the crnp footprint was moderately variable over both time and space but the temporal variability was higher spatial heterogeneity was weak but should be considered in future crnp calibrations this study provided theoretical and practical bases for the application and promotion of crnps in alpine meadows on the tibetan plateau keywords soil water content cosmic ray neutron probe footprint radius spatial heterogeneity alpine meadow 1 introduction soil water is an important component of the terrestrial hydrological cycle soil water accounts only for 0 05 of the fresh water on earth but it sustains terrestrial biological existence and production and the stable development of terrestrial ecosystems vereecken et al 2015 soil water is also a key state variable controlling the exchange of vapor and energy between land and atmosphere and thus has a critical influence on ecological and hydrological processes such as surface runoff rainwater infiltration and evapotranspiration vereecken et al 2014 the tibetan plateau is the highest geographical unit on earth with a mean elevation 4000 m a s l meadows developed in this high cold and oxygen deficient environment are fragile and sensitive to climate change the ecological environment of the tibetan plateau has changed profoundly in recent decades due to the dual influence of climate change and human activity zhang et al 2015b it became warmer and wetter during 1982 2001 which has increased vegetation coverage and net primary productivity the plateau however had a warming and drying trend during 2001 2011 due to a change in the rainfall pattern zhang et al 2015a soil water has become especially important for the restoration and healthy development of degraded meadows soil water has been extensively studied on the tibetan plateau in recent decades mainly by probe in situ observation and remote sensing in regional scale studies respectively zhu and shao 2015 studies at hectometer scales however are rare but could serve as bridges for scale transformation and could provide accurate non point data for calibrating the results of remote sensing inversion cosmic ray neutron probes crnps are an effective tool for hectometer scale measurements of soil water content swc filling the gap between point observation and remote sensing inversion and has the advantages of being automatic and non destructive crnps have been evaluated and successfully applied in many kinds of ecosystems including farmland han et al 2015 forest heidbüchel et al 2016 nguyen et al 2017 grassland peterson et al 2016 desert schreiner mcgraw et al 2016 and even alpine schattan et al 2017 ecosystems the application has also been evaluated on the third pole of the earth the tibetan plateau zhu et al 2016 2017 zhu et al 2016 2017 reported a high correlation coefficient r 0 938 and low root mean square error rmse 2 1 for swcs determined from oven dried soil samples and swcs measured by crnp demonstrating the good accuracy and applicability of crnps in an alpine meadow on the northern tibetan plateau identifying the practical range of instruments in different areas is important for maximizing accuracy and developing methods in the ecological hydrological and geophysical sciences crnps also have footprints the theoretical footprint of a crnp is defined as the region that contains 86 of the detected neutrons zreda et al 2008 proposed a theoretical footprint of crnps using a neutron transport model based on the monte carlo method desilets and zreda 2013 later reported that the footprint radius of a crnp was ca 300 m at sea level using the same model under several simplified assumptions köhli et al 2015 reported radii of 130 240 m at sea level which were mainly influenced by swc air humidity and vegetation using a refined cosmic ray neutron source and energy spectrum as is reported the radius of a crnp can also be influenced by elevation zreda et al 2012 desilets and zreda 2013 köhli et al 2015 based on the theory proposed by zreda et al 2012 and desilets and zreda 2013 the radius of a crnp was 25 larger at 3000 m a s l than at sea level zhu et al 2016 2017 also calculated a theoretical radius of ca 580 m for an alpine meadow ecosystem at 4600 m a s l nearly two fold larger than the radius at sea level which was due to the less probability of neutrons to interact with air molecules in less dense air köhli et al 2015 the radius however was only a simple estimate the new theoretical footprint radius accounting for air humidity swc vegetation and air pressure based on the simulation of köhli et al 2015 in the same study area should be updated and the most probable practical footprint radius also requires further study in this study we measured swc in a network of neutron access tubes in an alpine meadow in two consecutive growing seasons on the northern tibetan plateau and compared it with swc measured by a crnp the objectives of this study were to 1 determine the theoretical footprint of the crnp based on a recent simulation 2 identify the most probable practical footprint radius of the crnp in the meadow based on swc measured by a neutron probe and 3 analyze the temporal variability and spatial heterogeneity of swc within the crnp footprint 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in an alpine meadow on the northern tibetan plateau 31 38 38 58 n 92 00 51 34 e fig 1 a near nagqu prefecture at an elevation of ca 4600 m a s l the study area has a sub frigid and semi humid monsoon climate with cold and long winters and cool and short summers the soil is frozen from october to may and the growing season is very short only from june to august the annual mean air temperature is 0 5 c with the lowest monthly mean temperature of 9 5 c january and the highest of 10 4 c july the annual mean rainfall is 455 8 mm with 64 falling during the growing season the air is thin due to the high elevation with a mean pressure of only 58 7 kpa vegetation in this area is typical of alpine meadows with kobresia pygmaea the dominant species and accompanied by potentilla spp leontopodium pusillum carex moorcroftii and stipa purpurea which are all annual herbs the soil is typical alpine meadows soil and is classified as sandy and sandy clayey loams according to the world soil texture classification an irregular polygonal fence fig 1b was built as the boundary of a sample plot to prevent grazing by yaks and goats the plot was 530 770 m long from southeast to northwest and 480 580 m wide from southwest to northeast and had a total area of 33 5 ha the terrain was flat with the largest relative elevation of ca 11 m the plot sloped gently from northwest to southeast 2 2 experimental design and data acquisition a cosmic ray soil moisture observing system probe science and technology llc beijing china was installed in the middle of the study plot in may 2015 fig 1b and c the system uses a cylindrical probe filled with helium gas to detect neutron density a datalogger cr800 campbell scientific utah usa to record the neutrons and meteorological i e air temperature data and a solar panel and accumulator 12 v to provide energy more detailed information about the system is provided by zhu et al 2017 the system began operation on 24 may 2015 with a constant data acquisition step of 1 h data for more than two years were obtained the soil in the study area is thawed from june to august when swc varies greatly with precipitation and temperature crnp data from 15 june to 2 september 2015 and from 5 june to 1 september 2016 were thus used for analysis in this study point swc data were collected using a neutron probe cnc idr r one hundred and thirteen neutron access tubes 75 cm in length were inserted into the soil in a grid of 50 m 60 m in the plot in early june 2015 the locations were denoted as l1 to l113 most of the tubes extended 15 cm above the ground and 60 cm into the ground swc could thus be measured to a depth of 50 cm and each access tube was equipped with a removable cap on the top to prevent rain water entering the tube based on prior information of swc in the field and the depth of detection of the crnp data from depths of 10 20 and 30 cm were only used all locations except l10 with a measuring depth of only 20 cm could measure swc to a depth of 30 cm the crnp was conventionally calibrated zreda et al 2012 during the growing seasons of 2015 and 2016 we chose to collect 48 soil samples based on the special environment of the study area distributed as 1 four radial distances from the probe 25 75 150 and 250 m 2 four directions east west south and north and 3 three depths 10 20 and 30 cm this sampling design was repeated on 11 campaigns during the two growing seasons detailed information has been reported by zhu et al 2017 a pit was dug in the first sampling campaign to a depth of 30 cm at each of the 16 locations undisturbed soil cores were then collected using cutting rings 100 cm3 to depths of 10 20 and 30 cm two samples were collected at each depth at each location for a total of 96 undisturbed soil cores for measuring bulk density using the oven drying method volumetric swc could thus be calculated swc hereafter refers to volumetric water content 2 3 data processing and analysis 2 3 1 raw neutron density correction the raw neutron density detected by the crnp contained variations of air pressure humidity and incoming neutron density hawdon et al 2014 nguyen et al 2017 so relevant corrections were needed before the conversion from neutron density to swc correction procedures provided by zreda et al 2012 were used in this study in particular the air pressure factor fp was calculated as 1 f p exp p 0 p l where p hpa is the actual air pressure at the study site acquired by a micro weather eddy covariance system ca 90 m northeast of the crnp p0 hpa is the reference air pressure the mean air pressure during the study period and l g cm 2 is the mass attenuation length of high energy neutrons which decreases from the equator 142 g cm 2 to high latitudes 128 g cm 2 desilets and zreda 2003 the correction factor f wv for air humidity was calculated as 2 f wv 1 0 0054 ρ ρ ref where ρ g m 3 is the absolute air humidity at the time of measurement and ρ ref g m 3 is the absolute air humidity at a reference time in this study we used the mean absolute air humidity measured by the micro weather eddy covariance system during the study period the correction factor f i for the incoming neutron density was calculated as 3 f i i m i ref where i m counts per hour cph is the measured neutron density at a given time from neutron monitor at jungfraujoch switzerland and i ref cph is a specified baseline reference intensity the mean measured neutron density during the study period was used in this study the corrected neutron density n was calculated as 4 n n raw f p f wv f i where n raw cph is the raw neutron density detected by the crnp neutron density uncontaminated by environmental noise i e n cph was then used in analysis 2 3 2 calibrations of the crnp and the neutron probe corrected neutron densities are negatively and nonlinearly proportional to swc desilets et al 2010 proposed a shape defining function using the monte carlo neutron particle extended transport code as 5 θ a 0 n n 0 a 1 a 2 where θ is volumetric swc a0 a1 and a2 are the fitting parameters 0 0808 0 372 and 0 115 in silica soil respectively n cph is the corrected neutron density and n0 cph is the neutron density in air above dry soil under the same conditions n0 is calculated using measured field mean swc i e θ cm3 cm 3 and corrected neutron density i e n the field mean swc of the 48 soil samples was calculated by assigning non linear diminishing weights with the depth and distance from the crnp to the sample collection sites köhli et al 2015 n0 could be obtained for each sampling campaign and mean n0 was used to convert swc the neutron probe was also calibrated using field sampling which has been described in detail by zhu et al 2017 neutrons can easily escape from the topsoil so the soil was divided into two layers the fitted calibration equations were 6 y 83 237 x 3 505 r 0 740 p 0 01 10 cm y 81 615 x 7 537 r 0 612 p 0 01 20 50 cm where y is volumetric swc and x is the neutron counting rate swc was measured by the neutron probe a total of 21 times during the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons our analyses only included swc data from depths of 10 20 and 30 cm 2 3 3 determination of footprint radius of the crnp two methods were used in this study to determine the footprint radius of the crnp in the alpine meadow ecosystem one method was theoretical calculation based on model simulation the original theoretical footprint radius was calculated as desilets and zreda 2013 7 r r 0 p r p where r m is the theoretical radius at an actual air pressure p hpa and r0 m is the reference radius 300 m at the reference air temperature pr 1013 hpa köhli et al 2015 used a more complex but more accurate method to simulate the footprint radius that accounted for the influences of air pressure vegetation air humidity and swc the equation can be expressed as 8 r ρ θ p veg f p f veg r ρ θ where r ρ θ p veg is the footprint radius corrected for air pressure and vegetation at a specific air humidity and swc and f p and f veg are correction factors for air pressure and vegetation respectively which can be calculated as köhli et al 2015 9 f p p 0 p 10 f veg 1 0 17 1 e 0 41 h veg 1 e 7 θ where θ is swc m3 m 3 and hveg is the height of the vegetation m the grass in this degraded alpine meadow system is low and sparse even during the vibrant growing season the vegetation factor was thus set at 1 in this study the final equation was 11 r ρ θ p p 0 p r ρ θ the other method was experimental six circles with radii of 50 100 200 300 400 and 500 m were drawn in the plot around the location of the crnp fig 1b with 4 12 43 83 108 and 113 neutron tubes within its scope respectively the mean swc was calculated by assigning equal weights at each location and soil depth non linear weights with the depth and distance from the sample locations to the crnp are usually used to obtain a more accurate measurement from the crnp köhli et al 2015 nguyen et al 2017 in this study however differences were needed for determining the probable footprint radius of the crnp so we used simple arithmetic means to calculate the mean swcs the mean swcs were then compared with the crnp measured swc accuracy indices i e r rmse and the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 were used to judge the similarity and deviation of the two sets of swc data 2 3 4 statistical analysis classical statistics were used to describe the magnitude distribution and variability of the climatic factors i e ρ and p and the temporal and spatial swcs by calculating basic statistical parameters such as minimum maximum mean standard deviation sd and coefficient of variation cv a one way analysis of variance anova was used to determine the differences in swc at the various soil depths and in the two growing seasons these analyses and statistics were performed using microsoft office excel 2016 and ibm spss 22 geostatistical analysis and spatial interpolation used arcmap 10 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 the theoretical footprint radius of the crnp the theoretical footprint radius was defined as the radius of the horizontal region where 86 of the neutrons are detected by the crnp the footprint radius is influenced by air humidity swc vegetation and air pressure köhli et al 2015 degraded vegetation in the study area was low and sparse so only swc absolute air humidity and air pressure were used for calculating the theoretical footprint the mean swcs measured by the neutron probe were 12 5 and 17 7 with ranges of 8 6 12 5 and 9 7 17 7 in the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons respectively table 1 indicating a relatively higher swc in the 2016 than the 2015 growing season the mean swcs in the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons however had similar sds and cvs the absolute air humidity was low in both growing seasons was a little higher in 2016 than 2015 and was moderately variable in both seasons based on their cvs the mean air pressure in the plot was ca 58 5 kpa accounting for about 58 of the air pressure at sea level equivalent to a 1 7 fold larger foot print radius because the lower air density allows neutrons to travel farther before the next collision köhli et al 2015 the simple inverse proportional relationship in eq 7 desilets and zreda 2013 indicated that the theoretical footprint radius of the crnp was ca 580 m in the alpine meadow zhu et al 2016 a recent simulation accounting for air humidity soil moisture vegetation and air pressure by köhli et al 2015 proposed a more complex method and obtained a smaller radius due to the influence of other hydrogen pools except swc on the neutrons due to the means and ranges of absolute air humidity and air pressure in our study plot the radius was between 210 and 240 m based on the footprint radius contour lines drawn by köhli et al 2015 the new theoretical footprint radius of the crnp incorporating the air pressure was between 360 and 420 m in this alpine meadow on the northern tibetan plateau 3 2 probable experimental footprint radius of the crnp nonlinear weighting methods are generally used to average the swc of samples to increase the accuracy of crnps köhli et al 2015 schrön et al 2017 in this section however we used simple arithmetic means to average the swcs measured by the neutron probe in the circles the differences between simple averaged swcs and crnp measured swcs have greater explanatory power than nonlinear weighting methods of the probable footprint radius of the crnp on the northern tibetan plateau mean swcs from the circles with radii of 50 100 200 300 400 and 500 m fig 1b were calculated and compared to the swcs measured by the crnp fig 2 the slopes of the regression lines were near 1 and the mean r was 0 936 indicating a high correlation between the two sets of swc data rmse and nse were used to quantify the correlation further rmse decreased and nse increased for radii 200 m and reached a minimum and maximum at 200 m and rmse and nse remained stable for radii 200 m fig 3 these trends may indicate that mean swc in each circle was very similar to the crnp measured swc and that the similarity increased for radii 200 m and remained nearly constant for radii 200 m köhli et al 2015 reported that more than 60 of the neutrons come from the first 50 m around the probe but 63 of the neutrons in this area of low air pressure were from 115 m around the probe only ca 60 of the neutrons were from 100 m the radius of 86 of the neutrons was more than 300 m but areas not covered by neutron tubes were within 300 400 and 500 m which led to uncertainty of the comparison we can nevertheless conservatively conclude that the most probable footprint radius of the crnp in this alpine meadow was 200 m this experimental radius could be used to optimize sampling strategies for crnp calibration on the tibetan plateau where field work is extraordinarily difficult and uncomfortable 3 3 spatiotemporal characteristics of swc within the crnp footprint 3 3 1 temporal characteristics field mean swcs measured by the neutron probe were compared with the swcs measured by the crnp fig 4 all swc points measured by the neutron probe were distributed on or around the swc data from the crnp the relationship between these swcs was also analyzed fig 5 the slope of the regression line was near 1 and r rmse and nse were 0 944 1 8 and 0 874 respectively in our previous study crnp had similar accuracy indices compared to the field sampled swcs zhu et al 2017 the accuracy indices indicated that 1 crnp performed well for measuring field mean swc and 2 the calibration of the neutron probe eq 6 was valid for measuring swc in the underdeveloped and stony alpine meadow soil swc varied considerably during the two growing seasons fig 4 the cvs of swc in the two growing seasons of 2015 and 2016 were 33 5 and 19 8 respectively indicating a moderately variable swc in each growing season swc however varied more in the 2015 than the 2016 growing season due to different rainfall distributions the mean swc also differed significantly between the two growing seasons table 2 probably due to the large difference in cumulative rainfall between 2015 and 2016 growing seasons 203 2 and 347 6 mm respectively crnp measured swc was sensitive to rainfall fig 4 the curve had peaks for a single rain 3 july 2015 rain on several successive days middle of august or heavy rains 5 13 july and 6 august 2016 this sensitivity however would overestimate swc to some extent so future studies should apply proper corrections for rainfall 3 3 2 spatial characteristics crnp provides a bridge for swc scale transformations from point to regional scales but has a limited ability to demonstrate spatial heterogeneity of swc within its footprint which in turn could influence the accuracy of swcs measured by crnps schattan et al 2017 nguyen et al 2017 swc data collected by the neutron probe were used to analyze the spatial variability of swc at depths of 10 20 and 30 cm the mean swc at depth of 10 cm was significantly p 0 01 larger than the swcs at depths of 20 and 30 cm in both growing seasons table 3 perhaps due to the effect of a special alpine sedge mat kaiser et al 2008 also known as a mattic epipedon yang et al 2016 where soil and dense plant roots are hardened together and have a protective effect for water and heat in deep soil he 1965 zuo and le 1980 the variations of the mean swc however differed among the profiles a drought occurred in july 2015 and the soil became drier infiltration increased in the 2016 growing season due to the more abundant rainfall the cvs were low indicating weak to moderate swc spatial variability and were lower than the cvs for swc temporal variability table 3 suggesting that the temporal variability was higher than the spatial variability and demonstrating weak swc spatial heterogeneity in the alpine meadow the spatial heterogeneity of swc within the crnp footprint was determined by spatially interpolating swc at each soil depth in the plot using ordinary kriging based on the analysis of geostatistics the spatial distribution of swc at depths of 10 20 and 30 cm in the plot is shown in fig 6 swc generally varied little in the plot especially at 10 and 20 cm indicating a weak spatial heterogeneity of swc in the plot swc was higher in the northwestern and eastern parts of the plot and lower in the central and southern parts the nonuniform distribution of soil bulk density organic carbon content and particle composition rather than vegetation and topographical factors were the main causes of the spatial heterogeneity of swc data not shown the spatial heterogeneity of swc in this study area was low but neutron density may have been influenced when measuring swc using the crnp prior information about the distribution of swc could improve the accuracy of crnp calibration 4 conclusions in this study the theoretical footprint radius of crnp based on a recent model simulation was calculated for an alpine meadow at 4600 m a s l on the northern tibetan plateau a conservative experimental radius was also estimated by comparing mean swcs from concentrically spaced circles in the study plot with swcs measured by the crnp the temporal variability and spatial heterogeneity of swc within the crnp footprint were then analyzed the theoretical footprint radius of the crnp was 360 420 m after accounting for the influences of air humidity soil moisture vegetation and air pressure and the probable practical footprint radius was 200 m the performance of the crnp in measuring swc in this extremely high and cold area was further verified by comparing the swcs to those measured by a neutron probe the values of r rmse and nse were 0 944 1 8 and 0 874 respectively swc within the crnp footprint was moderately variable in both time two growing seasons and space the plot and the temporal variability was higher the spatial heterogeneity of swc should nevertheless be considered in crnp calculations in future studies these results will be useful for optimizing sampling strategies for further crnp calibration in the rugged and hostile environment on the tibetan plateau acknowledgements this study was financially

observation and remote sensing in regional scale studies respectively zhu and shao 2015 studies at hectometer scales however are rare but could serve as bridges for scale transformation and could provide accurate non point data for calibrating the results of remote sensing inversion cosmic ray neutron probes crnps are an effective tool for hectometer scale measurements of soil water content swc filling the gap between point observation and remote sensing inversion and has the advantages of being automatic and non destructive crnps have been evaluated and successfully applied in many kinds of ecosystems including farmland han et al 2015 forest heidbüchel et al 2016 nguyen et al 2017 grassland peterson et al 2016 desert schreiner mcgraw et al 2016 and even alpine schattan et al 2017 ecosystems the application has also been evaluated on the third pole of the earth the tibetan plateau zhu et al 2016 2017 zhu et al 2016 2017 reported a high correlation coefficient r 0 938 and low root mean square error rmse 2 1 for swcs determined from oven dried soil samples and swcs measured by crnp demonstrating the good accuracy and applicability of crnps in an alpine meadow on the northern tibetan plateau identifying the practical range of instruments in different areas is important for maximizing accuracy and developing methods in the ecological hydrological and geophysical sciences crnps also have footprints the theoretical footprint of a crnp is defined as the region that contains 86 of the detected neutrons zreda et al 2008 proposed a theoretical footprint of crnps using a neutron transport model based on the monte carlo method desilets and zreda 2013 later reported that the footprint radius of a crnp was ca 300 m at sea level using the same model under several simplified assumptions köhli et al 2015 reported radii of 130 240 m at sea level which were mainly influenced by swc air humidity and vegetation using a refined cosmic ray neutron source and energy spectrum as is reported the radius of a crnp can also be influenced by elevation zreda et al 2012 desilets and zreda 2013 köhli et al 2015 based on the theory proposed by zreda et al 2012 and desilets and zreda 2013 the radius of a crnp was 25 larger at 3000 m a s l than at sea level zhu et al 2016 2017 also calculated a theoretical radius of ca 580 m for an alpine meadow ecosystem at 4600 m a s l nearly two fold larger than the radius at sea level which was due to the less probability of neutrons to interact with air molecules in less dense air köhli et al 2015 the radius however was only a simple estimate the new theoretical footprint radius accounting for air humidity swc vegetation and air pressure based on the simulation of köhli et al 2015 in the same study area should be updated and the most probable practical footprint radius also requires further study in this study we measured swc in a network of neutron access tubes in an alpine meadow in two consecutive growing seasons on the northern tibetan plateau and compared it with swc measured by a crnp the objectives of this study were to 1 determine the theoretical footprint of the crnp based on a recent simulation 2 identify the most probable practical footprint radius of the crnp in the meadow based on swc measured by a neutron probe and 3 analyze the temporal variability and spatial heterogeneity of swc within the crnp footprint 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in an alpine meadow on the northern tibetan plateau 31 38 38 58 n 92 00 51 34 e fig 1 a near nagqu prefecture at an elevation of ca 4600 m a s l the study area has a sub frigid and semi humid monsoon climate with cold and long winters and cool and short summers the soil is frozen from october to may and the growing season is very short only from june to august the annual mean air temperature is 0 5 c with the lowest monthly mean temperature of 9 5 c january and the highest of 10 4 c july the annual mean rainfall is 455 8 mm with 64 falling during the growing season the air is thin due to the high elevation with a mean pressure of only 58 7 kpa vegetation in this area is typical of alpine meadows with kobresia pygmaea the dominant species and accompanied by potentilla spp leontopodium pusillum carex moorcroftii and stipa purpurea which are all annual herbs the soil is typical alpine meadows soil and is classified as sandy and sandy clayey loams according to the world soil texture classification an irregular polygonal fence fig 1b was built as the boundary of a sample plot to prevent grazing by yaks and goats the plot was 530 770 m long from southeast to northwest and 480 580 m wide from southwest to northeast and had a total area of 33 5 ha the terrain was flat with the largest relative elevation of ca 11 m the plot sloped gently from northwest to southeast 2 2 experimental design and data acquisition a cosmic ray soil moisture observing system probe science and technology llc beijing china was installed in the middle of the study plot in may 2015 fig 1b and c the system uses a cylindrical probe filled with helium gas to detect neutron density a datalogger cr800 campbell scientific utah usa to record the neutrons and meteorological i e air temperature data and a solar panel and accumulator 12 v to provide energy more detailed information about the system is provided by zhu et al 2017 the system began operation on 24 may 2015 with a constant data acquisition step of 1 h data for more than two years were obtained the soil in the study area is thawed from june to august when swc varies greatly with precipitation and temperature crnp data from 15 june to 2 september 2015 and from 5 june to 1 september 2016 were thus used for analysis in this study point swc data were collected using a neutron probe cnc idr r one hundred and thirteen neutron access tubes 75 cm in length were inserted into the soil in a grid of 50 m 60 m in the plot in early june 2015 the locations were denoted as l1 to l113 most of the tubes extended 15 cm above the ground and 60 cm into the ground swc could thus be measured to a depth of 50 cm and each access tube was equipped with a removable cap on the top to prevent rain water entering the tube based on prior information of swc in the field and the depth of detection of the crnp data from depths of 10 20 and 30 cm were only used all locations except l10 with a measuring depth of only 20 cm could measure swc to a depth of 30 cm the crnp was conventionally calibrated zreda et al 2012 during the growing seasons of 2015 and 2016 we chose to collect 48 soil samples based on the special environment of the study area distributed as 1 four radial distances from the probe 25 75 150 and 250 m 2 four directions east west south and north and 3 three depths 10 20 and 30 cm this sampling design was repeated on 11 campaigns during the two growing seasons detailed information has been reported by zhu et al 2017 a pit was dug in the first sampling campaign to a depth of 30 cm at each of the 16 locations undisturbed soil cores were then collected using cutting rings 100 cm3 to depths of 10 20 and 30 cm two samples were collected at each depth at each location for a total of 96 undisturbed soil cores for measuring bulk density using the oven drying method volumetric swc could thus be calculated swc hereafter refers to volumetric water content 2 3 data processing and analysis 2 3 1 raw neutron density correction the raw neutron density detected by the crnp contained variations of air pressure humidity and incoming neutron density hawdon et al 2014 nguyen et al 2017 so relevant corrections were needed before the conversion from neutron density to swc correction procedures provided by zreda et al 2012 were used in this study in particular the air pressure factor fp was calculated as 1 f p exp p 0 p l where p hpa is the actual air pressure at the study site acquired by a micro weather eddy covariance system ca 90 m northeast of the crnp p0 hpa is the reference air pressure the mean air pressure during the study period and l g cm 2 is the mass attenuation length of high energy neutrons which decreases from the equator 142 g cm 2 to high latitudes 128 g cm 2 desilets and zreda 2003 the correction factor f wv for air humidity was calculated as 2 f wv 1 0 0054 ρ ρ ref where ρ g m 3 is the absolute air humidity at the time of measurement and ρ ref g m 3 is the absolute air humidity at a reference time in this study we used the mean absolute air humidity measured by the micro weather eddy covariance system during the study period the correction factor f i for the incoming neutron density was calculated as 3 f i i m i ref where i m counts per hour cph is the measured neutron density at a given time from neutron monitor at jungfraujoch switzerland and i ref cph is a specified baseline reference intensity the mean measured neutron density during the study period was used in this study the corrected neutron density n was calculated as 4 n n raw f p f wv f i where n raw cph is the raw neutron density detected by the crnp neutron density uncontaminated by environmental noise i e n cph was then used in analysis 2 3 2 calibrations of the crnp and the neutron probe corrected neutron densities are negatively and nonlinearly proportional to swc desilets et al 2010 proposed a shape defining function using the monte carlo neutron particle extended transport code as 5 θ a 0 n n 0 a 1 a 2 where θ is volumetric swc a0 a1 and a2 are the fitting parameters 0 0808 0 372 and 0 115 in silica soil respectively n cph is the corrected neutron density and n0 cph is the neutron density in air above dry soil under the same conditions n0 is calculated using measured field mean swc i e θ cm3 cm 3 and corrected neutron density i e n the field mean swc of the 48 soil samples was calculated by assigning non linear diminishing weights with the depth and distance from the crnp to the sample collection sites köhli et al 2015 n0 could be obtained for each sampling campaign and mean n0 was used to convert swc the neutron probe was also calibrated using field sampling which has been described in detail by zhu et al 2017 neutrons can easily escape from the topsoil so the soil was divided into two layers the fitted calibration equations were 6 y 83 237 x 3 505 r 0 740 p 0 01 10 cm y 81 615 x 7 537 r 0 612 p 0 01 20 50 cm where y is volumetric swc and x is the neutron counting rate swc was measured by the neutron probe a total of 21 times during the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons our analyses only included swc data from depths of 10 20 and 30 cm 2 3 3 determination of footprint radius of the crnp two methods were used in this study to determine the footprint radius of the crnp in the alpine meadow ecosystem one method was theoretical calculation based on model simulation the original theoretical footprint radius was calculated as desilets and zreda 2013 7 r r 0 p r p where r m is the theoretical radius at an actual air pressure p hpa and r0 m is the reference radius 300 m at the reference air temperature pr 1013 hpa köhli et al 2015 used a more complex but more accurate method to simulate the footprint radius that accounted for the influences of air pressure vegetation air humidity and swc the equation can be expressed as 8 r ρ θ p veg f p f veg r ρ θ where r ρ θ p veg is the footprint radius corrected for air pressure and vegetation at a specific air humidity and swc and f p and f veg are correction factors for air pressure and vegetation respectively which can be calculated as köhli et al 2015 9 f p p 0 p 10 f veg 1 0 17 1 e 0 41 h veg 1 e 7 θ where θ is swc m3 m 3 and hveg is the height of the vegetation m the grass in this degraded alpine meadow system is low and sparse even during the vibrant growing season the vegetation factor was thus set at 1 in this study the final equation was 11 r ρ θ p p 0 p r ρ θ the other method was experimental six circles with radii of 50 100 200 300 400 and 500 m were drawn in the plot around the location of the crnp fig 1b with 4 12 43 83 108 and 113 neutron tubes within its scope respectively the mean swc was calculated by assigning equal weights at each location and soil depth non linear weights with the depth and distance from the sample locations to the crnp are usually used to obtain a more accurate measurement from the crnp köhli et al 2015 nguyen et al 2017 in this study however differences were needed for determining the probable footprint radius of the crnp so we used simple arithmetic means to calculate the mean swcs the mean swcs were then compared with the crnp measured swc accuracy indices i e r rmse and the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 were used to judge the similarity and deviation of the two sets of swc data 2 3 4 statistical analysis classical statistics were used to describe the magnitude distribution and variability of the climatic factors i e ρ and p and the temporal and spatial swcs by calculating basic statistical parameters such as minimum maximum mean standard deviation sd and coefficient of variation cv a one way analysis of variance anova was used to determine the differences in swc at the various soil depths and in the two growing seasons these analyses and statistics were performed using microsoft office excel 2016 and ibm spss 22 geostatistical analysis and spatial interpolation used arcmap 10 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 the theoretical footprint radius of the crnp the theoretical footprint radius was defined as the radius of the horizontal region where 86 of the neutrons are detected by the crnp the footprint radius is influenced by air humidity swc vegetation and air pressure köhli et al 2015 degraded vegetation in the study area was low and sparse so only swc absolute air humidity and air pressure were used for calculating the theoretical footprint the mean swcs measured by the neutron probe were 12 5 and 17 7 with ranges of 8 6 12 5 and 9 7 17 7 in the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons respectively table 1 indicating a relatively higher swc in the 2016 than the 2015 growing season the mean swcs in the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons however had similar sds and cvs the absolute air humidity was low in both growing seasons was a little higher in 2016 than 2015 and was moderately variable in both seasons based on their cvs the mean air pressure in the plot was ca 58 5 kpa accounting for about 58 of the air pressure at sea level equivalent to a 1 7 fold larger foot print radius because the lower air density allows neutrons to travel farther before the next collision köhli et al 2015 the simple inverse proportional relationship in eq 7 desilets and zreda 2013 indicated that the theoretical footprint radius of the crnp was ca 580 m in the alpine meadow zhu et al 2016 a recent simulation accounting for air humidity soil moisture vegetation and air pressure by köhli et al 2015 proposed a more complex method and obtained a smaller radius due to the influence of other hydrogen pools except swc on the neutrons due to the means and ranges of absolute air humidity and air pressure in our study plot the radius was between 210 and 240 m based on the footprint radius contour lines drawn by köhli et al 2015 the new theoretical footprint radius of the crnp incorporating the air pressure was between 360 and 420 m in this alpine meadow on the northern tibetan plateau 3 2 probable experimental footprint radius of the crnp nonlinear weighting methods are generally used to average the swc of samples to increase the accuracy of crnps köhli et al 2015 schrön et al 2017 in this section however we used simple arithmetic means to average the swcs measured by the neutron probe in the circles the differences between simple averaged swcs and crnp measured swcs have greater explanatory power than nonlinear weighting methods of the probable footprint radius of the crnp on the northern tibetan plateau mean swcs from the circles with radii of 50 100 200 300 400 and 500 m fig 1b were calculated and compared to the swcs measured by the crnp fig 2 the slopes of the regression lines were near 1 and the mean r was 0 936 indicating a high correlation between the two sets of swc data rmse and nse were used to quantify the correlation further rmse decreased and nse increased for radii 200 m and reached a minimum and maximum at 200 m and rmse and nse remained stable for radii 200 m fig 3 these trends may indicate that mean swc in each circle was very similar to the crnp measured swc and that the similarity increased for radii 200 m and remained nearly constant for radii 200 m köhli et al 2015 reported that more than 60 of the neutrons come from the first 50 m around the probe but 63 of the neutrons in this area of low air pressure were from 115 m around the probe only ca 60 of the neutrons were from 100 m the radius of 86 of the neutrons was more than 300 m but areas not covered by neutron tubes were within 300 400 and 500 m which led to uncertainty of the comparison we can nevertheless conservatively conclude that the most probable footprint radius of the crnp in this alpine meadow was 200 m this experimental radius could be used to optimize sampling strategies for crnp calibration on the tibetan plateau where field work is extraordinarily difficult and uncomfortable 3 3 spatiotemporal characteristics of swc within the crnp footprint 3 3 1 temporal characteristics field mean swcs measured by the neutron probe were compared with the swcs measured by the crnp fig 4 all swc points measured by the neutron probe were distributed on or around the swc data from the crnp the relationship between these swcs was also analyzed fig 5 the slope of the regression line was near 1 and r rmse and nse were 0 944 1 8 and 0 874 respectively in our previous study crnp had similar accuracy indices compared to the field sampled swcs zhu et al 2017 the accuracy indices indicated that 1 crnp performed well for measuring field mean swc and 2 the calibration of the neutron probe eq 6 was valid for measuring swc in the underdeveloped and stony alpine meadow soil swc varied considerably during the two growing seasons fig 4 the cvs of swc in the two growing seasons of 2015 and 2016 were 33 5 and 19 8 respectively indicating a moderately variable swc in each growing season swc however varied more in the 2015 than the 2016 growing season due to different rainfall distributions the mean swc also differed significantly between the two growing seasons table 2 probably due to the large difference in cumulative rainfall between 2015 and 2016 growing seasons 203 2 and 347 6 mm respectively crnp measured swc was sensitive to rainfall fig 4 the curve had peaks for a single rain 3 july 2015 rain on several successive days middle of august or heavy rains 5 13 july and 6 august 2016 this sensitivity however would overestimate swc to some extent so future studies should apply proper corrections for rainfall 3 3 2 spatial characteristics crnp provides a bridge for swc scale transformations from point to regional scales but has a limited ability to demonstrate spatial heterogeneity of swc within its footprint which in turn could influence the accuracy of swcs measured by crnps schattan et al 2017 nguyen et al 2017 swc data collected by the neutron probe were used to analyze the spatial variability of swc at depths of 10 20 and 30 cm the mean swc at depth of 10 cm was significantly p 0 01 larger than the swcs at depths of 20 and 30 cm in both growing seasons table 3 perhaps due to the effect of a special alpine sedge mat kaiser et al 2008 also known as a mattic epipedon yang et al 2016 where soil and dense plant roots are hardened together and have a protective effect for water and heat in deep soil he 1965 zuo and le 1980 the variations of the mean swc however differed among the profiles a drought occurred in july 2015 and the soil became drier infiltration increased in the 2016 growing season due to the more abundant rainfall the cvs were low indicating weak to moderate swc spatial variability and were lower than the cvs for swc temporal variability table 3 suggesting that the temporal variability was higher than the spatial variability and demonstrating weak swc spatial heterogeneity in the alpine meadow the spatial heterogeneity of swc within the crnp footprint was determined by spatially interpolating swc at each soil depth in the plot using ordinary kriging based on the analysis of geostatistics the spatial distribution of swc at depths of 10 20 and 30 cm in the plot is shown in fig 6 swc generally varied little in the plot especially at 10 and 20 cm indicating a weak spatial heterogeneity of swc in the plot swc was higher in the northwestern and eastern parts of the plot and lower in the central and southern parts the nonuniform distribution of soil bulk density organic carbon content and particle composition rather than vegetation and topographical factors were the main causes of the spatial heterogeneity of swc data not shown the spatial heterogeneity of swc in this study area was low but neutron density may have been influenced when measuring swc using the crnp prior information about the distribution of swc could improve the accuracy of crnp calibration 4 conclusions in this study the theoretical footprint radius of crnp based on a recent model simulation was calculated for an alpine meadow at 4600 m a s l on the northern tibetan plateau a conservative experimental radius was also estimated by comparing mean swcs from concentrically spaced circles in the study plot with swcs measured by the crnp the temporal variability and spatial heterogeneity of swc within the crnp footprint were then analyzed the theoretical footprint radius of the crnp was 360 420 m after accounting for the influences of air humidity soil moisture vegetation and air pressure and the probable practical footprint radius was 200 m the performance of the crnp in measuring swc in this extremely high and cold area was further verified by comparing the swcs to those measured by a neutron probe the values of r rmse and nse were 0 944 1 8 and 0 874 respectively swc within the crnp footprint was moderately variable in both time two growing seasons and space the plot and the temporal variability was higher the spatial heterogeneity of swc should nevertheless be considered in crnp calculations in future studies these results will be useful for optimizing sampling strategies for further crnp calibration in the rugged and hostile environment on the tibetan plateau acknowledgements this study was financially

7437,climate change impact assessment on meteorological variables involves large uncertainties as a result of incomplete knowledge on the future greenhouse gas concentrations and climate model physics next to the inherent internal variability of the climate system given that the alteration in greenhouse gas concentrations is the driver for the change one expects the impacts to be highly dependent on the considered greenhouse gas scenario ghs in this study we denote this behavior as ghs sensitivity due to the climate model related uncertainties this sensitivity is at local scale not always that strong as expected this paper aims to study the ghs sensitivity and its contributing role to climate scenarios for a case study in belgium an ensemble of 160 cmip5 climate model runs is considered and climate change signals are studied for precipitation accumulation daily precipitation intensities and wet day frequencies this was done for the different seasons of the year and the scenario periods 2011 2040 2031 2060 2051 2081 and 2071 2100 by means of variance decomposition the total variance in the climate change signals was separated in the contribution of the differences in ghss and the other model related uncertainty sources these contributions were found dependent on the variable and season following the time of emergence concept the ghs uncertainty contribution is found dependent on the time horizon and increases over time for the most distinct time horizon 2071 2100 the climate model uncertainty accounts for the largest uncertainty contribution the ghs differences explain up to 18 of the total variance in the climate change signals the results point further at the importance of the climate model ensemble design specifically the ensemble size and the combination of climate models whereupon climate scenarios are based the numerical noise introduced at scales smaller than the skillful scale e g at local scale was not considered in this study keywords climate change precipitation greenhouse gas scenario sensitivity uncertainty decomposition climate model ensemble design sensitivity analysis 1 introduction climate scenarios become widely used for decision making including adaptation planning alfieri et al 2015 arnbjerg nielsen et al 2013 brouwers et al 2015 ipcc 2014 tabari et al 2015 they typically take the form of absolute or relative changes from current to future climatic conditions hereafter denoted as climate change signals due to incomplete knowledge on the future greenhouse gas ghg and aerosol concentrations by convenience simplified to ghg concentrations uncertainties inherent to the impact modelling of these concentrations and representation of physical processes the climate change signals should not be reported as single values ranges should be provided to highlight the uncertainties this is however not always done for reasons of simplification in communication and or to avoid confusing messages that was clearly illustrated by mcmahon et al 2015 based on a questionnaire about an ipcc scenario graph that is frequently used in policy orientated messages when the rationale of those messages disappears or when the messages are misinterpreted discussions pop up about directives and guidelines on climate change impact and their inherent uncertainties lorenz et al 2015 information about the credibility of climate projections and so uncertainty assessment is required for an adequate incorporation of climate projections in adaptation strategies and future planning this involves traceability and relative partitioning of uncertainty sources reported climate scenarios are generally affected by the uncertainty in future greenhouse gas and aerosol concentration levels here denoted as the ghg scenario ghs uncertainty the climate model uncertainty and the internal variability deser et al 2012 fatichi et al 2016 hawkins and sutton 2009 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2017 the internal variability of the climate system is hereby represented by the climate model after considering different initial conditions when applying the climate change signals for impact analysis other sources can add uncertainty in hydrological climate change impact analysis for example these would be the change of land use the choice of the hydrological model the chosen parameter set for the hydrological model and the statistical downscaling method producing the projected hydro meteorological input time series addor et al 2014 ahmadalipour et al 2017 brigode et al 2013 chen et al 2011 hundecha et al 2016 karlsson et al 2016 meaurio et al 2017 seo et al 2016 sunyer et al 2015 teutschbein and seibert 2012 vetter et al 2017 uncertainties in the climate change signals are typically assessed by considering an ensemble of climate model runs the structure of such an ensemble is defined by the number of climate models the ghss and the number of runs with different initial conditions for each climate model each of these structural components relates to one specific uncertainty source they are denoted as climate model uncertainty ghs uncertainty and stochastic uncertainty related to the internal variability the use of an ensemble of scenarios or climate model runs results into an increased signal to noise ratio directly benefitting the identification of the climate change signals recent studies analysing the structure of gcm and rcm ensembles sanderson et al 2015 sunyer et al 2013 zubler et al 2016 point at the inter dependency between climate model runs making the number of effective climate model runs smaller than the ensemble size they stress on the importance of the ensemble size and the selection of the climate model runs next to the choice of the number of climate model runs the choice of the ghs represented by representative concentration pathways rcps has also been discussed climate change scenarios are mostly set up by an ensemble composition representing all four rcps moss et al 2010 van vuuren et al 2011 however there is an increased policy interest in these individual ghss and their particular impacts arnell et al 2016 jacob et al 2014 knmi 2015 based on the feasibility and cost efficiency of adaptation strategies policy makers and stakeholders select target values for the climatic changes gosling et al 2017 koutroulis et al 2016 whetton et al 2012 directly corresponding to the ghss and leading to a condensed ensemble composition the constraint of using only one ghs is not new and is a prerequisite for several applications such as agricultural impact assessment on crops demanding co2 changes consistent with the climatic changes to meteorological variables asseng et al 2013 vanuytrecht et al 2015 or land use change assessment demanding socio economic scenarios that are consistent with the ghss chen and yu 2014 karlsson et al 2016 poelmans et al 2011 inter comparison between the climate change scenarios for the different ghss provides prior insights in the ghs sensitivity of the variable considered given that the alteration in ghg concentrations is the driver for the change one expects the climate change signals to be highly dependent on the ghs considered this is often not the case on local scale arnell et al 2016 fatichi et al 2016 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2017 arnell et al 2016 analysed impact changes across different sectors including water resources agriculture and energy they concluded that impact changes increase under increasing ghg forcing they however also stress on the fact that not all differences in impacts results can be ascribed to the underlying forcing similarly differences in impacts across time for a chosen ghs are not fully explained by the time dependency of the forcing level nor can the differences between model projections be explained by the physical and chemical background differences in the climate models rather than a direct inter comparison of the change values across different ghss as applied in the study of arnell et al 2016 the total variance in climate change signals can be decomposed by means of variance analysis into different uncertainty sources within this approach the ghs uncertainty contribution reflects the ghs sensitivity based on older generation climate models hawkins and sutton 2009 have shown that the uncertainty in the global decadal mean temperature is dominantly controlled by model uncertainty and internal variability for the near future but their contribution reduces towards the later future and is replaced by an increased ghs uncertainty contribution they concluded moreover that towards the late 21st century the ghs uncertainty becomes the most relevant uncertainty source of global mean temperature recent studies of fatichi et al 2016 and hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2017 focus on the uncertainty in precipitation changes both studies identify the climate model uncertainty and uncertainty inherent to the internal variability of the climate system as the largest uncertainty contributors for the late 21st century this paper presents the ghs based climate scenarios for precipitation in central belgium the dependency of the climate change signals on the ghss a measure for the ghs sensitivity is visually analysed and assessed in a next step the magnitude of the ghs sensitivity is explored across different variables seasons months and scenario periods and variance decomposition of the climate change signals is applied to this end by means of variance decomposition the total variance in the climate change signals is separated in the contribution of the differences in ghss differences in climate model related characteristics and interaction terms co variance between the uncertainty sources the variable of interest a measure for the ghs sensitivity is the ghs uncertainty contribution finally different ensembles are considered for a sensitivity analysis on the ghs uncertainty contribution the analysis is based on a large ensemble of 160 cmip5 climate model runs these runs were validated based on station observations for the same region as in this study in a previous project by tabari et al 2015 2 data and methods the cmip5 gcm precipitation results taylor et al 2012 are studied for the grid cell covering the main station of the royal meteorological institute of belgium at uccle 4 36 50 80 near brussels these gcm results consider the four rcp based ghss notably rcp 8 5 rcp 6 0 rcp 4 5 and rcp 2 6 van vuuren et al 2011 rcp 2 6 is known as the strong mitigation scenario where the atmospheric ghg concentrations reach a radiative forcing equivalent to 2 6 w m2 by 2100 and a forthcoming global temperature rise in the range 0 9 2 3 c however under current emission trajectories rcp 8 5 is considered a more likely ghs scenario and defines a radiative forcing of 8 5 w m2 by 2100 corresponding to a global temperature rise in the range 3 2 5 4 c the other two rcp scenarios are related to radiative forcings in between these two extremely low and high forcings the total ensemble table a 1 in appendix a includes 160 climate model runs whereas the rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 rcp 6 0 and rcp 8 5 sub ensembles involve 36 48 28 and 48 climate model runs respectively for a prior estimation of the ghs sensitivity of the climate changes section 3 all available climate model runs are considered regardless whether the climate models have runs available for all four rcps for the uncertainty analysis of the climate change signals by means of variance decomposition section 4 only the climate model runs with data for all four rcps 12 climate models see appendix a or two rcps rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 25 climate models see appendix a are considered the climate models might share similar physics and parametrization schemes section 2 in dai 2005 sunyer et al 2015 however in this study they are assumed to be independent and equally important the climate change signals are analysed for precipitation accumulation wet day frequency and daily wet day intensities for different recurrence events a wet day is hereby defined as a day with daily precipitation accumulation exceeding 1 mm stephens et al 2010 the climatic changes of precipitation are described as relative changes and are analysed for the scenario periods 2011 2040 2031 2060 2051 2081 2071 2100 versus the control period 1961 1990 and this for all seasons and months of the year the total variance of the climate change signals vtot is partitioned in the contribution of the greenhouse gas and aerosol concentration scenarios vghs and the climate model related uncertainties the latter uncertainties are mainly due to the uncertainties in the physical climate model parameterizations vgcm and the climate variability as accounted for in the climate models e g the influence of the model initialization vgcmini also the co variance between the uncertainty types the interaction terms vghs gcm vghs gcmini and vgcm gcmini is accounted for eq 1 numerates these uncertainty contributions the equation is however only valid for a balanced climate model ensemble i e in presence of an equal number of realizations climate model with different initial conditions per rcp and for all climate models considered with exception to the csiro model for which 10 realizations per rcp are available most climate models have rather a small and unequal number of available realizations therefore a balanced climate model ensemble 1 realization per rcp per climate model is constructed see appendix a for this balanced ensemble climate models could still have a different variability and therefore the uncertainty contributions by the climate models vgcm and climate variability vgcmini become inseparable for ease of explanation vgcm includes both see eq 2 1 v tot v ghs v gcm v gcmini v ghs gcm v ghs gcmini v gcm gcmini 2 v tot v ghs v gcm v ghs gcm assuming that ccsij the climate change signal is for rcp i and gcm j ccsi the average climate change

the internal variability is analysed using the csiro climate model realizations different to eq 2 a pure uncertainty contribution due to the internal variability is measured i e vgcmini instead of vgcm a similar technique is applied by déqué et al 2007 sunyer et al 2015 and hundecha et al 2016 different years of the climate models were not considered as different realizations 3 ghg scenario based climate scenarios the concept time of emergence was introduced by hawkins and sutton 2012 hawkins and sutton 2012 define it as the time at which the climate change signal emerges from the noise introduced by the internal variability of the climate system the time of emergence for changes in local mean and extreme daily precipitation intensities at several european locations was investigated by maraun 2013 that study sets the time of emergence for changes in local convective summer precipitation at the end of the 21st century similar findings were found in the recent study of king et al 2015 based on the findings of these studies changes between 1961 1990 and 2071 2100 were selected for the prior ghs sensitivity assessment moreover strongest changes in precipitation accumulation and wet day frequency were projected for the winter december january and february and summer june july and august season whereas projections for belgium and neighboring regions ipcc 2013 jacob et al 2014 tabari et al 2015 indicate wetter winters increasing precipitation accumulation and wet day frequency and drier summers deceasing precipitation accumulation and wet day frequency in contrast during spring and autumn there is a transition of the change signals in sign leading to less strong changes the daily precipitation intensities for high recurrence events increase furthermore across all seasons in this context focus is put on the results for winter and summer season whereas january and july are chosen as a representative winter and summer month changes between 1961 1990 and 2071 2100 for the precipitation accumulation and wet day frequency and daily precipitation intensities for different recurrence events are presented in fig 1 and fig 2 respectively the changes are shown on seasonal and monthly time scales considering the complete set of ghss and each of the individual ghss fig 1a shows that towards the late 21st century the winter and summer precipitation accumulation will increase and decrease respectively under the total uncertainty range i e all climate model runs for all ghss are combined the interquartile ranges of the seasonal changes vary between 7 and 21 for winter and between 34 and 1 for summer similar interquartile ranges are noted for the accumulation changes on monthly time scale fig 1a shows furthermore that the precipitation accumulation changes for both time scales and seasons are magnified under increasing ghg forcing we define this behavior as greenhouse gas scenario sensitivity the analysis of the wet day frequency changes fig 1b makes clear that the decrease in summer precipitation accumulation is mainly governed by the large reduction of the wet day frequency under the total uncertainty range the interquartile ranges of the summer changes vary between 37 and 7 the changes for the winter season remain rather small compared to the summer season for the summer season an intensification of the changes under increasing ghg forcing becomes visible similar results are found at the monthly time scale the reduction in summer precipitation is next to the decreasing wet day frequency explained by the decreasing daily precipitation intensities for low recurrence interval events see appendix b however increasing daily precipitation intensities are projected for high recurrence interval events in contrast to summer daily precipitation intensities in winter increase for both low and high recurrence interval events the changes in precipitation intensities for high recurrence interval events are shown in fig 2 the interquartile changes in daily winter precipitation intensities for 1 5 10 and 15 year recurrence events vary between 5 22 3 19 2 21 and 1 23 respectively for the same recurrence intervals the interquartile changes in daily summer precipitation intensities vary in the ranges 3 to 19 3 to 23 3 to 25 and 8 to 32 these ranges point at the larger spread of change values for the summer events this observation remains moreover valid on monthly time scale given that the high recurrence summer events are of convective nature in belgium and the processes underlying convective summer precipitation events are not explicitly resolved due to the coarse model resolution arnbjerg nielsen et al 2013 tabari et al 2016 willems et al 2012 this may partly explain the larger total uncertainty range for that season the interquartile ranges differ also across time scales e g seasonal versus monthly time scale stronger changes in the winter precipitation intensities are observed on the monthly time scale whereas for summer these are found on the seasonal time scale hence the use of the seasonal time scale has an averaging effect for the winter results and may underestimate the changes at smaller time scales i e monthly but it may also lead to more robust climate changes signals particularly in summer as it reduces the sampling uncertainty the comparison between the use of a seasonal time scale for winter and a monthly time scale for summer assigns larger consequences to the use of a monthly time scale for summer for example the median change value for daily summer precipitation intensity for a 10 year recurrence event measures 10 on the seasonal scale whereas there is almost no change on the monthly time scale given that the median changes are positive and given that the changes are induced in the model by the ghg changes one would expect a positive magnification of the changes with increasing ghg concentrations this is the case for the daily winter precipitation intensity changes but often not for the summer intensity changes 4 identification of the ghg scenario sensitivity of the climate scenarios 4 1 variance contributions of the ghs uncertainty to obtain further insights in the ghs sensitivity of the climate change scenarios the total variance of the climate changes is partitioned into the sub variances induced by the ghss the climate models and the interaction between both eq 2 the interaction term accounts for the co variance as a result of dependency between the climate model and ghs related uncertainties the importance of the interaction term is analysed by means of the plots in fig 3 these plots show the difference between the total climate change and the gcm induced change versus the difference between the change and the ghs induced change see also appendix c larger deviations against the ghs induced change typically correspond with larger deviations against the gcm induced change this correlation is stronger during summer and for the changes in daily precipitation intensities for high recurrence events the relative contribution of the different uncertainty sources to the total variance depends firstly on the scenario period considered generally as shown by fig 4 the ghs uncertainty contribution increases with increasing time horizon for example the ghs uncertainty contribution to the variance in winter precipitation accumulation changes increases over time from 3 for the changes between 1961 1990 and 2011 2040 to 15 for the changes between 1961 1990 and 2071 2100 the ghs uncertainty contribution to the changes in daily winter precipitation intensities for a 1 10 and 15 year recurrence event between 1961 1990 and 2011 2040 and 1961 1990 and 2071 2100 increases in a similar way by 17 10 and 11 respectively the increase in ghs uncertainty contribution with increasing time horizon is due to the higher ghg changes leading to stronger climate change signals coincidentally the total variance of the climate change signals increases see appendix d the increase in magnitude of the climate change signals is not uni directional over time because it is influenced by the internal variability of the climate system e g for daily summer precipitation and winter wet day frequency the results in fig 4 allow to determine the time of emergence this time is longer for the daily summer precipitation intensity changes this observation has also been made by maraun 2013 based on the 10 csiro realizations after different climate model initializations the ghs uncertainty contribution and the uncertainty contribution inherent to the internal variability of the climate system gcmini for the variance in precipitation accumulation changes are reported in fig 5 this figure shows that towards the end of the 21st century the ghs uncertainty increases moreover the ghs uncertainty contribution gains weight within the total uncertainty balance and this at the expense of the uncertainty contribution inherent to the internal variability of the climate system fig 6 presents the relative contribution of all uncertainty sources in the total variance of the change signals between 1961 1990 and 2071 2100 for all variables and seasons the climate model uncertainty the uncertainty inherent to the internal variability of the climate system included has the highest share in the total variance it varies in the range 73 85 for the precipitation accumulation 82 76 for the wet day frequency and 58 52 65 55 and 71 62 for the daily precipitation intensities for a 1 10 and 15 year recurrence event respectively with exception to the winter precipitation accumulation and the summer wet day frequency the interaction term is identified as the second largest uncertainty source the uncertainty contribution by the interaction term is larger for the daily precipitation intensities for high recurrence events compared to the results for the wet day frequency and the precipitation changes for the daily precipitation intensities of high recurrence events it ranges between 19 and 45 this is in agreement with the results presented in fig 3 the contribution of the ghs uncertainty then varies in the range 15 7 for the precipitation accumulation 0 16 for the wet day frequency and 18 4 10 11 and 11 7 for daily precipitation intensities for a 1 10 and 15 year recurrence event respectively focusing on the relative contribution of the ghs uncertainty contribution it is shown in fig 6 that the ghs uncertainty contribution moreover depends on the season in general the ghs uncertainty contribution is higher in winter than in summer for example for precipitation accumulation the ghs uncertainty contribution is 8 higher in winter than in summer only for the wet day frequency a higher ghs uncertainty contribution is observed during summer these observations remain valid over increasing time horizon as shown by fig 4 also the time scale e g monthly versus seasonal influences the ghs uncertainty contribution fig 7 the time scale has the strongest influence on the changes in daily summer precipitation intensities for high recurrence events for that season the use of the monthly time scale results into a lower ghs uncertainty contribution 0 38 0 77 in comparison with the seasonal time scale 4 11 4 2 variance contributions of ghs uncertainty explained by ghs sensitivity the ghs uncertainty contribution fig 6 remains rather low for some variables especially for the daily summer precipitation intensities of high recurrence intervals also by visual inspection the ghs sensitivity of these variables is difficult to identify fig 3 to study this further a sensitivity analysis is conducted on the structural elements of the ensemble in first instance the sensitivity on the considered ghss is measured by considering only two rcps rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 instead of all four in a next step by consideration of only rcp 8 5 and rcp 4 5 26 climate models become available and the ghs uncertainty is measured for different ensemble sizes and different climate model combinations through monte carlo analysis randomly selecting sub samples from these 26 models for different ensemble sizes varying between 2 and 26 climate models confidence intervals are computed on the variance explained by the ghss results for this sensitivity analysis are presented in fig 8 the ghs contribution for the originally selected 12 climate models with data for all four rcps are also indicated based on the originally selected 12 models the sensitivity on the considered ghss is assessed by comparing the results based on 2 and 4 rcps results are similar for the daily winter precipitation intensities and 10 and 15 year recurrence events for all other cases a larger ghs uncertainty contribution is found for the ensemble based on four rcps to further study the influence of the ensemble size based on an ensemble size of 12 climate models different combinations of climate models are considered and their corresponding ghs uncertainty contributions are determined comparison of the 5 50 and 95 confidence intervals shows that the originally selected climate model ensemble produces often biased estimates of the ghs uncertainty contribution moreover the use of the original ensemble results in an overestimation of the ghs uncertainty contribution for summer precipitation accumulation and daily summer precipitation intensities for a 10 and 15 year recurrence event this shows that gcm ensembles should be carefully selected to avoid biased ghs uncertainty estimates fig 8 also shows that a larger ensemble size is more important than the climate model selection 5 discussion and conclusions in this study we assessed the greenhouse gas scenario sensitivity and quantified the main uncertainty sources in the precipitation projections for central belgium these projections are based on a large ensemble of cmip5 global climate models validated at the global dai 2005 stephens et al 2010 and local tabari et al 2015 scale these validation studies and others jacob et al 2014 kendon et al 2012 point at the limited skill of climate models in simulating precipitation patterns and hence biased precipitation statistics in order to understand this bias one has to consider that precipitation patterns are driven by thermodynamical processes i e processes related to the atmospheric moisture availability and by the large scale atmospheric circulation patterns mesoscale and local feedbacks e g topography lapse rate and soil moisture emori and brown 2005 van ulden and van oldenborgh 2006 lenderink and fowler 2017 kendon et al 2010 kröner 2016 kröner et al 2017 o gorman and schneider 2009 o gorman 2015 santos et al 2016 generally under increasing ghg concentrations the available atmospheric moisture increases hence the thermodynamical processes govern a global and overall increase in projected precipitation amounts emori and brown 2005 kendon et al 2010 kröner et al 2017 o gorman 2015 souverijns et al 2016 moreover under increasing ghg concentrations the midlatitude jet stream shifts poleward barnes and screen 2015 zappa et al 2013 during the winter season also an eastward extension of the midlatitude jet stream is observed zappa et al 2013 consequently the number position and strength of the anti cyclonic weather types in the euro atlantic region change santos et al 2016 zappa et al 2013 due to these changing dynamical processes an increasing summer precipitation amount is projected for northern europe and a strong decreasing amount for southern europe kröner 2016 kröner et al 2017 santos et al 2016 zappa et al 2013 for winter with exception to southern europe the precipitation amount is projected to remain constant slightly decrease or slightly increase kröner 2016 santos et al 2016 zappa et al 2013 considering central belgium the projected increase in average winter precipitation amount is due to dominating thermodynamical processes for the summer season the small lapse rate effect and dynamical processes lead to decreasing precipitation amounts combined these drivers dominate the thermodynamical processes resulting in a decreasing average summer precipitation amount the decreasing summer wet day frequency is controlled by dynamical processes i e an increasing occurrence frequency of dry weather types kröner 2016 santos et al 2016 considering these dominant processes one expects that the ghss drive the precipitation changes provided by the ensemble but the climate model related uncertainties play an important role as well for most seasons a clear ghs sensitivity is concluded for precipitation variables in central belgium with stronger changes for higher ghss higher changes for rcp 8 5 than for rcp 6 0 rcp 4 5 and rcp 2 6 as expected the changes are uni directional more positive changes for higher ghss if the changes are positive more negative changes if the changes are negative in some cases surprising results are obtained where the climate change signal does not show a clear dependency with the ghs even when such dependency is expected on physical grounds given that the ghg changes are the primary driver for the changes one expects the impact results to be dependent on the ghs by applying variance decomposition the total variance in the climate change signals was decomposed in different uncertainty sources the ghs uncertainty which is a measure for the ghs sensitivity was given particular focus underlying reasons for a low ghs sensitivity were identified by changing the considered ghss ensemble size and combinations of climate models for a given ensemble size this study accounts for the ghs gcm co variation uncertainty and this thereupon explains the differences with the results found in the studies of fatichi et al 2016 and hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2017 the relative importance of the studied uncertainty types strongly depends on the variable under study its recurrence interval the season and month of the year and the time horizon the results on the tracing of the influence of the ghs uncertainty versus gcm related uncertainties show at first that the gcm uncertainty remains the largest uncertainty source over time however the ghs uncertainty contribution is found to gain importance towards more distinct time horizons leading to increasing change signals over time the time of emergence of the climate change signal can therefore also be identified based on the evolution of the ghs uncertainty contribution also the time scale of the studied climate change signals seasonal versus monthly is found important as the shorter time scales may lead to information loss this is especially the case for daily summer precipitation intensity changes and high recurrence intervals for which high sampling uncertainty dominates at the monthly time scale results moreover show that the importance of the ghs uncertainty has strong variable dependent differences higher ghs uncertainty contributions are obtained for the wet day frequency summer and precipitation accumulation changes for the daily precipitation intensity changes of high recurrence events lower ghs uncertainty contributions are found the relevance of the ghs gcm co variation uncertainty remains limited for the wet day frequency and precipitation accumulation changes and is occasionally identified as the second largest uncertainty source next to the gcm uncertainty however for the precipitation intensities of high recurrence events the ghs gcm co variation uncertainty is identified as the second largest uncertainty source moreover a higher contribution is measured during summer for the most distinct time horizon 2071 2100 the gcm uncertainty contribution varies in the range 82 76 for the wet day frequency 73 85 for the precipitation accumulation changes and 58 52 52 49 65 55 and 71 62 for the daily precipitation intensity changes for a 1 5 10 and 15 year recurrence event respectively for that same time horizon the ghs uncertainty contribution varies in the range 0 16 for the wet day frequency 15 7 for the precipitation accumulation changes and 18 4 21 3 10 11 and 11 7 for the daily precipitation intensity changes for a 1 5 10 and 15 year recurrence event respectively what strikes in these results is the lower ghs uncertainty contribution for the daily summer precipitation intensity changes for high recurrence events we note that the coarse gcm resolution has a profound influence during the summer due to the more local nature of precipitation extremes in the study region tabari et al 2016 the sensitivity analysis on the ghs uncertainty contribution highlights that one has to be careful interpreting climate change signals based on an ensemble of climate model simulations over the years many methods for the design of climate model ensembles and the selection of climate model runs have been introduced cannon 2015 chen et al 2017 knutti et al 2010 mendlik and gobiet 2016 zubler et al 2016 many of these methods aim to reduce the ensemble size and so the computational costs during impact analysis some methods account for the dependency between the climate models this study however has shown that biased ghs uncertainty contributions are more likely obtained for smaller ensemble sizes irrespective of the variable and season considered two approaches are available to deal with biased ghs uncertainty contributions for a specific ensemble size a change in the combination of climate model runs can benefit the ghs uncertainty contribution towards the small ensemble sizes the probability of biased low and high ghs uncertainty contributions increases and one is better off to increase the ensemble size than changing the combination of climate model runs towards the higher ensemble sizes biased ghs uncertainty contributions can be resolved by changing the combination of climate models or increasing the ensemble size results of this study show that one needs to be aware of biased results for climate change signals and ghs sensitivity for both small and bigger ensemble sizes the results of this study are based on climate model data for one grid cell the grid cell scale is however smaller than the skillful scale of climate models and therefore poses a limitation to this study specifically noise introduced by different numerical schemes reduces the accuracy of climate model data at grid cell scale and could potentially have influenced the results of this study benestad et al 2008 grotch and maccracken 1991 moreover the large scale atmospheric circulation patterns a principal driver for precipitation are not captured at grid cell scale follow up studies should involve other types of uncertainties when the climate change signals are applied for impact analysis in hydrology these are the uncertainties in the dynamic and statistical downscaling the bias correction and the hydrological impact analysis also the dependency between different climate models statistical downscaling and bias correction methods should be addressed acknowledgments this

7437,climate change impact assessment on meteorological variables involves large uncertainties as a result of incomplete knowledge on the future greenhouse gas concentrations and climate model physics next to the inherent internal variability of the climate system given that the alteration in greenhouse gas concentrations is the driver for the change one expects the impacts to be highly dependent on the considered greenhouse gas scenario ghs in this study we denote this behavior as ghs sensitivity due to the climate model related uncertainties this sensitivity is at local scale not always that strong as expected this paper aims to study the ghs sensitivity and its contributing role to climate scenarios for a case study in belgium an ensemble of 160 cmip5 climate model runs is considered and climate change signals are studied for precipitation accumulation daily precipitation intensities and wet day frequencies this was done for the different seasons of the year and the scenario periods 2011 2040 2031 2060 2051 2081 and 2071 2100 by means of variance decomposition the total variance in the climate change signals was separated in the contribution of the differences in ghss and the other model related uncertainty sources these contributions were found dependent on the variable and season following the time of emergence concept the ghs uncertainty contribution is found dependent on the time horizon and increases over time for the most distinct time horizon 2071 2100 the climate model uncertainty accounts for the largest uncertainty contribution the ghs differences explain up to 18 of the total variance in the climate change signals the results point further at the importance of the climate model ensemble design specifically the ensemble size and the combination of climate models whereupon climate scenarios are based the numerical noise introduced at scales smaller than the skillful scale e g at local scale was not considered in this study keywords climate change precipitation greenhouse gas scenario sensitivity uncertainty decomposition climate model ensemble design sensitivity analysis 1 introduction climate scenarios become widely used for decision making including adaptation planning alfieri et al 2015 arnbjerg nielsen et al 2013 brouwers et al 2015 ipcc 2014 tabari et al 2015 they typically take the form of absolute or relative changes from current to future climatic conditions hereafter denoted as climate change signals due to incomplete knowledge on the future greenhouse gas ghg and aerosol concentrations by convenience simplified to ghg concentrations uncertainties inherent to the impact modelling of these concentrations and representation of physical processes the climate change signals should not be reported as single values ranges should be provided to highlight the uncertainties this is however not always done for reasons of simplification in communication and or to avoid confusing messages that was clearly illustrated by mcmahon et al 2015 based on a questionnaire about an ipcc scenario graph that is frequently used in policy orientated messages when the rationale of those messages disappears or when the messages are misinterpreted discussions pop up about directives and guidelines on climate change impact and their inherent uncertainties lorenz et al 2015 information about the credibility of climate projections and so uncertainty assessment is required for an adequate incorporation of climate projections in adaptation strategies and future planning this involves traceability and relative partitioning of uncertainty sources reported climate scenarios are generally affected by the uncertainty in future greenhouse gas and aerosol concentration levels here denoted as the ghg scenario ghs uncertainty the climate model uncertainty and the internal variability deser et al 2012 fatichi et al 2016 hawkins and sutton 2009 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2017 the internal variability of the climate system is hereby represented by the climate model after considering different initial conditions when applying the climate change signals for impact analysis other sources can add uncertainty in hydrological climate change impact analysis for example these would be the change of land use the choice of the hydrological model the chosen parameter set for the hydrological model and the statistical downscaling method producing the projected hydro meteorological input time series addor et al 2014 ahmadalipour et al 2017 brigode et al 2013 chen et al 2011 hundecha et al 2016 karlsson et al 2016 meaurio et al 2017 seo et al 2016 sunyer et al 2015 teutschbein and seibert 2012 vetter et al 2017 uncertainties in the climate change signals are typically assessed by considering an ensemble of climate model runs the structure of such an ensemble is defined by the number of climate models the ghss and the number of runs with different initial conditions for each climate model each of these structural components relates to one specific uncertainty source they are denoted as climate model uncertainty ghs uncertainty and stochastic uncertainty related to the internal variability the use of an ensemble of scenarios or climate model runs results into an increased signal to noise ratio directly benefitting the identification of the climate change signals recent studies analysing the structure of gcm and rcm ensembles sanderson et al 2015 sunyer et al 2013 zubler et al 2016 point at the inter dependency between climate model runs making the number of effective climate model runs smaller than the ensemble size they stress on the importance of the ensemble size and the selection of the climate model runs next to the choice of the number of climate model runs the choice of the ghs represented by representative concentration pathways rcps has also been discussed climate change scenarios are mostly set up by an ensemble composition representing all four rcps moss et al 2010 van vuuren et al 2011 however there is an increased policy interest in these individual ghss and their particular impacts arnell et al 2016 jacob et al 2014 knmi 2015 based on the feasibility and cost efficiency of adaptation strategies policy makers and stakeholders select target values for the climatic changes gosling et al 2017 koutroulis et al 2016 whetton et al 2012 directly corresponding to the ghss and leading to a condensed ensemble composition the constraint of using only one ghs is not new and is a prerequisite for several applications such as agricultural impact assessment on crops demanding co2 changes consistent with the climatic changes to meteorological variables asseng et al 2013 vanuytrecht et al 2015 or land use change assessment demanding socio economic scenarios that are consistent with the ghss chen and yu 2014 karlsson et al 2016 poelmans et al 2011 inter comparison between the climate change scenarios for the different ghss provides prior insights in the ghs sensitivity of the variable considered given that the alteration in ghg concentrations is the driver for the change one expects the climate change signals to be highly dependent on the ghs considered this is often not the case on local scale arnell et al 2016 fatichi et al 2016 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2017 arnell et al 2016 analysed impact changes across different sectors including water resources agriculture and energy they concluded that impact changes increase under increasing ghg forcing they however also stress on the fact that not all differences in impacts results can be ascribed to the underlying forcing similarly differences in impacts across time for a chosen ghs are not fully explained by the time dependency of the forcing level nor can the differences between model projections be explained by the physical and chemical background differences in the climate models rather than a direct inter comparison of the change values across different ghss as applied in the study of arnell et al 2016 the total variance in climate change signals can be decomposed by means of variance analysis into different uncertainty sources within this approach the ghs uncertainty contribution reflects the ghs sensitivity based on older generation climate models hawkins and sutton 2009 have shown that the uncertainty in the global decadal mean temperature is dominantly controlled by model uncertainty and internal variability for the near future but their contribution reduces towards the later future and is replaced by an increased ghs uncertainty contribution they concluded moreover that towards the late 21st century the ghs uncertainty becomes the most relevant uncertainty source of global mean temperature recent studies of fatichi et al 2016 and hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2017 focus on the uncertainty in precipitation changes both studies identify the climate model uncertainty and uncertainty inherent to the internal variability of the climate system as the largest uncertainty contributors for the late 21st century this paper presents the ghs based climate scenarios for precipitation in central belgium the dependency of the climate change signals on the ghss a measure for the ghs sensitivity is visually analysed and assessed in a next step the magnitude of the ghs sensitivity is explored across different variables seasons months and scenario periods and variance decomposition of the climate change signals is applied to this end by means of variance decomposition the total variance in the climate change signals is separated in the contribution of the differences in ghss differences in climate model related characteristics and interaction terms co variance between the uncertainty sources the variable of interest a measure for the ghs sensitivity is the ghs uncertainty contribution finally different ensembles are considered for a sensitivity analysis on the ghs uncertainty contribution the analysis is based on a large ensemble of 160 cmip5 climate model runs these runs were validated based on station observations for the same region as in this study in a previous project by tabari et al 2015 2 data and methods the cmip5 gcm precipitation results taylor et al 2012 are studied for the grid cell covering the main station of the royal meteorological institute of belgium at uccle 4 36 50 80 near brussels these gcm results consider the four rcp based ghss notably rcp 8 5 rcp 6 0 rcp 4 5 and rcp 2 6 van vuuren et al 2011 rcp 2 6 is known as the strong mitigation scenario where the atmospheric ghg concentrations reach a radiative forcing equivalent to 2 6 w m2 by 2100 and a forthcoming global temperature rise in the range 0 9 2 3 c however under current emission trajectories rcp 8 5 is considered a more likely ghs scenario and defines a radiative forcing of 8 5 w m2 by 2100 corresponding to a global temperature rise in the range 3 2 5 4 c the other two rcp scenarios are related to radiative forcings in between these two extremely low and high forcings the total ensemble table a 1 in appendix a includes 160 climate model runs whereas the rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 rcp 6 0 and rcp 8 5 sub ensembles involve 36 48 28 and 48 climate model runs respectively for a prior estimation of the ghs sensitivity of the climate changes section 3 all available climate model runs are considered regardless whether the climate models have runs available for all four rcps for the uncertainty analysis of the climate change signals by means of variance decomposition section 4 only the climate model runs with data for all four rcps 12 climate models see appendix a or two rcps rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 25 climate models see appendix a are considered the climate models might share similar physics and parametrization schemes section 2 in dai 2005 sunyer et al 2015 however in this study they are assumed to be independent and equally important the climate change signals are analysed for precipitation accumulation wet day frequency and daily wet day intensities for different recurrence events a wet day is hereby defined as a day with daily precipitation accumulation exceeding 1 mm stephens et al 2010 the climatic changes of precipitation are described as relative changes and are analysed for the scenario periods 2011 2040 2031 2060 2051 2081 2071 2100 versus the control period 1961 1990 and this for all seasons and months of the year the total variance of the climate change signals vtot is partitioned in the contribution of the greenhouse gas and aerosol concentration scenarios vghs and the climate model related uncertainties the latter uncertainties are mainly due to the uncertainties in the physical climate model parameterizations vgcm and the climate variability as accounted for in the climate models e g the influence of the model initialization vgcmini also the co variance between the uncertainty types the interaction terms vghs gcm vghs gcmini and vgcm gcmini is accounted for eq 1 numerates these uncertainty contributions the equation is however only valid for a balanced climate model ensemble i e in presence of an equal number of realizations climate model with different initial conditions per rcp and for all climate models considered with exception to the csiro model for which 10 realizations per rcp are available most climate models have rather a small and unequal number of available realizations therefore a balanced climate model ensemble 1 realization per rcp per climate model is constructed see appendix a for this balanced ensemble climate models could still have a different variability and therefore the uncertainty contributions by the climate models vgcm and climate variability vgcmini become inseparable for ease of explanation vgcm includes both see eq

the internal variability is analysed using the csiro climate model realizations different to eq 2 a pure uncertainty contribution due to the internal variability is measured i e vgcmini instead of vgcm a similar technique is applied by déqué et al 2007 sunyer et al 2015 and hundecha et al 2016 different years of the climate models were not considered as different realizations 3 ghg scenario based climate scenarios the concept time of emergence was introduced by hawkins and sutton 2012 hawkins and sutton 2012 define it as the time at which the climate change signal emerges from the noise introduced by the internal variability of the climate system the time of emergence for changes in local mean and extreme daily precipitation intensities at several european locations was investigated by maraun 2013 that study sets the time of emergence for changes in local convective summer precipitation at the end of the 21st century similar findings were found in the recent study of king et al 2015 based on the findings of these studies changes between 1961 1990 and 2071 2100 were selected for the prior ghs sensitivity assessment moreover strongest changes in precipitation accumulation and wet day frequency were projected for the winter december january and february and summer june july and august season whereas projections for belgium and neighboring regions ipcc 2013 jacob et al 2014 tabari et al 2015 indicate wetter winters increasing precipitation accumulation and wet day frequency and drier summers deceasing precipitation accumulation and wet day frequency in contrast during spring and autumn there is a transition of the change signals in sign leading to less strong changes the daily precipitation intensities for high recurrence events increase furthermore across all seasons in this context focus is put on the results for winter and summer season whereas january and july are chosen as a representative winter and summer month changes between 1961 1990 and 2071 2100 for the precipitation accumulation and wet day frequency and daily precipitation intensities for different recurrence events are presented in fig 1 and fig 2 respectively the changes are shown on seasonal and monthly time scales considering the complete set of ghss and each of the individual ghss fig 1a shows that towards the late 21st century the winter and summer precipitation accumulation will increase and decrease respectively under the total uncertainty range i e all climate model runs for all ghss are combined the interquartile ranges of the seasonal changes vary between 7 and 21 for winter and between 34 and 1 for summer similar interquartile ranges are noted for the accumulation changes on monthly time scale fig 1a shows furthermore that the precipitation accumulation changes for both time scales and seasons are magnified under increasing ghg forcing we define this behavior as greenhouse gas scenario sensitivity the analysis of the wet day frequency changes fig 1b makes clear that the decrease in summer precipitation accumulation is mainly governed by the large reduction of the wet day frequency under the total uncertainty range the interquartile ranges of the summer changes vary between 37 and 7 the changes for the winter season remain rather small compared to the summer season for the summer season an intensification of the changes under increasing ghg forcing becomes visible similar results are found at the monthly time scale the reduction in summer precipitation is next to the decreasing wet day frequency explained by the decreasing daily precipitation intensities for low recurrence interval events see appendix b however increasing daily precipitation intensities are projected for high recurrence interval events in contrast to summer daily precipitation intensities in winter increase for both low and high recurrence interval events the changes in precipitation intensities for high recurrence interval events are shown in fig 2 the interquartile changes in daily winter precipitation intensities for 1 5 10 and 15 year recurrence events vary between 5 22 3 19 2 21 and 1 23 respectively for the same recurrence intervals the interquartile changes in daily summer precipitation intensities vary in the ranges 3 to 19 3 to 23 3 to 25 and 8 to 32 these ranges point at the larger spread of change values for the summer events this observation remains moreover valid on monthly time scale given that the high recurrence summer events are of convective nature in belgium and the processes underlying convective summer precipitation events are not explicitly resolved due to the coarse model resolution arnbjerg nielsen et al 2013 tabari et al 2016 willems et al 2012 this may partly explain the larger total uncertainty range for that season the interquartile ranges differ also across time scales e g seasonal versus monthly time scale stronger changes in the winter precipitation intensities are observed on the monthly time scale whereas for summer these are found on the seasonal time scale hence the use of the seasonal time scale has an averaging effect for the winter results and may underestimate the changes at smaller time scales i e monthly but it may also lead to more robust climate changes signals particularly in summer as it reduces the sampling uncertainty the comparison between the use of a seasonal time scale for winter and a monthly time scale for summer assigns larger consequences to the use of a monthly time scale for summer for example the median change value for daily summer precipitation intensity for a 10 year recurrence event measures 10 on the seasonal scale whereas there is almost no change on the monthly time scale given that the median changes are positive and given that the changes are induced in the model by the ghg changes one would expect a positive magnification of the changes with increasing ghg concentrations this is the case for the daily winter precipitation intensity changes but often not for the summer intensity changes 4 identification of the ghg scenario sensitivity of the climate scenarios 4 1 variance contributions of the ghs uncertainty to obtain further insights in the ghs sensitivity of the climate change scenarios the total variance of the climate changes is partitioned into the sub variances induced by the ghss the climate models and the interaction between both eq 2 the interaction term accounts for the co variance as a result of dependency between the climate model and ghs related uncertainties the importance of the interaction term is analysed by means of the plots in fig 3 these plots show the difference between the total climate change and the gcm induced change versus the difference between the change and the ghs induced change see also appendix c larger deviations against the ghs induced change typically correspond with larger deviations against the gcm induced change this correlation is stronger during summer and for the changes in daily precipitation intensities for high recurrence events the relative contribution of the different uncertainty sources to the total variance depends firstly on the scenario period considered generally as shown by fig 4 the ghs uncertainty contribution increases with increasing time horizon for example the ghs uncertainty contribution to the variance in winter precipitation accumulation changes increases over time from 3 for the changes between 1961 1990 and 2011 2040 to 15 for the changes between 1961 1990 and 2071 2100 the ghs uncertainty contribution to the changes in daily winter precipitation intensities for a 1 10 and 15 year recurrence event between 1961 1990 and 2011 2040 and 1961 1990 and 2071 2100 increases in a similar way by 17 10 and 11 respectively the increase in ghs uncertainty contribution with increasing time horizon is due to the higher ghg changes leading to stronger climate change signals coincidentally the total variance of the climate change signals increases see appendix d the increase in magnitude of the climate change signals is not uni directional over time because it is influenced by the internal variability of the climate system e g for daily summer precipitation and winter wet day frequency the results in fig 4 allow to determine the time of emergence this time is longer for the daily summer precipitation intensity changes this observation has also been made by maraun 2013 based on the 10 csiro realizations after different climate model initializations the ghs uncertainty contribution and the uncertainty contribution inherent to the internal variability of the climate system gcmini for the variance in precipitation accumulation changes are reported in fig 5 this figure shows that towards the end of the 21st century the ghs uncertainty increases moreover the ghs uncertainty contribution gains weight within the total uncertainty balance and this at the expense of the uncertainty contribution inherent to the internal variability of the climate system fig 6 presents the relative contribution of all uncertainty sources in the total variance of the change signals between 1961 1990 and 2071 2100 for all variables and seasons the climate model uncertainty the uncertainty inherent to the internal variability of the climate system included has the highest share in the total variance it varies in the range 73 85 for the precipitation accumulation 82 76 for the wet day frequency and 58 52 65 55 and 71 62 for the daily precipitation intensities for a 1 10 and 15 year recurrence event respectively with exception to the winter precipitation accumulation and the summer wet day frequency the interaction term is identified as the second largest uncertainty source the uncertainty contribution by the interaction term is larger for the daily precipitation intensities for high recurrence events compared to the results for the wet day frequency and the precipitation changes for the daily precipitation intensities of high recurrence events it ranges between 19 and 45 this is in agreement with the results presented in fig 3 the contribution of the ghs uncertainty then varies in the range 15 7 for the precipitation accumulation 0 16 for the wet day frequency and 18 4 10 11 and 11 7 for daily precipitation intensities for a 1 10 and 15 year recurrence event respectively focusing on the relative contribution of the ghs uncertainty contribution it is shown in fig 6 that the ghs uncertainty contribution moreover depends on the season in general the ghs uncertainty contribution is higher in winter than in summer for example for precipitation accumulation the ghs uncertainty contribution is 8 higher in winter than in summer only for the wet day frequency a higher ghs uncertainty contribution is observed during summer these observations remain valid over increasing time horizon as shown by fig 4 also the time scale e g monthly versus seasonal influences the ghs uncertainty contribution fig 7 the time scale has the strongest influence on the changes in daily summer precipitation intensities for high recurrence events for that season the use of the monthly time scale results into a lower ghs uncertainty contribution 0 38 0 77 in comparison with the seasonal time scale 4 11 4 2 variance contributions of ghs uncertainty explained by ghs sensitivity the ghs uncertainty contribution fig 6 remains rather low for some variables especially for the daily summer precipitation intensities of high recurrence intervals also by visual inspection the ghs sensitivity of these variables is difficult to identify fig 3 to study this further a sensitivity analysis is conducted on the structural elements of the ensemble in first instance the sensitivity on the considered ghss is measured by considering only two rcps rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 instead of all four in a next step by consideration of only rcp 8 5 and rcp 4 5 26 climate models become available and the ghs uncertainty is measured for different ensemble sizes and different climate model combinations through monte carlo analysis randomly selecting sub samples from these 26 models for different ensemble sizes varying between 2 and 26 climate models confidence intervals are computed on the variance explained by the ghss results for this sensitivity analysis are presented in fig 8 the ghs contribution for the originally selected 12 climate models with data for all four rcps are also indicated based on the originally selected 12 models the sensitivity on the considered ghss is assessed by comparing the results based on 2 and 4 rcps results are similar for the daily winter precipitation intensities and 10 and 15 year recurrence events for all other cases a larger ghs uncertainty contribution is found for the ensemble based on four rcps to further study the influence of the ensemble size based on an ensemble size of 12 climate models different combinations of climate models are considered and their corresponding ghs uncertainty contributions are determined comparison of the 5 50 and 95 confidence intervals shows that the originally selected climate model ensemble produces often biased estimates of the ghs uncertainty contribution moreover the use of the original ensemble results in an overestimation of the ghs uncertainty contribution for summer precipitation accumulation and daily summer precipitation intensities for a 10 and 15 year recurrence event this shows that gcm ensembles should be carefully selected to avoid biased ghs uncertainty estimates fig 8 also shows that a larger ensemble size is more important than the climate model selection 5 discussion and conclusions in this study we assessed the greenhouse gas scenario sensitivity and quantified the main uncertainty sources in the precipitation projections for central belgium these projections are based on a large ensemble of cmip5 global climate models validated at the global dai 2005 stephens et al 2010 and local tabari et al 2015 scale these validation studies and others jacob et al 2014 kendon et al 2012 point at the limited skill of climate models in simulating precipitation patterns and hence biased precipitation statistics in order to understand this bias one has to consider that precipitation patterns are driven by thermodynamical processes i e processes related to the atmospheric moisture availability and by the large scale atmospheric circulation patterns mesoscale and local feedbacks e g topography lapse rate and soil moisture emori and brown 2005 van ulden and van oldenborgh 2006 lenderink and fowler 2017 kendon et al 2010 kröner 2016 kröner et al 2017 o gorman and schneider 2009 o gorman 2015 santos et al 2016 generally under increasing ghg concentrations the available atmospheric moisture increases hence the thermodynamical processes govern a global and overall increase in projected precipitation amounts emori and brown 2005 kendon et al 2010 kröner et al 2017 o gorman 2015 souverijns et al 2016 moreover under increasing ghg concentrations the midlatitude jet stream shifts poleward barnes and screen 2015 zappa et al 2013 during the winter season also an eastward extension of the midlatitude jet stream is observed zappa et al 2013 consequently the number position and strength of the anti cyclonic weather types in the euro atlantic region change santos et al 2016 zappa et al 2013 due to these changing dynamical processes an increasing summer precipitation amount is projected for northern europe and a strong decreasing amount for southern europe kröner 2016 kröner et al 2017 santos et al 2016 zappa et al 2013 for winter with exception to southern europe the precipitation amount is projected to remain constant slightly decrease or slightly increase kröner 2016 santos et al 2016 zappa et al 2013 considering central belgium the projected increase in average winter precipitation amount is due to dominating thermodynamical processes for the summer season the small lapse rate effect and dynamical processes lead to decreasing precipitation amounts combined these drivers dominate the thermodynamical processes resulting in a decreasing average summer precipitation amount the decreasing summer wet day frequency is controlled by dynamical processes i e an increasing occurrence frequency of dry weather types kröner 2016 santos et al 2016 considering these dominant processes one expects that the ghss drive the precipitation changes provided by the ensemble but the climate model related uncertainties play an important role as well for most seasons a clear ghs sensitivity is concluded for precipitation variables in central belgium with stronger changes for higher ghss higher changes for rcp 8 5 than for rcp 6 0 rcp 4 5 and rcp 2 6 as expected the changes are uni directional more positive changes for higher ghss if the changes are positive more negative changes if the changes are negative in some cases surprising results are obtained where the climate change signal does not show a clear dependency with the ghs even when such dependency is expected on physical grounds given that the ghg changes are the primary driver for the changes one expects the impact results to be dependent on the ghs by applying variance decomposition the total variance in the climate change signals was decomposed in different uncertainty sources the ghs uncertainty which is a measure for the ghs sensitivity was given particular focus underlying reasons for a low ghs sensitivity were identified by changing the considered ghss ensemble size and combinations of climate models for a given ensemble size this study accounts for the ghs gcm co variation uncertainty and this thereupon explains the differences with the results found in the studies of fatichi et al 2016 and hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2017 the relative importance of the studied uncertainty types strongly depends on the variable under study its recurrence interval the season and month of the year and the time horizon the results on the tracing of the influence of the ghs uncertainty versus gcm related uncertainties show at first that the gcm uncertainty remains the largest uncertainty source over time however the ghs uncertainty contribution is found to gain importance towards more distinct time horizons leading to increasing change signals over time the time of emergence of the climate change signal can therefore also be identified based on the evolution of the ghs uncertainty contribution also the time scale of the studied climate change signals seasonal versus monthly is found important as the shorter time scales may lead to information loss this is especially the case for daily summer precipitation intensity changes and high recurrence intervals for which high sampling uncertainty dominates at the monthly time scale results moreover show that the importance of the ghs uncertainty has strong variable dependent differences higher ghs uncertainty contributions are obtained for the wet day frequency summer and precipitation accumulation changes for the daily precipitation intensity changes of high recurrence events lower ghs uncertainty contributions are found the relevance of the ghs gcm co variation uncertainty remains limited for the wet day frequency and precipitation accumulation changes and is occasionally identified as the second largest uncertainty source next to the gcm uncertainty however for the precipitation intensities of high recurrence events the ghs gcm co variation uncertainty is identified as the second largest uncertainty source moreover a higher contribution is measured during summer for the most distinct time horizon 2071 2100 the gcm uncertainty contribution varies in the range 82 76 for the wet day frequency 73 85 for the precipitation accumulation changes and 58 52 52 49 65 55 and 71 62 for the daily precipitation intensity changes for a 1 5 10 and 15 year recurrence event respectively for that same time horizon the ghs uncertainty contribution varies in the range 0 16 for the wet day frequency 15 7 for the precipitation accumulation changes and 18 4 21 3 10 11 and 11 7 for the daily precipitation intensity changes for a 1 5 10 and 15 year recurrence event respectively what strikes in these results is the lower ghs uncertainty contribution for the daily summer precipitation intensity changes for high recurrence events we note that the coarse gcm resolution has a profound influence during the summer due to the more local nature of precipitation extremes in the study region tabari et al 2016 the sensitivity analysis on the ghs uncertainty contribution highlights that one has to be careful interpreting climate change signals based on an ensemble of climate model simulations over the years many methods for the design of climate model ensembles and the selection of climate model runs have been introduced cannon 2015 chen et al 2017 knutti et al 2010 mendlik and gobiet 2016 zubler et al 2016 many of these methods aim to reduce the ensemble size and so the computational costs during impact analysis some methods account for the dependency between the climate models this study however has shown that biased ghs uncertainty contributions are more likely obtained for smaller ensemble sizes irrespective of the variable and season considered two approaches are available to deal with biased ghs uncertainty contributions for a specific ensemble size a change in the combination of climate model runs can benefit the ghs uncertainty contribution towards the small ensemble sizes the probability of biased low and high ghs uncertainty contributions increases and one is better off to increase the ensemble size than changing the combination of climate model runs towards the higher ensemble sizes biased ghs uncertainty contributions can be resolved by changing the combination of climate models or increasing the ensemble size results of this study show that one needs to be aware of biased results for climate change signals and ghs sensitivity for both small and bigger ensemble sizes the results of this study are based on climate model data for one grid cell the grid cell scale is however smaller than the skillful scale of climate models and therefore poses a limitation to this study specifically noise introduced by different numerical schemes reduces the accuracy of climate model data at grid cell scale and could potentially have influenced the results of this study benestad et al 2008 grotch and maccracken 1991 moreover the large scale atmospheric circulation patterns a principal driver for precipitation are not captured at grid cell scale follow up studies should involve other types of uncertainties when the climate change signals are applied for impact analysis in hydrology these are the uncertainties in the dynamic and statistical downscaling the bias correction and the hydrological impact analysis also the dependency between different climate models statistical downscaling and bias correction methods should be addressed acknowledgments this

7438,shallow sediment core samples from two locales in the mesopotamian marshlands of iraq were analyzed to characterize the extractable organic lipid compounds and their sources and distributions after hydrological restoration by re flooding of the marshes dried samples were extracted with a dichloromethane methanol mixture before analysis by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms the major compounds were n alkanes fatty acids and alcohols steroids terpenoids hopanes steranes unresolved complex mixture ucm and plasticizers the lipid compounds in kurmashia al hammar marshes were generally higher in concentration than in abu zirig central marshes and decreased with core depths for both sites this concentration decrease with core depth is attributed to transformation biodegradation and variable input processes the distribution patterns of the lipids in the sediment cores indicated that the abu zirig area was drier than kurmashia before the re flooding process furthermore the concentration of the compounds in the surface sediment the abu zirig core was as high and similar to that in kurmashia reflecting the re flooding impacts on the marsh and the revival of the wetland the major sources of these lipids were from natural terrestrial vegetation 35 66 for abu zirig 40 49 for kurmashia microbial plankton residues and bacteria 27 52 for abu zirig 39 43 for

triterpenoids 1 introduction the mesopotamian marshes of iraq are shallow freshwater and lakes extending from 30 to 33 on and from 45 to 48 oe they are created by the euphrates and tigris rivers covering about 15 000 km2 and are considered the most widespread wetland complex ecosystem in the middle east brasington 2002 partow 2001 many peoples living in the region have depended largely on the wetlands for centuries a region where civilization was well established and sophisticated irrigation systems had been developed thesiger 1985 salim 1962 the largest wetlands of the mesopotamian marshes include the al hammar marshes south of the euphrates river the central marshes north of the euphrates and west of the tigris rivers and the al hawizeh marshes extending east from the tigris into the iran border the wetland marshes are utilized for cultivation freshwater fisheries and livelihood of the local people salim 1962 talling 1980 thesiger 1985 young 1983 water levels reach the maximum in early spring and then fall by as much as two meters during the hot dry summer al saaidi et al 1981 talling 1980 drainage of wetlands diversion of water supplies and dam building are the main threats to the marshes in iraq partow 2001 the major hydrological engineering activities in and around the area of lower mesopotamia have resulted in the drying out of vast areas of wetlands in the central marches and al hammar and could eventually lead to the disappearance of these systems lawler 2005 richardson et al 2005 currently 10 of the marshlands in iraq remain as fully functioning wetlands because of the extensive drainage and upstream agricultural irrigation programs on the tigris and euphrates rivers douabul et al 1988 lawler 2005 maltby 1994 partow 2001 the severe reduction in water availability excessive salt buildup pollution and dumping of toxic wastes and poisons during the war and loss of the seed bank of native plant species make it difficult to rapidly restore the drained marshes partow 2001 lawler 2005 richardson et al 2005 since 2003 restoration by re flooding of drained marshes has been proceeding in the central and al hammar marshlands lawler 2005 partow 2001 however uncontrolled re flooding may have counterproductive adverse impacts on the restoration processes of these wetlands therefore interdisciplinary studies are necessary and essential especially during the restoration operations that are currently taking place previous studies for similar sites focused on the characteristics levels and sources of organic matter on surface sediments with little attention to the impact of flooding to their distribution rushdi et al 2006a b thus the purpose of this work is to determine the impacts of re flooding on the distributions and sources of lipid compounds in extractable organic matter of shallow sediment cores from the central and al hammar marshes 2 experimental 2 1 sampling sites abu zirig marsh of the central marshes is in a natural depression north of an nasiriyah at the terminal end of the gharraf river fig 1 the shatt abu lihia river channel which runs through the marsh until it dissipates at the southern end is the main supply of water to the marsh also the abu ismaisim abul al jury and al rumaidh channels which emanate from the gharraf river are other supplies of water to the marsh the rivers and channels feed the marsh along its northerly perimeter the marsh terminates at the left bank of the euphrates river the abu zirig marsh was fairly dry and re flooded in april 2003 as a result of the direct action of the ministry of water resources at the request of the local population kurmashia marsh is located southeast of an nasiriyah at the head of the al hammar marsh fig 1 this area was relatively wet and has been inundated since may 2003 as a result of the opening of the termini of several distributary canals from the euphrates its area may reach more than 100 km2 and it contains a considerable variety of plant cover and various water depths ranging from open mudflats to open water around 2 m deep 2 2 sampling and sample preparation sediment core samples were collected from the abu zirig lat 31 7 48 n

mixture of dichloromethane methanol dcm meoh 3 1 v v the sonication was carried out in a 150 ml precleaned beaker the extract aliquots were combined and filtered by a filtration unit with an annealed glass fiber filter for the removal of sediment particles the filtrate was first concentrated on a rotary evaporator followed by a stream of dry nitrogen gas to a volume of approximately 200 µl the volume was adjusted to 500 µl exactly by addition of dcm meoh 3 1 v v aliquots 50 ml of the total extracts were converted to their trimethylsilyl tms derivatives using n o bis trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetamide bstfa containing 1 trimethylchlorosilane tmcs pierce and pyridine pierce for 3 h at 70 c the excess reagent was evaporated by a stream of nitrogen and the product dissolved in an equivalent volume of hexane prior to analysis 2 4 instrumental analysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms was carried out with a hewlett packard 6890 gas chromatograph coupled to a 5973 mass

observed for the kurmashia site ranging from 9 3 to 17 6 μg g 1 and showed different distributions with depth where the concentrations increased from 11 1 μg g 1 at 0 5 cm to 17 6 μg g 1 and then

cmax at 27 and or 29 depending on the plant species as well as the season and locality e g eglinton and hamilton 1967 simoneit 1977 street et al 2012 the contributions of different sources of plant wax n alkanes were calculated according to simoneit et al 1991a in order to better evaluate the relative input from various vegetation sources supplemental material table sm1 the percentages of wax n alkanes of aquatic residues from algae and mosses representing wet conditions ranged from 8 7 to 12 9 of the total n alkanes for abu zirig and from 9 6 to 14 6 for kurmashia they decreased with depth to minima at 5 10 cm then increased slightly indicating minor changes in the aquatic conditions of the sites table sm1 the woody plant wax n alkanes range from 25 3 to 29 7 and changed slightly with depth for the abu zirig for kurmashia they ranged from 15 3 to 26 7 with a minimum at 5 10 cm and increase at depth table sm1 the percent fractions of grass wax n alkanes were relatively higher in sediments from abu zirig 14 4 20 5 with a slight depth increase and for kurmashia 7 4 15 3 no significant change with depth these differences in source fractions indicate that abu zirig was relatively drier than kurmashia the percent fractions of natural plant n alkanes were relatively higher for abu zirig 50 4 62 with a slight depth increase and for kurmashia 34 5 56 6 a decrease to a minimum at 5 10 cm then slight increase with depth phytol 3 7 11 15 tetramethyl 2 hexadecen 1 ol which is apparently produced from the hydrolysis of chlorophyll and some microbial sources bendoraitis et al 1962 maxwell et al 1971 ikan et al 1975 didyk et al 1978 generally produces pristane 2 6 10 14 tetramethylpentadecane and phytane 2 6 10 14 tetramethylhexadecane as a result of geochemical diagenesis both pristane and phytane are present in crude oil diesel fuel and lubricating oil as well as in both auto and diesel engine exhaust simoneit 1984 1985 the presence of pristane and phytane along with the ucm of branched and cyclic compounds generally confirm the contamination by residues from fossil fuel and petroleum products simoneit 1984 1985 the presence of pristane in sediments as a dominant compound can also indicate that zooplankton is its main source blumer et al 1963 therefore high ratio of pr pr ranging between 3 and 5 suggests unpolluted sediments steinhauer and boehm 1992 all sediment samples showed pr ph ratios of 0 56 table sm1 suggesting that their major source was petroleum products the percent fractions of petroleum n alkanes in sediments ranged from 38 1 to 49 6 for abu zirig and from 43 4 to 65 5 for kurmashia generally decreasing with core depths table sm1 3 2 fatty acids and alcohols the n alkanoic acids ranged from c8 to c18 with a cmax at 16 for all core sections except at 10 15 cm cmax 8 for abu zirig and for kurmashia they extended to c24 with a cmax at 16 table sm1 and table 1 their total concentrations ranged from 3 1 to 18 5 μg g 1 for abu zirig with the maximum at 0 5 cm the concentrations were higher for kurmashia ranging from to 21 9 28 9 μg g 1 fig 3b the carbon preference indices cpi e o for the entire range were 2 4 6 0 for abu zirig and 4 3 5 0 for kurmashia the methyl n alkanoate concentrations i e n alkanoic acid methyl esters ranged from 0 99 to 10 8 μg g 1 for abu zirig and for kurmashia from 0 26 to 3 4 μg g 1 both generally decreasing with depth table sm1 the cmax was at 16 and the cpi e o was similar as the free alkanoic acids table sm1 the source of methyl n alkanoates is inferred to be the same as for the n alkanoic acids above and they may be experimental artifacts that formed by transesterification in the extraction solvent from the fatty acids or wax esters present alkanoic acids from planktonic diatoms algae microbial mats and bacteria are characterized by odd carbon numbered and branched homologues c20 whereas terrestrial plants have mainly even carbon numbered homologues c20 simoneit 1978 perry et al 1979 volkman et al 1980 kharlamenko et al 1995 budge and parish 1998 therefore we treated all fatty acids c20 as inputs from microbial sources and all c20 from terrestrial inputs accordingly the fatty acids for abu zirig were mainly from local microbial inputs and relatively higher terrestrial than microbial inputs were observed for kurmashia the total n alkanols ranged from 26 9 to 59 1 μg g 1 and increased slightly with depth for the core from abu zirig the cmax was at 26 or 28 and the cpi e o ranged from 5 6 to 7 6 for kurmashia the cmax was at 30 and the cpi e o ranged from 5 7 to 6 2 whereas the concentrations reached a maximum 137 1 μg g 1 at 5 10 cm then decreased with depth table 1 fig 3c table sm1 the presence of n alkanols as major compounds with a strong even carbon numbered predominance indicates an input of vascular plant wax from semitropical to tropical environments simoneit 1977 1978 1989 rushdi et al 2006b treignier et al 2006 the n alkanol concentrations were higher than the n alkanoic acid concentrations for both sites fig 3b c the lower concentrations of alkanoic acids and alkanols in the core from abu zirig suggest that the site was dry for years and the recent re flooding increased the alkanoic acids in the surface sediment on the other hand their concentrations in the kurmashia core indicate that re flooding had no apparent concentration effect with depth suggesting that the site was wet during the years before re flooding the presence of long chain c22 n alkanols with an even carbon numbered predominance has been attributed to terrestrial sources simoneit 1989 rielley et al 1991 treignier et al 2006 whereas the short chain c22 homologues are reported as markers of microbial sources robinson et al 1984a the obvious high t c12 c20 t c24 c32 ratio for both n alkanoic acids and n alkanols in the shallow surface sediment of abu zirig fig 3d implies an increase of microbial activity after wetting due to re flooding this elevated ratio was not observed for the kurmashia site 3 3 steroids and terpenoids steroids comprising stenols stanols stenones and stanones were major compounds in the core samples from both marsh sites the stenols ranged from c27 to c31 with concentrations of 20 1 36 3 µg g 1 and 31 4 53 0 µg g 1 for abu zirig and kurmashia respectively and decreased slightly with depth for both tables 1 and sm1 the stanols stenones and stanones had similar ranges with lower concentrations as the stenols table 1 steroids are derived from both faunal and floral tissues akhisa and kokke 1991 hence they occur in all ecosystems they can be used to identify sources and fate of organic matter in the environment volkman et al 1981 rushdi et al 2006b campesterol stigmasterol and sitosterol are major stenols phytosterols in terrestrial plant lipids moreau et al 2002 whereas cholesterol is the main sterol in animal lipids and some phytoplankton and aquatic microbes volkman 1986 voet and voet 2004 brassicasterol dinosterol and cholesterol minor are dominant stenols in plankton dinoflagellates and diatoms didyk et al 1978 boon et al 1979 de leeuw et al 1983 robinson et al 1984a b volkman 1986 2003 volkman et al 1993 giner and boyer 1998 the phytosterols in these samples are interpreted to originate from terrestrial higher plant sources barbier et al 1981 moreau et al 2002 simoneit et al 1983 and their similar distribution pattern indicates the same source fig 3e the aquatic plant and microbial sterols have a similar depth concentration pattern as the phytosterols fig 3g with the highest levels for kurmashia stanols including coprostanol cholestanol campestanol and stigmastanol were also major compounds in these sediment samples cholestanol was the dominant stanol followed by campestanol then stigmastanol fig 2 the highest concentrations of stanols were observed for kurmashia 43 51 µg g 1 and lower for abu zirig 26 34 µg g 1 with a slight decrease with depth for both table 1 stanols occur in dinoflagellates which are often the major direct source of 5α stanols e g dinosterol in marine sediments robinson et al 1984b the 5β stanols e g coprostanol and epimer epi coprostanol are major components of the total sterols in carnivore feces chris et al 2001 and are derived from anaerobic bacterial alteration of sterols the 5β phytostanols e g 5β stigmastan 3β ol and epimer also formed by anaerobic bacterial alteration of the natural product precursors are eliminated in feces of herbivores rogge et al 2006 the significant stanols in these samples indicate microbial alteration of sterols where coprostanol generally is due to sewage sources and 5β campestanol and 5β stigmastanol are from animal waste fernandes et al 1999 chris et al 2001 rogge et al 2006 the stenones and stanones were significant mostly 5 µg g 1 and decreased with depth for both sites table 1 their presence indicates chemical oxidation of biogenic sterols mackenzie et al 1982 diterpenoids mainly neophytadiene isophytene 3z and 3e phyta 1 3 diene phyta 2 4 diene and phytol were found in all samples fig 2 table sm1 their concentrations were low 1 3 7 9 μg g 1 for abu zirig and 2 8 3 3 μg g 1 for kurmashia and had similar distribution patterns with depth for both sites with the highest amount in the surface sediment from abu zirig table sm1 fig 3h phytol is generally derived from the side chain of chlorophyll a and can be observed in different ecosystems volkman and maxwell 1986 the presence of phytadienes indicated an origin from biodegradation of phytol under anaerobic conditions grossi et al 1998 rontani and volkman 2003 tetrahymanol tetrahymanone gammacer 3 one 17β h 21 β h bishomohopan 32 ol were the major triterpenoids in these samples table sm1 their concentrations were 4 4 7 3 µg g 1 for abu zirig and 7 1 8 1 µg g 1 for kurmashia table sm1 fig 3h these triterpenoids including dinosterol indicate a microbial origin the major sources of tetrahymanol include the protozoan tetrahymena pyriformis mallory et al 1963 holz and conner 1973 some ferns zander et al 1969 and cultures of an anaerobic rumen fungus kemp et al 1984 hence tetrahymanol with its derivative tetrahymanone support an input of organic detritus from aquatic plankton the ββ bishomohopan 32 ol is an early diagenetic product from bacteriohopanepolyol indicating oxidation or bacterial reworking of microbial organic detritus and is a known component in sediments of aquatic environments ourisson et al 1979 brassell et al 1983 philp 1985 venkatesan 1989 3 4 hopanes and steranes hopanes and steranes were detected in the samples from both sites the hopanes ranged from c27 to c34 no c28 with cmax at 29 or 30 and concentrations of 0 2 1 1 μg g 1 for abu zirig and 1 6 3 2 μg g 1 for kurmashia table 1 fig 3i steranes were also present in these samples but at lower concentrations than the hopanes table 1 fig 3j the occurrence of hopane and sterane hydrocarbons in an environment indicates contamination from fossil fuel residues e g simoneit 1984 simoneit et al 1991b medeiros et al 2005 rushdi et al 2016 the major hopane biomarkers detected in these samples were dominantly 17α h 21β h the more thermodynamically stable and minor 17β h 21α h hopanes with the α β series fully mature and the homologs c30 present as the equilibrated c 22 r s isomer pairs equilibrium ratio 0 56 simoneit 1984 peters and moldowan 1993 these compounds are commonly utilized as confirming environmental tracers for petroleum and vehicle engine exhaust simoneit 1984 1985 the ratios of c 22s s r for the c31 and c32 hopanes ranged from 0 68 to 0 78 and 0 07 0 82 for abu zirig respectively and for kurmashia from 0 46 to 0 82 and 0 28 0 84 respectively table sm1 these values are similar to those for petroleum products and mature crude oil kvenvolden et al 1990 rushdi and simoneit 2002a b confirming that these hopanes are from such sources steranes are also introduced into the environment from petroleum or lubricants in direct emissions of vehicular engines abas and simoneit 1996 municipal wastewaters and refinery activities are other possible sources for such inputs to the aquatic environment laws 1993 discharges from ship washing and boat traffic are yet other sources of petroleum components to sediments thus steranes are also useful as confirming tracer indicators for pollution from oil products in the environment e g albaiges and cuberes 1980 aboul kassim and simoneit 1996 traces of steranes in these sediments occurred as 20s and 20r epimers with mainly the 5α 14α 17β and minor 5α 14α 17α configurations the ratio of sterane epimerization of c 20s s r for c27 and c29 for abu zirig was 0 27 0 76 and 0 42 0 50 respectively and for kurmashia 0 77 0 82 and 0 53 respectively table sm1 these ratios indicated that the steranes were from crude oil related products and petroleum sources 3 5 unresolved complex mixture the occurrence of an unresolved complex mixture ucm of branched and cyclic hydrocarbons is common in aquatic sediments and is related mainly to oil spills and or fossil fuel utilization simoneit 1985 the ucm for abu zirig ranged from 2 3 to 5 7 μg g 1 decreasing with depth and for kurmashia 11 7 21 4 μg g 1 with a maximum at shallow depth table 1 the ratio of ucm to resolved peaks u r mazurek and simoneit 1984 varied from 0 22 to 0 69 for abu zirig and 0 53 0 63 for kurmashia table 1 the declines of the ucm concentrations with depth indicate less historic input of petroleum products the concentrations of total petroleum residues i e petroleum n alkanes pristane phytane hopanes steranes and ucm versus core depths were higher for kurmashia except for the shallow sediment than for abu zirig fig 3k 3 6 plasticizers plasticizers were important components of these samples and included diethyl phthalate di n butyl phthalate diisobutyl phthalate and di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate their concentrations ranged from 2 3 to 5 7 μg g 1 for abu zirig and 1 8 21 7 μg g 1 for kurmashia table sm1 fig 3l the decrease in plasticizer concentrations with depth may be due to degradation or varied inputs 3 7 locale similarity comparison both natural biogenic and anthropogenic sources are the main inputs of the lipid compounds to the sediments of the central and al hammar marshes as indicated by the results of this work for the purpose of understanding the similarity and difference between the central marshes abu zirig site and the al hammar marshes kurmashia site as well as the impact of the re flooding practice on these marshes the entire data set was analyzed statistically by principal component analysis pca techniques using the spss ibm statistical package for the social sciences version 16 the output of the pca analysis explaining 97 8 of the variance is shown in fig 4 where two groups were recognized the first group c1 explaining 95 included all the depths from both sites and the second one c2 explaining 2 8 included only the surface 0 5 cm depth sediment from abu zirig this indicates that the sources of organic matter to the central and al hammar marshes are generally similar where the central marshes were relatively wetter than the al hammar marshes thus the recent restoration of the marshes by re flooding has an evident effect on the al hammar marshes 3 8 input sources the sources of the lipid compounds in these sediments are from allochthonous terrestrial higher plants autochthonous aquatic microbiota and anthropogenic inputs the terrestrial vascular plant input is calculated as the sum of the wax n alkanes plus the polar lipid compounds i e n alkanoic acids and n alkanols with chain lengths c20 and c28 and c29 sterols the aquatic sources from algal and microbial inputs are estimated as the total lipids with chain lengths c20 stanones tetrahymanol tetrahymanone and ββ bishomohopanol the results show that lipid compounds from both aquatic microbial sources 27 52 for abu zirig 39 42 for kurmashia and terrestrial vascular plant wax 35 66 for abu zirig 40 49 for kurmashia are major sources the anthropogenic input from petroleum hydrocarbons including n alkanes ucm hopanes and steranes and plasticizers were significant in these sediments 6 13 for abu zirig 9 18 for kurmashia fig 5 4 conclusion the analytical results for sediment core samples from the abu zirig i e central marshes and kurmashia al hammar marshes sites showed that the major contributors to the extractable organic matter were both natural biogenic organic compounds and anthropogenic inputs mainly petroleum and plasticizers the natural sources of the lipid compounds were mainly 1 allochthonous from surrounding vegetation as confirmed by the presence of high levels of phytosterols 2 autochthonous from algal and plankton productivity as is evident by the presence of tetrahymanol cholesterol and dinosterol and 3 from organic matter alteration by bacteria and fungi as indicated by the presence of ββ bishomohopan 32 ol anthropogenic pollution input is obvious from petroleum residues and plastic wastes as based on the presence of the ucm pristane phytane hopanes steranes and phthalate derivatives the distribution patterns of the different lipid compounds with sediment depths indicate that the central marshes were drier than the al hammar marshes before the restoration by re flooding they also indicate that this re flooding restoration process has apparently improved the ecosystem of the central marshes appendix a supplementary data

7438,shallow sediment core samples from two locales in the mesopotamian marshlands of iraq were analyzed to characterize the extractable organic lipid compounds and their sources and distributions after hydrological restoration by re flooding of the marshes dried samples were extracted with a dichloromethane methanol mixture before analysis by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms the major compounds were n alkanes fatty acids and alcohols steroids terpenoids hopanes steranes unresolved complex mixture ucm and plasticizers the lipid compounds in kurmashia al hammar marshes were generally higher in concentration than in abu zirig central marshes and decreased with core depths for both sites this concentration decrease with core depth is attributed to transformation biodegradation and variable input processes the distribution patterns of the lipids in the sediment cores indicated that the abu zirig area was drier than kurmashia before the re flooding process furthermore the concentration of the compounds in the surface sediment the abu zirig core was as high and similar to that in kurmashia reflecting the re flooding impacts on the marsh and the revival of the wetland the major sources of these lipids were from natural terrestrial vegetation 35 66 for abu zirig 40 49 for kurmashia microbial plankton residues and bacteria 27 52 for abu zirig 39 43 for kurmashia with a minor contribution from anthropogenic sources including plastic wastes and petroleum 6 13 for abu zirig 9 18 for kurmashia keywords mesopotamian marshes gc ms lipids steroids triterpenoids 1 introduction the mesopotamian marshes of iraq are shallow freshwater and lakes extending from 30 to 33 on and from 45 to 48 oe they are created by the euphrates and tigris rivers covering about 15 000 km2 and are considered the most widespread wetland complex ecosystem in the middle east brasington 2002 partow 2001 many peoples living in the region have depended largely on the wetlands for centuries a region where civilization was well established and sophisticated irrigation systems had been developed thesiger 1985 salim 1962 the largest wetlands of the mesopotamian marshes include the al hammar marshes south of the euphrates river the central marshes north of the euphrates and west of the tigris rivers and the al hawizeh marshes extending east from the tigris into the iran border the wetland marshes are utilized for cultivation freshwater fisheries and livelihood of the local people salim 1962 talling 1980 thesiger 1985 young 1983 water levels reach the maximum in early spring and then fall by as much as two meters during the hot dry summer al saaidi et al 1981 talling 1980 drainage of wetlands diversion of water supplies and dam building are the main threats to the marshes in iraq partow 2001 the major hydrological engineering activities in and around the area of lower mesopotamia have resulted in the drying out of vast areas of wetlands in the central marches and al hammar and could eventually lead to the disappearance of these systems lawler 2005 richardson et al 2005 currently 10 of the marshlands in iraq remain as fully functioning wetlands because of the extensive drainage and upstream agricultural irrigation programs on the tigris and euphrates rivers douabul et al 1988 lawler 2005 maltby 1994 partow 2001 the severe reduction in water availability excessive salt buildup pollution and dumping of toxic wastes and poisons during the war and loss of the seed bank of native plant species make it difficult to rapidly restore the drained marshes partow 2001 lawler 2005 richardson et al 2005 since 2003 restoration by re flooding of drained marshes has been proceeding in the central and al hammar marshlands lawler 2005 partow 2001 however uncontrolled re flooding may have counterproductive adverse impacts on the restoration processes of these wetlands therefore interdisciplinary studies are necessary and essential especially during the restoration operations that are currently taking place previous studies for similar sites focused on the characteristics levels and sources of organic matter on surface sediments with little attention to the impact of flooding to their distribution rushdi et al 2006a b thus the purpose of this work is to determine the impacts of re flooding on the distributions and sources of lipid compounds in extractable organic matter of shallow sediment cores from the central and al hammar marshes 2 experimental 2 1 sampling sites abu zirig marsh of the central marshes is in a natural depression north of an nasiriyah at the terminal end of the gharraf river fig 1 the shatt abu lihia river channel which runs through the marsh until it dissipates at the southern end is the main supply of water to the marsh also the abu ismaisim abul al jury and al rumaidh channels which emanate from the gharraf river are other supplies of water to the marsh the rivers and channels feed the marsh along its northerly perimeter the marsh terminates at the left bank of the euphrates river the abu zirig marsh was fairly dry and re flooded in april 2003 as a result of the direct action of the ministry of water resources at the request of the local population kurmashia marsh is located southeast of an nasiriyah at the head of the al hammar marsh fig 1 this area was relatively wet and has been inundated since may 2003 as a result of the opening of the termini of several distributary canals from the euphrates its area may reach more than 100 km2 and it contains a considerable variety of plant cover and various water depths ranging from open mudflats to open water around 2 m deep 2 2 sampling and sample preparation sediment core samples were collected from the abu zirig lat 31 7 48 n long 46 37 38 e and kurmashia lat 30 49 29 n long 46 33 28 e marshes fig 1 using stainless steel gravity corers about 3 5 cm3 of each wet sediment sub sample was taken by a micro core at 5 cm intervals dried at room temperature then ground and sieved to obtain 125 µm fine particles 2 3 extraction about 5 g of each dried sediment sample was ultrasonicated three times for 15 min in a 30 ml mixture of dichloromethane methanol dcm meoh 3 1 v v the sonication was carried out in a 150 ml precleaned beaker the extract aliquots were combined and filtered by a filtration unit with an annealed glass fiber filter for the removal of sediment particles the filtrate was first concentrated on a rotary evaporator followed by a stream of dry nitrogen gas to a volume of approximately 200 µl the volume was adjusted to 500 µl exactly by addition of dcm meoh 3 1 v v aliquots 50 ml of the total extracts were converted to their trimethylsilyl tms derivatives using n o bis trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetamide bstfa containing 1 trimethylchlorosilane tmcs pierce and pyridine pierce for 3 h at 70 c the excess reagent was evaporated by a stream of nitrogen and the product dissolved in an equivalent volume of hexane prior to analysis 2 4 instrumental analysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms was carried out with a hewlett packard 6890 gas chromatograph coupled to a 5973 mass

marshes table 1 the total concentrations of n alkanes were slightly lower for the abu zirig site ranging from 4 0 to 9 7 μg g 1 and decreasing with depth fig 3 a the highest concentrations were observed for the kurmashia site ranging from 9 3 to 17 6 μg g 1 and showed different distributions with depth where the concentrations increased from 11 1 μg g 1 at 0 5 cm to 17 6 μg g 1 and then

molecular weight n alkane distribution has also been observed in the iraqi wetlands and shatt al arab river rushdi et al 2006a b 2014a the influence of biogenic and anthropogenic inputs can be assessed by using the cpi values of n alkanes simoneit 1989 the cpi values of the sediment core samples from both abu zirig and kurmashia were greater than 2 0 and increased slightly with core depths below 5 10 cm table 1 indicating that vascular plants were major sources of the n alkanes with a very minor contribution from petroleum sources the cmax of woody plant wax n alkanes normally have a cmax at 27 and or 29 depending on the plant species as well as the season and locality e g eglinton and hamilton 1967 simoneit 1977 street et al 2012 the contributions of different sources of plant wax n alkanes were calculated according to simoneit et al 1991a in order to better evaluate the relative input from various vegetation sources supplemental material table sm1 the percentages of wax n alkanes of aquatic residues from algae and mosses representing wet conditions ranged from 8 7 to 12 9 of the total n alkanes for abu zirig and from 9 6 to 14 6 for kurmashia they decreased with depth to minima at 5 10 cm then increased slightly indicating minor changes in the aquatic conditions of the sites table sm1 the woody plant wax n alkanes range from 25 3 to 29 7 and changed slightly with

sediments from abu zirig 14 4 20 5 with a slight depth increase and for kurmashia 7 4 15 3 no significant change with depth these differences in source fractions indicate that abu zirig was relatively

compound can also indicate that zooplankton is its main source blumer et al 1963 therefore high ratio of pr pr ranging between 3 and 5 suggests unpolluted sediments steinhauer and boehm 1992 all sediment samples showed pr ph ratios of 0 56 table sm1 suggesting that their major source was petroleum products the percent fractions of petroleum n alkanes in sediments ranged from 38 1 to 49 6 for abu zirig and from 43 4 to 65 5 for kurmashia generally decreasing with core depths table sm1 3 2 fatty acids and alcohols the n alkanoic acids ranged from c8 to c18 with a cmax at 16 for all core sections except at 10 15 cm cmax 8 for abu zirig and for kurmashia they extended to c24 with a cmax at 16 table sm1 and table 1 their total concentrations ranged from 3 1 to 18 5 μg g 1 for abu zirig with the maximum at 0 5 cm the concentrations were higher for kurmashia ranging from to 21 9 28 9 μg g 1 fig 3b the carbon preference indices cpi e o for the entire range were 2 4 6 0 for abu zirig and 4 3 5 0 for kurmashia the methyl n alkanoate concentrations i e n alkanoic acid methyl esters ranged from 0 99 to 10 8 μg g 1 for abu zirig and for kurmashia from 0 26 to 3 4 μg g 1 both generally decreasing with depth table sm1 the cmax was at 16 and the cpi e o was similar as the free alkanoic acids table sm1 the source of methyl n alkanoates is inferred to be the same as for the n alkanoic acids above and they may be experimental artifacts that formed by transesterification in the extraction solvent from the fatty acids or wax esters present alkanoic acids from planktonic diatoms algae microbial mats and bacteria are characterized by odd carbon numbered and branched homologues c20 whereas terrestrial plants have mainly even carbon numbered homologues c20 simoneit 1978 perry et al 1979 volkman et al 1980 kharlamenko et al 1995 budge and parish 1998 therefore we treated all fatty acids c20 as inputs from microbial sources and all c20 from terrestrial inputs accordingly the fatty acids for abu zirig were mainly from local microbial inputs and relatively higher terrestrial than microbial inputs were observed for kurmashia the total n alkanols ranged from 26 9 to 59 1 μg g 1 and increased slightly with depth for the core from abu zirig the cmax was at 26 or 28 and the cpi e o ranged from 5 6 to 7 6 for kurmashia the cmax was at 30 and the cpi e o ranged from 5 7 to 6 2 whereas the concentrations reached a maximum 137 1 μg g 1 at 5 10 cm then decreased with depth table 1 fig 3c table sm1 the presence of n alkanols as major compounds with a strong even carbon numbered predominance indicates an input of vascular plant wax from semitropical to tropical environments simoneit 1977 1978 1989 rushdi et al 2006b treignier et al 2006 the n alkanol concentrations were higher than the n alkanoic acid concentrations for both sites fig 3b c the lower concentrations of alkanoic acids and alkanols in the core from abu zirig suggest that the site was dry for years and the recent re flooding increased the alkanoic acids in the surface sediment on the other hand their concentrations in the kurmashia core indicate that re flooding had no apparent concentration effect with depth suggesting that the site was wet during the years before re flooding the presence of long chain c22 n alkanols with an even carbon numbered predominance has been attributed to terrestrial sources simoneit 1989 rielley et al 1991 treignier et al 2006 whereas the short chain c22 homologues are reported as markers of microbial sources robinson et al 1984a the obvious high t c12 c20 t c24 c32 ratio for both n alkanoic acids and n alkanols in the shallow surface sediment of abu zirig fig 3d implies an increase of microbial activity after wetting due to re flooding this elevated ratio was not observed for the kurmashia site 3 3 steroids and terpenoids steroids comprising stenols stanols stenones and stanones were major compounds in the core samples from both marsh sites the stenols ranged from c27 to c31 with concentrations of 20 1 36 3 µg g 1 and 31 4 53 0 µg g 1 for abu zirig and kurmashia respectively and decreased slightly with depth for both tables 1 and sm1 the stanols stenones and stanones had similar ranges with lower concentrations as the stenols table 1 steroids are derived from both faunal and floral tissues akhisa and kokke 1991 hence they occur in all ecosystems they can be used to identify sources and fate of organic matter in the environment volkman et al 1981 rushdi et al 2006b campesterol stigmasterol and sitosterol are major stenols phytosterols in terrestrial plant lipids moreau et al 2002 whereas cholesterol is the main sterol in animal lipids and some phytoplankton and aquatic microbes volkman 1986 voet and voet 2004 brassicasterol dinosterol and cholesterol minor are dominant stenols in plankton dinoflagellates and diatoms didyk et al 1978 boon et al 1979 de leeuw et al 1983 robinson et al 1984a b volkman 1986 2003 volkman et al 1993 giner and boyer 1998 the phytosterols in these samples are interpreted to originate from terrestrial higher plant sources barbier et al 1981 moreau et al 2002 simoneit et al 1983 and their similar distribution pattern indicates the same source fig 3e the aquatic plant and microbial sterols have a similar depth concentration pattern as the phytosterols fig 3g with the highest levels for kurmashia stanols including coprostanol cholestanol campestanol and stigmastanol were also major compounds in these sediment samples cholestanol was the dominant stanol followed by campestanol then stigmastanol fig 2 the highest concentrations of stanols were observed for kurmashia 43 51 µg g 1 and lower for abu zirig 26 34 µg g 1 with a slight decrease with depth for both table 1 stanols occur in dinoflagellates which are often the major direct source of 5α stanols e g dinosterol in marine sediments robinson et al 1984b the 5β stanols e g coprostanol and epimer epi coprostanol are major components of the total sterols in carnivore feces chris et al 2001 and are derived from anaerobic bacterial alteration of sterols the 5β phytostanols e g 5β stigmastan 3β ol and epimer also formed by anaerobic bacterial alteration of the natural product precursors are eliminated in feces of herbivores rogge et al 2006 the significant stanols in these samples indicate microbial alteration of sterols where coprostanol generally is due to sewage sources and 5β campestanol and 5β stigmastanol are from animal waste fernandes et al 1999 chris et al 2001 rogge et al 2006 the stenones and stanones were significant mostly 5 µg g 1 and decreased with depth for both sites table 1 their presence indicates chemical oxidation of biogenic sterols mackenzie et al 1982 diterpenoids mainly neophytadiene isophytene 3z and 3e phyta 1 3 diene phyta 2 4 diene and phytol were found in all samples fig 2 table sm1 their concentrations were low 1 3 7 9 μg g 1 for abu zirig and 2 8 3 3 μg g 1 for kurmashia and had similar distribution patterns with depth for both sites with the highest amount in the surface sediment from abu zirig table sm1 fig 3h phytol is generally derived from the side chain of chlorophyll a and can be observed in different ecosystems volkman and maxwell 1986 the presence of phytadienes indicated an origin from biodegradation of phytol under anaerobic conditions grossi et al 1998 rontani and volkman 2003 tetrahymanol tetrahymanone gammacer 3 one 17β h 21 β h bishomohopan 32 ol were the major triterpenoids in these samples table sm1 their concentrations were 4 4 7 3 µg g 1 for abu zirig and 7 1 8 1 µg g 1 for kurmashia table sm1 fig 3h these triterpenoids including dinosterol indicate a microbial origin the major sources of tetrahymanol include the protozoan tetrahymena pyriformis mallory et al 1963 holz and conner 1973 some ferns zander et al 1969 and cultures of an anaerobic rumen fungus kemp et al 1984 hence tetrahymanol with its derivative tetrahymanone support an input of organic detritus from aquatic plankton the ββ bishomohopan 32 ol is an early diagenetic product from bacteriohopanepolyol indicating oxidation or bacterial reworking of microbial organic detritus and is a known component in sediments of aquatic environments ourisson et al 1979 brassell et al 1983 philp 1985 venkatesan 1989 3 4 hopanes and steranes hopanes and steranes were detected in the samples from both sites the hopanes ranged from c27 to c34 no c28 with cmax at 29 or 30 and concentrations of 0 2 1 1 μg g 1 for abu zirig and 1 6 3 2 μg g 1 for kurmashia table 1 fig 3i steranes were also present in these samples but at lower concentrations than the hopanes table 1 fig 3j the occurrence of hopane and sterane hydrocarbons in an environment indicates contamination from fossil fuel residues e g simoneit 1984 simoneit et al 1991b medeiros et al 2005 rushdi et al 2016 the major hopane biomarkers detected in these samples were dominantly 17α h 21β h the more thermodynamically stable and minor 17β h 21α h hopanes with the α β series fully mature and the homologs c30 present as the equilibrated c 22 r s isomer pairs equilibrium ratio 0 56 simoneit 1984 peters and moldowan 1993 these compounds are commonly utilized as confirming environmental tracers for petroleum and vehicle engine exhaust simoneit 1984 1985 the ratios of c 22s s r for the c31 and c32 hopanes ranged from 0 68 to 0 78 and 0 07 0 82 for abu zirig respectively and for kurmashia from 0 46 to 0 82 and 0 28 0 84 respectively table sm1 these values are similar to those for petroleum products and mature crude oil kvenvolden et al 1990 rushdi and simoneit 2002a b confirming that these hopanes are from such sources steranes are also introduced into the environment from petroleum or lubricants in direct emissions of vehicular engines abas and simoneit 1996 municipal wastewaters and refinery activities are other possible sources for such inputs to the aquatic environment laws 1993 discharges from ship washing and boat traffic are yet other sources of petroleum components to sediments thus steranes are also useful as confirming tracer indicators for pollution from oil products in the environment e g albaiges and cuberes 1980 aboul kassim and simoneit 1996 traces of steranes in these sediments occurred as 20s and 20r epimers with mainly the 5α 14α 17β and minor 5α 14α 17α configurations the ratio of sterane epimerization of c 20s s r for c27 and c29 for abu zirig was 0 27 0 76 and 0 42 0 50 respectively and for kurmashia 0 77 0 82 and 0 53 respectively table sm1 these ratios indicated that the steranes were from crude oil related products and petroleum sources 3 5 unresolved complex mixture the occurrence of an unresolved complex mixture ucm of branched and cyclic hydrocarbons is common in aquatic sediments and is related mainly to oil spills and or fossil fuel utilization simoneit 1985 the ucm for abu zirig ranged from 2 3 to 5 7 μg g 1 decreasing with depth and for kurmashia 11 7 21 4 μg g 1 with a maximum at shallow depth table 1 the ratio of ucm to resolved peaks u r mazurek and simoneit 1984 varied from 0 22 to 0 69 for abu zirig and 0 53 0 63 for kurmashia table 1 the declines of the ucm concentrations with depth indicate less historic input of petroleum products the concentrations of total petroleum residues i e petroleum n alkanes pristane phytane hopanes steranes and ucm versus core depths were higher for kurmashia except for the shallow sediment than for abu zirig fig 3k 3 6 plasticizers plasticizers were important components of these samples and included diethyl phthalate di n butyl phthalate diisobutyl phthalate and di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate their concentrations ranged from 2 3 to 5 7 μg g 1 for abu zirig and 1 8 21 7 μg g 1 for kurmashia table sm1 fig 3l the decrease in plasticizer concentrations with depth may be due to degradation or varied inputs 3 7 locale similarity comparison both natural biogenic and anthropogenic sources are the main inputs of the lipid compounds to the sediments of the central and al hammar marshes as indicated by the results of this work for the purpose of understanding the similarity and difference between the central marshes abu zirig site and the al hammar marshes kurmashia site as well as the impact of the re flooding practice on these marshes the entire data set was analyzed statistically by principal component analysis pca techniques using the spss ibm statistical package for the social sciences version 16 the output of the pca analysis explaining 97 8 of the variance is shown in fig 4 where two groups were recognized the first group c1 explaining 95 included all the depths from both sites and the second one c2 explaining 2 8 included only the surface 0 5 cm depth sediment from abu zirig this indicates that the sources of organic matter to the central and al hammar marshes are generally similar where the central marshes were relatively wetter than the al hammar marshes thus the recent restoration of the marshes by re flooding has an evident effect on the al hammar marshes 3 8 input sources the sources of the lipid compounds in these sediments are from allochthonous terrestrial higher plants autochthonous aquatic microbiota and anthropogenic inputs the terrestrial vascular plant input is calculated as the sum of the wax n alkanes plus the polar lipid compounds i e n alkanoic acids and n alkanols with chain lengths c20 and c28 and c29 sterols the aquatic sources from algal and microbial inputs are estimated as the total lipids with chain lengths c20 stanones tetrahymanol tetrahymanone and ββ bishomohopanol the results show that lipid compounds from both aquatic microbial sources 27 52 for abu zirig 39 42 for kurmashia and terrestrial vascular plant wax 35 66 for abu zirig 40 49 for kurmashia are major sources the anthropogenic input from petroleum hydrocarbons including n alkanes ucm hopanes and steranes and plasticizers were significant in these sediments 6 13 for abu zirig 9 18 for kurmashia fig 5 4 conclusion the analytical results for sediment core samples from the abu zirig i e central marshes and kurmashia al hammar marshes sites showed that the major contributors to the extractable organic matter were both natural biogenic organic compounds and anthropogenic inputs mainly petroleum and plasticizers the natural sources of the lipid compounds were mainly 1 allochthonous from surrounding vegetation as confirmed by the presence of high levels of phytosterols 2 autochthonous from algal and plankton productivity as is evident by the presence of tetrahymanol cholesterol and dinosterol and 3 from organic matter alteration by bacteria and fungi as indicated by the presence of ββ bishomohopan 32 ol anthropogenic pollution input is obvious from petroleum residues and plastic wastes as based on the presence of the ucm pristane phytane hopanes steranes and phthalate derivatives the distribution patterns of the different lipid compounds with sediment depths indicate that the central marshes were drier than the al hammar marshes before the restoration by re flooding they also indicate that this re flooding restoration process has apparently improved the ecosystem of the central marshes appendix a supplementary data

7439,rainfall partitioning is an important part of the ecohydrological cycle influenced by numerous variables rainfall partitioning for pine pinus nigra arnold and birch betula pendula roth trees was measured from january 2014 to june 2017 in an urban area of ljubljana slovenia 180 events from more than three years of observations were analyzed focusing on 13 meteorological variables including the number of raindrops their diameter and velocity regression tree and boosted regression tree analyses were performed to evaluate the influence of the variables on rainfall interception loss throughfall and stemflow in different phenoseasons the amount of rainfall was recognized as the most influential variable followed by rainfall intensity and the number of raindrops higher rainfall amount intensity and the number of drops decreased percentage of rainfall interception loss rainfall amount and intensity were the most influential on interception loss by birch and pine trees during the leafed and leafless periods respectively lower wind speed was found to increase throughfall whereas wind direction had no significant influence consideration of drop size spectrum properties proved to be important since the number of drops drop diameter and median volume diameter were often recognized as important influential variables keywords rainfall interception throughfall stemflow drop size distribution dsd drop velocity regression tree analysis 1 introduction trees are an important element in our environment whether they are part of natural forests increasingly recognized urban forests or part of green infrastructure in urban areas regardless of their location trees significantly influence ecological and hydrological cycles šraj et al 2008 carlyle moses and gash 2011 van stan et al 2014 part of these cycles is rainfall partitioning an important but often neglected component rainfall partitioning consists of three components precipitation falling through the gaps in canopy or dripping from it to the ground i e throughfall precipitation trickling down the stem i e stemflow and precipitation retained in the canopy and evaporating back into the atmosphere i e interception loss the portion of precipitation not reaching the ground depends on numerous variables the influential variables are in general divided into vegetation variables describing tree properties e g canopy characteristics bark quality tree structure zabret 2013 and meteorological variables describing characteristics of rainfall events e g rainfall amount intensity wind properties humidity crockford and richardson 2000 these influences are mostly interdependent and therefore difficult to evaluate in only one analysis therefore most studies are focused on one of the variables hölscher et al 2004 deguchi et al 2006 pypker et al 2006 muzylo et al 2012 holder 2013 ilek and kucza 2014 or more variables of the same group gomez et al 2002 keim et al 2006 nanko et al 2006 andre et al 2008 park and cameron 2008 staelens et al 2008 honda et al 2014 van stan et al 2016 iida et al 2017 however toba and ohta 2005 report meteorological variables to be more influential than vegetation ones generally rainfall interception loss decreases with rainfall amount duration and intensity jackson 1975 crockford and richardson 2000 toba and ohta 2005 staelens et al 2008 however the influence of these variables also depends on vegetation characteristics siegert and levia 2014 observed negligible influence of rainfall duration on interception loss by smooth barked trees and negligible influence of rainfall intensity for rough barked similarly rainfall duration in a deciduous forest was shown to be influential only in leafless but not in leafed periods muzylo et al 2012 although rainfall characteristics were reported to be the most influential among the meteorological variables the number of raindrops their diameter and velocity are hardly ever included in analyses so far only drop size distribution dsd of throughfall has been studied levia et al 2017 some authors compared the rainfall dsd measured in the open to the throughfall dsd in the forest hall and calder 1993 nanko et al 2006 or under a maize canopy frasson and krajewski 2011 in some cases raindrop volume was included in the modelling of rainfall interception calder 1996a calder 1996b hall 2003 suggesting higher interception with smaller raindrops however the influence of open rainfall dsd on rainfall partitioning was quantified only at event scale by zabret et al 2017 on the other hand the influence of wind conditions on rainfall partitioning is often discussed in studies nanko et al 2006 andre et al 2008 staelens et al 2008 šraj et al 2008 van stan et al 2014 it seems that wind speed can either increase or decrease interception loss depending on the type of trees and geographical location for example wind speed enhanced stemflow in leafless periods in a temperate mixed oak beech stand in belgium andre et al 2008 and for two deciduous tree species in maryland usa van stan et al 2014 on the contrary a decrease in throughfall with wind speed was observed in a deciduous mediterranean forest in slovenia šraj et al 2008 within a single beech canopy during the growing season in belgium staelens et al 2008 and during the first half of the event in a mature coniferous forest stand in japan iida et al 2017 compared to wind speed wind direction is not often included in the analyses and is rarely found to be statistically significant for rainfall partitioning xiao et al 2000 guevara escobar et al 2007 staelens et al 2008 šraj et al 2008 van stan et al 2011 similarly temperature humidity potential evapotranspiration and antecedent dry period can be found in the analyses but are rarely recognized as significantly influencing rainfall partitioning xiao et al 2000 nanko et al 2006 staelens et al 2008 šraj et al 2008 zhang et al 2015 iida et al 2017 to identify the most influential variable for a selected target variable of rainfall partitioning a number of methods have been used in various studies i e multiple regression analysis staelens et al 2008 van stan et al 2014 schooling and carlyle moses 2015 decision trees šraj et al 2008 štravs et al 2008 generalized boosted regression trees nanko et al 2016 tanaka et al 2017 principal component analysis siegert and levia 2014 and multiple correspondence analysis van stan et al 2016 each new study using one of these or different statistical method for a new tree species or in a new geographical location contributes to the creation of a complete picture of the influence of meteorological and vegetation variables on rainfall partitioning and allows standardized comparison of temporal rainfall interception dynamics van stan et al 2016 the main objectives of this study are as follows 1 to evaluate the influence of meteorological variables on rainfall partitioning in the leafed and leafless periods for two distinct tree species in an urban area 2 to use two similar statistical models one with graphical and another with numerical data representation to estimate the most influential variables in individual phenoseasons and 3 to include the number of raindrops their diameter and velocity in the analysis the data from more than three years of measurements were used to evaluate the influence of several meteorological variables affecting rainfall partitioning including the previously not studied raindrop diameter volume and number additionally the measurements were performed for two distinct tree species allowing us to compare the situation in different phenoseasons the study took place in an urban area which has a specific characteristics in relation to natural forested areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site data were collected in a park in the center of ljubljana the capital of slovenia the park is located near the department for environmental civil engineering building 46 04 n 14 49 e at an elevation of 292 m above sea level the area is located in central slovenia and is characterized by sub alpine climate with well defined seasons the mean long term 1986 2016 total annual rainfall is approximately 1380 mm the most rainfall is delivered in autumn 146 mm followed by summer 128 mm spring 96 mm and winter 81 mm arso 2017 the average annual temperature is 11 c and varies between 3 c in the winter and 24 c in the summer the experimental site has an area of 600 m2 it is flat and covered with regularly cut grass in the east part of the site two groups of distinct trees are located i e a group of pine trees pinus nigra arnold on the northeast and a group of birch trees betula pendula roth on the southeast birch trees are on average 15 7 m 1 0 m high with a diameter at breast height dbh of 17 9 cm 0 4 cm and a total projected crown area of 42 3 m2 they have a smooth bark with average storage capacity of 0 7 mm of rainfall upwards branch inclination of 510 from the stem to the branch and the leaf area index lai measured with lai 2200 plant canopy analyzer li cor inc ranging from 0 8 in the leafless period to 2 6 in the leafed period pine trees are on average 12 6 m 0 6 m high have a dbh of 19 0 cm 2 3 cm and a total projected crown area of 22 7 m2 their bark has a rough surface which is thicker and more absorbent with storage capacity of 3 5 mm of rainfall their branches are inclined downwards with 980 from the stem to the branch while the average lai is 3 9 0 7 bark storage capacity was determined on three bark samples from each tree which were first soaked in the water for 24 h and then dried at 40 c until the weight of the samples stopped to decrease perez harguindeguy et al 2013 phenoseasons were determined according to our observations so exact dates vary from year to year we defined the start and end of the leafing period the leafed period the leaf fall period and the leafless period 2 2 measurements of rainfall throughfall and stemflow rainfall partitioning data were collected from january 2014 through june 2017 gross precipitation p was measured on the clearing at the experimental site approximately 10 m from the nearest tree using a tipping bucket 0 2 mm tip rain gauge onset rg2 m with an automatic data logger onset hobo event a total of 413 rainfall events were detected in the observed period i e 258 events in the leafed period 35 events in the leaf fall period 108 in the leafless period and 12 events in the leafing period snow events were excluded from the analysis the data on rainfall rainfall microstructure throughfall and stemflow was complete for 180 events table 1 rainfall events were separated with dry period of at least 4 h throughfall and stemflow were measured at the experimental site under two birch and two pine trees throughfall tf was measured using three different methods in order to record throughfall s spatial variability underneath each group of trees ten manually read roving wedge gauges with a catch area of 78 5 cm2 were randomly placed and moved around from tree stem to canopy edge steel trough gauges 2 5 0 3 m were positioned under each tree in each group of trees one trough gauge was manually read after each rainfall event polyethylene 10 l containers attached to a 50 l polyethylene barrel while the other one was equipped with a tipping bucket flow gauge unidata 6506g 50 ml tip and an automatic data logger onset hobo event throughfall values used in the analysis were determined as weighted average according to the collector s area stemflow sf was captured by a halved rubber hose spirally wrapped around the stem of one tree from each group in the case of pine tree the hose was routed to the 1 5 l container which was emptied at the same time as the manually read throughfall gauges the hose around the birch stem was connected to a tipping bucket onset rg2 m 0 2 mm tip with an automatic data logger onset hobo event stemflow volume was converted to depth according to its contribution area of the tree canopy by dividing the measured stemflow volume by the total projection canopy area levia et al 2010 livesley et al 2014 siegert and levia 2014 rainfall interception loss i is generally expressed as gross precipitation not reaching the ground e g toba and ohta 2005 guevara escobar et al 2007 iida et al 2017 1 i p tf sf 2 3 meteorological data detailed data on drop diameter velocity and the number of drops per event were obtained using an optical disdrometer ott parsivel located on the rooftop of the nearest building 50 m from the experimental site the laser light sheet extends over the measuring area of 54 cm2 when a raindrop falls through it the transmitted signal amplitude is reduced for a certain period of time from the duration and amplitude of the weakened signal the instrument determines the velocity and diameter of the falling precipitation respectively typical sizes and velocities of rain drops lead to the signal durations between 0 4 and 1 1 ms löffler mang and joss 2000 once per minute the particles are classified into 32 diameter and velocity classes the number of drops their diameter and velocity were obtained from the raw data for each individual event additionally the median volume diameter mvd was calculated from the event s drop diameter spectrum data of additional meteorological variables were obtained from the nearest slovenian environment agency s meteorological station ljubljana bežigrad located 3 km northeast from the experimental site the automatic meteorological station monitors half hourly data on air pressure hpa air temperature c relative humidity amount of precipitation mm wind speed m s and direction global irradiation w m2 and diffuse energy radiation w m2 although wind speed and direction in this study were not measured at the study plot where they might be different due to the influence of surrounding buildings they were used as a descriptor of a general weather situation for example for this study area sw wind direction characterize the pre frontal events while ne wind direction prevail after the frontal passage 2 4 statistical analysis due to a large number of rainfall events their characteristics were determined using hierarchical cluster analysis it was performed using the r software and its function hclust from the r stats package r core team 2015 hierarchical clustering is a method which assigns cases based on their similarity to clusters in order to create a hierarchy of clusters grouping and splitting of the clusters is based on the measure of dissimilarity between sets of observations zaki and meira 2014 hierarchical clustering was performed using ward s minimum variance method on a distance matrix calculated by the euclidean distance measure zaki and meira 2014 resulting hierarchical trees were cut to create 6 clusters no data transformation was implemented before the clustering the influence of various meteorological variables on rainfall partitioning throughout the year in leafed and leafless periods was evaluated using two statistical methods namely regression tree rt and boosted regression tree brt analysis both methods were conducted in r software r core team 2015 using packages rpart therneau et al 2017 to construct regression trees and gbm ridgeway 2017 for brt analysis meteorological variables considered in analyses were the amount of rainfall pamount mm event s average intensity pintensity mm h and duration pduration h average raindrop diameter dropd mm and velocity dropv m s median volume diameter mvd mm number of raindrops per event dropnr average relative humidity hum average air temperature temp c average wind direction wd 0 and speed ws m s duration of dry period from the previous to the present event dryperiod h and day or night time of the event s occurrence daynight for the construction of the regression trees rt training 75 of events and test 25 of events datasets were used a rt split was performed when at least 20 events were assigned to a node the terminal node was determined with a minimum of 6 events in order to fit brt models we used gaussian distribution minimum 10 observations in the terminal nodes of the trees a learning rate of 0 005 and 5 cross validations the minimum number of trees was 1500 among which the best fit was chosen the results of this analysis are expressed with the relative influence ri of the predictor variables which was estimated based on the optimal number of iterations determined by cross validation stronger influence of the predictor variable is indicated by a higher ri value nanko et al 2016 ridgeway 2017 as a threshold ri value indicating significant influence of the variable a value of 7 7 was set 100 divided by 13 the number of variables hobley et al 2015 the ri for the most influential variables was visualized in partial dependence plots pdp using the gbm package of r software the predictive performance of the brt is influenced by the size of the data set as models have lower predictive error when the large samples are available for smaller data sets simple trees should be used and the uncertainty of the results should be taken into account elith et al 2008 rt method permits visual interpretation of the results and indicates the threshold values of the variables used for splitting the nodes the results of brt are presented descriptively clearly stating the classification of the influencing variables according to their impact therefore the use of two similar methods with different presentation of results gave better insight into the influence of meteorological variables on rainfall partitioning 3 results 3 1 rainfall partitioning from 1 january 2014 to 30 june 2017 we recorded 413 events delivering 4110 mm of rainfall in total 888 mm of rainfall was intercepted by birch and 1865 mm by pine trees table 2 no throughfall was recorded in 91 and 121 events under birch and pine trees respectively total stemflow amount for birch trees was 131 mm during 217 events whereas stemflow for pine trees was observed in 161 events and amounted to only 2 7 mm event throughfall stemflow and interception loss increased linearly with the rainfall fig 1 the most distinct differences between the phenoseasons for both tree species were observed for stemflow the slope of the regression line and the amount of stemflow decreased in leafed period when more precipitation was necessary to generate the stemflow which also resulted in its lower amounts because of a failure in rainfall measurements using the disdrometer due to technical problems only 180 events were included in further analysis table 1 for the considered events the rainfall amount per event varied between 0 4 mm and 93 mm the largest amount of rainfall was delivered in 21 5 h on 14 june 2016 rainfall duration per event ranged between 5 min and 119 h with an average intensity of 2 8 mm h and at some point reaching as much as 28 2 mm h according to meteorological variables the events were classified in 6 groups using hierarchical clustering table 3 events in cluster 1 delivered the largest amount of rainfall during the longest time but had the smallest drop diameter and velocities events in cluster 2 can be categorized by light intensity and moderate rainfall amount in calm wind conditions delivering small and slow raindrops events in cluster 3 delivered the smallest amount of rainfall with high intensity and large drop diameters and velocities during the windiest conditions cluster 4 combines rainfall events with a moderate rainfall amount and intensity but quite a large drop diameter and velocity events in cluster 5 delivered the second largest amount of rainfall with moderate intensity drop diameter and velocity events in cluster 6 are characterized with high intensities during light and short rainfall events with an average drop diameter and velocity according to hierarchical clustering birch trees intercepted the most rainfall during the events grouped in cluster 3 whereas pine trees intercepted similar amounts of rainfall during the events grouped in clusters 3 and 6 fig 2 these events were characterized by windy conditions and high temperatures while the average amount of rainfall was the lowest its duration the shortest rainfall intensity the highest and drop diameters the largest table 3 throughfall and stemflow produced by both tree species were the highest during the events assigned to cluster 1 when by far the lowest interception loss was also measured this is the result of the longest and heaviest rainfall events grouped in cluster 1 showing the effect of rainfall amount and duration on rainfall partitioning 3 2 regression trees rt 3 2 1 effect of meteorological variables on rainfall interception loss the meteorological variables influencing rainfall interception loss differed according to the tree species table 4 in general interception loss by birch trees was the most influenced by the number of raindrops per event when the number of drops was higher than 311 365 the interception loss was on average lower by 26 during the events with a smaller number of raindrops lower amounts of rainfall induced higher interception loss interception loss by pine trees was the most influenced by the amount of rainfall 1 1 mm of rainfall was determined as the threshold value a smaller rainfall amount was almost entirely intercepted while rainfall events with rainfall amounts between 1 1 mm and 14 1 mm were influenced also by drop diameter threshold value of 0 57 mm in case of smaller drop diameters the average rainfall interception loss was larger during the leafed period rainfall interception loss by birch trees was the most influenced by the rainfall event duration table 4 events longer than 400 min intercepted on average less rainfall 31 than shorter events 50 the amount of rainfall threshold value of 6 3 mm and the number of drops per event threshold value of 59 203 were recognized as the second and third most influential variables similar to the entire observation period interception loss by pine trees in the leafed period was the most influenced by the amount of rainfall threshold value of 1 1 mm smaller amounts of rainfall were fully intercepted whereas the interception loss of larger amounts of rainfall was further dependent on rainfall intensity and mvd rainfall interception loss decreased with a higher mvd and higher rainfall intensity during the leafless period interception loss by both tree species was the most influenced by rainfall intensity with a threshold value of 0 5 mm h and 0 7 mm h for birch and pine trees respectively table 4 interception loss was higher during lower intensity events which on average accounted for 37 of rainfall by birch trees and 79 for pine trees 3 2 2 effect of meteorological variables on throughfall throughfall was the most influenced by the amount of rainfall which had a lower splitting value in the case of birch trees than in the case of pine trees table 4 throughfall under birch trees was on average lower for smaller amounts of rainfall 41 and influenced also by temperature throughfall was in general higher with decreasing temperature when the amount of rainfall exceeded3 6 mm higher wind speed lowered throughfall under birch trees the amount of rainfall had the main influence on throughfall under pine trees table 4 throughfall increased with the increase in the rainfall amount however no throughfall under pine trees was observed for less than 1 3 mm of rainfall the amount of rainfall was also the most influential variable on throughfall in the leafed period table 4 the threshold value for throughfall under the birch trees in the leafed period was higher 4 mm than throughout the year 3 6 mm wind speed was the second influencing variable throughfall increased with lower wind speed fig 3 the splitting amount of rainfall for throughfall under pine trees in the leafed period was also higher 14 4 mm than that throughout the year 10 1 mm and the values of rainfall amount and throughfall were statistically significant for both periods however the threshold value inducing the throughfall under pine remained the same 1 3 mm mvd was recognized as an influential variable for higher rainfall amounts in the leafed period fig 4 the observed throughfall under pine trees increased with larger mvd throughfall in the leafless period under birch trees was influenced by humidity and mvd when the humidity was lower than 88 throughfall was on average 49 throughfall for events with higher humidity was higher 80 on average influenced by mvd lower values of mvd increased throughfall fig 3 the throughfall under pine trees in the leafless period was the most influenced by the number of drops per event with an increase in the drop number throughfall reached higher values 49 on average a similar threshold value of humidity 90 also influenced throughfall under pine trees for events with a smaller number of drops higher humidity also increased throughfall under pine trees 3 2 3 effect of meteorological variables on stemflow stemflow was most affected by the amount of rainfall which was recognized as the top split variable for both tree species in both phenoseasons except for birch trees in the leafless period table 4 in case of pine trees more than 13 1 mm of rainfall was needed to induce the stemflow whereas 10 8 mm was needed by birch trees during the events with more than 10 8 mm of rainfall stemflow produced by birch trees accounted for on average 4 of rainfall per event in this case stemflow was also affected by humidity since higher humidity over 95 inducing greater stemflow in the leafed period the amount of rainfall inducing stemflow generation by pine and birch trees was 12 7 mm and 10 7 mm respectively the highest measured amounts of stemflow produced by birch trees 4 5 of rainfall on average in the leafed period were observed when the rainfall amount was higher than 10 7 mm and wind speed was lower than 1 1 m s stemflow produced by pine trees was the highest 0 1 of rainfall on average for events with more than 12 7 mm of rainfall and temperature higher than 15 7 c stemflow generated by birch trees in the leafless period started with 3 mm of rainfall however the most influencing variable was the number of drops per event for more than 210 826 drops stemflow was on average as high as 7 of rainfall the amount of rainfall was also the main variable inducing stemflow generation by pine trees with at least 8 7 mm necessary for its occurrence 3 3 generalized boosted regression tree brt models the results of the brt models demonstrate that rainfall interception loss by pine trees was strongly influenced by a single significant variable whereas several variables were influential in the case of birch trees fig 5 pine trees interception loss during the entire year and in the leafed period was the most affected by rainfall amount in the leafless period rainfall intensity had the largest influence however mvd and dry period duration need to be considered as well throughout the year interception loss by birch trees was influenced mainly by the number of drops per event and humidity in the leafed period the amount of rainfall and its duration were the most influential during the leafless period the interception loss by birch trees was significantly influenced by rainfall intensity throughfall results indicated rainfall amount to be the dominant variable for both birch and pine trees during the leafed period and in general throughout the year fig 6 furthermore throughfall under pine trees for these two periods was also influenced by rainfall intensity and under birch trees by the number of drops per event in the leafless period the influence of individual variables was not that significant throughfall under pine trees in leafless period depended mostly on the number of drops and the amount of rainfall humidity the amount of rainfall and wind speed were recognized as almost equally important for formation of throughfall under birch trees in leafless period similarly during the whole year and in the leafed period stemflow was the most affected by the amount of rainfall in addition to the rainfall intensity for pine trees and the number of drops for birch trees fig 7 on the other hand in the leafless period stemflow produced by pine trees was the most influenced by mvd followed by the amount of rainfall in case of birch trees stemflow depended to the greatest extent on humidity and the number of drops per event 4 discussion in this study the amount of rainfall was recognized as the most influential variable on rainfall partitioning by vegetation as previously reported by other authors xiao et al 2000 staelens et al 2008 šraj et al 2008 siegert and levia 2014 it had the highest influence on all three components of rainfall partitioning by pine trees throughout the year it was also the most influential variable during the leafed season while in the leafless season rainfall intensity and the number of drops were the most influential on interception loss and throughfall respectively for birch trees we identified two dominant variables affecting rainfall partitioning throughout the year and in the leafed period namely the amount of rainfall and the number of raindrops in the leafless period rainfall interception loss by birch trees was mainly influenced by rainfall intensity and velocity of drops whereas throughfall depended mainly on humidity and median volume diameter mvd and stemflow on the number of drops and the amount of rainfall for both tree species the results of two different models suggested that rainfall partitioning throughout the year and in the leafed period was influenced by similar variables whereas the influence of other variables was present during the leafless period table 4 figs 5 7 this is in accordance with the results of staelens et al 2008 who reported that rainfall amount was found to be the most influential variable affecting interception loss by a single beech canopy for the leafed season while its influence can be neglected during the leafless period the number of events in the leafless period was lower than that in the leafed period table 3 which may affect the average results of the entire year nevertheless the difference between the leafed and leafless periods cannot be overlooked this is expected for deciduous birch trees and not to the same extent for pine trees however a similar phenomenon for coniferous trees was also observed by iroume and huber 2002 deguchi et al 2006 barbier et al 2009 and zabret 2016 iroume and huber 2002 suggested that interception loss patterns between the seasons for evergreen trees are more closely related to meteorological conditions than canopy characteristics which is partially supported by this study however this may also be the consequence of lower lai values for coniferous trees during the winter time margolis et al 1995 rainfall interception loss in the leafless period was most influenced by rainfall intensity muzylo et al 2012 reported the significant effect of rainfall duration influencing all three rainfall partitioning components in the leafless season but that was not observed in this study however different intensity threshold values were determined for pine 0 7 mm h and for birch 0 5 mm h trees suggesting that rainfall intensity did not have so profound influence because of pine tree characteristic fig 8 siegert and levia 2014 reported that due to rougher bark characteristics rainfall intensity had no impact on stemflow generation by l tulipifera whereas it significantly influenced stemflow generation by smooth barked f grandifolia percentage of interception loss decreased with higher rainfall intensity for both tree species which was reported also in other studies bellot and escarre 1998 xiao et al 2000 toba and ohta 2005 staelens et al 2008 van stan et al 2016 kermavnar and vilhar 2017 this might be the consequence of high rainfall intensity creating splash and disrupting interception channeling more rainfall into throughfall herwitz 1987 analysis of construction of regression trees rt indicated that lower rainfall amount values were needed for response of throughfall under birch trees 3 6 mm than under pine trees 10 1 mm the amount of rainfall as a threshold value differed by phenoseasons for both tree species and was higher in the leafed period than throughout the year table 4 similar conclusions were also drawn by šraj et al 2008 and staelens et al 2008 in addition the amount of rainfall inducing stemflow differed between phenoseasons stemflow produced by pine trees in the leafed period was induced with 12 7 mm and in the leafless period with 8 7 mm whereas stemflow produced by birch trees was induced with 10 7 mm and 3 mm in the leafed and leafless periods respectively these values are higher than the amounts reported for other smooth barked trees in forests namely 4 6 mm perez suarez et al 2014 5 mm chang and matzner 2000 siegert and levia 2014 2 1 mm and 3 4 mm in growing periods and 1 5 mm in dormant periods andre et al 2008 staelens et al 2008 in case of birch tree stemflow was influenced also by humidity increasing the amount of stemflow while it had no influence on stemflow generated by pine tree table 4 fig 7 higher air humidity may have contributed to faster saturation of the birch tree s bark due to its lower storage capacity which increased the amount of stemflow levia and germer 2015 as an influential parameter on stemflow produced by birch humidity was emphasized by brt for leafed and leafless period but not throughout the year for which it was recognized by the rt some uncertainty of the results for small sized datasets can be expected by brt elith et al 2008 and this may contribute to such results therefore the use of two models eliminated some of the uncertainty as humidity was recognized to influence stemflow generation by birch tree by both models an important influencing variable recognized several times by both models is also the number of raindrops per event as expected stronger rainfall events induced higher throughfall and stemflow whereas rainfall interception loss was lower although the number of drops per event was treated as a separate variable it can be strongly correlated also to the amount of rainfall with correlation coefficient of 0 82 additionally a new variable dropnr pamount was used to build the rt and brt but did not have any significant influence on rainfall partitioning although amount of rainfall and number of drops per event seems to be interdependent they influence rainfall partitioning differently probably due to other raindrop properties especially drop diameter and mvd however the results indicated that as throughfall increased with the amount of rainfall it also increased with the number of raindrops which was also observed by nanko et al 2006 however calder 1996a reported that for the same amount of rainfall interception loss will be higher for smaller raindrop diameters the influence of drop size described by mvd and drop diameter on rainfall partitioning was also expressed by both models for pine tree table 4 fig 5 in the present study smaller values of mvd caused higher interception loss and lower throughfall by pine trees in the leafed period fig 8 also the smaller drop diameter increased interception loss and decreased throughfall by pine trees throughout the year and in the leafless period this phenomenon was observed also by zabret et al 2017 who reported an increase in throughfall under pine trees during the event after the occurrence of drops with larger diameters however in the case of birch trees rts suggest the opposite smaller drop diameter and lower mvd decreased rainfall interception loss this may be the result of different response from the needles of the pine tree and leaves of the birch tree as different behavior of the needles and leaves in interaction to the rain drops were observed also by others nanko et al 2006 holder 2013 nanko et al 2013 previous studies of how various meteorological variables affecting rainfall partitioning also highlighted wind speed staelens et al 2008 šraj et al 2008 van stan et al 2014 nanko et al 2016 iida et al 2017 in this study the noticeable influence of wind speed on throughfall and stemflow under birch trees was confirmed by both methods according to rt increasing wind speed decreased throughfall in leafed period fig 3 and during the year and stemflow in leafed period table 4 according to ri of brt models wind speed influenced throughfall under birch in leafless period fig 6 as none of the models highlighted the influence of wind speed in relation to interception loss additional analyses were performed the regression analyses showed the decreasing trend of throughfall and stemflow and increasing trend of interception loss with wind speed for all phenoseasons table 5 the additionally prepared pdps of rainfall partitioning components for birch tree in all three phenoseasons showed the decrease of throughfall with wind speed higher than 0 7 m s on average per phenoseason and stemflow with wind speed higher than 1 0 m s on average per phenoseason interception loss was increasing up to wind speed of 2 m s fig 8 the increase of throughfall and stemflow with wind speed agrees with the results of toba and ohta 2005 staelens et al 2008 and šraj et al 2008 this corresponds with the penman monteith equation which assumes that higher wind speed increases evaporation rate which decreases throughfall hörmann et al 1996 klaassen et al 1998 herbst et al 2008 reid and lewis 2009 however this phenomenon was not observed by xiao et al 2000 andre et al 2008 van stan et al 2014 and iida et al 2017 who reported increasing throughfall and stemflow with increasing wind speed this can be explained with an assumption that wind decreases canopy storage capacity due to the shaking of the canopy which increases the dripping of intercepted rainfall xiao et al 2000 nanko et al 2006 andre et al 2008 according to the results of the present study the storage capacity of the birch tree canopy was not influenced by wind which may be the consequence of its location in urban area 5 conclusions we analyzed the influence of various meteorological variables on all three components of rainfall partitioning throughfall stemflow and interception loss using two different models for two distinct tree species in different phenoseasons generally the amount of rainfall the number of raindrops and rainfall intensity are among the most influential meteorological variables drop properties such as the number of drops their velocity diameter and median volume diameter were also recognized as significant these results suggest that drop size distribution is an important and influential characteristic which should be taken into account when analyzing rainfall partitioning although in our experimental site the trees are situated in an urban area wind direction was often considered as less influential than these other variables influential variables differ among phenoseasons and depend on the rainfall partitioning component to be able to recognize these differences long datasets combining various phenoseasons and covering several years of measurements are needed the variables influences also depend on the environment e g natural urban and tree species so studies that would consider different phenoseasons and evergreen or deciduous tree species are needed conflict of interest none funding the research was partially financially supported by the slovenian research agency through the phd grant of the first author k zabret 
7439,rainfall partitioning is an important part of the ecohydrological cycle influenced by numerous variables rainfall partitioning for pine pinus nigra arnold and birch betula pendula roth trees was measured from january 2014 to june 2017 in an urban area of ljubljana slovenia 180 events from more than three years of observations were analyzed focusing on 13 meteorological variables including the number of raindrops their diameter and velocity regression tree and boosted regression tree analyses were performed to evaluate the influence of the variables on rainfall interception loss throughfall and stemflow in different phenoseasons the amount of rainfall was recognized as the most influential variable followed by rainfall intensity and the number of raindrops higher rainfall amount intensity and the number of drops decreased percentage of rainfall interception loss rainfall amount and intensity were the most influential on interception loss by birch and pine trees during the leafed and leafless periods respectively lower wind speed was found to increase throughfall whereas wind direction had no significant influence consideration of drop size spectrum properties proved to be important since the number of drops drop diameter and median volume diameter were often recognized as important influential variables keywords rainfall interception throughfall stemflow drop size distribution dsd drop velocity regression tree analysis 1 introduction trees are an important element in our environment whether they are part of natural forests increasingly recognized urban forests or part of green infrastructure in urban areas regardless of their location trees significantly influence ecological and hydrological cycles šraj et al 2008 carlyle moses and gash 2011 van stan et al 2014 part of these cycles is rainfall partitioning an important but often neglected component rainfall partitioning consists of three components precipitation falling through the gaps in canopy or dripping from it to the ground i e throughfall precipitation trickling down the stem i e stemflow and precipitation retained in the canopy and evaporating back into the atmosphere i e interception loss the portion of precipitation not reaching the ground depends on numerous variables the influential variables are in general divided into vegetation variables describing tree properties e g canopy characteristics bark quality tree structure zabret 2013 and meteorological variables describing characteristics of rainfall events e g rainfall amount intensity wind properties humidity crockford and richardson 2000 these influences are mostly interdependent and therefore difficult to evaluate in only one analysis therefore most studies are focused on one of the variables hölscher et al 2004 deguchi et al 2006 pypker et al 2006 muzylo et al 2012 holder 2013 ilek and kucza 2014 or more variables of the same group gomez et al 2002 keim et al 2006 nanko et al 2006 andre et al 2008 park and cameron 2008 staelens et al 2008 honda et al 2014 van stan et al 2016 iida et al 2017 however toba and ohta 2005 report meteorological variables to be more influential than vegetation ones generally rainfall interception loss decreases with rainfall amount duration and intensity jackson 1975 crockford and richardson 2000 toba and ohta 2005 staelens et al 2008 however the influence of these variables also depends on vegetation characteristics siegert and levia 2014 observed negligible influence of rainfall duration on interception loss by smooth barked trees and negligible influence of rainfall intensity for rough barked similarly rainfall duration in a deciduous forest was shown to be influential only in leafless but not in leafed periods muzylo et al 2012 although rainfall characteristics were reported to be the most influential among the meteorological variables the number of raindrops their diameter and velocity are hardly ever included in analyses so far only drop size distribution dsd of throughfall has been studied levia et al 2017 some authors compared the rainfall dsd measured in the open to the throughfall dsd in the forest hall and calder 1993 nanko et al 2006 or under a maize canopy frasson and krajewski 2011 in some cases raindrop volume was included in the modelling of rainfall interception calder 1996a calder 1996b hall 2003 suggesting higher interception with smaller raindrops however the influence of open rainfall dsd on rainfall partitioning was quantified only at event scale by zabret et al 2017 on the other hand the influence of wind conditions on rainfall partitioning is often discussed in studies nanko et al 2006 andre et al 2008 staelens et al 2008 šraj et al 2008 van stan et al 2014 it seems that wind speed can either increase or decrease interception loss depending on the type of trees and geographical location for example wind speed enhanced stemflow in leafless periods in a temperate mixed oak beech stand in belgium andre et al 2008 and for two deciduous tree species in maryland usa van stan et al 2014 on the contrary a decrease in throughfall with wind speed was observed in a deciduous mediterranean forest in slovenia šraj et al 2008 within a single beech canopy during the growing season in belgium staelens et al 2008 and during the first half of the event in a mature coniferous forest stand in japan iida et al 2017 compared to wind speed wind direction is not often included in the analyses and is rarely found to be statistically significant for rainfall partitioning xiao et al 2000 guevara escobar et al 2007 staelens et al 2008 šraj et al 2008 van stan et al 2011 similarly temperature humidity potential evapotranspiration and antecedent dry period can be found in the analyses but are rarely recognized as significantly influencing rainfall partitioning xiao et al 2000 nanko et al 2006 staelens et al 2008 šraj et al 2008 zhang et al 2015 iida et al 2017 to identify the most influential variable for a selected target variable of rainfall partitioning a number of methods have been used in various studies i e multiple regression analysis staelens et al 2008 van stan et al 2014 schooling and carlyle moses 2015 decision trees šraj et al 2008 štravs et al 2008 generalized boosted regression trees nanko et al 2016 tanaka et al 2017 principal component analysis siegert and levia 2014 and multiple correspondence analysis van stan et al 2016 each new study using one of these or different statistical method for a new tree species or in a new geographical location contributes to the creation of a complete picture of the influence of meteorological and vegetation variables on rainfall partitioning and allows standardized comparison of temporal rainfall interception dynamics van stan et al 2016 the main objectives of this study are as follows 1 to evaluate the influence of meteorological variables on rainfall partitioning in the leafed and leafless periods for two distinct tree species in an urban area 2 to use two similar statistical models one with graphical and another with numerical data representation to estimate the most influential variables in individual phenoseasons and 3 to include the number of raindrops their diameter and velocity in the analysis the data from more than three years of measurements were used to evaluate the influence of several meteorological variables affecting rainfall partitioning including the previously not studied raindrop diameter volume and number additionally the measurements were performed for two distinct tree species allowing us to compare the situation in different phenoseasons the study took place in an urban area which has a specific characteristics in relation to natural forested areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site data were collected in a park in the center of ljubljana the capital of slovenia the park is located near the department for environmental civil engineering building 46 04 n

between 3 c in the winter and 24 c in the summer the experimental site has an area of 600 m2 it is flat and covered with regularly cut grass in the east part of the site two groups of distinct trees are located i e a group of pine trees pinus nigra arnold on the northeast and a group of birch trees betula pendula roth on the southeast birch trees are on average 15 7 m 1 0 m high with a diameter at breast height dbh of 17 9 cm 0 4 cm and a total projected crown area of 42 3 m2 they have a smooth bark with average storage capacity of 0 7 mm of rainfall upwards branch inclination of 510 from the stem to the branch and the leaf area index lai measured with lai 2200 plant canopy analyzer li cor inc ranging from 0 8 in the leafless period to 2 6 in the leafed period pine trees are on average

rainfall their branches are inclined downwards with 980 from the stem to the branch while the average lai is 3 9 0 7 bark storage capacity was determined on three bark samples from each tree which were first soaked in the water for 24 h and then dried at 40 c until the weight of the samples stopped to decrease perez harguindeguy et al 2013 phenoseasons were determined according to our observations so exact dates vary from year to year we defined the start and end of the leafing period the leafed period the leaf fall period and the leafless period 2 2 measurements of rainfall throughfall and stemflow rainfall partitioning data were collected from january 2014 through june 2017 gross precipitation p was measured on the clearing at the experimental site approximately 10 m from the nearest tree using a tipping bucket 0 2 mm tip rain gauge onset rg2 m with an automatic data logger onset hobo event a total of 413 rainfall events were detected in the observed period i e 258 events in the leafed period 35 events in the leaf fall period 108 in the leafless period and 12 events in the leafing period snow events were excluded from the analysis the data on rainfall rainfall microstructure throughfall and stemflow was complete for 180 events table 1 rainfall events were separated with dry period of at least 4 h throughfall and stemflow were measured at the experimental site under two birch and two pine trees throughfall tf was measured using three different methods in order to record throughfall s spatial variability underneath each group of trees ten manually read roving wedge gauges with a catch area of 78 5 cm2 were randomly placed and moved around from tree stem to canopy edge steel trough gauges 2 5 0 3 m were positioned under each tree in each group of trees one trough gauge was manually read after each rainfall event polyethylene 10 l containers attached to a 50 l polyethylene barrel while the other one was equipped with a tipping bucket flow gauge unidata 6506g 50 ml tip and an automatic data logger onset hobo event throughfall values used in the analysis were determined as weighted average according to the collector s area stemflow sf was captured by a halved rubber hose spirally wrapped around the stem of one tree from each group in the case of pine tree the hose was routed to the 1 5 l container which was emptied at the same time as the manually read throughfall gauges the hose around the birch stem was connected to a tipping bucket onset rg2 m 0 2 mm tip with an automatic data logger onset hobo event stemflow volume was converted to depth according to its contribution area of the tree canopy by dividing the measured stemflow volume by the total projection canopy area levia et al 2010 livesley et al 2014

2 3 meteorological data detailed data on drop diameter velocity and the number of drops per event were obtained using an optical disdrometer ott parsivel located on the rooftop of the nearest building 50 m from the experimental site the laser light sheet extends over the measuring area of 54 cm2 when a raindrop falls through it the transmitted signal amplitude is reduced for a certain period of time from the duration and amplitude of the weakened signal the instrument determines the velocity and diameter of the falling precipitation respectively typical sizes and velocities of rain drops lead to the signal durations between 0 4 and 1 1 ms löffler mang and joss 2000 once per minute the particles are classified into 32 diameter and velocity classes the number of drops their diameter and velocity were obtained from the raw data for each individual event additionally the median volume diameter mvd was calculated from the event s drop diameter spectrum data of additional meteorological variables were obtained from the nearest slovenian environment agency s meteorological station ljubljana bežigrad located 3 km northeast from the experimental site the automatic meteorological station monitors half hourly data on air pressure hpa air temperature c relative humidity amount of precipitation mm wind speed m s and direction global irradiation w m2 and diffuse energy radiation w m2 although wind speed and direction in this study were not measured at the study plot where they might be different due to the influence of surrounding buildings they were used as a descriptor of a general weather situation for example for this study area sw wind direction characterize the pre frontal events while ne wind direction prevail after the frontal passage 2 4 statistical analysis due to a large number of rainfall events their characteristics were determined using hierarchical cluster analysis it was performed using the r software and its function hclust from the r stats package r core team 2015 hierarchical clustering is a method which assigns cases based on their similarity to clusters in order to create a hierarchy of clusters grouping and splitting of the clusters is based on the measure of dissimilarity between sets of observations zaki and meira 2014 hierarchical clustering was performed using ward s minimum variance method on a distance matrix calculated by the euclidean distance measure zaki and meira 2014 resulting hierarchical trees were cut to create 6 clusters no data transformation was implemented before the clustering the influence of various meteorological variables on rainfall partitioning throughout the year in leafed and leafless periods was evaluated using two statistical methods namely regression tree rt and boosted regression tree brt analysis both methods were conducted in r software r core team 2015 using packages rpart therneau et al 2017 to construct regression trees and gbm ridgeway 2017 for brt analysis meteorological

datasets were used a rt split was performed when at least 20 events were assigned to a node the terminal node was determined with a minimum of 6 events in order to fit brt models we used gaussian distribution minimum 10 observations in the terminal nodes of the trees a learning rate of 0 005 and 5 cross validations the minimum number of trees was 1500 among which the best fit was chosen the results of this analysis are expressed with the relative influence ri of the predictor variables which was estimated based on the optimal number of iterations determined by cross validation stronger influence of the predictor variable is indicated by a higher ri value nanko et al 2016 ridgeway 2017 as a threshold ri value indicating significant influence of the variable a value of 7 7 was set 100 divided by 13 the number of variables hobley et al 2015 the ri for the most influential variables was visualized in partial dependence plots pdp using the gbm package of r software the predictive performance of the brt is influenced by the size of the data set as models have lower predictive error when the large samples are available for smaller data sets simple trees should be used and the uncertainty of the results should be taken into account elith et al 2008 rt method permits visual interpretation of the results and indicates the threshold values of the variables used for splitting the nodes the results of brt are presented descriptively clearly stating the classification of the influencing variables according to their impact therefore the use of two similar methods with different presentation of results gave better insight into the influence of meteorological variables on rainfall partitioning 3 results 3 1 rainfall partitioning from 1 january 2014 to 30 june 2017 we recorded 413 events delivering 4110 mm of rainfall in total 888 mm of rainfall was intercepted by birch and 1865 mm by pine trees table 2 no throughfall was recorded in 91 and 121 events under birch and pine trees respectively total stemflow amount for birch trees was 131 mm during 217 events whereas stemflow for pine trees was observed in 161 events and amounted to only 2 7 mm event throughfall stemflow and interception loss increased linearly with the rainfall fig 1 the most distinct differences between the phenoseasons for both tree species were observed for stemflow the slope of the regression line and the amount of stemflow decreased in leafed period when more precipitation was necessary to generate the stemflow which also resulted in its lower amounts because of a failure in rainfall measurements using the disdrometer due to technical problems only 180 events were included in further analysis table 1 for the considered events the rainfall amount per event varied between 0 4 mm and 93 mm the largest amount of rainfall was delivered in 21 5 h on 14 june 2016 rainfall duration per event ranged between 5 min and 119 h with an average intensity of 2 8 mm h and at some point reaching as much as 28 2 mm h according to meteorological variables the events were classified in 6 groups using hierarchical clustering table 3 events in cluster 1 delivered the largest amount of rainfall during the longest time but had the smallest drop diameter and velocities events in cluster 2 can be categorized by light intensity and moderate rainfall amount in calm wind conditions delivering small and slow raindrops events in cluster 3 delivered the smallest amount of rainfall with high intensity and large drop diameters and velocities during the windiest conditions cluster 4 combines rainfall events with a moderate rainfall amount and intensity but quite a large drop diameter and velocity events in cluster 5 delivered the second largest amount of rainfall with moderate intensity drop diameter and velocity events in cluster 6 are characterized with high intensities during light and short rainfall events with an average drop diameter and velocity according to hierarchical clustering birch trees intercepted the most rainfall during the events grouped in cluster 3 whereas pine trees intercepted similar amounts of rainfall during the events grouped in clusters 3 and 6 fig 2 these events were characterized by windy conditions and high temperatures while the average amount of rainfall was the lowest its duration the shortest rainfall intensity the highest and drop diameters the largest table 3 throughfall and stemflow produced by both tree species were the highest during the events assigned to cluster 1 when by far the lowest interception loss was also measured this is the result of the longest and heaviest rainfall events grouped in cluster 1 showing the effect of rainfall amount and duration on rainfall partitioning 3 2 regression trees rt 3 2 1 effect of meteorological variables on rainfall interception loss the meteorological variables influencing rainfall interception loss differed according to the tree species table 4 in general interception loss by birch trees was the most influenced by the number of raindrops per event when the number of drops was higher than 311 365 the interception loss was on average lower by 26 during the events with a smaller number of raindrops lower amounts of rainfall induced higher interception loss interception loss by pine trees was the most influenced by the amount of rainfall 1 1 mm of rainfall was determined as the threshold value a smaller rainfall amount was almost entirely intercepted while rainfall events with rainfall amounts between 1 1 mm and 14 1 mm were influenced also by drop diameter threshold value of 0 57 mm in case of smaller drop diameters the average rainfall interception loss was larger during the leafed period rainfall interception loss by birch trees was the most influenced by the rainfall event duration table 4 events longer than 400 min intercepted on average less rainfall 31 than shorter events 50 the amount of rainfall threshold value of 6 3 mm and the number of drops per event threshold value of 59 203 were recognized as the second and third most influential variables similar to the entire observation period interception loss by pine trees in the leafed period was the most influenced by the amount of rainfall threshold value of 1 1 mm smaller amounts of rainfall were fully intercepted whereas the interception loss of larger amounts of rainfall was further dependent on rainfall intensity and mvd rainfall interception loss decreased with a higher mvd and higher rainfall intensity during the leafless period interception loss by both tree species was the most influenced by rainfall intensity with a threshold value of 0 5 mm h and 0 7 mm h for birch and pine trees respectively table 4 interception loss was higher during lower intensity events which on average accounted for 37 of rainfall by birch trees and 79 for pine trees 3 2 2 effect of meteorological variables on throughfall throughfall was the most influenced by the amount of rainfall which had a lower splitting value in the case of birch trees than in the case of pine trees table 4 throughfall under birch trees was on average lower for smaller amounts of rainfall 41 and influenced also by temperature throughfall was in general higher with decreasing temperature when the amount of rainfall exceeded3 6 mm higher wind speed lowered throughfall under birch trees the amount of rainfall had the main influence on throughfall under pine trees table 4 throughfall increased with the increase in the rainfall amount however no throughfall under pine trees was observed for less than 1 3 mm of rainfall the amount of rainfall was also the most influential variable on throughfall in the leafed period table 4 the threshold value for throughfall under the birch trees in the leafed period was higher 4 mm than throughout the year 3 6 mm wind speed was the second influencing variable throughfall increased with lower wind speed fig 3 the splitting amount of rainfall for throughfall under pine trees in the leafed period was also higher 14 4 mm than that throughout the year 10 1 mm and the values of rainfall amount and throughfall were statistically significant for both periods however the threshold value inducing the throughfall under pine remained the same 1 3 mm mvd was recognized as an influential variable for higher rainfall amounts in the leafed period fig 4 the observed throughfall under pine trees increased with larger mvd throughfall in the leafless period under birch trees was influenced by humidity and mvd when the humidity was lower than 88 throughfall was on average 49 throughfall for events with higher humidity was higher 80 on average influenced by mvd lower values of mvd increased throughfall fig 3 the throughfall under pine trees in the leafless period was the most influenced by the number of drops per event with an increase in the drop number throughfall reached higher values 49 on average a similar threshold value of humidity 90 also influenced throughfall under pine trees for events with a smaller number of drops higher humidity also increased throughfall under pine trees 3 2 3 effect of meteorological variables on stemflow stemflow was most affected by the amount of rainfall which was recognized as the top split variable for both tree species in both phenoseasons except for birch trees in the leafless period table 4 in case of pine trees more than 13 1 mm of rainfall was needed to induce the stemflow whereas 10 8 mm was needed by birch trees during the events with more than 10 8 mm of rainfall stemflow produced by birch trees accounted for on average 4 of rainfall per event in this case stemflow was also affected by humidity since higher humidity over 95 inducing greater stemflow in the leafed period the amount of rainfall inducing stemflow generation by pine and birch trees was 12 7 mm and 10 7 mm respectively the highest measured amounts of stemflow produced by birch trees 4 5 of rainfall on average in the leafed period were observed when the rainfall amount was higher than 10 7 mm and wind speed was lower than 1 1 m s stemflow produced by pine trees was the highest 0 1 of rainfall on average for events with more than 12 7 mm of rainfall and temperature higher than 15 7 c stemflow generated by birch trees in the leafless period started with 3 mm of rainfall however the most influencing variable was the number of drops per event for more than 210 826 drops stemflow was on average as high as 7 of rainfall the amount of rainfall was also the main variable inducing stemflow generation by pine trees with at least 8 7 mm necessary for its occurrence 3 3 generalized boosted regression tree brt models the results of the brt models demonstrate that rainfall interception loss by pine trees was strongly influenced by a single significant variable whereas several variables were influential in the case of birch trees fig 5 pine trees interception loss during the entire year and in the leafed period was the most affected by rainfall amount in the leafless period rainfall intensity had the largest influence however mvd and dry period duration need to be considered as well throughout the year interception loss by birch trees was influenced mainly by the number of drops per event and humidity in the leafed period the amount of rainfall and its duration were the most influential during the leafless period the interception loss by birch trees was significantly influenced by rainfall intensity throughfall results indicated rainfall amount to be the dominant variable for both birch and pine trees during the leafed period and in general throughout the year fig 6 furthermore throughfall under pine trees for these two periods was also influenced by rainfall intensity and under birch trees by the number of drops per event in the leafless period the influence of individual variables was not that significant throughfall under pine trees in leafless period depended mostly on the number of drops and the amount of rainfall humidity the amount of rainfall and wind speed were recognized as almost equally important for formation of throughfall under birch trees in leafless period similarly during the whole year and in the leafed period stemflow was the most affected by the amount of rainfall in addition to the rainfall intensity for pine trees and the number of drops for birch trees fig 7 on the other hand in the leafless period stemflow produced by pine trees was the most influenced by mvd followed by the amount of rainfall in case of birch trees stemflow depended to the greatest extent on humidity and the number of drops per event 4 discussion in this study the amount of rainfall was recognized as the most influential variable on rainfall partitioning by vegetation as previously reported by other authors xiao et al 2000 staelens et al 2008 šraj et al 2008 siegert and levia 2014 it had the highest influence on all three components of rainfall partitioning by pine trees throughout the year it was also the most influential variable during the leafed season while in the leafless season rainfall intensity and the number of drops were the most influential on interception loss and throughfall respectively for birch trees we identified two dominant variables affecting rainfall partitioning throughout the year and in the leafed period namely the amount of rainfall and the number of raindrops in the leafless period rainfall interception loss by birch trees was mainly influenced by rainfall intensity and velocity of drops whereas throughfall depended mainly on humidity and median volume diameter mvd and stemflow on the number of drops and the amount of rainfall for both tree species the results of two different models suggested that rainfall partitioning throughout the year and in the leafed period was influenced by similar variables whereas the influence of other variables was present during the leafless period table 4 figs 5 7 this is in accordance with the results of staelens et al 2008 who reported that rainfall amount was found to be the most influential variable affecting interception loss by a single beech canopy for the leafed season while its influence can be neglected during the leafless period the number of events in the leafless period was lower than that in the leafed period table 3 which may affect the average results of the entire year nevertheless the difference between the leafed and leafless periods cannot be overlooked this is expected for deciduous birch trees and not to the same extent for pine trees however a similar phenomenon for coniferous trees was also observed by iroume and huber 2002 deguchi et al 2006 barbier et al 2009 and zabret 2016 iroume and huber 2002 suggested that interception loss patterns between the seasons for evergreen trees are more closely related to meteorological conditions than canopy characteristics which is partially supported by this study however this may also be the consequence of lower lai values for coniferous trees during the winter time margolis et al 1995 rainfall interception loss in the leafless period was most influenced by rainfall intensity muzylo et al 2012 reported the significant effect of rainfall duration influencing all three rainfall partitioning components in the leafless season but that was not observed in this study however different intensity threshold values were determined for pine 0 7 mm h and for birch 0 5 mm h trees suggesting that rainfall intensity did not have so profound influence because of pine tree characteristic fig 8 siegert and levia 2014 reported that due to rougher bark characteristics rainfall intensity had no impact on stemflow generation by l tulipifera whereas it significantly influenced stemflow generation by smooth barked f grandifolia percentage of interception loss decreased with higher rainfall intensity for both tree species which was reported also in other studies bellot and escarre 1998 xiao et al 2000 toba and ohta 2005 staelens et al 2008 van stan et al 2016 kermavnar and vilhar 2017 this might be the consequence of high rainfall intensity creating splash and disrupting interception channeling more rainfall into throughfall herwitz 1987 analysis of construction of regression trees rt indicated that lower rainfall amount values were needed for response of throughfall under birch trees 3 6 mm than under pine trees 10 1 mm the amount of rainfall as a threshold value differed by phenoseasons for both tree species and was higher in the leafed period than throughout the year table 4 similar conclusions were also drawn by šraj et al 2008 and staelens et al 2008 in addition the amount of rainfall inducing stemflow differed between phenoseasons stemflow produced by pine trees in the leafed period was induced with 12 7 mm and in the leafless period with 8 7 mm whereas stemflow produced by birch trees was induced with 10 7 mm and 3 mm in the leafed and leafless periods respectively these values are higher than the amounts reported for other smooth barked trees in forests namely 4 6 mm perez suarez et al 2014 5 mm chang and matzner 2000 siegert and levia 2014 2 1 mm and 3 4 mm in growing periods and 1 5 mm in dormant periods andre et al 2008 staelens et al 2008 in case of birch tree stemflow was influenced also by humidity increasing the amount of stemflow while it had no influence on stemflow generated by pine tree table 4 fig 7 higher air humidity may have contributed to faster saturation of the birch tree s bark due to its lower storage capacity which increased the amount of stemflow levia and germer 2015 as an influential parameter on stemflow produced by birch humidity was emphasized by brt for leafed and leafless period but not throughout the year for which it was recognized by the rt some uncertainty of the results for small sized datasets can be expected by brt elith et al 2008 and this may contribute to such results therefore the use of two models eliminated some of the uncertainty as humidity was recognized to influence stemflow generation by birch tree by both models an important influencing variable recognized several times by both models is also the number of raindrops per event as expected stronger rainfall events induced higher throughfall and stemflow whereas rainfall interception loss was lower although the number of drops per event was treated as a separate variable it can be strongly correlated also to the amount of rainfall with correlation coefficient of 0 82 additionally a new variable dropnr pamount was used to build the rt and brt but did not have any significant influence on rainfall partitioning although amount of rainfall and number of drops per event seems to be interdependent they influence rainfall partitioning differently probably due to other raindrop properties especially drop diameter and mvd however the results indicated that as throughfall increased with the amount of rainfall it also increased with the number of raindrops which was also observed by nanko et al 2006 however calder 1996a reported that for the same amount of rainfall interception loss will be higher for smaller raindrop diameters the influence of drop size described by mvd and drop diameter on rainfall partitioning was also expressed by both models for pine tree table 4 fig 5 in the present study smaller values of mvd caused higher interception loss and lower throughfall by pine trees in the leafed period fig 8 also the smaller drop diameter increased interception loss and decreased throughfall by pine trees throughout the year and in the leafless period this phenomenon was observed also by zabret et al 2017 who reported an increase in throughfall under pine trees during the event after the occurrence of drops with larger diameters however in the case of birch trees rts suggest the opposite smaller drop diameter and lower mvd decreased rainfall interception loss this may be the result of different response from the needles of the pine tree and leaves of the birch tree as different behavior of the needles and leaves in interaction to the rain drops were observed also by others nanko et al 2006 holder 2013 nanko et al 2013 previous studies of how various meteorological variables affecting rainfall partitioning also highlighted wind speed staelens et al 2008 šraj et al 2008 van stan et al 2014 nanko et al 2016 iida et al 2017 in this study the noticeable influence of wind speed on throughfall and stemflow under birch trees was confirmed by both methods according to rt increasing wind speed decreased throughfall in leafed period fig 3 and during the year and stemflow in leafed period table 4 according to ri of brt models wind speed influenced throughfall under birch in leafless period fig 6 as none of the models highlighted the influence of wind speed in relation to interception loss additional analyses were performed the regression analyses showed the decreasing trend of throughfall and stemflow and increasing trend of interception loss with wind speed for all phenoseasons table 5 the additionally prepared pdps of rainfall partitioning components for birch tree in all three phenoseasons showed the decrease of throughfall with wind speed higher than 0 7 m s on average per phenoseason and stemflow with wind speed higher than 1 0 m s on average per phenoseason interception loss was increasing up to wind speed of 2 m s fig 8 the increase of throughfall and stemflow with wind speed agrees with the results of toba and ohta 2005 staelens et al 2008 and šraj et al 2008 this corresponds with the penman monteith equation which assumes that higher wind speed increases evaporation rate which decreases throughfall hörmann et al 1996 klaassen et al 1998 herbst et al 2008 reid and lewis 2009 however this phenomenon was not observed by xiao et al 2000 andre et al 2008 van stan et al 2014 and iida et al 2017 who reported increasing throughfall and stemflow with increasing wind speed this can be explained with an assumption that wind decreases canopy storage capacity due to the shaking of the canopy which increases the dripping of intercepted rainfall xiao et al 2000 nanko et al 2006 andre et al 2008 according to the results of the present study the storage capacity of the birch tree canopy was not influenced by wind which may be the consequence of its location in urban area 5 conclusions we analyzed the influence of various meteorological variables on all three components of rainfall partitioning throughfall stemflow and interception loss using two different models for two distinct tree species in different phenoseasons generally the amount of rainfall the number of raindrops and rainfall intensity are among the most influential meteorological variables drop properties such as the number of drops their velocity diameter and median volume diameter were also recognized as significant these results suggest that drop size distribution is an important and influential characteristic which should be taken into account when analyzing rainfall partitioning although in our experimental site the trees are situated in an urban area wind direction was often considered as less influential than these other variables influential variables differ among phenoseasons and depend on the rainfall partitioning component to be able to recognize these differences long datasets combining various phenoseasons and covering several years of measurements are needed the variables influences also depend on the environment e g natural urban and tree species so studies that would consider different phenoseasons and evergreen or deciduous tree species are needed conflict of interest none funding the research was partially financially supported by the slovenian research agency through the phd grant of the first author k zabret
