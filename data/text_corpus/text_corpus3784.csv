18920,there is growing interest in the application of rapid quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr and other pcr based methods for recreational water quality monitoring and management programs this interest has strengthened given the publication of u s environmental protection agency epa validated qpcr methods for enterococci fecal indicator bacteria fib and has extended to similar methods for escherichia coli e coli fib implementation of qpcr based methods in monitoring programs can be facilitated by confidence in the quality of the data produced by these methods data quality can be determined through the establishment of a series of specifications that should reflect good laboratory practice ideally these specifications will also account for the typical variability of data coming from multiple users of the method this study developed proposed standardized data quality acceptance criteria that were established for important calibration model parameters and or controls from a new qpcr method for e coli epa draft method c based upon data that was generated by 21 laboratories each laboratory followed a standardized protocol utilizing the same prescribed reagents and reference and control materials after removal of outliers statistical modeling based on a hierarchical bayesian method was used to establish metrics for assay standard curve slope intercept and lower limit of quantification that included between laboratory replicate testing within laboratory and random error variability a nested analysis of variance anova was used to establish metrics for calibrator positive control negative control and replicate sample analysis data these data acceptance criteria should help those who may evaluate the technical quality of future findings from the method as well as those who might use the method in the future furthermore these benchmarks and the approaches described for determining them may be helpful to method users seeking to establish comparable laboratory specific criteria if changes in the reference and or control materials must be made graphical abstract image 1 keywords qpcr e coli epa method c data quality criteria water quality criteria 1 introduction quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr methods continue to attract attention from the beach water quality management community because of their ability to provide estimates of fecal indicator bacteria fib densities within as few as three hours after receipt of the sample in the lab compared to the minimum of 18 h required for presently employed culture based methods haugland et al 2005 noble and weisberg 2005 same day water quality notifications to the public based on rapid analytical methods such as qpcr could contribute to better informed recreational water use decisions boehm et al 2009 u s epa 2014 moreover the u s environmental protection agency epa now provides water quality criteria values that are applicable for two qpcr methods methods 1611 and 1609 for enterococci fib in its 2012 recreational water quality criteria rwqc publication u s epa 2012a results of epidemiological studies conducted with epa draft method a the forerunner to method 1611 for the 2012 rwqc demonstrated a significant association between gastrointestinal illness among swimmers and this method colford et al 2012 wade et al 2008 2010 consequently this or similar qpcr methods for enterococci have been used by local authorities in several beach monitoring demonstration or implementation programs across the country ferretti et al 2011 griffith and weisberg 2011 dorevitch et al 2017 byappanahalli et al 2018 while much faster qpcr methods are more complex than membrane filtration or defined substrate culture methods thus if qpcr methods are to be widely used defined performance characteristics are essential to ensure that beach notifications based on these methods are grounded in high quality data despite the availability of water quality criteria from the epa for culture and qpcr enumerated enterococci culture methods for escherichia coli e coli are more commonly used in the u s and canada to assess recreational water quality in fresh waters health canada 2012 kinzelman et al 2003 u s epa 2003 consequently there is a reluctance by many beach management authorities to adopt an enterococci qpcr method for fresh waters due to their historical use of and established water quality standards for e coli aided by the introduction of improved pcr reagents with lower levels of residual e coli ribosomal dna remaining after commercial manufacturing processes chern et al 2011 the epa has more recently developed and preliminarily validated draft method c for quantitative enumeration of e coli based on qpcr detection of the 23s ribosomal rna rrna gene the same gene targeted by epa enterococci qpcr methods 1611 and 1609 other groups have developed qpcr methods targeting e coli rrna genes using probes and primers that target differing sequences knappett et al 2011 silkie and nelson 2009 and various single copy genes frahm and obst 2003 hinata et al 2004 kaclíková et al 2005 koponen et al 2002 lee et al 2006 noble et al 2010 sandhya et al 2008 such as uida which is required for phenotypic expression in most culture methods for detection of these organisms one of these uida gene targeted methods is currently being used on a site specific basis for rapid beach notifications by a great lakes beach management authority kinzelman et al 2013 however further research is needed to determine the comparative applicability of e coli qpcr analysis methods methods that detect multi copy rrna genes such as method c offer the potential for greater analytical sensitivity which could facilitate such efforts by providing quantitative data for a wider range of ambient e coli densities this article presents proposed data quality acceptance criteria for draft method c that were developed from analyses of common reference and control materials by 21 laboratories these criteria were developed to be equally applicable for two alternative calibration models that can be used to estimate the number of target gene copies in an unknown sample and are presently being considered for a final epa publication of draft method c the first is the delta delta ct δδct model that is used in current epa methods 1609 1 and 1611 1 u s epa 2015a 2015b for enterococci the second is a master standard curve based model that relies more directly on the use of dna standards and has greater similarity to other qpcr methods sivaganesan et al 2010 consistent with both of these models and with the shift in emphasis to the quantification of gene copies rather than cell equivalents haugland et al 2014 in epa s updated methods 1611 1 and 1609 1 for enterococci this study on draft method c placed greater emphasis on the development of standards curves derived from analyses of dna reference materials than previous validation studies of the original epa methods 1611 and 1609 u s epa 2012b 2013b more explicit criteria for assessing the quality of positive and negative control sample measurements and for defining lower limits of quantification were also developed in this study from multi laboratory data results from an evaluation of the performance of the 21 laboratories in meeting the proposed data quality acceptance criteria for draft method c during ongoing analyses of recreational water samples are described by aw et al 2019 2 materials and methods 2 1 participants a total of 21 of the 22

hydrolysis probe sequence is 5 agtcgcaggcggccaccgt 2 3 study design and reference and control materials participants received detailed protocols including instructions to complete the study all participants were instructed to provide data from analyses performed in triplicate on a set of five dilutions of a multi purpose plasmid dna idtsmart kan std1 xho1 standard using the ec23s857 assay a minimum of four separate instrument runs were requested to produce these data for the generation of four independent calibrations curves the previously diluted and quantified plasmids were provided by the epa with a recommendation to store them at 80 c estimated concentrations of the plasmid dilutions were determined from droplet digital qpcr analysis using the entero1a assay for enterococci u s epa 2015a 2015b each plasmid molecule contains one copy of the entero1a assay and one copy of the ec23s857 assay target sequences and so copy numbers of the standards for both assays were assumed to be equivalent these plasmids and the methodology used to prepare and quantify them are described in sivaganesan et al 2018 participants were also instructed to provide data from duplicate ec23s857 and

negative control filter samples consisted of clean polycarbonate filters that were extracted in parallel with the calibrator positive control filter samples on a minimum of four separate occasions three no template control ntc reactions were also performed per instrument run with the ec23s857 assay together with the analyses of the plasmid dna standards similar procedures for the preparation and preliminary analyses of reference and quality control materials by individual laboratories are described in the updated epa methods for enterococci u s epa 2015a 2015b 2 4 dna extraction as described in methods 1611 1 and 1609 1 each positive and negative control filter was transferred to a 2 ml semi conical screw cap micro centrifuge tube containing 0 3 g of acid washed 212 300 μm glass

each sample and analysis were sent by each of the participants to a central laboratory for compilation and data analysis the compiled ct data for ec23s857 and sketa22 assay analyses were identified by assigned lab number instrument run number sample type target sequence copy number for plasmid dna standards and replicate sample number for calibrator positive control and negative control samples

after removal of outlier ct measurements criteria studentized residual 3 results of the plasmid dna standards analyses from each of the individual instrument runs n 4 or 5 were pooled together to obtain a master fitted curve for each participant laboratory a hierarchical bayesian model was used to incorporate the variability between instrument runs in estimating these curves the general form of the regression model is given by y ijk n μ ij σ 2 ij μ ij α i β i log10 x ij σ i j 2 σ i 2 log 10 x i j α i n α σ a 2 1 β i n β σ b 2 i 1 2 n j 1 2 r k 1 2 3 where y ijk is the kth ct measurement

winbugs code used for generating weighted master standard curves as described above is provided as supplemental material 2 8 determination of standardized lower limit of quantification from repeated standard curve measurements standard curve data from selected participant laboratories see selection criteria below were pooled to estimate the lower limit of quantification lloq using a weighted

the standard uniform distribution u 0 1 and var α ˆ i l and var β ˆ i l are respectively the estimated variances of the least squares estimates of α i l and β i l the standardized lloq was estimated at the lowest concentration of the plasmid dna standards 1 071 log10 copies per reaction letting z1 n α σ a 2 and z2 n β σ b 2 and l z1 z2 1 071 the upper 95 ct value of the bayesian credible interval bci of the posterior distribution of l was defined as the standardized lloq as the mean estimate α ˆ of the master intercept α as defined by equation 1 was relatively higher for lab 21 than for any other lab a 99 bci was estimated for z1 using standard curve data from all the participants except that lab the mean estimate α ˆ for lab 21 fell outside this 99 bci and thus their data were excluded from this analysis the data from the remaining 20 labs were used to estimate the standardized lloq and upper and lower acceptance bounds for standard curve intercept and slope parameters as described above 2 9 standardized lower and upper acceptance bounds for calibrator positive control sample ct measurements calibrator positive control sample ct measurements from all participant laboratories were pooled as in the above sections to estimate the total variability in the ec23s857 and sketa22 assay ct measurements first for each of the 21 labs and for each assay a nested anova model random factors run calibrator nested in run error was used to identify outliers criteria studentized residual 2 then a nested anova was used for the pooled data with outliers removed to estimate the total variability for each assay random factors included lab run nested in lab calibrator nested in run and random error an overall mean 2 s1 was defined as the acceptable intervals for future calibrator positive control sample analyses where s1 is the square root of the estimated total variance 2 10 standard deviation for replicate ec23s857 assay ct measurements pooled laboratory ct data for the lowest concentration plasmid dna standard 1 071 log10 copies were used to estimate variability nested anova random factors lab runs nested in lab filters nested in run and random error was used to estimate each component of total variability three times the square root of the estimated random error variance s2 was defined as the upper bound for the standard deviation of replicate ct measurements of future unknown samples if the standard deviation of the replicate ct measurements from these samples exceeds 3 s2 the corresponding sample data would be considered unacceptable and would not be eligible for data analysis following this criterion 3 results 3 1 standardized weighted master standard curve parameter values and data quality acceptance bounds as the variability in replicate ct measurements of the dna standards were relatively higher at the lowest concentration weighted linear regression analysis was used instead of regular linear regression analysis to estimate the model parameters the mean slope β and intercept α values as well as associated standard deviations from the weighted master standard curves for each of the participants are shown in table 1 for comparisons with epa enterococci methods 1611 1 and 1609 1 the corresponding mean amplification factors 10ˆ 1 β are also shown the 99 bci calculated from eligible dna standards data was used to establish the lower and upper standardized acceptance bounds for slope and intercept for the method to identify extreme laboratory results in future studies the posterior mean and associated standard deviation of the standardized slope were 3 49 and 0 09 corresponding to qpcr amplification efficiencies of 85 103 the estimated lower and upper standardized acceptance bounds for slope were 3 23 and 3 74 respectively the corresponding mean and standard deviation of estimates for the standardized intercept were 37 97 and 0 47 with the lower and upper standardized acceptance bounds as 36 66 and 39 25 3 2 standardized lower limit of quantification the individual mean lloq estimates and associated standard deviations based on the lowest concentration standard 1 07 log10 copies per reaction for each of the participating labs are shown in table 1 as described in section 2 8 the standardized lloq for the method was determined from all eligible data using the upper 95 ct value of the bci the resultant standardized lloq ct value was 35 17 3 3 standardized data quality acceptance bounds for calibrator positive control sample ct measurements the mean ec23s857 and sketa22 assay ct results and associated standard deviations for each of the 21 participants are shown in table 1 ec23s857 assay ct results were screened for variability results from lab 14 were excluded from the nested anova analysis described in section 2 9 due to an extreme difference in their mean ct compared to other labs 3 standard deviations lower than the mean of the other labs the standardized mean ct value and standard deviation were 28 05 and 0 79 respectively the lower and upper standardized acceptance bounds were 26 48 and 29 63 respectively based on the mean 2 standard deviations for the sketa22 assay results from labs 20 and 21 were excluded from the nested anova due to extreme within lab variability 3 times the maximum variability of the other labs the resulting standardized mean ct value and standard deviation for the remaining labs were 20 30 and 0 86 the lower and upper standardized acceptance bounds were 18 58 and 22 01 also based on the mean 2 standard deviations 3 4 standardized data quality acceptance for replicate ec23s857 assay ct measurements random error variability analysis of the pooled laboratory ct data for the lowest concentration plasmid dna standard in this study 1 071 log10 copies produced a standard deviation of 0 481 based on this value the maximum acceptable standard deviation for duplicate ec23s857 assay ct measurements of a given filter sample was established as 1 44 3 0 48 for use in future experiments 3 5 data quality acceptance for negative control filter sample measurements duplicate analyses of three negative control filter samples per instrument run was practiced in this study ec23s857 assay results from these analyses are summarized in table 2 the acceptance criterion was defined as the ct values from a maximum of only two negative control analyses could exceed the standardized lloq ct value based on this criterion 84 out of the total of 88 instrument runs would have been considered acceptable however three of the four failed runs were performed by a single laboratory that also obtained similar ct values from their ntc reactions data not shown the problem was subsequently attributed to a contaminated vial of environmental master mix that also came from a different lot than recommended for this study this vial was replaced with the recommended lot of master mix for the remainder of the study 3 6 summary of data quality acceptance criteria a summary of all data quality acceptance criteria established for method c from the results of this study is provided in table 3 4 discussion 4 1 importance of data quality acceptance criteria the growing interest in using rapid qpcr methods for recreational water quality monitoring points to a need for developing standardized data quality acceptance criteria for these methods to help ensure successful technology transfer across laboratories data acceptance criteria are benchmark metrics derived from repeated measures of centrally provided or common reference and control materials generated by a large representative group of practitioners following a standard protocol as illustrated by ongoing analysis results by these laboratories aw et al 2019 these metrics should be valuable for identifying and excluding poor quality data in addition the availability of such metrics should assist in the process of training a new generation of water quality professionals for the use of rigorous qpcr methods thereby improving the implementation of rapid molecular methods for improved water quality management it is important to note that the standardized data acceptance metrics developed in this study are only applicable in future experiments with the use of the reference and control materials described here or with alternative materials that can be demonstrated to be equivalent if these materials are not available it is recommended that the approaches described here be used to the greatest extent possible in establishing data acceptance criteria for substituted reference and or control material preparations careful documentation of approaches taken to prepare and quantify alternative reference materials used for quantification e g dna standards also will be particularly important for ensuring compatibility of results across laboratories 4 2 development and importance of standardized reference and control materials a clear obstacle to establishing the wide use of standardized data acceptance criteria for epa qpcr methods has been the lack of readily available standardized reference materials the use of enterococcus faecalis 550 cfu bioballs as a cellular reference material for epa methods 1611 and 1609 was demonstrated to result in highly reproducible enterococci density estimates in unknown water samples among eight different laboratories shanks et al 2012 unfortunately these cellular reference materials may be cost prohibitive for routine use and more importantly a parallel study cao et al 2013 demonstrated that substantially different enterococci density estimates were obtained when using a different source of e faecalis cells along with the introduction of more reliable methods for quantifying them recent efforts have shifted toward the use of centralized dna standards in epa qpcr methods haugland et al 2014 shanks et al 2016 sivaganesan et al 2018 as a result droplet digital pcr quantified plasmid dna standards have been prepared for updated epa methods 1611 1 and 1609 1 sivaganesan et al 2018 coinciding with a shift towards determining target sequence quantities in unknown samples rather than cell equivalent numbers haugland et al 2014 u s epa 2015a 2015b these same plasmid dna standards also should be applicable for method c and were used in this study until recently these standards were made available upon request by the epa office of water for epa methods 1609 1 and 1611 1 u s epa 2015a 2015b they presently may be obtained on a limited basis by special requests to the corresponding author in addition efforts are underway to develop a similar multi assay reference dna standard for a wide array of water quality testing qpcr methods including method c that will be commercially available a ready to use centralized reference dna material would minimize laboratory practitioner manipulations i e dilutions and contribute to reproducibility of these methods when implemented across laboratories the use of whole cells and salmon dna in calibrator or positive control samples still plays an important role in controlling for potential variations in sample analyses and in demonstrating successful implementation of a method whether analysis results for these materials are incorporated into a calibration model by the δδct approach or employed only for determining data quality in a standard curve model standardized acceptance criteria for these results such as those developed in this study will only be applicable if consistent and economically viable sources of these materials are readily available the use of multishot 1e8 cfu e coli bioballs provides a reasonable compromise for achieving analytical consistency at an acceptable cost a single such bioball is sufficient to generate 10 000 calibrator or positive control samples however the need for additional manipulations i e dilutions combined with requirements for proper storage of these cells still escalates the potential for variability this problem may have led to the exclusion of data from one of the laboratories in the development of the standardized acceptance criterion for ec23s857 assay ct values from the calibrator positive control samples the difference seen between ct results of this laboratory and the others also may have been related to the use of a different pcr instrument although no clear differences between results from the two platforms were otherwise evident in this study similarly the sample processing control spc salmon dna that is used in this and other epa methods can be readily obtained from a commercial source at low cost but again the additional manipulations and possible variations in the storage conditions of this dna could lead to variability this was potentially illustrated by the need to exclude results from two of the laboratories in the development of the standardized acceptance criterion for sketa22 assay ct values from the calibrator positive control samples recent studies have compared qpcr and digital pcr for measuring fecal indicator bacteria in water and have discussed the relative merits of these technologies cao et al 2015 staley et al 2018 wang et al 2016 one of the major advantages of digital pcr that has been emphasized is its reduced requirement for standardized reference materials while a direct comparison of qpcr and digital pcr was outside of the scope of this study the use of digital pcr to quantify the dna standards employed in this study illustrates how one of the key advantages of this technology can be applied towards the development of a relatively rapid low cost and accessible qpcr method with consistent performance and sufficient sensitivity for monitoring general fecal indicator bacteria such as enterococci or e coli in recreational waters 4 3 standardized lloq estimate and relationship to negative control results the establishment of limits of detection is now a requirement for qpcr methods bustin et al 2009 different approaches have been used for establishing limits of detection and lloq for qpcr methods shanks et al 2012 2016 sivaganesan et al 2014 u s epa 2013a the approach selected for defining the standardized lloq in this study was considered to produce a conservative value that also has significance in relation to the negative control samples as noted earlier in this article significant improvements have been seen in recent years in the ability to eliminate low residual levels of e coli dna that can persist from production processes in many commercial taq polymerase products chern et al 2011 silkie et al 2008 nevertheless the quality control of these products is still typically evaluated by analyses with pcr assays for single gene copy per genome targets chen wang life technologies personal communication the possibility therefore remains for detectable levels of multi copy rrna genes to remain in many of these products ntc and negative control sample results table 2 appeared to corroborate this possibility for the lot of environmental master mix used in this study results from this study and from other analyses u s epa unpublished data have suggested that low levels of contaminating e coli dna can occur in products from different manufacturers and in different production lots from the same manufacturer consequently an important recommendation for future users of method c will be to determine the level of background signal that is coming from each lot of polymerase reagent that is to be used in the method the lloq ct value determined in this study can be used as the lower threshold of ct values that replicate analyses of new lots of a reagent should never exceed given the capacity for the presence of trace levels of e coli target sequence contamination in qpcr reagents it is important that the lloq accounts for this potential background to prevent the misinterpretation of unknown samples 4 4 interference and technical controls the need for appropriate controls to identify sample matrix interference and other sources of error in qpcr analyses of surface water samples is well documented cao et al 2012 haugland et al 2012 2016 noble et al 2010 shanks et al 2016 sample matrix interference has been defined previously as any attribute associated with the test sample that results in the underestimation of target sequence concentrations and has been ascribed to two general mechanistic categories pcr amplification inhibition and dna loss haugland et al 2012 previous studies have identified different potentially prevalent agents in the environment that can act by either or both categories opel et al 2010 radstrom et al 2004 shanks et al 2016 the sketa22 spc assay monitors matrix interference effects due to both categories and thus should be sufficient for detecting either type of interference in most samples haugland et al 2016 the previously established acceptance criterion for sketa22 assay analysis results for the salmon dna spc in epa methods 1611 1 and 1609 1 u s epa 2015a 2015b was also adopted for draft method c unlike for most of the data quality acceptance criteria developed in this study this criterion was not statistically derived from representative estimates of the variability of these analyses but is rather an empirically established value that allows for the acceptance of potentially suboptimal analysis results from unknown samples within a limited range 3 ct units higher than the mean of the calibrator positive control samples within this limited range the sketa22 assay results have been indicated to be effective in compensating for sample matrix interferences in the δδct calibration model haugland et al 2012 2016 it is noted that this compensation also can be incorporated into standard curve models aw et al 2019 updated epa methods 1611 1 and 1609 1 have also included the option to use of an internal amplification control iac assay for the specific detection of pcr amplification inhibition shanks et al 2016 u s epa 2015a 2015b and to detect technical e g pipetting errors by operators performing the methods while an iac assay has been developed for draft method c and likely will be recommended as an option in the final publication of this method as well it was not evaluated in this study this was partially because provisions have not been made yet for making low cost ready to use iac assay dna templates available on a wide spread basis the new data quality acceptance criterion for replicate ec23s857 assay ct measurements established in this study is also expected to partially fill the role of the iac assay in detecting potential technical errors in performing the method when the iac assay is omitted 4 5 quality acceptance criteria for matrix spikes previous epa validation studies of methods 1611 and 1609 for enterococci u s epa 2012b 2013b emphasized the determination of spiked target organism recoveries as an important metric for assessing laboratory performance of the methods while results from subsequent studies have supported the value of this metric haugland et al 2016 such analyses place substantial additional demands on method practitioners in terms of additional sample collections sample preparations and sample analyses and thus were not evaluated in this study spike recovery results and criteria derived from the previous studies of epa enterococci methods cited above may serve as useful benchmarks for practitioners of draft method c that wish to evaluate this metric 5 conclusions standardized data quality acceptance criteria were established for calibration model parameters and controls including slope intercept and lloq values for e coli ec23s857 assay standard curves and e coli and salmon dna spc assay ct values for calibrator positive control samples in draft method c criteria values were determined from pooled analyses of centrally provided reference and control materials generated by 21 laboratories using a standard protocol and common reagents these criteria values should be applicable for any laboratory that performs draft method c using the prescribed reference and control materials and protocol from this study the approaches described for determining these criteria values may also provide useful guidelines for laboratories wishing to establish their own comparable laboratory specific criteria for the method using different material or protocol variations and ultimately increase the number of laboratories adopting qpcr for monitoring programs dna polymerase reagents should be checked for the potential presence of e coli target dna on a lot by lot basis potential effects of low levels of contaminant dna on analytical results can be minimized by demonstrating that negative control sample e coli assay ct values are higher than the lloq value and by only reporting unknown sample results where the ct values are lower

18920,there is growing interest in the application of rapid quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr and other pcr based methods for recreational water quality monitoring and management programs this interest has strengthened given the publication of u s environmental protection agency epa validated qpcr methods for enterococci fecal indicator bacteria fib and has extended to similar methods for escherichia coli e coli fib implementation of qpcr based methods in monitoring programs can be facilitated by confidence in the quality of the data produced by these methods data quality can be determined through the establishment of a series of specifications that should reflect good laboratory practice ideally these specifications will also account for the typical variability of data coming from multiple users of the method this study developed proposed standardized data quality acceptance criteria that were established for important calibration model parameters and or controls from a new qpcr method for e coli epa draft method c based upon data that was generated by 21 laboratories each laboratory followed a standardized protocol utilizing the same prescribed reagents and reference and control materials after removal of outliers statistical modeling based on a hierarchical bayesian method was used to establish metrics for assay standard curve slope intercept and lower limit of quantification that included between laboratory replicate testing within laboratory and random error variability a nested analysis of variance anova was used to establish metrics for calibrator positive control negative control and replicate sample analysis data these data acceptance criteria should help those who may evaluate the technical quality of future findings from the method as well as those who might use the method in the future furthermore these benchmarks and the approaches described for determining them may be helpful to method users seeking to establish comparable laboratory specific criteria if changes in the reference and or control materials must be made graphical abstract image 1 keywords qpcr e coli epa method c data quality criteria water quality criteria 1 introduction quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr methods continue to attract attention from the beach water quality management community because of their ability to provide estimates of fecal indicator bacteria fib densities within as few as three hours after receipt of the sample in the lab compared to the minimum of 18 h required for presently employed culture based methods haugland et al 2005 noble and weisberg 2005 same day water quality notifications to the public based on rapid analytical methods such as qpcr could contribute to better informed recreational water use decisions boehm et al 2009 u s epa 2014 moreover the u s environmental protection agency epa now provides water quality criteria values that are applicable for two qpcr methods methods 1611 and 1609 for enterococci fib in its 2012 recreational water quality criteria rwqc publication u s epa 2012a results of epidemiological studies conducted with epa draft method a the forerunner to method 1611 for the 2012 rwqc demonstrated a significant association between gastrointestinal illness among swimmers and this method colford et al 2012 wade et al 2008 2010 consequently this or similar qpcr methods for enterococci have been used by local authorities in several beach monitoring demonstration or implementation programs across the country ferretti et al 2011 griffith and weisberg 2011 dorevitch et al 2017 byappanahalli et al 2018 while much faster qpcr methods are more complex than membrane filtration or defined substrate culture methods thus if qpcr methods are to be widely used defined performance characteristics are essential to ensure that beach notifications based on these methods are grounded in high quality data despite the availability of water quality criteria from the epa for culture and qpcr enumerated enterococci culture methods for escherichia coli e coli are more commonly used in the u s and canada to assess recreational water quality in fresh waters health canada 2012 kinzelman et al 2003 u s epa 2003 consequently there is a reluctance by many beach management authorities to adopt an enterococci qpcr method for fresh waters due to their historical use of and established water quality standards for e coli aided by the introduction of improved pcr reagents with lower levels of residual e coli ribosomal dna remaining after commercial manufacturing processes chern et al 2011 the epa has more recently developed and preliminarily validated draft method c for quantitative enumeration of e coli based on qpcr detection of the 23s ribosomal rna rrna gene the same gene targeted by epa enterococci qpcr methods 1611 and 1609 other groups have developed qpcr methods targeting e coli rrna genes using probes and primers that target differing sequences knappett et al 2011 silkie and nelson 2009 and various single copy genes frahm and obst 2003 hinata et al 2004 kaclíková et al 2005 koponen et al 2002 lee et al 2006 noble et al 2010 sandhya et al 2008 such as uida which is required for phenotypic expression in most culture methods for detection of these organisms one of these uida gene targeted methods is currently being used on a site specific basis for rapid beach notifications by a great lakes beach management authority kinzelman et al 2013 however further research is needed to determine the comparative applicability of e coli qpcr analysis methods methods that detect multi copy rrna genes such as method c offer the potential for greater analytical sensitivity which could facilitate such efforts by providing quantitative data for a wider range of ambient e coli densities this article presents proposed data quality acceptance criteria for draft method c that were developed from analyses of common reference and control materials by 21 laboratories these criteria were developed to be equally applicable for two alternative calibration models that can be used to estimate the number of target gene copies in an unknown sample and are presently being considered for a final epa publication of draft method c the first is the delta delta ct δδct model that is used in current epa methods 1609 1 and 1611 1 u s epa 2015a 2015b for enterococci the second is a master standard curve based model that relies more directly on the use of dna standards and has greater similarity to other qpcr methods sivaganesan et al 2010 consistent with both of these models and with the shift in emphasis to the quantification of gene copies rather than cell equivalents haugland et al 2014 in epa s updated methods 1611 1 and 1609 1 for enterococci this study on draft method c placed greater emphasis on the development of standards curves derived from analyses of dna reference materials than previous validation studies of the original epa methods 1611 and 1609 u s epa 2012b 2013b more explicit criteria for assessing the quality of positive and negative control sample measurements and for defining lower limits of quantification were also developed in this study from multi laboratory data results from an evaluation of the performance of the 21 laboratories in meeting the proposed data quality acceptance criteria for draft method c during ongoing analyses of recreational water samples are described by aw et al 2019 2 materials and methods 2 1 participants a total of 21 of the 22

hydrolysis probe sequence is 5 agtcgcaggcggccaccgt 2 3 study design and reference and control materials participants received detailed protocols including instructions to complete the study all participants were instructed to provide data from analyses performed in triplicate on a set of five dilutions of a multi purpose plasmid dna idtsmart kan std1 xho1 standard using the ec23s857 assay a minimum of four separate instrument runs were requested to produce these data for the generation of four independent calibrations curves the previously diluted and quantified plasmids were provided by the epa with a recommendation to store them at 80 c estimated concentrations of the plasmid dilutions were determined from droplet digital qpcr analysis using the entero1a assay for enterococci u s epa 2015a 2015b each plasmid molecule contains one copy of the entero1a assay and one copy of the ec23s857 assay target sequences and so copy numbers of the standards for both assays were assumed to be equivalent these plasmids and the methodology used to prepare and quantify them are described in sivaganesan et al 2018 participants were also instructed to provide data from duplicate ec23s857 and

negative control filter samples consisted of clean polycarbonate filters that were extracted in parallel with the calibrator positive control filter samples on a minimum of four separate occasions three no template control ntc reactions were also performed per instrument run with the ec23s857 assay together with the analyses of the plasmid dna standards similar procedures for the preparation and preliminary analyses of reference and quality control materials by individual laboratories are described in the updated epa methods for enterococci u s epa 2015a 2015b 2 4 dna extraction as described in methods 1611 1 and 1609 1 each positive and negative control filter was transferred to a 2 ml semi conical screw cap micro centrifuge tube containing 0 3 g of acid washed 212 300 μm glass

after removal of outlier ct measurements criteria studentized residual 3 results of the plasmid dna standards analyses from each of the individual instrument runs n 4 or 5 were pooled together to obtain a master fitted curve for each participant laboratory a hierarchical bayesian model was used to incorporate the variability between instrument runs in estimating these curves the general form of the regression model is given by y ijk n μ ij σ 2 ij μ ij α i β i log10 x ij σ i j 2 σ i 2 log 10 x i j α i n α σ a 2 1 β i n β σ b 2 i 1 2 n j 1 2 r k 1 2 3 where y ijk is the kth ct measurement

at the lowest concentration of the plasmid dna standards 1 071 log10 copies per reaction letting z1 n α σ a 2 and z2 n β σ b 2 and l z1 z2 1 071 the upper 95 ct value of the bayesian credible interval bci of the posterior distribution of l was defined as the standardized lloq as the mean estimate α ˆ of the master intercept α as defined by equation 1 was relatively higher for lab 21 than for any other lab a 99 bci was estimated for z1 using standard curve data from all the participants except that lab the mean estimate α ˆ for lab 21 fell outside this 99 bci and thus their data were excluded from this analysis the data from the remaining 20 labs were used to estimate the standardized lloq and upper and lower acceptance bounds for standard curve intercept and slope parameters as described above 2 9 standardized lower and upper acceptance bounds for calibrator positive control sample ct measurements calibrator positive control sample ct measurements from all participant laboratories were pooled as in the above sections to estimate the total variability in the ec23s857 and sketa22 assay ct measurements first for each of the 21 labs and for each assay a nested anova model random factors run calibrator nested in run error was used to identify outliers criteria studentized residual 2 then a nested anova was used for the pooled data with outliers removed to estimate the total variability for each assay random factors included lab run nested in lab calibrator nested in run and random error an overall mean 2 s1 was defined as the acceptable intervals for future calibrator positive control sample analyses where s1 is the square root of the estimated total variance 2 10 standard deviation for replicate ec23s857 assay ct measurements pooled laboratory ct data for the lowest concentration plasmid dna standard 1 071 log10 copies were used to estimate variability nested anova random factors lab runs nested in lab filters nested in run and random error was used to estimate each component of total variability three times the square root of the estimated random error variance s2 was defined as the upper bound for the standard deviation of replicate ct measurements of future unknown samples if the standard deviation of the replicate ct measurements from these samples exceeds 3 s2 the corresponding sample data would be considered unacceptable and would not be eligible for data analysis following this criterion 3 results 3 1 standardized weighted master standard curve parameter values and data quality acceptance bounds as the variability in replicate ct measurements of the dna standards were relatively higher at the lowest concentration weighted linear regression analysis was used instead of regular linear regression analysis to estimate the model parameters the mean slope β and intercept α values as well as associated standard deviations from the weighted master standard curves for each of the participants are shown in table 1 for comparisons with epa enterococci methods 1611 1 and 1609 1 the corresponding mean amplification factors 10ˆ 1 β are also shown the 99 bci calculated from eligible dna standards data was used to establish the lower and upper standardized acceptance bounds for slope and intercept for the method to identify extreme laboratory results in future studies the posterior mean and associated standard deviation of the standardized slope were 3 49 and 0 09 corresponding to qpcr amplification efficiencies of 85 103 the estimated lower and upper standardized acceptance bounds for slope were 3 23 and 3 74 respectively the corresponding mean and standard deviation of estimates for the standardized intercept were 37 97 and 0 47 with the lower and upper standardized acceptance bounds as 36 66 and 39 25 3 2 standardized lower limit of quantification the individual mean lloq estimates and associated standard deviations based on the lowest concentration standard 1 07 log10 copies per reaction for each of the participating labs are shown in table 1 as described in section 2 8 the standardized lloq for the method was determined from all eligible data using the upper 95 ct value of the bci the resultant standardized lloq ct value was 35 17 3 3 standardized data quality acceptance bounds for calibrator positive control sample ct measurements the mean ec23s857 and sketa22 assay ct results and associated standard deviations for each of the 21 participants are shown in table 1 ec23s857 assay ct results were screened for variability results from lab 14 were excluded from the nested anova analysis described in section 2 9 due to an extreme difference in their mean ct compared to other labs 3 standard deviations lower than the mean of the other labs the standardized mean ct value and standard deviation were 28 05 and 0 79 respectively the lower and upper standardized acceptance bounds were 26 48 and 29 63 respectively based on the mean 2 standard deviations for the sketa22 assay results from labs 20 and 21 were excluded from the nested anova due to extreme within lab variability 3 times the maximum variability of the other labs the resulting standardized mean ct value and standard deviation for the remaining labs were 20 30 and 0 86 the lower and upper standardized acceptance bounds were 18 58 and 22 01 also based on the mean 2 standard deviations 3 4 standardized data quality acceptance for replicate ec23s857 assay ct measurements random error variability analysis of the pooled laboratory ct data for the lowest concentration plasmid dna standard in this study 1 071 log10 copies produced a standard deviation of 0 481 based on this value the maximum acceptable standard deviation for duplicate ec23s857 assay ct measurements of a given filter sample was established as 1 44 3 0 48 for use in future experiments 3 5 data quality acceptance for negative control filter sample measurements duplicate analyses of three negative control filter samples per instrument run was practiced in this study ec23s857 assay results from these analyses are summarized in table 2 the acceptance criterion was defined as the ct values from a maximum of only two negative control analyses could exceed the standardized lloq ct value based on this criterion 84 out of the total of 88 instrument runs would have been considered acceptable however three of the four failed runs were performed by a single laboratory that also obtained similar ct values from their ntc reactions data not shown the problem was subsequently attributed to a contaminated vial of environmental master mix that also came from a different lot than recommended for this study this vial was replaced with the recommended lot of master mix for the remainder of the study 3 6 summary of data quality acceptance criteria a summary of all data quality acceptance criteria established for method c from the results of this study is provided in table 3 4 discussion 4 1 importance of data quality acceptance criteria the growing interest in using rapid qpcr methods for recreational water quality monitoring points to a need for developing standardized data quality acceptance criteria for these methods to help ensure successful technology transfer across laboratories data acceptance criteria are benchmark metrics derived from repeated measures of centrally provided or common reference and control materials generated by a large representative group of practitioners following a standard protocol as illustrated by ongoing analysis results by these laboratories aw et al 2019 these metrics should be valuable for identifying and excluding poor quality data in addition the availability of such metrics should assist in the process of training a new generation of water quality professionals for the use of rigorous qpcr methods thereby improving the implementation of rapid molecular methods for improved water quality management it is important to note that the standardized data acceptance metrics developed in this study are only applicable in future experiments with the use of the reference and control materials described here or with alternative materials that can be demonstrated to be equivalent if these materials are not available it is recommended that the approaches described here be used to the greatest extent possible in establishing data acceptance criteria for substituted reference and or control material preparations careful documentation of approaches taken to prepare and quantify alternative reference materials used for quantification e g dna standards also will be particularly important for ensuring compatibility of results across laboratories 4 2 development and importance of standardized reference and control materials a clear obstacle to establishing the wide use of standardized data acceptance criteria for epa qpcr methods has been the lack of readily available standardized reference materials the use of enterococcus faecalis 550 cfu bioballs as a cellular reference material for epa methods 1611 and 1609 was demonstrated to result in highly reproducible enterococci density estimates in unknown water samples among eight different laboratories shanks et al 2012 unfortunately these cellular reference materials may be cost prohibitive for routine use and more importantly a parallel study cao et al 2013 demonstrated that substantially different enterococci density estimates were obtained when using a different source of e faecalis cells along with the introduction of more reliable methods for quantifying them recent efforts have shifted toward the use of centralized dna standards in epa qpcr methods haugland et al 2014 shanks et al 2016 sivaganesan et al 2018 as a result droplet digital pcr quantified plasmid dna standards have been prepared for updated epa methods 1611 1 and 1609 1 sivaganesan et al 2018 coinciding with a shift towards determining target sequence quantities in unknown samples rather than cell equivalent numbers haugland et al 2014 u s epa 2015a 2015b these same plasmid dna standards also should be applicable for method c and were used in this study until recently these standards were made available upon request by the epa office of water for epa methods 1609 1 and 1611 1 u s epa 2015a 2015b they presently may be obtained on a limited basis by special requests to the corresponding author in addition efforts are underway to develop a similar multi assay reference dna standard for a wide array of water quality testing qpcr methods including method c that will be commercially available a ready to use centralized reference dna material would minimize laboratory practitioner manipulations i e dilutions and contribute to reproducibility of these methods when implemented across laboratories the use of whole cells and salmon dna in calibrator or positive control samples still plays an important role in controlling for potential variations in sample analyses and in demonstrating successful implementation of a method whether analysis results for these materials are incorporated into a calibration model by the δδct approach or employed only for determining data quality in a standard curve model standardized acceptance criteria for these results such as those developed in this study will only be applicable if consistent and economically viable sources of these materials are readily available the use of multishot 1e8 cfu e coli bioballs provides a reasonable compromise for achieving analytical consistency at an acceptable cost a single such bioball is sufficient to generate 10 000 calibrator or positive control samples however the need for additional manipulations i e dilutions combined with requirements for proper storage of these cells still escalates the potential for variability this problem may have led to the exclusion of data from one of the laboratories in the development of the standardized acceptance criterion for ec23s857 assay ct values from the calibrator positive control samples the difference seen between ct results of this laboratory and the others also may have been related to the use of a different pcr instrument although no clear differences between results from the two platforms were otherwise evident in this study similarly the sample processing control spc salmon dna that is used in this and other epa methods can be readily obtained from a commercial source at low cost but again the additional manipulations and possible variations in the storage conditions of this dna could lead to variability this was potentially illustrated by the need to exclude results from two of the laboratories in the development of the standardized acceptance criterion for sketa22 assay ct values from the calibrator positive control samples recent studies have compared qpcr and digital pcr for measuring fecal indicator bacteria in water and have discussed the relative merits of these technologies cao et al 2015 staley et al 2018 wang et al 2016 one of the major advantages of digital pcr that has been emphasized is its reduced requirement for standardized reference materials while a direct comparison of qpcr and digital pcr was outside of the scope of this study the use of digital pcr to quantify the dna standards employed in this study illustrates how one of the key advantages of this technology can be applied towards the development of a relatively rapid low cost and accessible qpcr method with consistent performance and sufficient sensitivity for monitoring general fecal indicator bacteria such as enterococci or e coli in recreational waters 4 3 standardized lloq estimate and relationship to negative control results the establishment of limits of detection is now a requirement for qpcr methods bustin et al 2009 different approaches have been used for establishing limits of detection and lloq for qpcr methods shanks et al 2012 2016 sivaganesan et al 2014 u s epa 2013a the approach selected for defining the standardized lloq in this study was considered to produce a conservative value that also has significance in relation to the negative control samples as noted earlier in this article significant improvements have been seen in recent years in the ability to eliminate low residual levels of e coli dna that can persist from production processes in many commercial taq polymerase products chern et al 2011 silkie et al 2008 nevertheless the quality control of these products is still typically evaluated by analyses with pcr assays for single gene copy per genome targets chen wang life technologies personal communication the possibility therefore remains for detectable levels of multi copy rrna genes to remain in many of these products ntc and negative control sample results table 2 appeared to corroborate this possibility for the lot of environmental master mix used in this study results from this study and from other analyses u s epa unpublished data have suggested that low levels of contaminating e coli dna can occur in products from different manufacturers and in different production lots from the same manufacturer consequently an important recommendation for future users of method c will be to determine the level of background signal that is coming from each lot of polymerase reagent that is to be used in the method the lloq ct value determined in this study can be used as the lower threshold of ct values that replicate analyses of new lots of a reagent should never exceed given the capacity for the presence of trace levels of e coli target sequence contamination in qpcr reagents it is important that the lloq accounts for this potential background to prevent the misinterpretation of unknown samples 4 4 interference and technical controls the need for appropriate controls to identify sample matrix interference and other sources of error in qpcr analyses of surface water samples is well documented cao et al 2012 haugland et al 2012 2016 noble et al 2010 shanks et al 2016 sample matrix interference has been defined previously as any attribute associated with the test sample that results in the underestimation of target sequence concentrations and has been ascribed to two general mechanistic categories pcr amplification inhibition and dna loss haugland et al 2012 previous studies have identified different potentially prevalent agents in the environment that can act by either or both categories opel et al 2010 radstrom et al 2004 shanks et al 2016 the sketa22 spc assay monitors matrix interference effects due to both categories and thus should be sufficient for detecting either type of interference in most samples haugland et al 2016 the previously established acceptance criterion for sketa22 assay analysis results for the salmon dna spc in epa methods 1611 1 and 1609 1 u s epa 2015a 2015b was also adopted for draft method c unlike for most of the data quality acceptance criteria developed in this study this criterion was not statistically derived from representative estimates of the variability of these analyses but is rather an empirically established value that allows for the acceptance of potentially suboptimal analysis results from unknown samples within a limited range 3 ct units higher than the mean of the calibrator positive control samples within this limited range the sketa22 assay results have been indicated to be effective in compensating for sample matrix interferences in the δδct calibration model haugland et al 2012 2016 it is noted that this compensation also can be incorporated into standard curve models aw et al 2019 updated epa methods 1611 1 and 1609 1 have also included the option to use of an internal amplification control iac assay for the specific detection of pcr amplification inhibition shanks et al 2016 u s epa 2015a 2015b and to detect technical e g pipetting errors by operators performing the methods while an iac assay has been developed for draft method c and likely will be recommended as an option in the final publication of this method as well it was not evaluated in this study this was partially because provisions have not been made yet for making low cost ready to use iac assay dna templates available on a wide spread basis the new data quality acceptance criterion for replicate ec23s857 assay ct measurements established in this study is also expected to partially fill the role of the iac assay in detecting potential technical errors in performing the method when the iac assay is omitted 4 5 quality acceptance criteria for matrix spikes previous epa validation studies of methods 1611 and 1609 for enterococci u s epa 2012b 2013b emphasized the determination of spiked target organism recoveries as an important metric for assessing laboratory performance of the methods while results from subsequent studies have supported the value of this metric haugland et al 2016 such analyses place substantial additional demands on method practitioners in terms of additional sample collections sample preparations and sample analyses and thus were not evaluated in this study spike recovery results and criteria derived from the previous studies of epa enterococci methods cited above may serve as useful benchmarks for practitioners of draft method c that wish to evaluate this metric 5 conclusions standardized data quality acceptance criteria were established for calibration model parameters and controls including slope intercept and lloq values for e coli ec23s857 assay standard curves and e coli and salmon dna spc assay ct values for calibrator positive control samples in draft method c criteria values were determined from pooled analyses of centrally provided reference and control materials generated by 21 laboratories using a standard protocol and common reagents these criteria values should be applicable for any laboratory that performs draft method c using the prescribed reference and control materials and protocol from this study the approaches described for determining these criteria values may also provide useful guidelines for laboratories wishing to establish their own comparable laboratory specific criteria for the method using different material or protocol variations and ultimately increase the number of laboratories adopting qpcr for monitoring programs dna polymerase reagents should be checked for the potential presence of e coli target dna on a lot by lot basis potential effects of low levels of contaminant dna on analytical results can be minimized by demonstrating that negative control sample e coli assay ct values are higher than the lloq value and by only reporting unknown sample results where the ct values are lower

18921,there is interest in the application of rapid quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr methods for recreational freshwater quality monitoring of the fecal indicator bacteria escherichia coli e coli in this study we determined the performance of 21 laboratories in meeting proposed standardized data quality acceptance qa criteria and the variability of target gene copy estimates from these laboratories in analyses of 18 shared surface water samples by a draft qpcr method developed by the u s environmental protection agency epa for e coli the participating laboratories ranged from academic and government laboratories with more extensive qpcr experience to new water quality and public health laboratories with relatively little previous experience in most cases failures to meet qa criteria for the method were observed in 24 of the total 376 test sample analyses of these failures 39 came from two of the new laboratories likely factors contributing to qa failures included deviations in recommended procedures for the storage and preparation of reference and control materials a master standard curve calibration model was also found to give lower overall variability in log10 target gene copy estimates than the delta delta ct δδct calibration model used in previous epa qpcr methods however differences between the mean estimates from the two models were not significant and variability between laboratories was the greatest contributor to overall method variability in either case study findings demonstrate the technical feasibility of multiple laboratories implementing this or other qpcr water quality monitoring methods with similar data quality acceptance criteria but suggest that additional practice and or assistance may be valuable even for some more generally experienced qpcr laboratories special attention should be placed on providing and following explicit guidance on the preparation storage and handling of reference and control materials graphical abstract image 1 keywords qpcr e coli draft method c recreational water qa variability 1 introduction until recently the only option for monitoring recreational beach waters for fecal pollution has been by the use of culture based methods for fecal indicator bacteria fib such as escherichia coli e coli or enterococcus spp these methods typically require 18 or more hours from sample collection to results haugland et al 2005 noble et al 2010 this delay limits the ability of beach managers to issue closure or warning notices that are adequate for the protection of public health particularly on the day of exposure advances in molecular techniques now offer attractive alternatives for measuring microbial water quality more rapidly for example quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr is now a well established technique that can be performed in as little as 3 h based on epidemiologic studies wade et al 2008 2010 national regulatory criteria and beach action values have been recommended by the epa for an enterococci qpcr method u s epa 2012 and an improved and updated version of this method u s epa 2015a is now being implemented with the epa criteria for daily beach monitoring in a major metropolitan area dorevitch et al 2017 and in a u s national park byappanahalli et al 2018 in addition a number of different qpcr methods have also been developed for e coli fib sivaganesan et al 2019 and one such method is currently being used for site specific beach notifications by a great lakes beach management authority kinzelman et al 2013 as discussed in sivaganesan et al 2019 qpcr methods that are being considered for widespread use should have standardized data quality acceptance qa criteria guidelines in addition past evaluations of qpcr based water quality testing methods have often focused on the performance of these methods by established laboratories with less attention paid to the practical challenges of technology transfer to laboratories with little or no molecular biology based experience griffith and weisberg 2011 therefore assessments of method performance that account for the ability of personnel from laboratories with varying levels of experience to implement rapid qpcr based methods are an important consideration for evaluating the general applicability of these methods in this study laboratory performance of a relatively new e coli qpcr method developed by the epa draft method c was investigated based on standardized qa guidelines sivaganesan et al 2019 during the analyses of 18 shared surface water samples collected from 6 sites in the state of michigan a total of 21 laboratories ranging from academic and government laboratories with more extensive qpcr experience to water quality and public health laboratories with a long history of using culture based methods but in some cases relatively little previous qpcr experience participated in the study e coli 23s rrna target gene copy concentration estimates were determined for all sample and laboratory analyses meeting the qa guidelines in addition laboratory results were used to characterize the variability in target gene copy concentration estimates using two alternative calibration approaches the first was the δδct model used in epa methods 1609 1 and 1611 1 for enterococci u s epa 2015a 2015b and the second was a modified master standard curve calibration approach sivaganesan et al 2010 results from these analyses should provide informative benchmarks for comparing with variability assessments of other qpcr methods designed for widespread environmental water testing and may offer useful insights for the selection of calibration methods for a final version of draft method c as well as for other newer qpcr methods 2 materials and methods 2 1 participating laboratories and study design laboratory participants are listed in table 1 along with categorizations based on prior experience with qpcr technology at the time of the study new laboratories received qpcr equipment in 2015 and a subsequent three day training course on epa draft method c in 2016 but otherwise had relatively little prior experience experienced laboratories all had substantial prior knowledge and practice with qpcr technology in general but in most cases had not previously performed draft method c except as noted in section 2 2 all materials used to generate test sample and control filters including membrane filters dna extraction tubes and e coli cells for spiking came from central laboratories with the capability to provide these materials to all of the laboratories in order to help ensure the consistency of the samples e coli cells were also provided to each of the participant laboratories for the preparation of positive control calibrator sample filters containing 1e4 cfu filter as described in sivaganesan et al 2019 with the exception of one laboratory where the filters from 2 samples were lost each participant laboratory received a total of 54 test sample filters prepared from 18 different water samples three replicate filters sample as described in section 2 2 for a total of 1128 filters and 376 samples in the study a standardized testing procedure including templates for performing the qpcr analyses of the samples in the same order in three instrument runs were provided to each of the laboratories laboratories were directed to complete the analyses within approximately one month of receipt of the samples three negative control and three positive control calibrator sample filters were prepared and analyzed by each laboratory for each instrument run as described by sivaganesan et al 2019 2 2 water sample collection and preparation ambient water sample sites n 6 and their locations are described in table 2 three water samples of approximately 8 l were collected from each site at the same time and location water samples were kept at 4 c for no longer than 6 h between collection and initiation of filtration with exception of the metropark beach lake st clair sc site table 2 most probable number mpn estimates of the e coli cultivable cell densities were determined by colilert analysis as per manufacturer s procedure idexx laboratories westport me for each of the ambient samples from the first 8 l sample at each site approximately seventy five 100 ml aliquots of unaltered ambient surface water were filtered through 47 mm diameter 0 4 μm pore size polycarbonate filters millipore http04700 filters containing retentates from each of the water sample filtrations were transferred to sterile 2 ml semi conical microcentrifuge tubes prefilled with 0 3 g 0 01 g of 212 300 μm acid washed glass beads sigma aldrich after filtering the ambient water samples spiked water samples were prepared by inoculating e coli cell suspensions originating from known dilutions of multishot 10e8 bioballs biomerieux lombard il catalog 56146 lot b3215 mean colony forming unit cfu count 8 086e7 3 915e6 cfu into the two remaining 8 l water samples to achieve estimated spike concentrations of 200 cfu per 100 ml and 800 cfu per 100 ml respectively and then aliquots were filtered as described above this spiking protocol was applied to the meinert park lake michigan lmm twin lake park itl and sc site samples table 2 the two remaining samples from the saginaw river sr and saginaw bay sb sites were spiked with 1 ml and either 10 ml or 20 ml of sewage bay county wastewater treatment plant and 50 ml aliquots of the sewage spiked samples were filtered e coli cultivable cell densities were also determined by colilert analysis for these samples table 2 due to the expectation of very high ambient e coli cell densities in the memorial park lake st clair me site samples subsequently confirmed by colilert analysis table 2 the two remaining samples from this site were diluted 5 and 25 fold with water from another site on lake st clair that was predicted by the sample collector to be uncontaminated in order to obtain an expected corresponding range of e coli cell densities in the final samples e coli cultivable cell densities in these samples were determined by colilert analysis table 2 and 100 ml aliquots were filtered as described above for the ambient samples all spiked and diluted water samples were homogenized by inverting the carboys at least 10 times before filtering the filter tubes were stored at 80 c for 2 3 months before they were distributed to the participants filter tubes were express shipped 24 h to all participants on dry ice with recommendations to store them at 80 c until they were extracted with one exception as detailed in section 2 1 each laboratory received a total of 54 filter tubes labeled with identically coded identifiers 3 replicates of each of 3 sample types ambient low and high spike dilution from each of the 6 sampling locations 2 3 dna extraction and qpcr analyses dna extractions were performed as described by sivaganesan et al 2019 in brief 600 μl of sae extraction buffer containing 0 2 μg ml of salmon dna in qiagen ae buffer was added to each filter tube tubes were sealed bead milled at 5 000 reciprocations min for 60 s and centrifuged at 12 000 g for 1 min supernatants were transferred to clean low retention micro centrifuge tubes and centrifuged for an additional 5 min and approximately 100 μl of the clarified supernatants were transferred to new microcentrifuge tubes for analysis all dna extracts were analyzed immediately after extraction each dna extract was analyzed in duplicate by the ec23s857 assay for e coli chern et al 2011 and by the sketa22 assay for the salmon dna sample processing control spc u s epa 2015a b on the same instrument run analyses were performed as described by sivaganesan et al 2019 in brief reaction mixtures for both assays contained 12 5 μl of environmental master mix thermo fisher scientific microbiology division lenexa ks 4396838 2 5 μl of 2 mg ml bovine serum albumin 3 μl of primer probe mix for a final concentration of 1 μm of each primer and 80 nm of taqman probe in the reactions 2 μl of dna free water and 5 μl of the dna extracts for a total reaction volume of 25 μl thermal cycling protocols were 10 min at 95 c followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 c and 60 s at 56 c most of the participants used a steponeplus real time pcr sequence detector applied biosystems foster city ca however laboratories 10 and 14 used a cfx96 real time pcr detection system biorad hercules ca 2 4 raw data reporting and analysis instrument generated excel export files containing raw sequence detector determined quantitative cycle threshold cq measurement data referred to as ct measurements values or data in this article for each sample and analysis were sent by each of the participants to a central laboratory for compilation and data analysis by a qualified statistician the compiled ct data for ec23s857 and sketa22 assay analyses were identified by assigned lab number instrument run number sample type positive control calibrator negative control or unknown test sample and sample identification number for unknown test samples see table 2 data analyses were performed using sas version 9 2 cary nc and winbugs http www mrc bsu cam ac uk bugs as detailed in the following sections 2 5 data qa analysis and trimming except as noted below data collected by each laboratory was subject to the qa criteria described in sivaganesan et al 2019 the hierarchy of parameters for qa evaluation was as follows 1 standard curve slope acceptance range 3 23 to 3 74 and intercept ct acceptance range 36 66 to 39 25 2 positive control calibrator samples ec23s857 assay ct acceptance range 26 48 to 29 63 sketa22 assay ct acceptance range 18 58 to 22 01 3 negative control samples ec23s857 assay ct acceptance range lower limit of quantification ct value described below 4 matrix interference by test samples sketa22 assay ct acceptance range for test samples within 3 units of mean from corresponding positive control samples 5 variability of test sample ec23s857 assay ct measurements acceptance range for standard deviation from duplicate measurements 1 44 and 6 lower limit of quantification lloq for ec23s857 assay ct measurements of test samples ct acceptance range global lloq ct value of 35 17 standard curve results from sivaganesan et al 2019 were used to determine acceptability of the master standard curves for each laboratory in addition test samples were deemed eligible for ec23s857 target copy estimations if at least 2 of 3 replicate filters and at least 4 out of 6 corresponding positive and negative control samples in each instrument run met the qa criteria described above for sketa22 analyses only one replicate test sample filter was required to meet the matrix interference qa criterion for the ec23s857 assay analyses only one of the duplicate analyses of a test sample filter was required to give a ct measurement within 40 cycles the total number of thermal cycles performed for each analysis for that filter to be used for further analyses 2 6 delta delta ct calibration method the δδct model used in this study for estimating the number of e coli target gene copies x 0 from an unknown water sample is given by 1 log 10 x 0 δ c t 0 c t c c t c s c t i c α β δ c t 0 δ c t c c t i c α β where δct 0 is the difference between the mean ec23s857 assay and mean sketa22 assay ct measurements of each unknown sample filter α and β are the master standard curve intercept and slope previously defined for each laboratory sivaganesan et al 2019 ct c and ct cs are the mean ec23s857 assay and mean sketa22 assay ct values respectively for corresponding instrument run calibrator positive control sample analyses passing qa denoted by δct c c t i c is the mean of all initial calibrator sample ec23s857 assay ct values previously defined for each laboratory sivaganesan et al 2019 δct 0 δct c and c t i c were assumed to have the following known normal distributions 2 δ c t 0 n δ m 0 δ s 0 2 δ c t c n δ m c δ s c 2 c t i c n m i c s i c 2 where δm 0 and δs 0 are the estimated mean and standard deviation of the δct 0 values for the three replicate sample filters of each unknown water sample and δm c and δs c are the estimated mean and standard deviation of the corresponding calibrator positive control samples δct c values from the same instrument run filter variability was accounted for via a one way analysis of variance anova model in estimating δs 0 and δs c moreover the overall mean and standard deviation estimates of ct values of the initial calibrators were used to estimate mean m ic and standard deviation s i c of c t i c instrument run to run variability as well as filter within run variability were incorporated in estimating s i c via a nested anova model winbugs codes for performing these analyses are provided as supplemental material 2 7 master standard curve calibration method when using the master standard curve model to estimate the number of e coli target gene copies x 0 per analysis in the unknown water sample extracts equation 1 was modified to 3 log 10 x 0 δ c t 0 c t c s α β which does not include the initial or instrument run specific calibrator ct measurements for the ec23s857 assay but does continue to include the mean of the sketa22 assay ct measurements ct cs from the corresponding calibrator positive control samples in the respective instrument run again assumed to have a known normal distribution with mean ct 1 and standard deviation s 1 as in the case of δδct model filter variability was incorporated in s 1 4 ct cs n ct 1 s 1 2 thus the δδct and master curve models agree in theory if the mean ec23s857 assay ct values of the run specific calibrator positive control samples and the initial calibrator samples are the same i e ct c c t i c winbugs codes for performing these analyses are provided as supplemental material 2 8 method variability analysis for a given sample between laboratory and total variabilities were estimated from all results passing the qa criteria described above via the following model 5 z i n γ i σ ˆ i 2 γ i n γ σ b 2 σ t σ ˆ w 2 σ b 2 i 1 2 m where m is the number of labs for a given sample z i and σ ˆ i are estimated mean and standard deviation of log10 copies for ith lab and γ σ b are respectively the overall mean log10 copies per analysis and standard deviation of between lab variability σ ˆ w is the estimated standard deviation of overall within lab variability which is the average of all σ ˆ i s i 1 2 m the standard deviation for the total variability including both within and between laboratories is denoted by σ t non informative normal and gamma prior distributions are assumed for γ and σ b respectively for each sample the posterior distribution of a normal random variable with mean γ and standard deviation σ t was used to estimate the mean and 95 bayesian credible interval bci for the overall mean log10 gene copies per pcr analysis as sometimes different or unequal numbers of samples passed all qa criteria for each laboratory a subset of samples and labs were selected to generate a balanced data set to estimate between lab within lab and total variabilities data from 11 labs and 13 samples were selected for this analysis as described above with m 11 codes for performing these analyses are provided as supplemental material as indicated above 3 results 3 1 laboratory qa performance one of the major objectives of this study was to investigate how consistently a diverse group of laboratories with varying levels of prior qpcr experience could perform draft method c based on their success in meeting of standardized qa guidelines fig 1 shows the laboratory and sample combinations that had to be excluded due to qa failures as indicated in section 2 5 the first 5 qa categories were considered to specifically relate to laboratory performance of the method failures to meet the sixth category ec23s857 assay ct measurements global lloq were considered indicative of unusable data but not necessarily to reflect laboratory performance all of these qa categories are equally applicable to the δδct and standard curve calibration methods as indicated in section 2 5 data from laboratory 21 was excluded due to the failure to meet qa criteria for their master standard curve a total of 60 out of the remaining total of 358 sample analyses excluding laboratory 21 and 2 missing sample analyses from laboratory 14 failed to meet the qa criteria for the positive control calibrator samples ec23s857 and sketa22 assay ct values more informatively since each failure to meet these criteria affected 6 sample analyses in an instrument run 10 out of the total of 60 instrument runs 17 excluding laboratory 21 failed these criteria among the 10 failed runs 2 were caused by ec23s857 assay failures 5 by sketa22 assay failures and 3 by failures of both assays data not shown only 6 sample analyses 1 of the 60 instrument runs failed the negative control samples ec23s857 assay criterion only 8 individual sample analyses originating from 5 laboratories and 5 samples failed the sketa22 assay criterion for assessing matrix interference and no eligible water sample analyses failed the criterion for excessive variability of duplicate ec23s857 assay ct measurements 3 2 variability of water sample analysis results a second major objective of the study was to comprehensively evaluate the variability of target gene copy estimates obtained by the laboratories from analyses of a variety of ambient water matrices when all qa criteria were met as indicated in the introduction another component of this analysis was to compare the variability of target gene copy estimates obtained by the two alternative calibration methods fig 2 shows heat maps representing the posterior means of log10 ec23s857 assay target gene copies per reaction for each of the 18 samples from each lab s data that passed the qa criteria as estimated by the δδct fig 2a and standard curve fig 2b methods respectively corresponding standard deviations are represented in fig 2c and fig 2d the quantitative estimates ranged from log10 0 5 to 4 8 for means and from log10 0 03 to 0 43 for standard deviations samples analyses that failed any of the first 5 qa criteria listed in section 2 5 see fig 1 or where mean ct measurements by the ec23s857 assay exceeded the global lloq are shown in white in all panels corresponding numeric mean and standard deviation values and qa failure codes for each sample analysis are provided in table s1 table 3 shows the means and standard deviations based on total lab variabilities σ ˆ t of log10 ec23s857 assay target gene copies per reaction as determined using both the δδct and standard curve methods for each of 13 water samples where analyses by 50 of the laboratories produced data that met all 6 qa categories described in section 2 5 four of the 5 excluded samples where most of the laboratories obtained mean ec23s857 assay ct measurements exceeding the global lloq ct value were un spiked water samples with low ambient densities of culturable e coli table 2 as indicated in table 3 the total number of laboratories contributing acceptable data for each these 13 water samples ranged from 15 to 18 and there was not complete consistency from sample to sample in the laboratories that were excluded due to qa failures to obtain a more statistically balanced assessment of method variability a second analysis using results from only 11 of the labs that produced acceptable data for all 13 of these samples was therefore conducted results from these analyses including estimates of between lab σ ˆ b within lab σ ˆ w as well as total σ ˆ t variabilities are also shown in table 3 estimates of means and total variability expressed as 95 bci s for each of the 13 samples from this subset of data are also graphically portrayed in fig 3 4 discussion 4 1 data qa criteria and laboratory performance the goal of utilizing qa criteria in draft method c is to ensure to the greatest extent possible that potentially extreme and erroneous test sample quantitative results will be identified in future implementations of the method a total of 92 of the 376 test sample analyses conducted 24 failed at least 1 of the 5 qa performance related categories excluding the global lloq metric this seemingly high percentage of failures raises the question of whether the imposed qa metrics are overly restrictive or whether they are truly detecting and excluding what would otherwise be erroneous estimates of analyte e coli target gene copy concentrations in the samples due to suboptimal laboratory performance the availability of reference variability estimations standard deviations and 95 bci values of e coli target gene copy estimates from the laboratories that met the qa criteria for each of the 13 samples that also gave acceptable quantitative data lloq in this study allowed for an assessment of this question as described in sivaganesan et al 2019 and shown in fig 1 results of all sample analyses by laboratory 21 were excluded due to a high standard curve intercept value results shown in table s1 also reveal that this laboratory failed the qa criteria for positive control calibrator samples associated with samples 13 18 it was observed that after excluding these samples the mean e coli target gene copy estimates for 6 of the 7 quantifiable lloq samples remaining from this laboratory were outside of the 95 bci bounds established by the laboratories that passed all qa criteria when using the master standard curve calibration model conversely none of the estimates for these samples were outside of the 95 bci bounds established by the δδct model these results illustrate the primary difference between the two calibration models wherein the ct values from the ec23s857 assay for the calibrator samples from each instrument run are essentially used to adjust the intercept of the master standard curve for that run in the δδct model in this instance the high master standard curve intercept value obtained by laboratory 21 was offset by comparably high calibrator sample ct values in the δδct model which resulted in comparable e coli target gene copy estimates to those of the other laboratories nevertheless results of this nature also may be indicative of subpar sensitivity of the method in this laboratory the qa category responsible for the largest number of failures by far was the positive control calibrator samples ec23s857 and or sketa22 assay results with 65 of all failures being associated with this category as illustrated in fig 1 within this category failures to meet the sketa22 assay acceptance criterion were more common with 80 of the failed sample analyses being associated with this assay as opposed to 50 for the ec23s857 assay 30 failed the criteria for both assays possible reasons for these failures were identified in some instances and are yet to be confirmed in others but could include storage temperatures and numbers of freeze thaw cycles of the salmon dna and cellular e coli control materials holding time between preparation and extraction of positive control calibrator samples and variability in preparing new working stock solutions of sae extraction buffer several laboratories reported an inability to store dna standards and cellular e coli control materials at the recommended temperature of 80 c due to unavailability of an appropriate freezer it is again noteworthy that failures to meet the acceptance criteria established for this qa category often did not equate to extreme e coli target sequence copy estimates from the quantification models in relation to the results of the other laboratories that passed all qa categories for example among the 46 otherwise quantifiable lloq sample analyses that failed this qa category e coli target gene copy estimates were outside of the 95 bci bounds established by the laboratories that passed all qa categories for only 11 24 and 8 17 of these analyses using the master standard curve and δδct calibration models respectively data not shown most of these instances 9 and 6 respectively occurred in a total of just 3 instrument runs by 2 laboratories suggesting that these runs were compromised thus the multi laboratory data available from this study indicated that the proposed qa criteria metrics for positive control calibrator sample results can exclude valid sample analysis results but also showed that these criteria were able to identify compromised instrument runs while further refinements to the proposed qa criteria for positive controls in draft method c should be explored the availability of such criteria are particularly important when as normally would be the case no other option is readily available for objectively assessing day to day laboratory performance of this method the next most common source of failed analyses was presumptive matrix interference based on a previously established acceptance criterion for sketa22 assay results u s epa 2015a 2015b sivaganesan et al 2019 this criterion is designed to assess the suitability of a dna extract for qpcr amplification and is typically not considered an indicator of laboratory performance the highly sporadic and rare occurrence of analysis failures across the laboratories in this qa category fig 1 suggests however that none of the samples truly harbored substances that interfered with qpcr testing instead these failures more likely suggest suboptimal performance of specific analyses possibly caused by operator error in setting up these reactions previous studies have suggested a possible inverse relationship between frequencies of sample matrix interference and the assay amplification efficiency 10 1 master slope 1 haugland et al 2016 but no such relationship was evident in this study the broader question of how diverse ambient surface waters from more widely different geographic locations in michigan and across the entire u s affect the performance of this method has been examined u s epa unpublished data and will be addressed in subsequent reports the last two qa categories considered to be related to laboratory performance negative control samples ec23s857 assay ct values and excessive variability of duplicate ec23s857 assay ct measurements in individual test sample filters were the source of only six failed sample analyses in the entire study all coming from unacceptably low negative control ct values in just one instrument run the conventions described in section 2 5 for applying these criteria in this study at least two of the three replicate filters of each test sample and at least four out of the six analyses of the corresponding negative control samples in each instrument run having to meet the established criteria would not be applicable in other studies where replicate filters of test samples are not analyzed results from this study therefore may be underestimating the potential impact of these two qa categories on frequencies of failed sample analyses in other such studies close inspection of the results shown in fig 2 reveals several rare instances of sample analysis results by individual laboratories that passed all five of the qa categories but still showed atypical mean target sequence copy estimates in relation to the other laboratories the most striking example of this occurred in the analysis results for sample 14 by laboratory 15 where most of the laboratories obtained mean log10 target sequence copy estimates of 3 5 whereas the estimate from this laboratory was global lloq examination of ct measurements from this laboratory revealed that while the six sketa22 assay results for this sample were generally consistent and acceptable following the conventions of this study the ec23s857 assay results were highly variable ct values ranging from 25 87 to non detect or undetermined as indicated by the instrument outputs suggesting operator error in setting up the ec23s857 reactions for this sample such errors could be detected by the variability test for duplicate ec23s857 assay ct measurements if ct values of 40 were assigned to undetermined reactions and also likely would be detected by the duplex internal amplification control iac assay that is available as an option for draft method c but was not employed in this study sivaganesan et al 2019 the lack of extensive prior laboratory experience with qpcr technology appeared to contribute to the overall frequencies of failed analyses based on the five qa categories with the seven laboratories categorized as new in table 1 contributing 48 of the total failed analyses of these seven laboratories however only two were responsible for 39 of the total failures both of these laboratories also exhibited high run to run variability in sketa22 assay ct measurements during preliminary analyses sivaganesan et al 2019 suggesting within lab variability in the preparation of sae buffer working stocks these laboratories in particular will require further assistance before implementing the method the inability of these laboratories to maintain the dna standards and cellular control materials at the recommended 80 c storage temperature also may have contributed to their failed analyses thus the availability of a 80 c freezer ideally with a backup power system may be necessary for laboratories that intend to use qpcr analyses for beach monitoring conversely the qa failure rate among the other five new laboratories was only 9 compared to 19 for the 14 experienced laboratories these results suggest that the training received by these five laboratories on draft method c was beneficial and that additional practice or assistance specifically with method c also may be beneficial for some otherwise more experienced laboratories the current effort by the state of michigan to establish a network of multiple laboratories and personnel with demonstrated proficiency in draft method c gives an example of one approach for providing support to newer laboratories that may be initially struggling with the implementation of a new qpcr method 4 2 calibration models and method variability the design of this study provided an opportunity to directly compare the variability of target gene copy estimates generated by the δδct calibration model used in current epa qpcr methods for enterococci u s epa 2015a b and by a master standard curve model similar to those used in many other qpcr studies sivaganesan et al 2010 since draft method c has not yet been published as an epa method it is conceivable that its final version could incorporate either of these calibration models based on relative performance in minimizing variability and other considerations a demonstration that these models produce similar mean target sequence copy estimates also could be useful for future comparisons of results from this method with those of other epa or non epa qpcr methods that may use different models the results in table 3 and fig 3 show that the total standard deviations and 95 bcis of e coli target gene copy estimates were lower for most sample analyses using the master standard curve model this observation is expected from the standpoint that the repeated ec23s857 assay measurements of the preliminary and run specific calibrator samples introduce additional sources of random and sample preparation related variability into the δδct calibration model that are not included in the master standard curve model day to day or laboratory specific differences in the measurements of run specific calibrator samples by this assay must reflect corresponding differences in the measurements of test samples for the δδct calibration model to overcome its greater inherent potential for variability specific examples where this compensation may have occurred can be seen such as in the laboratory 21 results from this study referred to in section 4 1 however the overall results of this study suggest that this was not normally the case the results in table 3 and fig 3 also show that the mean estimates of e coli target gene copies were higher from the master standard curve model than from δδct calibration model for all sample analyses the mean median and maximum differences among the samples were only 0 054 0 054 and 0 069 log10 copies per reaction respectively based on all accepted laboratory analyses these differences were not significant in relation to the 95 bcis for each of the sample estimates as shown in fig 3 as mentioned in section 2 7 the δδct and standard curve models should agree in theory if the mean ec23s857 assay ct values of the run specific calibrator positive control samples and the initial calibrator samples are the same additional studies using different calibrator cell preparations would be needed to conclude whether the slight differences in target gene copy estimates observed in this study reflect any consistent systematic bias in using one or the other of the two models in this method 4 3 data reporting and comparison of method variability with other qpcr methods and studies several previous studies have employed similar designs to this study in evaluating the inter laboratory variability of other qpcr methods for genetic markers from general or source specific fib in surface waters griffith and weisberg 2006 ebentier et al 2013 kinzelman et al 2013 shanks et al 2012 shanks et al 2016 the differences in the quantitative models data analysis methods and or the reporting of results from those studies largely preclude direct comparisons with the results of this study for example many of the earlier studies modeled and reported fib density estimates as cell equivalents rather than target sequence copy estimates also the scaling of target sequence copy estimates to be expressed on a per water sample volume rather than on a per reaction basis and conversions from original log10 unit estimates from standard curves to arithmetic values are common practices such practices often may be necessary for comparing the results of qpcr methods with those of other methods such as culture or with existing recreational water quality criteria values or when different water sample or dna extract volumes are analyzed however arithmetic qpcr results should be reported as median copies and assessments of the variability of qpcr methods should be reported in the log10 scale on a per reaction basis with information provided about any deviations from the standard sample extraction and analysis volumes of the method the data reporting from this study followed this approach and employed traditional and bayesian statistics to take into account most sources of variability in the quantification models including replicate standards curves from replicate analyses replicate whole cell calibrator samples and analyses when applicable for the δδct calibration model replicate test sample filters and analyses within laboratories and finally variability across laboratories for data analysis of water samples from diverse sites that contained a wide range of e coli cell densities table 2 one common observation from this table 3 and other studies ebentier et al 2013 is that variability between laboratories was consistently the greatest contributor to overall method variability despite this the overall 95 bcis for many of the samples in this study particularly from the master standard curve model were nearly the same as previously reported values of 0 6 from sample analyses by a single laboratory using epa methods 1609 1 and 1611 1 sivaganesan et al 2014 this value of 0 6 log10 copies equating to a two fold target sequence recovery range from the expected values for spiked samples has been used as a benchmark in subsequent studies to evaluate the performance of methods 1609 1 and 1611 1 by multiple laboratories haugland et al 2016 the use of similar study designs and data analysis approaches to those of the present study is recommended for future studies that wish to assess the quantitative variability of qpcr methods for fib in water the variability ranges of log10 gene copy reaction estimates obtained from samples with varying densities of target organisms determined in this study may be useful for evaluating the results of such similarly designed studies of draft method c or other comparable methods 5 conclusions previously established standardized data quality acceptance criteria for five qa categories were used to evaluate the results of 21 laboratories with varying levels of prior experience with qpcr technology in performing draft method c for qpcr analysis of e coli in diverse freshwater recreational waters failures to meet these criteria occurred in 24 of all laboratory sample analyses with the major contributing category being unacceptable e coli and salmon dna spc assay ct values from calibrator positive control samples failures to meet acceptable e coli and salmon dna spc assay ct values for calibrator positive control samples were often not associated with extreme or erroneous e coli target sequence copy estimates in the samples instances of such associations occurred in approximately 20 of the analyses that failed this qa category and primarily in just three instrument runs in the entire study these observations point to the need for these controls and criteria in evaluating the day to day performance of the method by individual laboratories but also suggest that the development of further refinements to the proposed qa criteria for positive controls in draft method c should be explored variations in the percentages of sample analyses meeting all qa criteria among both new and more generally experienced laboratories suggest that further assistance or practice with draft method c may be beneficial for some laboratories in both groups variations in the storage and preparation of reference and control materials particularly by two of the laboratories were suggested to be potentially important factors in contributing to qa failures the master standard curve calibration model produced lower overall variability expressed as standard deviations and 95 bcis in log10 target gene copy estimates than the δδct calibration model in most sample analyses however mean log10 target sequence copy concentration estimates in the sample analyses were not significantly different using these two calibration models and variability between the laboratories was the greatest contributor to the overall variability of the method in either case to the extent to which comparisons were possible the variability of draft method c quantitative estimates in this study appears to be consistent with those from previous studies of other

18921,there is interest in the application of rapid quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr methods for recreational freshwater quality monitoring of the fecal indicator bacteria escherichia coli e coli in this study we determined the performance of 21 laboratories in meeting proposed standardized data quality acceptance qa criteria and the variability of target gene copy estimates from these laboratories in analyses of 18 shared surface water samples by a draft qpcr method developed by the u s environmental protection agency epa for e coli the participating laboratories ranged from academic and government laboratories with more extensive qpcr experience to new water quality and public health laboratories with relatively little previous experience in most cases failures to meet qa criteria for the method were observed in 24 of the total 376 test sample analyses of these failures 39 came from two of the new laboratories likely factors contributing to qa failures included deviations in recommended procedures for the storage and preparation of reference and control materials a master standard curve calibration model was also found to give lower overall variability in log10 target gene copy estimates than the delta delta ct δδct calibration model used in previous epa qpcr methods however differences between the mean estimates from the two models were not significant and variability between laboratories was the greatest contributor to overall method variability in either case study findings demonstrate the technical feasibility of multiple laboratories implementing this or other qpcr water quality monitoring methods with similar data quality acceptance criteria but suggest that additional practice and or assistance may be valuable even for some more generally experienced qpcr laboratories special attention should be placed on providing and following explicit guidance on the preparation storage and handling of reference and control materials graphical abstract image 1 keywords qpcr e coli draft method c recreational water qa variability 1 introduction until recently the only option for monitoring recreational beach waters for fecal pollution has been by the use of culture based methods for fecal indicator bacteria fib such as escherichia coli e coli or enterococcus spp these methods typically require 18 or more hours from sample collection to results haugland et al 2005 noble et al 2010 this delay limits the ability of beach managers to issue closure or warning notices that are adequate for the protection of public health particularly on the day of exposure advances in molecular techniques now offer attractive alternatives for measuring microbial water quality more rapidly for example quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr is now a well established technique that can be performed in as little as 3 h based on epidemiologic studies wade et al 2008 2010 national regulatory criteria and beach action values have been recommended by the epa for an enterococci qpcr method u s epa 2012 and an improved and updated version of this method u s epa 2015a is now being implemented with the epa criteria for daily beach monitoring in a major metropolitan area dorevitch et al 2017 and in a u s national park byappanahalli et al 2018 in addition a number of different qpcr methods have also been developed for e coli fib sivaganesan et al 2019 and one such method is currently being used for site specific beach notifications by a great lakes beach management authority kinzelman et al 2013 as discussed in sivaganesan et al 2019 qpcr methods that are being considered for widespread use should have standardized data quality acceptance qa criteria guidelines in addition past evaluations of qpcr based water quality testing methods have often focused on the performance of these methods by established laboratories with less attention paid to the practical challenges of technology transfer to laboratories with little or no molecular biology based experience griffith and weisberg 2011 therefore assessments of method performance that account for the ability of personnel from laboratories with varying levels of experience to implement rapid qpcr based methods are an important consideration for evaluating the general applicability of these methods in this study laboratory performance of a relatively new e coli qpcr method developed by the epa draft method c was investigated based on standardized qa guidelines sivaganesan et al 2019 during the analyses of 18 shared surface water samples collected from 6 sites in the state of michigan a total of 21 laboratories ranging from academic and government laboratories with more extensive qpcr experience to water quality and public health laboratories with a long history of using culture based methods but in some cases relatively little previous qpcr experience participated in the study e coli 23s rrna target gene copy concentration estimates were determined for all sample and laboratory analyses meeting the qa guidelines in addition laboratory results were used to characterize the variability in target gene copy concentration estimates using two alternative calibration approaches the first was the δδct model used in epa methods 1609 1 and 1611 1 for enterococci u s epa 2015a 2015b and the second was a modified master standard curve calibration approach sivaganesan et al 2010 results from these analyses should provide informative benchmarks for comparing with variability assessments of other qpcr methods designed for widespread environmental water testing and may offer useful insights for the selection of calibration methods for a final version of draft method c as well as for other newer qpcr methods 2 materials and methods 2 1 participating laboratories and study design laboratory participants are listed in table 1 along with categorizations based on prior experience with qpcr technology at the time of the study new laboratories received qpcr equipment in 2015 and a subsequent three day training course on epa draft method c in 2016 but otherwise had relatively little prior experience experienced laboratories all had substantial prior knowledge and practice with qpcr technology in general but in most cases had not previously performed draft method c except as noted in section 2 2 all materials used to generate test sample and control filters including membrane filters dna extraction tubes and e coli cells for spiking came from central laboratories with the capability to provide these materials to all of the laboratories in order to help ensure the consistency of the samples e coli cells were also provided to each of the participant laboratories for the preparation of positive control calibrator sample filters containing 1e4 cfu filter as described in sivaganesan et al 2019 with the exception of one laboratory where the filters from 2 samples were lost each participant laboratory received a total of 54 test sample filters prepared from 18 different water samples three replicate filters sample as described in section 2 2 for a total of 1128 filters and 376 samples in the study a standardized testing procedure including templates for performing the qpcr analyses of the samples in the same order in three instrument runs were provided to each of the laboratories laboratories were directed to complete the analyses within approximately one month of receipt of the samples three negative control and three positive control calibrator sample filters were prepared and analyzed by each laboratory for each instrument run as described by sivaganesan et al 2019 2 2 water sample collection and preparation ambient water sample sites n 6 and their locations are described in table 2 three water samples of approximately 8 l were collected from each site at the same time and location water samples were kept at 4 c for no longer than 6 h between collection and initiation of filtration with exception of the metropark beach lake st clair sc site table 2 most probable number mpn estimates of the e coli cultivable cell densities were determined by colilert analysis as per manufacturer s procedure idexx laboratories westport me for each of the ambient samples from the first 8 l sample at each site approximately seventy five 100 ml aliquots of unaltered ambient surface water were filtered through 47 mm diameter 0 4 μm pore size polycarbonate filters millipore http04700 filters containing retentates from each of the water sample filtrations were transferred to sterile 2 ml semi conical microcentrifuge tubes prefilled with 0 3 g 0 01 g of 212 300 μm acid washed glass beads sigma aldrich after filtering the ambient water samples spiked water samples were prepared by inoculating e coli cell suspensions originating from known dilutions of multishot 10e8 bioballs biomerieux lombard il catalog 56146 lot b3215 mean colony forming unit cfu count 8 086e7 3 915e6 cfu into the two remaining 8 l water samples to achieve estimated spike concentrations of 200 cfu per 100 ml and 800 cfu per 100 ml respectively and then aliquots were filtered as described above this spiking protocol was applied to the meinert park lake michigan lmm twin lake park itl and sc site samples table 2 the two remaining samples from the saginaw river sr and saginaw bay sb sites were spiked with 1 ml and either 10 ml or 20 ml of sewage bay county wastewater treatment plant and 50 ml aliquots of the sewage spiked samples were filtered e coli cultivable cell densities were also determined by colilert analysis for these samples table 2 due to the expectation of very high ambient e coli cell densities in the memorial park lake st clair me site samples subsequently confirmed by colilert analysis table 2 the two remaining samples from this site were diluted 5 and 25 fold with water from another site on lake st clair that was predicted by the sample collector to be uncontaminated in order to obtain an expected corresponding range of e coli cell densities in the final samples e coli cultivable cell densities in these samples were determined by colilert analysis table 2 and 100 ml aliquots were filtered as described above for the ambient samples all spiked and diluted water samples were homogenized by inverting the carboys at least 10 times before filtering the filter tubes were stored at 80 c for 2 3 months before they were distributed to the participants filter tubes were express shipped 24 h to all participants on dry ice with recommendations to store them at 80 c until they were extracted with one exception as detailed in section 2 1 each laboratory received a total of 54 filter tubes labeled with identically coded identifiers 3 replicates of each of 3 sample types ambient low and high spike dilution from each of the 6 sampling locations 2 3 dna extraction and qpcr analyses dna extractions were performed as described by sivaganesan et al 2019 in brief 600 μl of sae extraction buffer containing 0 2 μg ml of salmon dna in qiagen ae buffer was added to each filter tube tubes were sealed bead milled at 5 000 reciprocations min for 60 s and centrifuged at 12 000 g for 1 min supernatants were transferred to clean low retention micro centrifuge tubes and centrifuged for an additional 5 min and approximately 100 μl of the clarified supernatants were transferred to new microcentrifuge tubes for analysis all dna extracts were analyzed immediately after extraction each dna extract was analyzed in duplicate by the ec23s857 assay for e coli chern et al 2011 and by the sketa22 assay for the salmon dna sample processing control spc u s epa 2015a b on the same instrument run analyses were performed as described by sivaganesan et al 2019 in brief reaction mixtures for both assays contained 12 5 μl of environmental master mix thermo fisher scientific microbiology division lenexa ks 4396838 2 5 μl of 2 mg ml bovine serum albumin 3 μl of primer probe mix for a final concentration of 1 μm of each primer and 80 nm of taqman probe in the reactions 2 μl of dna free water and 5 μl of the dna extracts for a total reaction volume of 25 μl thermal cycling protocols were 10 min at 95 c followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 c and 60 s at 56 c most of the participants used a steponeplus real time pcr sequence detector applied biosystems foster city ca however laboratories 10 and 14 used a cfx96 real time pcr detection system biorad hercules ca 2 4 raw data reporting and analysis instrument generated excel export files containing raw sequence detector determined quantitative cycle threshold cq measurement data referred to as ct measurements values or data in this article for each sample and analysis were sent by each of the participants to a central laboratory for compilation and data analysis by a qualified statistician the compiled ct data for ec23s857 and sketa22 assay analyses were identified by assigned lab number instrument run number sample type positive control calibrator negative control or unknown test sample and sample identification number for unknown test samples see table 2 data analyses were performed using sas version 9 2 cary nc and winbugs http www mrc bsu cam ac uk bugs as detailed in the following sections 2 5 data qa analysis and trimming except as noted below data collected by each laboratory was subject to the qa criteria described in sivaganesan et al 2019 the hierarchy of parameters for qa evaluation was as follows 1 standard curve slope acceptance range 3 23 to 3 74 and intercept ct acceptance range 36 66 to 39 25 2 positive control calibrator samples ec23s857 assay ct acceptance range 26 48 to 29 63 sketa22 assay ct acceptance range 18 58 to 22 01 3 negative control samples ec23s857 assay ct acceptance range lower limit of quantification ct value described below 4 matrix interference by test samples sketa22 assay ct acceptance range for test samples within 3 units of mean from corresponding positive control samples 5 variability of test sample ec23s857 assay ct measurements acceptance range for standard deviation from duplicate measurements 1 44 and 6 lower limit of quantification lloq for ec23s857 assay ct measurements of test samples ct acceptance range global lloq ct value of 35 17 standard curve results from sivaganesan et al 2019 were used to determine acceptability of the master standard curves for each laboratory in addition test samples were deemed eligible for ec23s857 target copy estimations if at least 2 of 3 replicate filters and at least 4 out of 6 corresponding positive and negative control samples in each instrument run met the qa criteria described above for sketa22 analyses only one replicate test sample filter was required to meet the matrix interference qa criterion for the ec23s857 assay analyses only one of the duplicate analyses of a test sample filter was required to give a ct measurement within 40 cycles the total number of thermal cycles performed for each analysis for that filter to be used for further analyses 2 6 delta delta ct calibration method the δδct model used in this study for estimating the number of e coli target gene copies x 0 from an unknown water sample is given by 1 log 10 x 0 δ c t 0 c t c c t c s c t i c α β δ c t 0 δ c t c c t i c α β where δct 0 is the difference between the mean ec23s857 assay and mean sketa22 assay ct measurements of each unknown sample filter α and β are the master standard curve intercept and slope previously defined for each laboratory sivaganesan et al 2019 ct c and ct cs are the mean ec23s857 assay and mean sketa22 assay ct values respectively for corresponding instrument run calibrator positive control sample analyses passing qa denoted by δct c c t i c is the mean of all initial calibrator sample ec23s857 assay ct values previously defined for each laboratory sivaganesan et al 2019 δct 0 δct c and c t i c were assumed to have the following known normal distributions 2 δ c t 0 n δ m 0 δ s 0 2 δ c t c n δ m c δ s c 2 c t i c n m i c s i c 2 where δm 0 and δs 0 are the estimated mean and standard deviation of the δct 0 values for the three replicate sample filters of each unknown water sample and δm c and δs c are the estimated mean and standard deviation of the corresponding calibrator positive control samples δct c values from the same instrument run filter variability was accounted for via a one way analysis of variance anova model in estimating δs 0 and δs c moreover the overall mean and standard deviation estimates of ct values of the initial calibrators were used to estimate mean m ic and standard deviation s i c of c t i c instrument run to run variability as well as filter within run variability were incorporated in estimating s i c via a nested anova model winbugs codes for performing these analyses are provided as supplemental material 2 7 master standard curve calibration method when using the master standard curve model to estimate the number of e coli target gene copies x 0 per analysis in the unknown water sample extracts equation 1 was modified to 3 log 10 x 0 δ c t 0 c t c s α β which does not include the initial or instrument run specific calibrator ct measurements for the ec23s857 assay but does continue to include the mean of the sketa22 assay ct measurements ct cs from the corresponding calibrator positive control samples in the respective instrument run again assumed to have a known normal distribution with mean ct 1 and standard deviation s 1 as in the case of δδct model filter variability was incorporated in s 1 4 ct cs n ct 1 s 1 2 thus the δδct and master curve models agree in theory if the mean ec23s857 assay ct values of the run specific calibrator positive control samples and the initial calibrator samples are the same i e ct c c t i c winbugs codes for performing these analyses are provided as supplemental material 2 8 method variability analysis for a given sample between laboratory and total variabilities were estimated from all results passing the qa criteria described above via the following model 5 z i n γ i σ ˆ i 2 γ i n γ σ b 2 σ t σ ˆ w 2 σ b 2 i 1 2 m where m is the number of labs for a given sample z i and σ ˆ i are estimated mean and standard deviation of log10 copies for ith lab and γ σ b are respectively the overall mean log10 copies per analysis and standard deviation of between lab variability σ ˆ w is the estimated standard deviation of overall within lab variability which is the average of all σ ˆ i s i 1 2 m the standard deviation for the total variability including both within and between laboratories is denoted by σ t non informative normal and gamma prior distributions are assumed for γ and σ b respectively for each sample the posterior distribution of a normal random variable with mean γ and standard deviation σ t was used to estimate the mean and 95 bayesian credible interval bci for the overall mean log10 gene copies per pcr analysis as sometimes different or unequal numbers of samples passed all qa criteria for each laboratory a subset of samples and labs were selected to generate a balanced data set to estimate between lab within lab and total variabilities data from 11 labs and 13 samples were selected for this analysis as described above with m 11 codes for performing these analyses are provided as supplemental material as indicated above 3 results 3 1 laboratory qa performance one of the major objectives of this study was to investigate how consistently a diverse group of laboratories with varying levels of prior qpcr experience could perform draft method c based on their success in meeting of standardized qa guidelines fig 1 shows the laboratory and sample combinations that had to be excluded due to qa failures as indicated in section 2 5 the first 5 qa categories were considered to specifically relate to laboratory performance of the method failures to meet the sixth category ec23s857 assay ct measurements global lloq were considered indicative of unusable data but not necessarily to reflect laboratory performance all of these qa categories are equally applicable to the δδct and standard curve calibration methods as indicated in section 2 5 data from laboratory 21 was excluded due to the failure to meet qa criteria for their master standard curve a total of 60 out of the remaining total of 358 sample analyses excluding laboratory 21 and 2 missing sample analyses from laboratory 14 failed to meet the qa criteria for the positive control calibrator samples ec23s857 and sketa22 assay ct values more informatively since each failure to meet these criteria affected 6 sample analyses in an instrument run 10 out of the total of 60 instrument runs 17 excluding laboratory 21 failed these criteria among the 10 failed runs 2 were caused by ec23s857 assay failures 5 by sketa22 assay failures and 3 by failures of both assays data not shown only 6 sample analyses 1 of the 60 instrument runs failed the negative control samples ec23s857 assay criterion only 8 individual sample analyses originating from 5 laboratories and 5 samples failed the sketa22 assay criterion for assessing matrix interference and no eligible water sample analyses failed the criterion for excessive variability of duplicate ec23s857 assay ct measurements 3 2 variability of water sample analysis results a second major objective of the study was to comprehensively evaluate the variability of target gene copy estimates obtained by the laboratories from analyses of a variety of ambient water matrices when all qa criteria were met as indicated in the introduction another component of this analysis was to compare the variability of target gene copy estimates obtained by the two alternative calibration methods fig 2 shows heat maps representing the posterior means of log10 ec23s857 assay target gene copies per reaction for each of the 18 samples from each lab s data that passed the qa criteria as estimated by the δδct fig 2a and standard curve fig 2b methods respectively corresponding standard deviations are represented in fig 2c and fig 2d the quantitative estimates ranged from log10 0 5 to 4 8 for means and from log10 0 03 to 0 43 for standard deviations samples analyses that failed any of the first 5 qa criteria listed in section 2 5 see fig 1 or where mean ct measurements by the ec23s857 assay exceeded the global lloq are shown in white in all panels corresponding numeric mean and standard deviation values and qa failure codes for each sample analysis are provided in table s1 table 3 shows the means and standard deviations based on total lab variabilities σ ˆ t of log10 ec23s857 assay target gene copies per reaction as determined using both the δδct and standard curve methods for each of 13 water samples where analyses by 50 of the laboratories produced data that met all 6 qa categories described in section 2 5 four of the 5 excluded samples where most of the laboratories obtained mean ec23s857 assay ct measurements exceeding the global lloq ct value were un spiked water samples with low ambient densities of culturable e coli table 2 as indicated in table 3 the total number of laboratories contributing acceptable data for each these 13 water samples ranged from 15 to 18 and there was not complete consistency from sample to sample in the laboratories that were excluded due to qa failures to obtain a more statistically balanced assessment of method variability a second analysis using results from only 11 of the labs that produced acceptable data for all 13 of these samples was therefore conducted results from these analyses including estimates of between lab σ ˆ b within lab σ ˆ w as well as total σ ˆ t variabilities are also shown in table 3 estimates of means and total variability expressed as 95 bci s for each of the 13 samples from this subset of data are also graphically portrayed in fig 3 4 discussion 4 1 data qa criteria and laboratory performance the goal of utilizing qa criteria in draft method c is to ensure to the greatest extent possible that potentially extreme and erroneous test sample quantitative results will be identified in future implementations of the method a total of 92 of the 376 test sample analyses conducted 24 failed at least 1 of the 5 qa performance related categories excluding the global lloq metric this seemingly high percentage of failures raises the question of whether the imposed qa metrics are overly restrictive or whether they are truly detecting and excluding what would otherwise be erroneous estimates of analyte e coli target gene copy concentrations in the samples due to suboptimal laboratory performance the availability of reference variability estimations standard deviations and 95 bci values of e coli target gene copy estimates from the laboratories that met the qa criteria for each of the 13 samples that also gave acceptable quantitative data lloq in this study allowed for an assessment of this question as described in sivaganesan et al 2019 and shown in fig 1 results of all sample analyses by laboratory 21 were excluded due to a high standard curve intercept value results shown in table s1 also reveal that this laboratory failed the qa criteria for positive control calibrator samples associated with samples 13 18 it was observed that after excluding these samples the mean e coli target gene copy estimates for 6 of the 7 quantifiable lloq samples remaining from this laboratory were outside of the 95 bci bounds established by the laboratories that passed all qa criteria when using the master standard curve calibration model conversely none of the estimates for these samples were outside of the 95 bci bounds established by the δδct model these results illustrate the primary difference between the two calibration models wherein the ct values from the ec23s857 assay for the calibrator samples from each instrument run are essentially used to adjust the intercept of the master standard curve for that run in the δδct model in this instance the high master standard curve intercept value obtained by laboratory 21 was offset by comparably high calibrator sample ct values in the δδct model which resulted in comparable e coli target gene copy estimates to those of the other laboratories nevertheless results of this nature also may be indicative of subpar sensitivity of the method in this laboratory the qa category responsible for the largest number of failures by far was the positive control calibrator samples ec23s857 and or sketa22 assay results with 65 of all failures being associated with this category as illustrated in fig 1 within this category failures to meet the sketa22 assay acceptance criterion were more common with 80 of the failed sample analyses being associated with this assay as opposed to 50 for the ec23s857 assay 30 failed the criteria for both assays possible reasons for these failures were identified in some instances and are yet to be confirmed in others but could include storage temperatures and numbers of freeze thaw cycles of the salmon dna and cellular e coli control materials holding time between preparation and extraction of positive control calibrator samples and variability in preparing new working stock solutions of sae extraction buffer several laboratories reported an inability to store dna standards and cellular e coli control materials at the recommended temperature of 80 c due to unavailability of an appropriate freezer it is again noteworthy that failures to meet the acceptance criteria established for this qa category often did not equate to extreme e coli target sequence copy estimates from the quantification models in relation to the results of the other laboratories that passed all qa categories for example among the 46 otherwise quantifiable lloq sample analyses that failed this qa category e coli target gene copy estimates were outside of the 95 bci bounds established by the laboratories that passed all qa categories for only 11 24 and 8 17 of these analyses using the master standard curve and δδct calibration models respectively data not shown most of these instances 9 and 6 respectively occurred in a total of just 3 instrument runs by 2 laboratories suggesting that these runs were compromised thus the multi laboratory data available from this study indicated that the proposed qa criteria metrics for positive control calibrator sample results can exclude valid sample analysis results but also showed that these criteria were able to identify compromised instrument runs while further refinements to the proposed qa criteria for positive controls in draft method c should be explored the availability of such criteria are particularly important when as normally would be the case no other option is readily available for objectively assessing day to day laboratory performance of this method the next most common source of failed analyses was presumptive matrix interference based on a previously established acceptance criterion for sketa22 assay results u s epa 2015a 2015b sivaganesan et al 2019 this criterion is designed to assess the suitability of a dna extract for qpcr amplification and is typically not considered an indicator of laboratory performance the highly sporadic and rare occurrence of analysis failures across the laboratories in this qa category fig 1 suggests however that none of the samples truly harbored substances that interfered with qpcr testing instead these failures more likely suggest suboptimal performance of specific analyses possibly caused by operator error in setting up these reactions previous studies have suggested a possible inverse relationship between frequencies of sample matrix interference and the assay amplification efficiency 10 1 master slope 1 haugland et al 2016 but no such relationship was evident in this study the broader question of how diverse ambient surface waters from more widely different geographic locations in michigan and across the entire u s affect the performance of this method has been examined u s epa unpublished data and will be addressed in subsequent reports the last two qa categories considered to be related to laboratory performance negative control samples ec23s857 assay ct values and excessive variability of duplicate ec23s857 assay ct measurements in individual test sample filters were the source of only six failed sample analyses in the entire study all coming from unacceptably low negative control ct values in just one instrument run the conventions described in section 2 5 for applying these criteria in this study at least two of the three replicate filters of each test sample and at least four out of the six analyses of the corresponding negative control samples in each instrument run having to meet the established criteria would not be applicable in other studies where replicate filters of test samples are not analyzed results from this study therefore may be underestimating the potential impact of these two qa categories on frequencies of failed sample analyses in other such studies close inspection of the results shown in fig 2 reveals several rare instances of sample analysis results by individual laboratories that passed all five of the qa categories but still showed atypical mean target sequence copy estimates in relation to the other laboratories the most striking example of this occurred in the analysis results for sample 14 by laboratory 15 where most of the laboratories obtained mean log10 target sequence copy estimates of 3 5 whereas the estimate from this laboratory was global lloq examination of ct measurements from this laboratory revealed that while the six sketa22 assay results for this sample were generally consistent and acceptable following the conventions of this study the ec23s857 assay results were highly variable ct values ranging from 25 87 to non detect or undetermined as indicated by the instrument outputs suggesting operator error in setting up the ec23s857 reactions for this sample such errors could be detected by the variability test for duplicate ec23s857 assay ct measurements if ct values of 40 were assigned to undetermined reactions and also likely would be detected by the duplex internal amplification control iac assay that is available as an option for draft method c but was not employed in this study sivaganesan et al 2019 the lack of extensive prior laboratory experience with qpcr technology appeared to contribute to the overall frequencies of failed analyses based on the five qa categories with the seven laboratories categorized as new in table 1 contributing 48 of the total failed analyses of these seven laboratories however only two were responsible for 39 of the total failures both of these laboratories also exhibited high run to run variability in sketa22 assay ct measurements during preliminary analyses sivaganesan et al 2019 suggesting within lab variability in the preparation of sae buffer working stocks these laboratories in particular will require further assistance before implementing the method the inability of these laboratories to maintain the dna standards and cellular control materials at the recommended 80 c storage temperature also may have contributed to their failed analyses thus the availability of a 80 c freezer ideally with a backup power system may be necessary for laboratories that intend to use qpcr analyses for beach monitoring conversely the qa failure rate among the other five new laboratories was only 9 compared to 19 for the 14 experienced laboratories these results suggest that the training received by these five laboratories on draft method c was beneficial and that additional practice or assistance specifically with method c also may be beneficial for some otherwise more experienced laboratories the current effort by the state of michigan to establish a network of multiple laboratories and personnel with demonstrated proficiency in draft method c gives an example of one approach for providing support to newer laboratories that may be initially struggling with the implementation of a new qpcr method 4 2 calibration models and method variability the design of this study provided an opportunity to directly compare the variability of target gene copy estimates generated by the δδct calibration model used in current epa qpcr methods for enterococci u s epa 2015a b and by a master standard curve model similar to those used in many other qpcr studies sivaganesan et al 2010 since draft method c has not yet been published as an epa method it is conceivable that its final version could incorporate either of these calibration models based on relative performance in minimizing variability and other considerations a demonstration that these models produce similar mean target sequence copy estimates also could be useful for future comparisons of results from this method with those of other epa or non epa qpcr methods that may use different models the results in table 3 and fig 3 show that the total standard deviations and 95 bcis of e coli target gene copy estimates were lower for most sample analyses using the master standard curve model this observation is expected from the standpoint that the repeated ec23s857 assay measurements of the preliminary and run specific calibrator samples introduce additional sources of random and sample preparation related variability into the δδct calibration model that are not included in the master standard curve model day to day or laboratory specific differences in the measurements of run specific calibrator samples by this assay must reflect corresponding differences in the measurements of test samples for the δδct calibration model to overcome its greater inherent potential for variability specific examples where this compensation may have occurred can be seen such as in the laboratory 21 results from this study referred to in section 4 1 however the overall results of this study suggest that this was not normally the case the results in table 3 and fig 3 also show that the mean estimates of e coli target gene copies were higher from the master standard curve model than from δδct calibration model for all sample analyses the mean median and maximum differences among the samples were only 0 054 0 054 and 0 069 log10 copies per reaction respectively based on all accepted laboratory analyses these differences were not significant in relation to the 95 bcis for each of the sample estimates as shown in fig 3 as mentioned in section 2 7 the δδct and standard curve models should agree in theory if the mean ec23s857 assay ct values of the run specific calibrator positive control samples and the initial calibrator samples are the same additional studies using different calibrator cell preparations would be needed to conclude whether the slight differences in target gene copy estimates observed in this study reflect any consistent systematic bias in using one or the other of the two models in this method 4 3 data reporting and comparison of method variability with other qpcr methods and studies several previous studies have employed similar designs to this study in evaluating the inter laboratory variability of other qpcr methods for genetic markers from general or source specific fib in surface waters griffith and weisberg 2006 ebentier et al 2013 kinzelman et al 2013 shanks et al 2012 shanks et al 2016 the differences in the quantitative models data analysis methods and or the reporting of results from those studies largely preclude direct comparisons with the results of this study for example many of the earlier studies modeled and reported fib density estimates as cell equivalents rather than target sequence copy estimates also the scaling of target sequence copy estimates to be expressed on a per water sample volume rather than on a per reaction basis and conversions from original log10 unit estimates from standard curves to arithmetic values are common practices such practices often may be necessary for comparing the results of qpcr methods with those of other methods such as culture or with existing recreational water quality criteria values or when different water sample or dna extract volumes are analyzed however arithmetic qpcr results should be reported as median copies and assessments of the variability of qpcr methods should be reported in the log10 scale on a per reaction basis with information provided about any deviations from the standard sample extraction and analysis volumes of the method the data reporting from this study followed this approach and employed traditional and bayesian statistics to take into account most sources of variability in the quantification models including replicate standards curves from replicate analyses replicate whole cell calibrator samples and analyses when applicable for the δδct calibration model replicate test sample filters and analyses within laboratories and finally variability across laboratories for data analysis of water samples from diverse sites that contained a wide range of e coli cell densities table 2 one common observation from this table 3 and other studies ebentier et al 2013 is that variability between laboratories was consistently the greatest contributor to overall method variability despite this the overall 95 bcis for many of the samples in this study particularly from the master standard curve model were nearly the same as previously reported values of 0 6 from sample analyses by a single laboratory using epa methods 1609 1 and 1611 1 sivaganesan et al 2014 this value of 0 6 log10 copies equating to a two fold target sequence recovery range from the expected values for spiked samples has been used as a benchmark in subsequent studies to evaluate the performance of methods 1609 1 and 1611 1 by multiple laboratories haugland et al 2016 the use of similar study designs and data analysis approaches to those of the present study is recommended for future studies that wish to assess the quantitative variability of qpcr methods for fib in water the variability ranges of log10 gene copy reaction estimates obtained from samples with varying densities of target organisms determined in this study may be useful for evaluating the results of such similarly designed studies of draft method c or other comparable methods 5 conclusions previously established standardized data quality acceptance criteria for five qa categories were used to evaluate the results of 21 laboratories with varying levels of prior experience with qpcr technology in performing draft method c for qpcr analysis of e coli in diverse freshwater recreational waters failures to meet these criteria occurred in 24 of all laboratory sample analyses with the major contributing category being unacceptable e coli and salmon dna spc assay ct values from calibrator positive control samples failures to meet acceptable e coli and salmon dna spc assay ct values for calibrator positive control samples were often not associated with extreme or erroneous e coli target sequence copy estimates in the samples instances of such associations occurred in approximately 20 of the analyses that failed this qa category and primarily in just three instrument runs in the entire study these observations point to the need for these controls and criteria in evaluating the day to day performance of the method by individual laboratories but also suggest that the development of further refinements to the proposed qa criteria for positive controls in draft method c should be explored variations in the percentages of sample analyses meeting all qa criteria among both new and more generally experienced laboratories suggest that further assistance or practice with draft method c may be beneficial for some laboratories in both groups variations in the storage and preparation of reference and control materials particularly by two of the laboratories were suggested to be potentially important factors in contributing to qa failures the master standard curve calibration model produced lower overall variability expressed as standard deviations and 95 bcis in log10 target gene copy estimates than the δδct calibration model in most sample analyses however mean log10 target sequence copy concentration estimates in the sample analyses were not significantly different using these two calibration models and variability between the laboratories was the greatest contributor to the overall variability of the method in either case to the extent to which comparisons were possible the variability of draft method c quantitative estimates in this study appears to be consistent with those from previous studies of other

18922,instrumentation control and automation ica are currently applied throughout the urban water system at water treatment plants in water distribution networks in sewer networks and at wastewater treatment plants however researchers and practitioners specialising in respective urban water sub systems do not frequently interact and in most cases to date the application of ica has been achieved in silo here we review start of the art ica throughout these sub systems and discuss the benefits achieved in terms of performance improvement cost reduction and more importantly the enhanced capacity of the existing infrastructure to cope with increased service demand caused by population growth and continued urbanisation we emphasise the importance of integrated control within each of the sub systems and also across the entire urban water system system wide ica will have increasing importance with the growing complexity of the urban water environment in cities of the future keywords distribution ica iuwm sewer water supply wwtp 1 introduction 1 1 urban water grand challenges population growth urbanisation and climate change are causing major impacts around the world these megatrends present fundamental challenges to the water sector significant changes in water quantity and quality are occurring around the world wmo 2018 lall et al 2018 ipcc 2018 kunkel et al 2018 and more changes are predicted for decades to come oecd 2012 predicted that without any new policies water demand globally will increase by 55 over the years 2012 2050 the main increases in water requirement will be in emerging economies and developing countries the rise in demand for manufacturing electricity production and domestic use are predicted to increase by 400 140 and 130 respectively the demand for water for irrigation is also expected to increase substantially fao 2018 projects that feeding a world population of 9 billion people in 2050 would require raising overall food production by some 60 over the years 2018 2050 production in developing countries would need to almost double in the face of these competing needs water scarcity already affects more than 40 people in the world a proportion predicted to reach around 65 by 2050 fao 2018 consequently there will be increasing competition for freshwater in the near future there is an urgent need for more water sources and for improved efficiency of water use it also must be acknowledged that around 80 of population growth will take place in urban areas which will create a herculean challenge for urban water management in addition to population growth and urbanisation urban water services also face the challenges caused by climate change including temperature rise changed precipitation patterns and extreme weather conditions current water infrastructure is typically designed based on historical climate and environmental conditions how to operate such infrastructure in the wake of on going climate change is a critical question requiring complex answers similarly how new infrastructure should be designed and operated requires a new way of thinking the new design and operational strategies must account for changing climate conditions in order to reduce future risks to urban water management typically to overcome a lack of water supply we look for water sources which are often less accessible e g remotely sourced or from deep groundwater with substantially increased costs and environmental impact it is becoming clear that future cities must apply integrated solutions and manage the whole urban water cycle future water services will require the integrated use of multiple water sources such as surface waters recycled water stormwater and seawater there is also a trend towards a hybrid structure involving water production and wastewater treatment at both centralised and decentralised scales jones and olsson 2017 fit for purpose water production will also become more important as different water uses do not necessarily require the same water quality these strategies add another level of complexity to the already complex urban water system 1 2 ica in urban water systems an urban water system consists of several sub systems including catchments for water collection and storage water treatment plants water distribution systems domestic and industrial water consumption wastewater collection and treatment systems stormwater collection and retention treatment systems and receiving waters the recycling of wastewater and harvesting of stormwater at multiple scales are recent augmentations to urban water systems instrumentation control and automation ica is currently widespread in water and wastewater treatment plants ica attracted the attention of the water and wastewater industry in the early 1970s because many operators recognised that while treatment plants were designed for average loads the true load varies significantly over time olsson et al 1973 olsson 2012 therefore to date the primary function of ica has been to keep treatment systems running efficiently achieving the desired performance at an affordable cost in the presence of large fluctuations in loading olsson et al 2005 in recent years there has been a greater emphasis on the use of ica to improve the capacity of existing systems to cope with increased loading caused by population increase and urban growth in this case the use of ica defers the need for infrastructure upgrade which typically requires substantial capital investment such opportunities are available because conventional planning for increased drinking water demand and wastewater services involved designing the treatment plants to handle a sufficiently large volume as a result existing infrastructure has additional capacity to cope with higher average loads provided that there are proper methods to deal with the peak loads in this context ica can help attenuate the load temporarily shift the operational targets and temporarily or even permanently reduce the load notably most of the control systems used today focus on individual units in a sub system at most covering several process units in a sub system integrated control of multiple sub systems is still rare with the exception of combined sewer overflow control for the benefit of receiving water quality benedetti et al 2013 widening the perspective from individual processes to sub systems and then to the entire urban system is necessary considering the increasing complexity of urban water systems rodriguez roda et al 2002 contributed to this school of thought over a decade ago this transition requires systems thinking where the multitude of couplings between processes and individual controllers are considered beck 2005 all systems and components in the urban water cycle from the water source to the receiving water are parts of a whole system ica is considered an enabling technology for integrated urban water management the rapid development of sensors instruments and communication systems enables real time data collection from a wide range of process units across the entire urban water system while more powerful computers and advanced data analytics support system level optimisation achieving global rather than local optimum olsson 2012 however system wide ica is still in the early stages of development in this paper we review the current state of ica application in various components of the urban water system with a particular focus on the roles of ica in increasing the capacity of existing infrastructure to cope with future needs i e in sweating the assets we also identify and discuss new opportunities for ica including iot internet of things in the context of integrated urban water management 2 control architecture and methodology and hierarchy in an urban water system control systems consist of four key components the process the measurement the decision making and the implementation fig 1 presents a conceptual view of a simple feedback and a simple feedforward control system feedback control fig 1 upper is a powerful concept it can stabilise unstable systems and improve the reliability of poorly performing components the controller senses the operative state of a system compares it against a desired response computes corrective actions sometimes based on a model of the system s response to external inputs and actuates the system to effect the desired change this basic feedback loop of sensing computation and actuation is the central concept in control and this conceptual view is applicable to any processes alternatively feedforward compensation fig 1 lower is where we measure the disturbances and take anticipatory actions to compensate or cancel out the effects of the disturbance an example of feedforward control is measuring a concentration or a flow rate deviation upstream of a wastewater treatment plant and then correcting the plant operation to eliminate the consequence of the deviation however models are needed to determine how much compensation is required feedforward control is normally used for a fast anticipatory response while feedback control takes care of model inaccuracies in the compensation as well as unmeasured disturbances in an urban water system the aforementioned basic control concepts can be applied at multiple levels namely equipment level this involves controlling the actuators including pumps compressors valves and motors control at this level is not unique for water operations and is applied in all process industries however at this level the operation is limited in many water systems often the designer does diligent work in static design but leaves too little flexibility to manipulate the system to handle significant disturbances kukudis 1973 stated at the first ica conference arranged by iawprc predecessor of iwa even if we had the most sophisticated automated plant in existence it still would not be able to operate at maximum efficiency because the designs of wastewater treatment plants are based on uniform combined sewer flow without consideration for periodic intensity due to storm flow or periodic lows during dry weather spells or hours of least demand so much of the time the flow into the plant is either above or below the maximum efficiency level unit process level once the basic operations are functioning attention can be paid to the various unit processes usually controllers at this level are relatively simple i e based on one sensor and influencing one actuator the primary focus is to satisfy effluent quality requirements once regulatory constraints are satisfied operations can be optimised with respect to resource utilisation such as energy and chemicals sub system level in order to better utilise resources it is necessary to apply sub system wide perspective there are sequential couplings between various process units within a sub system this means that actions taken at a process unit will often affect downstream units in the case of a wastewater treatment plant recirculation also occurs between process units e g between secondary settlers and bioreactors which further complicates unit level control therefore it is necessary to apply a plant wide perspective and to implement integrated control of multiple process units to achieve plant wide optimisation entire urban water system level the goal to operate the complete water cycle as one system under one organisation is not new beck 1976 one good example for integrated control of multiple sub systems is the connectivity of a sewer system and a wastewater treatment plant wwtp with water quality in the receiving water body as the control objective in such a case the influent flow to the wwtp is no longer an uncontrollable disturbance but an internal variable of the combined system measurements and control in the sewer will obviously have a profound impact on the operation of the wwtp the final test of the accomplishment of integrated sewer and wwtp control is the receiving water quality feedback from measurements of the receiving water quality should guide operation of the upstream sub systems a natural consequence of integration is that each sub system cannot be optimised individually instead there must be compromises in the operation of each sub system in order to achieve the best for the whole system schütze et al 1999 olsson and newell 1999 ch 20 this is not an easy task and involves a lot of non technical issues related to governance and individual operator responsibility why should i run my unit process at a sub optimal level in order to help the other parts of the system i do not want to be blamed for low performance the principles of feedback and feedforward control are applicable all the way up to high level strategic decisions the framework is always the same whereas the measurements the analyses and the decisions are different hence it is vital to understand this way of thinking in order for utilities to become smarter more robust resilient efficient effective and most importantly more sustainable ingildsen and olsson 2016 to maximise the capacity of urban water systems it will be important to systematically address challenges and opportunities of control such as translating the general goal of protecting the urban and natural environment into operational goals of urban water system control meeting the need for information with sensors sensors will provide a huge amount of online information about operations from real time basic equipment function to sophisticated water quality analysis on a slower timescale utilising the rich spectrum of analytical methods and computing tools to analyse raw data for interpretation into reliable and useful information that can form the basis for decisions developing sufficient control authority control methods can handle all possible operational challenges that appear in water supply and wastewater treatment systems can the controllability be increased by installing more actuators developing flexible actuator hardware that translates decisions into real actions in the urban water system and building an information management system with connectivity to sensors control computers actuators and people it is important to acknowledge the role of people in the control systems outlined previously particularly at upper levels forming human in the loop hitl control systems in this case the machine system serves to collect and transmit data provide early warning and analyse the data to provide information to operators managers who make the operational management decisions to be implemented through the control system the feedback and feedforward principles are still the underpinning methodology with the rapid development of machine learning and artificial intelligence humans may eventually be replaced by machines in this complex decision making process this will be further discussed in section 6 in any case systems thinking is the key to integrated urban water management beck 2005 the tasks described are a challenge for control and systems engineers and due to the truly cross disciplinary nature will also influence urban planners architects civil electrical chemical and mechanical engineers as well as non technical specialists in human and social systems it should be noted that water has been recognised as a crucial topic for electrical engineers by ieee the institute of electrical and electronics engineers and for mechanical engineers by asme the american society of mechanical engineers water is certainly a topic not only for water professionals however we water professionals must reach out and try to understand what we can expect from other specialists in order to solve the water system challenges 3 ica in water supply systems water supply systems are large and complex requiring significant economic investment for construction maintenance and operation therefore in the last few decades many researchers have focused on the optimisation of these systems including minimising energy requirements early detection and localization of leaks and meeting customer demand at minimum cost the optimisation of water distribution systems wds have become even more important recently as increasing water demand and dwindling available sources due to climate change cause additional stress on wds it is imperative to find the best solutions able to meet service requirements with the minimum economic and environmental impact the following sections highlight the benefits and possibilities in application of ica to manage water supply systems in particular for water treatment processes for the design and operation of wds for the detection of leaks and for customer water demand management 3 1 ica in drinking water treatment plants in recent decades most drinking water treatment plants dwtps have been automated for consistent operation the use of automated operation increases objectivity and alleviates the problem of variable and contradictory heuristics between operating personnel olsson et al 2003 however for the first automation projects the goal was to operate the dwtps in the same manner as human operators therefore the configurations consisted of a heuristic control strategy based on historical operator experience there is currently a shift in the operation of dwtps from experience based to knowledge based driven by the actual state of the plant the use of feedforward and feedback control in various units in dwtps enhances the water quality as well as reduces the operational costs for example van schagen et al 2010 developed a design method for the control of dwtps which focuses on disturbance identification and using control to take known disturbances into account using this design method chemical usage was reduced by 15 in the softening treatment step thereby also reducing the maintenance effort the previously existing control was deduced from steady state calculations but when taking into account dynamic disturbances such as changing water temperature the steady state optimum was not achieved the new design method focuses on disturbance rejection keeping the process condition close to optimum coagulation followed by separation is one of the most important treatment processes for drinking water treatment worldwide several million tons of metal salts al or febased coagulants are used annually for water and wastewater treatment costing multiple billions of us dollars pa ratnaweera and fettig 2015 the on line control of coagulant dosing in water treatment has been extensively studied as reviewed in dentel 1991 ratnaweera 2014 and ratnaweera and fettig 2015 feedforward control with chemical dosing rate determined based on the measurements of feedwater flow rate and feed water quality e g turbidity ph conductivity and temperature in some cases is the most commonly used approach this is typically done by establishing an empirical relationship between the dosing rate and the flowrate and feedwater quality parameters based on operational or experimental data the relationship is subsequently used to calculate the dosing rates on line based on real time measurements of water quantity and quality parameters the feedforward controllers are in some cases augmented by feedback loops with controlled variables being water quality parameters of the coagulant dosed water or finished water e g streaming current ph turbidity and size shape and strength of flocs formed after coagulation full scale demonstration of a feedforward feedback algorithm delivered better water qualities compared with the feedforward only controller although chemical consumption was not reduced liu and ratnaweera 2016 it was showed however savings in chemical consumption of 3 7 15 5 could have been achieved if the control objective was only to avoid over dosage rather than to also simultaneously improve water quality coagulant dosing control in ultrafiltration uf which is often used prior to reverse osmosis for solids and organic matter removal has also been studied recently with the aim of reducing the uf membrane fouling gao et al 2017 presented a dosing controller that relied on real time tracking of cycle to cycle uf resistance after each backwashing the so called pb resistance the controller increased or decreased the coagulant dose depending on improvements in the cycle to cycle change in uf pb resistance the controller was implemented and field demonstrated on a pilot seawater desalination plant 18 000 gpd and shown to achieve lower pb resistance with reduced chemical dosing chew et al 2018 developed controllers to automatically adjust the filtration and backwashing time of a dead end uf to enhance its efficiency an artificial neural network ann predictive model was used to estimate specific cake resistance using transmembrane pressure and turbidity data the model prediction was subsequently utilized by two ann controllers to control filtration and backwash durations the water loss due to backwash was significantly reduced compared with a case with constant filtration and backwash durations due to increased filtration time in addition to achieving improved water quality and reduced operational costs ica has been used to level the production demand for dwtps in a survey conducted in the netherlands in 2011 involving all ten dutch water supply companies it was found that 57 of the total production flow was controlled by model predictive flow control the other 43 of production flow was controlled by level based flow control table 1 to compare the performance of level based with model based production control bakker et al 2013 switched off model based production control at five treatment plants for one week and compared plant performance with and without model based control in the level based control loop the production flow set point was directly related to the level in the reservoir the production flow set point increases decreases with the water level in the reservoir fig 2 a model predictive flow control algorithm consists of a short term water demand forecasting algorithm and a control algorithm for the production flow control the forecasting horizon is typically 24 48 h bakker et al 2003 the control algorithm calculates the production flow set point that matches the forecasted demand on the condition that the level in the reservoir stays between a chosen upper and lower limit with this method the water production was stabilised at approximately 2 000 m3 day throughout the day fig 2 as opposed to varying between 1 000 and 4000 m3 day without the forecasting facility this implies that with advanced model predictive control to attenuate the variation the treatment plant has the capacity to meet a much higher average water demand caused by for example population growth in addition to production capacity increase bakker et al 2013 also showed that the model predictive control led to better water quality and higher energy efficiency production variation was 3 8 times lower turbidity values were 12 28 lower particle volume values were 12 42 lower overall energy consumption was 1 0 5 3 lower overall energy costs were 1 7 7 4 lower the increased use of soft sensors in water treatment is worth highlighting soft sensors are computer models that calculate estimates of variables that are difficult to measure directly the estimates are based on other variables that can be more easily and or more frequently measured van schagen et al 2008 rietveld et al 2010 wuister et al 2012 and worm et al 2013 showed that quality improvements can be achieved by monitoring treatment processes using soft sensors for example the direct measurement of water quality for process optimisation is difficult changes in water quality often test the accuracy of the measurement device however water quality can be estimated using physical parameters such as pressure flow and valve position simple chemical parameters such as redox and conductivity and accurate models the mathematical models that can be used vary from white box models to grey box models if white box models are available the modelling effort for application in a new treatment plant is minimal the white box model can then be used to determine measurement accuracy directly without model calibration applying grey box models makes it possible to acquire more information from the plant data even without knowing the exact processes that are taking place moreover less modelling effort is required in comparison to back box modelling before the model can be applied to real process data however black box models are partly data driven and application is more plant specific than using a white box model 3 2 water distribution system optimisation water distribution systems wds comprise a set of pipes pumps valves and tanks arranged together to deliver water of suitable quality from the water source or sources to the final users wds are designed to guarantee a satisfactory level of service for a set of normal and abnormal operating conditions a typical operational challenge is the optimisation of pump operations which consists of finding a set of controls that minimises pumping costs while also meeting the system requirements the pump optimisation problem has been well studied in the literature using different formulations these include for example minimisation of cost lópez ibáñez et al 2008 minimisation of cost and number of pump switches savić et al 1997 and minimisation of cost and greenhouse gas emissions stokes et al 2015 various optimisation algorithms have been used including linear programming jowitt and germanopoulos 1992 non linear programming rastogi 1989 dynamic programming zessler and shamir 1989 genetic algorithm savić et al 1997 and ant colony optimization algorithm lópez ibáñez et al 2008 the optimisation of wds operation can potentially result in large savings the electric power research institute epri 2002 estimated that electricity costs for treatment and distribution are approximately 80 of the cost of municipal water processing and distribution this energy accounts for about 4 of the u s power generation in california 19 of the state s electricity is used to satisfy the energy requirements of water related uses california energy commission 2005 it should be noted however the majority of this energy is used by the customer for heating water and statistics from various countries show that more than 90 of water related energy use is in the home doe 2001 reffold et al 2008 kenway et al 2011 olsson 2015 despite extensive research on water related energy consumption and costs the application of energy and cost saving measures is still limited because often only a 24 h operational period is optimised given the variability in water demand applying the optimal pump regime developed for a specific period may result in failures or in sub optimal operation for other demand conditions to overcome these issues research is moving towards near real time control of pump operations where ica is fundamental salomons et al 2007 were the first in outlining the 3 step process 1 a tool e g an artificial neural network to predict the daily demands is required 2 the wds hydraulic model with the forecasted demands is optimised and 3 the optimal pump regime is implemented measurement of the system characteristics e g pressures and tank levels are used to verify the predicted network behaviour and to initialise the next period of the optimisation supervisory control and data acquisition scada facilities are required for monitoring the network sending the data to the control centre and remotely implementing the optimal pump regime using recorded data salomons et al 2007 estimated an annual saving of 25 in energy costs for the haifa a case study in israel using the same methodology martinez et al 2007 showed that costs could be reduced by 18 for wds operation in valencia spain cost savings within a similar range were also predicted for a medium sized water transmission system in seoul south korea jung et al 2015 in order to save computational time and efficiently determine the optimal pump regime odan et al 2014 replaced the wds hydraulic model with a meta model based on an artificial neural network algorithm savings of approximately 16 were predicted in applying this methodology to a wds in brazil implementation of optimised real time control of pump operations was described by ganidi and holden 2014 after a first phase in which the optimisation model was tested off line a semi automated version was incorporated into the operational routine the telemetry data were uploaded automatically and the pump schedule was generated in an automated way however implementation of the pump schedule remained a manual process during this second phase 97 1 of all pump schedules were successful while 1 7 needed to be optimised again the remaining 1 2 failures were related to it and telemetry issues the conservative estimate of the savings carried out during the off line phase of the project was a 3 4 reduction in costs which corresponded to 217 000 year and 787 mwh year equivalent to a reduction of 428 tonco2 eq year in greenhouse gas emissions ganidi and holden 2014 demonstrated that real time control could be successfully applied to full scale wds however for the correct operation of the system the authors highlighted the importance of the quality and quantity of the measurements and that a shorter scheduling period 3 h instead of 12 h decreased the failure rate thus to improve the reliability of ica practical applications require faster optimisation algorithms other aspects of wds can also benefit from ica at a basic level instrumentation can be used to quantify parameters such as pressure and flow which can help monitor the system while off line data data that is collected and analysed at a later time is still beneficial for wds management analysing real time data can shorten the detection times of anomalies such as water leakages component malfunctioning and water thefts and reduce water and energy wastage and associated costs stoianov et al 2007 armon et al 2011 mounce et al 2010 measurements and therefore instrumentation are necessary to calibrate a wds hydraulic model e g salomons et al 2007 broad et al 2010 gibbs et al 2010 which can then be used to simulate the consequences of changes in the layout or operation of the network components the only full scale example known to the authors where measurements from wds sensors are automatically used to calibrate the hydraulic model is the wireless water sentinel in singapore allen et al 2011 this system allows modifications to the network to be automatically incorporated into the model so that engineers can assess the performance of the wds in real time ideally this could also be used to automatically modify the normal operation of the system in order to improve the service to the users well calibrated hydraulic models and good data are important in the expansion of existing wds where the design of the new part should take into account the existing parts in order to minimise the whole of life costs the minimisation of capital and operational costs has been investigated previously e g farmani et al 2006 wu et al 2010a but it is less commonly reported for complex case studies sa eea south australian engineering excellence awards 2010 brought to light an application of ica to deliver water from a desalination plant to the metropolitan area of adelaide south australia in this case the contribution of ica to the wds design was limited to model calibration however depending on the characteristics of the network it may have been possible to avoid the capital cost of system augmentation by controlling valves and pumps in real time this option although interesting is difficult to explore because of the uncertainty of water demand the numerous requirements associated with wds and the uniqueness of each case 3 3 leakage detection in water distribution systems leak management in wds is a significant problem worldwide water utilities lose a considerable amount of treated water due to leaks particularly in ageing water infrastructure for example the energy and water department of the world bank estimated that the total global annual cost of leakage to utility companies was approximately us 14 billion comprising 48 billion m3 of wasted treated water with a third of this occurring in developing nations kingdom et al 2006 in western australia it is estimated that 30 billion litres 8 4 of all water supplied was lost to pipeline leakage in 2012 13 oag 2014 australia s national performance report on urban water utilities for 2012 13 reports median real losses of 79 l c d litres connection day with outliers as high as 416 l c d for some utilities nwc 2014 in the united states an estimated 7 000 km of pipe requires replacement each year at a cost of us 2 7 billion while water losses estimated to be 10 are valued at us 4 3 billion per year whittle et al 2013 the challenge of leak mitigation requires a water entity to predict the size and location of leaks in a wds given measurements such as flows at certain locations pipe materials and age or acoustic measurements leak quantification is one part of the broader task of managing water losses in distribution networks by assessing detecting and controlling losses puust et al 2010 the main challenge of leak detection is to obtain reliable evidence on the size and location of leaks at a reasonable cost for equipment and effort leak detection methods fall into three categories based on the data source 1 data obtained outside the distribution network 2 data from sensors brought into the network at certain times and 3 data from a permanent network of sensors methods for the first two categories are well established fanner 2007 farley and trow 2005 farley 2010 puust et al 2010 mutikanga et al 2013 the third category is a novel approach for water distribution systems made possible by new sensor technologies at lower cost and improved telemetry shiddiqi et al 2018 decisions on the approach of choice for leakage reduction are ultimately cost driven although informed by governance regulations nwc 2014 fanner 2007 water utilities need to establish strategies that balance the cost of water with the cost of leak reduction for their own unique circumstances several low cost approaches exist for leak management managing water pressure throughout the network is a commonly used proactive method because leakage volume is positively related to network pressure maintaining network pressure as low as possible while still satisfying customer demand is a cost effective strategy for leak reduction puust et al 2010 fanner 2007 another low cost strategy is purely reactive i e water utilities respond to and repair leaks when they are reported by the public or staff fanner 2007 minimising the response time for repairing these reported leaks reduces water losses condition based maintenance methods use historical data to find correlations between pipe failure rates and factors such as pipe material climate and soil parameters this information can be used to prioritise pipe replacements before leaks occur pratt 2011 step testing is a top down method used since the 1980s for leak detection it subdivides a network by closing valves during minimum night flow to create district metered areas dmas flow meters are then used to measure the water balance within a district and this indicates the size of leaks in a locality farley 2010 to pinpoint the position of the leak acoustic logging ultrasonic sensing ground motion sensors or ground penetrating radar can be used puust et al 2010 leak noise correlation uses two microphones in contact with a pipe or valve stem on either side of the leak it can detect a leak position to within 1 m and is most effective for clean small diameter metal pipes in high water pressure areas puust et al 2010 but not suitable for plastic pipes a network of permanent sensors can be used to monitor pipeline distribution systems continuously in order to detect anomalies such as leaks shiddiqi et al 2018 recent developments of new types of sensors with lower costs and better telemetry are making this approach more reliable and cost effective examples of new sensor technologies include ultrasonic and electromagnetic flow meters and flow meters that can be inserted directly into a pipe farley 2010 sensor network leak detection uses a combination of sensed field measurements from the network hydraulic models and machine learning algorithms leak detection can be posed as an inverse problem system characteristics such as flows in pipes pipe length network topology and pipe diameters are known while leak size and location are unknown pudar and liggett 1992 solving a system of non linear hydraulic modelling equations for the unknowns enables leak predictions to be made sensor networks provide current flow information for predicting leaks in an early study de silva et al 2011 used a machine learning algorithm to train a support vector machine as the classifier for leak size and location based on pressure measurements in the network however they reported low accuracy for their classifier the epanet hydraulic model has been combined with a rule learning algorithm to generate human readable prediction rules for quantifying leaks cardell oliver et al 2015 leak signatures can be used to optimise the placement of a limited number of sensors shiddiqi et al 2017 these methods allow for measurement uncertainty and can optimise the number and placement of flow sensors allowing trade offs to be made between prediction accuracy and network cost wu et al 2010b used a genetic algorithm to determine the hydraulic model that gives the best explanation of leak position and size to account for known pressure and flow values in a pipeline network possible areas of water loss were narrowed down under low flow rate conditions but the model could not identify the size of leaks or their precise location only a few studies have reported industry trials of leak detection methods the waterwise project in singapore has tested real time monitoring of a wds using a wireless sensor network and a suite of decision making algorithms whittle et al 2013 with a focus on minimising cost the system can detect and locate burst leaks and monitor hydraulic parameters burst detection is performed using transient pressure signals triangulated from relative time difference of arrival measurements from network sensors the intelligent water network of victoria australia reported practical field trials of several sensor technologies the trials showed that flow sensors and acoustic sensors are more effective than pressure sensors for identifying small leaks teo 2012 leak detection using permanent sensor networks is a promising approach but there are many open research problems research is needed to address the multi objective problem of trade offs between leak detection accuracy and the type and placement of sensors emphasis should be placed on establishing design principles for new infrastructure to facilitate leak detection as is now common for dmas farley 2010 practical demonstrations of novel sensing technologies and techniques as reported by teo 2012 and whittle et al 2013 are needed in order for industry to adopt new leak detection methods 3 4 smart metering for customer water demand management water conservation targets such as a 15 demand reduction by 2030 water corporation of western australia 2009 are common in the water industry achieving these targets requires a detailed understanding of the patterns of water use that affect demand smart metering is a key emerging technology for discovering usage patterns that are needed for customer demand management data for this task is provided by smart meters that record end user consumption automatically each hour or more often and report it daily data mining methods are then applied for analysis of this data data mining can be used to answer four types of questions 1 explore e g what patterns of water use occur for a given population 2 explain e g how is water used during summer months when does highest water use occur 3 predict e g based on past history how much water will a certain individual use next week at what times and 4 plan e g how do current trends in water use inform future infrastructure planning several commonly used computer based methods that can transform data into useful information are reviewed in corominas et al 2018 customer demand has been studied using different types of water meter data low medium or high resolution low resolution data reports annual quarterly or monthly water consumption medium resolution has a period of one or more hours and high resolution has a period of seconds or minutes low resolution data has been used to correlate consumption with possible influencing factors including dwelling characteristics socio demographic attributes attitudes and beliefs and policy levers corral verdugo et al 2002 grafton et al 2011 fox et al 2009 syme et al 2004 jorgensen et al 2009 medium resolution data for large populations has only recently become widely available as water utilities deploy smart meters on a large scale cardell oliver 2013 cardell oliver et al 2016 there are only a few studies of pattern discovery in medium resolution data britton et al 2008 use smart meter data to identify customer side leaks and to inform a customer intervention program more generally water use signature patterns have been proposed to characterise leaks ad hoc and periodic usage patterns and their significance for individuals and for large populations cardell oliver 2013 high resolution data can be used to train a recognition system to identify human activities such as flushing a toilet taking a shower or running the dishwasher willis et al 2013 beal et al 2011 each of these activities is associated with a continuous subsequence of high resolution meter readings human experts label examples of these activities as they occur in a training set of smart meter readings for each user machine learning algorithms are then used to create an automatic software program that recognizes the same classes of activities in unlabelled meter data this training process is labour intensive and so current techniques are not suitable for analysing large populations nguyen et al 2013 another drawback is that only activities that have been identified by the trainer are recognised unknown unknowns in the data remain hidden for example relatively rare activities such as garden watering can play a significant role in overall water use but are challenging to recognize as activity sequences particularly when activities overlap one another the business case for smart metering can be difficult to quantify especially in the short term since the current cost of smart meters is relatively high compared with the price of water and achievable demand reductions apart from these costs recent industry studies have shown that effective customer engagement is critical for realising the benefits of smart metering atkinson and medbury 2013 devitt 2014 a significant economic benefit of reducing consumption can be the delay of capital infrastructure upgrades delays are beneficial because the cost of capital interest redemption and depreciation is typically a high contributor to water utility business costs for example one study estimated that a reduction of 10 in peak daily demand in the dry season could extend the life of a current treatment plant by 4 years devitt 2014 other benefits of smart metering include lower occupational health and safety costs related to automated versus manual collection of data and increased metering accuracy another important factor is to integrate smart metering insights into existing operations workflows to build trust and confidence for the end users patabendige et al 2018 automated pattern discovery in water use offers many opportunities for improving customer demand management research is needed on approaches that support more nuanced evidence based decision making for water conservation for example for large populations automatic methods are needed that combine data from water meters with contextual information such as climate data and customer demographics pattern discovery at the population level is also an area that promises significant efficiency gains for example segmentation of users with inefficient consumption habits can be used to prioritize customer engagement campaigns smart metering is a key technology for achieving these goals 4 ica in wastewater systems for many decades ica has been applied to wastewater systems consisting of sewer networks and wwtps initially control was limited to hydraulic processes but since the latter part of the last century control has been extended to biological and chemical treatment processes most of the conventional control systems are unit process oriented with the aim to enhance treatment performance leading to improved effluent quality and reduced energy and chemical consumption however there has been an increasing trend in recent years to design control systems that consider multiple units in the plant to achieve plant wide control and in some cases to control the entire wastewater system comprising sewers and treatment plants the use of ica for improving the capacity of wastewater systems to handle increased loading has also attracted considerable attention in the past decade the use of ica for the operation and management of wastewater systems will increase in coming years due to push and pull forces pull forces include continued population growth and urbanisation leading to increased wastewater load a continued increase in the complexity of wastewater treatment plant function and capability e g wwtps are now often called resource recovery facilities wrf and extreme weather conditions associated with climate change several technology push forces will make ica increasingly economical to implement with concomitant computational and instrumentation improvements there is an interesting trend towards smart sensors with multiple detectors and transmission abilities which can be placed anywhere in the process train actuators mostly variable speed drives for pumps and compressors make control much more flexible control theory and practice today can offer almost anything that the water operator would need 4 1 ica in wastewater treatment plants the control of unit processes in a wwtp is relatively mature some examples of state of the art unit process control include dissolved oxygen do control with a constant or a variable set point as part of the aerator unit process operation variation in the do set point is typically guided by nitrogen removal performance monitored with nutrient sensors aeration phase length control in alternating plants based on nutrients do ph or oxidation reduction potential orp measurements nitrate recirculation control in a pre denitrification plant based on nitrate and do measurements in the aerobic and anoxic zones external carbon dosage control based on nitrate measurement in the anoxic zone srt solids retention time control based on sludge inventory using turbidity data return activated sludge flow control based on proportional to the influent flow rate step feed control based on influent flow to limit sludge overloading of secondary clarifiers control of anaerobic processes aimed at stabilizing the process and maximizing the biogas production and chemical precipitation control based on local measurements of phosphate concentration it has been demonstrated that ica can increase the capacity of biological nutrient removal plants by 10 30 with further understanding and exploitation of the relationship between operational parameters and the microbial population dynamics and biochemical reactions combined with increased maturity of advanced online sensors the improvements offered by ica will likely be greater than 30 within the next 10 20 years comprehensive reviews of these control systems can be found in olsson et al 2005 2014 and olsson 2008 2012 a review of literature comparing different control structures for aeration is found in åmand et al 2013 and several lessons from full scale implementations of aeration control are documented in åmand et al 2014 ammonia based control can lead to energy savings through limiting aeration as well as reducing effluent ammonia peaks rieger et al 2014 over the years the function of a wastewater treatment plant has evolved from cod chemical oxygen demand removal only to cod and nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus removal and further to resource water energy and nutrients recovery consequently the complexity of a wastewater treatment plant has increased substantially with strong interactions among different process units such interactions represent both challenges and opportunities for ica interaction between different parts of the treatment plant can cause unintentional disturbances for example a sudden release of nitrogen rich sludge supernatant from an anaerobic digester back to the influent of the wastewater treatment plant will cause an unnecessary overload of the plant if it happens during the high load periods of the day fig 3 shows how the oxygen uptake rate increases significantly as the supernatant is recycled within the plant the controlled release of such streams during low load periods will beneficially attenuate the disturbance the interaction between different parts of the treatment plant can be positively exploited through integrated control or plant wide control to derive additional benefits for example the bioenergy recovery from waste activated sludge can be enhanced by controlling the sludge age in the secondary treatment to a level just allowing full nitrification this is because a relatively young sludge is more biodegradable giving a higher yield for bioenergy recovery this aim can be achieved through sludge retention time control olsson et al 2005 integrated control will be a key focus of control design in the coming years such an approach is expected to not only deliver benefits in terms of treatment efficiency and costs but also enhance the ability of a plant to cope with increased loading thus deferring plant upgrades one good example is the well known aeration tank settling technology nielsen et al 2000 during a storm event the flow to a wwtp is expected to increase by several fold this is the case even for separate sanitary sewers the hydraulic capacity of a wwtp is typically limited by its secondary settler as the solids loading to the settler during a high flow period can exceed its capacity nielsen et al 2000 proposed to switch off aeration and mixing in the last part of the aerobic reactor which feeds into the settler a few hours prior to the arrival of the stormwater the activated sludge settles in the reactor reducing the solids loading to the settler and the amount of solids to be buffered in the settler this significantly increases the hydraulic capacity of the plant which is highly desirable for plants operated in an era of climate change and extreme weather conditions sharma et al 2013 the paradigm shift from wastewater treatment to resource recovery is also leading to the development of novel processes in conventional wwtps energy contained in organic carbon is not recovered rather organic carbon is used to support denitrification or removed by aerobic processes that require much energy input the a b process has recently been applied at full scale with the aim to minimise aerobic oxidation of organic carbon and to enhance bioenergy recovery in this process the organic carbon in wastewater is firstly absorbed or bio assimilated by the activated sludge in the a stage the energy rich activated sludge is then passed on to the anaerobic digester for the production of methane as a renewable energy as a large fraction of the organic carbon has been removed from the wastewater in the a stage the b stage requires much less aeration hence less energy consumption in comparison to a conventional one sludge system as a result the aeration requirement is reduced in the a b process and a larger fraction of organic carbon compared to conventional activated sludge processes is converted to biogas in an anaerobic digester supported by this technology two municipal wastewater treatment plants in austria strass and wolfgangsee ischl treatment plants are achieving energy self sufficiency and also feeding surplus electrical energy from the plant to grid nowak et al 2011 however the organic carbon used for energy production in the a b process is no longer available for achieving a high level of nitrogen removal by conventional means consequently nitrogen removal processes with a lower carbon demand such as the shortcut process nitritation followed by denitritation are needed the ground breaking discovery in the early 1990s of unique microorganisms which carry out anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox potentially provides an alternative more attractive solution to the problem associated with the a b process anammox bacteria have the unique metabolic ability to combine ammonium and nitrite to form nitrogen gas strous et al 1999 through a partnership between ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and anammox bacteria completely autotrophic nitrogen removal via nitrite is possible aob consume a limited amount of oxygen to partially oxidise ammonia to nitrite while anammox bacteria convert residual ammonia and nitrite into nitrogen gas under anoxic conditions these novel process designs pose control challenges firstly the a stage should be operated such that a maximum amount of cod is absorbed adsorbed bio assimilated thus making more carbon available for bio energy recovery the manipulatable variables in an a stage process are similar to those in a conventional activated sludge process namely aeration sludge wastage flow and sludge return flow miller et al 2017 however the control objectives are different in a conventional activated sludge process the effluent cod and tss total suspended solids concentrations should be kept below their respective discharge limit in comparison there are no similar strict limits for the a stage effluent although lower levels of cod and tss in the a stage effluent are desirable when autotrophic nitrogen removal is employed in the b stage another important goal is that the mineralized carbon i e converted to co2 in the a stage should be minimised to enable maximum bioenergy recovery miller et al 2017 employed a cascade controller with an airflow feedback loop being the slave controller to control do dissolved oxygen at pre selected set points no obvious correlation between cod removal and do was observed in general the impact of do on the fate of organic carbon in the a stage reactor is not fully understood at present as cod removal in such a reactor involves multiple mechanisms including absorption adsorption bio assimilation as cells or extracellular polymeric substances and mineralization kinyua et al 2017 do level also affects sludge settleability and hence the effluent tss and vss volatile suspended solids levels more research is required to fully understand these effects before appropriate do set points can be identified miller et al 2017 trialled two controllers for the manipulation of the waste activated sludge flow one aimed to control srt at a set point by also considering sludge loss via the effluent different from a conventional activated sludge process where tss in secondary effluent can typically be neglected in srt control tss in the a stage effluent has a much higher concentration and thus a much higher impact on srt the srt controller therefore required not only an mlss mixed liquor suspended solids sensor in the bioreactor but also a tss sensor to measure the effluent this design failed as the controller was very sensitive to the accuracy of the sensors the other controller aimed to keep the mlss concentration in the a stage bioreactor at a constant level which was reported to be successful in the pilot plant study however the applicability of such a controller in practice is in question as mlss is sensitive to the influent flow and composition which vary substantially in full scale plants it makes little sense to keep a constant mlss level by increasing the wastage flow in a period when more cod is to be removed in a high load period possibly requiring more biomass or vice versa the control of returned activated sludge in an a stage system is similar to that in a conventional system i e to have it paced with influent miller et al 2017 kept at a constant level e g the average influent flow rate even more challenging is the provision of suitable conditions in the aob anammox reactor s such that aob and anammox bacteria develop in partnership while nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob are eliminated yuan et al 2008 online control of aeration is often necessary to out select nob through kinetic selection or through substrate competition with nitrite reducers ordinary denitrifiers or anammox bacteria for example online control to maintain a constant ratio between the concentrations of do and the total ammonia nitrogen bartrolí et al 2010 or between the concentrations of nh4 and no2 no3 also termed avn control regmi et al 2014 was found to favour nob out selection online aeration control to suppress nob based on ph lee et al 2013 yang et al 2007 gu et al 2012 and our oxygen uptake rate blackburne et al 2008 lemaire et al 2008 has also been reported a further challenge that future ica systems have to address is the mitigation of n2o emissions from biological nitrogen removal plants it is known that operational conditions such as do nitrite and inorganic carbon concentrations ph and biomass specific nitrogen loading rate play critical roles law et al 2012 among these factors do control has been used to mitigate n2o emissions for example based on simulation results ni et al 2015 the south australian water corporation australia replaced the previously adopted intermittent aeration strategy with a continuous aeration system with do concentration controlled at 0 5 mg o2 l and achieved a 30 reduction in n2o emissions from a full scale sequencing batch reactor personal communication with dr ben van den akker sa water the integrated control of multiple operational parameters to minimise n2o emissions in biological nitrogen removal while deemed to be necessary is yet to be developed and demonstrated 4 2 flow control in sewer systems the primary function of a sewer system is to transport wastewater and stormwater in the case of a combined sewer away from the community to a wastewater treatment plant to protect both public health and the environment correspondingly the two key objectives for sewer flow control are 1 to prevent wastewater spill and flooding during its transport and 2 to minimise the impact of wastewater on the receiving water the latter in particular should involve the integrated control of sewers and wwtps with the quality of the receiving water as the ultimate goal fu et al 2008 dong et al 2012 4 2 1 sewer flow monitoring and prediction in contrast to a wwtp a sewer is a distributed system the two key requisites for sewer flow control are sensors that can be widely deployed at key locations in the system and accurate dynamic models that can predict flows across the network based on somewhat limited sensor data sensors for online measurement of water velocities water levels and rain intensities are available and have been widely deployed for sewer monitoring it should be noted that flow measurement in sewers may not be as trivial as expected as flow rates in sewers are typically low leading to large relative errors when a sensor has a limited accuracy also the location of a flow sensor is important since the accuracy may depend on the position of the device mignot et al 2012 sewer sensors are currently being developed with iot internet of things capacity with built in wireless telecommunication abilities for known reliability low power consumption and low costs this new development will enable the acquisition of much larger volumes of data from sewer networks this aspect will be further discussed in section 7 2 in addition to physical sensors software sensors have also been developed to estimate unmeasured parameters from other sensor signals for example chen et al 2014 estimated the sewage flow rate into a pumping station based on the on off timing of a pumping station the method made use of the fact that at an intermittently operated pumping station the pump is turned on when the water level in the wet well reaches a pre defined upper water level and turned off when a pre defined lower water level is reached as such the average water flow entering the pumping station between the off time in the previous pump cycle and the on time of the current cycle must be equal to the known wet well volume between the upper and lower water levels based on a similar principle the authors also developed an algorithm to estimate sewage flow entering a continuously operated pumping station in this case the algorithm requires continuous monitoring of the water level in the wet well chen et al 2014 in a slightly more complicated case ahm et al 2016 calculated the volume of combined sewer overflow cso by estimating flow rates based on level measurements the data driven software sensor was developed by correlating the physical water levels and discharges the authors achieved good accuracy when the estimates were compared with electromagnetic flow measurements another software sensor concept was based on computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations of the physical layout of the cso structures this software sensor is an independent estimation and does not need any calibration to discharge measurements the real time simulation of flows in a network requires prediction of the flows entering the network based on real time monitoring chen et al 2014 developed a methodology for predicting future flows a few hours ahead using an arma auto regressive moving average model and multi step iterative prediction this methodology was validated with flow data collected from two pumping stations with different flow characteristics and different wet well storage capacities the proposed methodology was shown to be capable of predicting future flow rates with good accuracy under both dry and wet weather conditions li et al 2019 extended the arma model into an armax auto regressive moving average with external input model with real time rainfall data as an external input the armax model was shown to substantially reduce the prediction delays associated with the previously developed arma model li et al 2019 for a given network the flow profiles across the network can theoretically be predicted in real time harremoës and rauch 1999 once all the external flows entering the network are known measured and or predicted indeed dynamic models have increasingly been used for simulation of the hydraulics of sewer systems pollution transport in the sewer is often included in such simulations as it is highly important for estimating the pollutant load to the treatment plant or to the receiving water when csos occur however there is often a high level of uncertainty associated with such simulations particularly for large networks for a number of reasons including inflow and infiltration that are often unaccounted for see 4 2 2 it is necessary to perform additional physical measurements of hydraulic parameters e g velocity and levels within the network in order to verify model predictions an important question here is how many flow rate and level measurements are required to get a confident picture of the hydraulics of the sewer system the more measurements the higher the confidence however there must be a balance between cost of measurements and accuracy of the estimated parameters or state variables of the system 4 2 2 estimating inflow and infiltration one of the challenges for real time prediction of wastewater flow through a network is the uncertainties associated with inflow and infiltration i i which are often un or inadequately accounted for during the prediction inflow and infiltration of unwanted water in the sewer system is not desirable since this will lead to a substantially higher hydraulic load to a wwtp de bénédittis and bertrand krajewski 2005 ellis and bertrand krajewski 2010 beheshti et al 2015 in australia for example it has been found that sewer i i could raise sewage flow rate in a sanitary sewer to several times that of the dry weather chen et al 2014 li et al 2019 obviously any reduction in the i i will decrease the probability for cso or an overload of the treatment plant there are various methods to detect localize and quantify i i in sewer systems traditional methods to estimate the i i are based on flow rate measurements analysis of diurnal flow and load variation and balancing of water inputs and outputs ellis and bertrand krajewski 2010 flow rate methods are typically used off line the tracer test is another off line method one qualitative online monitoring method is based on temperature measurements fibre optic distributed temperature sensing dts can measure temperature with high resolution and frequency this method has been widely used in other industries for example to detect fractures in oil pipelines vosse et al 2013 schilperoort et al 2013 stormwater inflow can be detected as long as the temperature of this inflow differs from the in sewer temperatures langeveld et al 2012 online conductivity measurements have also been used to estimate rainfall derived i i when overflow happens at the same time zhang et al 2018b usually it is difficult to distinguish between the two phenomena variations in the flow and water quality during dry weather conditions were analysed using fast fourier transform and a model was developed for estimating the rainfall derived i i based on conductivity data the method has been successfully tested for light medium and heavy rains 4 2 3 sewer flow control to prevent sewer spill and flooding sewer spill and local flooding should be avoided to protect public health often the first notification of a spill comes from a member of the public hours and sometimes days after the first spill the challenge is to find a way to predict the spill before it happens so that appropriate actions can be taken in a timely manner sewer spill can happen when sewer lines are blocked a common pump problem in sewer operations is clogging caused by rags pre moistened wipes and other consumer goods marketed as flushable this causes sewage backups in the collection system indeed the pump clog problem is increasingly caused by the use of flushable wipes one solution that has been applied is installing a special impeller that helps to counterbalance hydraulic forces and create a balanced single flow path that passes problematic flushables an early warning approach has also been used where the online monitored flow rate is compared with the motor current a standard method in many pumping applications a rise in power consumption for a certain flow is reported as an early sign for clogging an early warning method for spills has also been developed by nukon http www nukon com au a model was developed using data from previous spills with the goal to find out if the model could detect a spill earlier than other methods one indicator is the time between pump runs a pump will start running when a wet well is filled the time to fill was identified for on peak off peak weekends and weekdays under normal behaviour the model identifies blockages by detecting abnormal time to fill behaviour for example if the fill time is unexpectedly long during peak times or the pump does not run it is an indicator of abnormality or possible blockage the model has been tested successfully and could detect historical blockages more than 12 h before they were reported by a customer high sewer flows during wet weather when exceeding the hydraulic capacity of the sewer system also cause spill and flooding hydraulic predictions as outlined in sections 4 2 1 and 4 2 2 are needed to predict flows and the likelihood of spill and flooding and to guide operation the prediction often consists of coupled 1d drainage network and 2d surface models to predict inundation depths in the surrounding area as emphasized by savić 2017 the prediction horizon is crucial the model must provide enough lead time for the flood prediction so that necessary actions can be taken model simplifications of large networks may have to be realised so that the computations can be finished in time savić 2017 describes two methods fast overland flood modelling and data driven machine learning sewer surcharge modelling the overland flood modelling is realized by a 2d cellular automata model ghimire et al 2013 guidolin et al 2016 this approach increases the computational speed by about an order of magnitude compared to traditional methods the other approach is using machine learning where the model is updated using an artificial neural network ann model that uses computational data from several flood calculations via traditional models which is combined with rainfall radar forecasts duncan et al 2011 2013 the model is then compared to real events a similar approach is described by rjeily et al 2017 the flood risk is calculated by estimating the water depth variation within critical manholes the ann parameters describe how water depth variation in manholes is related to rainfall intensities it is crucial to find out how far the urban drainage system can be controlled and then know how to act if it is not controllable for example a gravity sewer has much less controllability than a sewer supplied with pumps as demonstrated in christchurch new zealand after the major earthquake in 2011 several pumps have been installed in the sewer system since to make it more controllable climate change is causing an increase in extreme wet weather events kleidorfer et al 2018 analysed a heavy rain event in austria the authors emphasize that the models may be calibrated for more common events like a 10 year rain event however data for extreme and rare events is seldom available which makes flood prediction models unreliable because the relationship between rainfall intensities and flooding is nonlinear some actions may have to be taken outside the drainage system to reduce the flooding risk one approach to deal with the sewer capacity problem is to store rainwater at source which decreases the flow into the sewer butler and parkinson 1997 this also enables rainwater harvesting and use after treatment see section 5 it was realized early kollatsch 1993 that the exclusion of stormwater from urban wastewater would be the most important measure to obtain more efficient drainage systems 4 2 4 integrated control of sewer networks and wastewater treatment plants the sequential relationship between the sewer the wwtp and the receiving water is obvious and the need for control of flow in the sewers for the benefit of the downstream components was recognized early for example sewer control was applied in the early 1970s in cleveland usa kukudis 1973 during dry periods flow equalisation was employed during storm periods the system was primarily designed to capture and treat the first 20 min of flow i e the first flush any water which was bypassed out of necessity after the first period would have been heavily diluted a sewer flow control strategy integrating sewers and wastewater treatment plants seeks to prevent or reduce the detrimental direct discharge of wastewater into receiving water due to sewer overflow an integrated control strategy can be used to equalize flows to the treatment plants in particular during wet weather when wastewater flow rates varying substantially the two key requisites for successful implementation of integrated control are accurate dynamic models for both systems and reliable sensors following the advent of deterministic models of integrated drainage approximately two decades ago integrated control was investigated by several groups mostly in europe nielsen et al 1996 bauwens et al 1996 pfister et al 1998 rauch and harremoës 1996a 1996b 1999 schütze et al 1999 nearly all investigations focused on semi virtual cases utilizing simulation studies while the implementation was demonstrated through computer modelling the infrastructure studied was real and these theoretical studies demonstrated the potential of integrated control paving the way for practical implementation the early studies extensively researched stimulations based on models and control concepts e g weinreich et al 1997 pleau et al 2001 schütze et al 2002 zacharof et al 2003 erbe and schütze 2005 butler and schütze 2005 vanrolleghem et al 2005 benedetti et al 2008 case studies e g erbe et al 2002 seggelke et al 2005 and novel optimisation methods e g brdys et al 2008 muschalla 2008 an overview of these developments can be found in schütze et al 2004 rauch et al 2005 olsson and jeppsson 2006 beeneken et al 2013 and garcía et al 2015 among these olsson and jeppsson 2006 emphasised the role of plant wide control and considering the inflow while various control structures and algorithms have been presented it is difficult to compare the benefits of these methods since the systems and the operating conditions are not identical a similar dilemma was expressed in the early 1990s concerning wastewater treatment control this led to the development of a benchmark system called the benchmark simulation model bsm that has been extremely successful in testing and comparing control strategies for wastewater treatment systems gernaey et al 2014 based on a similar philosophy a benchmark scheme for urban drainage systems astlingen has now been developed by working group integral real time control of the german water association dwa schütze et al 2018 following development of the models researchers together with operators developed the necessary technologies and experience for reliable online monitoring of sewer systems which complemented the more established monitoring of the treatment plants online sensor development together with data quality control proved to be a significant step forward for implementation bertrand krajewski et al 2003 gruber et al 2005 rieger and vanrolleghem 2008 métadier and bertrand krajewski 2012 schilperoort et al 2012 vezzaro et al 2013 recent developments include the use of distributed sensing via fibre optics hoes et al 2009 novel concepts for extracting information from sensors dürrenmatt et al 2013 and the implementation of low power consumption wireless telecommunication in particular the latter has potential for major innovation as it allows for spatially refined high density information integrated control is now being achieved in full scale application e g eindhoven in the netherlands weijers et al 2012 copenhagen in denmark grum et al 2011 quebec canada fradet et al 2011 and wilhelmshaven in germany seggelke et al 2013 although the number of successful implementations is still limited benedetti et al 2013 a key barrier for wider implementation of integrated control is the fragmented urban water management framework sewers and wastewater treatment plants are typically managed by different departments or entities which have different aims procedures and cultures thus the goals of sewer operation versus those of wastewater treatment are often contradictory a major benefit of integrated control is mitigation of sewer overflows particularly during wet weather while the prevention of sewer overflow brings direct environmental benefits it causes hydraulic stress to the treatment plant which may affect treatment performance in contrast while sewers can be used to equalise hydraulic load to the treatment plant thus improving treatment performance and potentially reducing aeration costs aymerich et al 2015 such an operation does not necessarily improve the sewer performance in both cases the benefit is only apparent when sewers and treatment plants together are seen as an integrated wastewater system with a unified goal but unfortunately this is uncommon because cross discipline collaboration is not established easily another barrier to implementation is the absence of a standard solution a one size fits all approach is not feasible as each case is different and requires a tailored approach to design due to the inherent complexity and need for reliability capacity building is also another challenge as training of operators in how to manage the integrated system is critical 4 3 chemical dosing control in sewers for corrosion and odour management sewer systems are critical infrastructure for modern urban societies today s underground sewer infrastructure is the result of enormous investment over the last 100 years in the usa sewers represent an estimated asset value of one trillion 1012 dollars equating to approximately 7 of the current gross domestic product brongers et al 2002 however globally sewer infrastructure is under serious threat due to deterioration with an estimated annual asset loss of around 14 billion in the usa alone brongers et al 2002 sulfide induced concrete sewer corrosion costs billions of dollars annually and has been identified as a main cause of sewer deterioration us environmental protection agency 1991 under the anaerobic conditions typical in sewage sulfate reducing bacteria convert sulfate so4 2 in sewage to hydrogen sulfide h2s due to its low solubility in the wastewater hydrogen sulfide is emitted from sewage into the air space of gravity sewer sections sewage pumping stations and inlet structures of wastewater treatment plants on concrete surfaces exposed to air gaseous sulfide is oxidised forming highly corrosive sulfuric acid water utilities around the world have focused on the removal of sulfide after its formation incurring mitigation costs comparable to the value of asset losses there are currently several methods to control this sulfide induced problem with chemical dosing being the most widely used according to a recent survey conducted among the major water utilities in australia ganigué et al 2011 the commonly used chemicals for sulfide control in sewers include oxygen and nitrate which both oxidise sulfide iron salts to precipitate sulfide and magnesium hydroxide to elevate ph thereby decreasing hydrogen sulfide transfer from the liquid to the gas phase the way chemical dosing is conducted has not only a major influence on the effectiveness of the chemical on sulfide control but also significant implications for operational cost controlling chemical dosing in rising main sewers ganigué et al 2011 is very challenging due to the plug flow behaviour of a sewer system according to the same industry survey ganigué et al 2011 flow paced or profiled dosing strategies are used at the majority of dosing sites these strategies which are commonly based on empirical guidelines developed through experience de haas et al 2008 can lead to over or under dosage as sewers have a distinct dynamic behaviour with large variations in sewage flow and characteristics occurring throughout the day week and year additionally rainwater inflow and infiltration may dilute sewage and decrease its hydraulic retention time within the pipe dramatically reducing the amount of chemical required for suitable sulfide control online control of chemical dosing of magnesium hydroxide to a rising main was studied recently by ganigué et al 2016 fig 4 the controller consisted of three components the first being a local feedback controller which raises the sewage ph to the set point before it is pumped into the rising main pipe the second component was a feedforward controller which adds additional magnesium hydroxide to the sewage while it enters the pipe to neutralise the predicted acid production in sewage while it is being transported through the pipe the third component was a feedback controller that makes further adjustment to the dosing rate based on the long term average ph at the end of the pipe in a two month field study at a pumping station with a total average dry weather flow of 12 ml d followed by a rising main with a total length of 5 29 km and a pipe diameter of 600 mm the chemical consumption was reduced by 15 at the same time the ph variation at the end of the pipe was also reduced substantially a similar method was applied to iron salts dosing for sulfide control through precipitation ganigué et al 2018 the controller was applied to a 10 km sewer main with diameters varying between 603 and 750 mm and an average dry weather flow of 21 ml d the control system achieved 25 savings in chemical consumption combined with better sulfide control performance ganigué et al 2018 to support the design of the aforementioned controllers chen et al 2014 developed a methodology for real time future flow prediction in sewers based on arma models and multi step iterative prediction the validation of the model and a later developed armax model with real time rainfall data as an external input using real sewer data have been described in section 4 2 1 online control of chemical dosing with real time sewer flow prediction using these models was tested through simulation studies chen et al 2014 li et al 2019 and yielded improved control performance and reduced costs liu et al 2013 extended the control design from a single pipe to a more complex system by controlling the dosing and pump operations via hybrid automata control strategy sulfide control was achieved across a network 5 control of stormwater systems flooding and environmental degradation due to polluted urban discharges are managed using a variety of structural and non structural stormwater management options in the 20th century large stormwater drainage gutter pipe channel systems were introduced alongside wet and more often dry detention and retention basins to manage pluvial flooding stormwater quality management is more recent started in late 1980s and is applied through water sensitive urban design systems such as wetlands ponds swales and biofilters also known as bioretention systems or rain gardens wong et al 2013 over the past 10 15 years rainwater and stormwater harvesting was introduced at an unprecedented scale in some regions that experienced prolonged droughts grant et al 2012 for example rainwater tanks are used at large scale in australia for irrigation of urban gardens and toilet flushing ferguson et al 2013 over the past 50 years the complexity of stormwater management increased enormously because stormwater is regarded and managed as both a nuisance and a valuable water source some stormwater structural measures can serve more than one purpose rainwater harvesting rwh systems such as rainwater harvesting tanks rwht are good examples of multifunctional systems they can provide an alternate source of water while serving as detention retention for roof runoff that would otherwise be discharged into the stormwater network leading to potential flooding and pollution however to achieve these often competing multiple objectives the rwh systems have to be controlled often in real time control of rwh systems is a recent innovation with only a few being demonstrated in practice control of rwht can be via 1 a passive system that slowly releases accumulated water between two rain events and therefore prepares the tank to detain runoff from the next event or 2 an active system that uses real time control to purge accumulated rainwater before a large storm event the benefits of passive rwht have been demonstrated by several desktop studies e g herrmann and schmida 1999 melville shreeve et al 2014 bishop et al 2013 burns et al 2012 only a few passively controlled tanks have been installed and monitored in australia e g burns et al 2012 and in the usa e g debusk et al 2012 it can be speculated that the efficiency of stormwater infrastructure could be much improved if active controls are included in the traditionally passive systems a good example of an active rwht system installed in new bern north carolina usa is presented in debusk et al 2012 the system captures runoff from 290 m2 of rooftop into five plastic tanks of 12 300 l in total water is extracted from the tanks using a pump for garden irrigation the system is equipped with an rtc device optirtc by geosyntec https www optirtc com that automatically releases stored water based on real time forecasted precipitation and current conditions within the rwh system using forecasted precipitation from the national weather service of the usa the device triggers the rwh system to slowly release a given amount of water to ensure that the rainfall can be captured water is released before the critical storm events only if there is insufficient storage capacity within the tank to accommodate the forecasted precipitation the maximum amount of water released by the system is equivalent to the volume of water associated with a 1 year 1 h storm event to meet the state water quality target this system has been monitored but so far no data have been published in open literature another example of rtc rainwater tanks has been installed by south east water in melbourne australia this talk tank releases water based on forecast data using a mobile phone app to manage i e monitor and purge water volume in the tank only in the past few years have rtc systems been considered for management of stormwater discharge quality a good example is an active stormwater tank installed as a part of drainage system in quebec city in canada where the stormwater detention time is actively controlled to manage both the available storage volume for flood protection and whenever possible quality of realeased water muschalla et al 2014 gaborit et al 2013 recent laboratory based work has also shown that efficiency of typical raingardens for stormwater treatment could be highly improved if an rtc system is included the quality of treated water using an actively managed raingarden could improve to the point to enable safe stormwater harvesting for some non potable uses shen submitted in conclusion the application of ica technology in stormwater systems is in its infancy although modelling studies are showing that there is great potential 6 why is ica adoption progressing slowly in urban water management load variations in a wastewater treatment system are considerable compared to most other process industries the influent must be accepted and treated regardless and there is no returning it to the supplier water supply operations resemble electricity delivery where the customer demand cannot be controlled under normal circumstances the production at all times must adapt to the need these are just some of the features of urban water systems calling for the use of ica however the adoption of ica in urban water management is far behind other process industries there are a number of reasons for the slow progress in application of ica in urban water systems not only technical but also economic regulatory and social 6 1 economic reasons profit motives urban water utilities are not as sensitive to capital and operational costs as other industries water utilities or private operators rightfully place serious focus on compliance they are willing to employ safer but more expensive design and operational strategies to operate the systems comfortably within the boundaries rather than its more aggressive counterpart by taking up online control to operate the systems closer to the boundaries while these companies are under pressure to cut costs for their services customers have so far been willing to pay for the services product price the low product price of water has certainly been playing a critical role in slow uptake of ica the price per m3 of oil is 100 200 times higher than that of drinking water not surprisingly a lot of methods and instruments have been developed for leakage detection and localization in oil pipelines swift et al 2011 vosse et al 2013 schilperoort et al 2013 it is quite pleasing to observe that the value of water both economic and social is being increasingly recognised which has led to the development and application of more advanced leakage detection and localisation methods in recent years section 3 3 6 2 technical reasons some technical aspects of water operations give control a lower priority process dynamics most process units in urban water systems are inherently stable this means that online control is not required for ensuring process stability for example except for anaerobic sludge digesters virtually all units in an activated sludge wastewater treatment system can work stably without process control anaerobic sludge digesters will also operate stably if operated well below critical organic loading rates however it is increasingly recognised that connecting unit processes through recirculation creates internal disturbances often causing operational problems with increasing system complexity associated with these interactions the human ability to predict and handle all the consequences of disturbances is becoming a limiting factor the one end control objective of product quality unlike most other process industries where products are required to have a well defined composition water and wastewater treatment plants are typically required to produce effluents with contaminant concentrations to be maintained below certain levels specified in regulations such one end type of specifications can be met without process control through conservative design and operational strategies such as over aeration or over dosing of chemicals with concomitant costs as discussed the urban water sector is not overly sensitive to costs and consequently high effluent quality safety margins are often prioritised over operational costs take nitrogen and phosphorus removal as an example the economic goal would mean that the total effluent nitrogen phosphorus should be controlled as close as possible to the discharge limits with reduced aeration and chemical costs instead of keeping the concentration significantly below the limits the former goal cannot be achieved without online control but the latter can be through over design and conservative operation unfortunately a conservative attitude which outweighs the focus on costs prevents the use of advanced control even when the economic benefits are demonstrated ingildsen 2002 ch 11 online instrumentation the reliability of advanced online sensors such as nutrient sensors for monitoring wastewater treatment systems is a current limitation to ica application simpler sensors such as do ph flow and level sensors have long been proven to be reliable and robust with required level of accuracy and they can be used with minimum maintenance therefore such sensors have been widely used in the control of urban water systems in comparison more complicated water quality sensors such as ammonium nitrate nitrite and phosphate sensors which are critical for controlling biological nutrient removal and recovery processes are far less reliable and require more frequent maintenance this has resulted in an inadequate level of confidence in these sensors which has prevented wider application of the well developed control algorithms required by these sensors insufficient flexibility in design the coupling of design and operation in a control integrated design is seldom seen instead ica is often implemented as a complementary step in existing plants to improve efficiency or reduce costs inflexible design limits control potential and opportunities for example on off instead of variable speed pumps or compressors are often used and valves are often designed for most favorable pressure drop rather than for control 6 3 regulatory reasons the common practice at least in european countries is that laboratory measurements are the golden standard increasingly plant managers favour online sensors but face opposition from regulatory agencies which only accept results from manual sampling combined with laboratory analysis the fact that both laboratory analysis and online sensors are prone to errors is often discussed but has not led to meaningful changes in practice one key factor is the need for better information and education there is a wide competence range among plant operation and online sensors may be used for measurements outside the recommended range this kind of misuse is often used as an argument against using sensors for operational oversight and compliance with good reason in an ongoing culture change sensor manufacturers are improving their product information and plant operators are being better educated and trained 6 4 the human factor the human factor involved in successful operation is often neglected though it can pose a greater challenge than the technology olsson and newell 1998 incentives and motivations of the involved stakeholders the public federal agencies provincial agencies local political leadership plant managers operator in chief and operators their interests incentives and pressures must be taken into account rieger and olsson 2012 for example do and ammonia control is implemented in many activated sludge plants however quite often the operator changes the setpoints to increase the safety margins for effluent quality the operator does not want to be blamed for not meeting the quality criteria but is seldom praised for saving electrical energy or chemicals the following summarises some critical elements of the human factor job protection automation of certain unit processes in wastewater treatment plants together with remote supervision has been applied since the early 1990s automation can lower personnel costs lumley et al 1993 however union resistance at many places has slowed progress towards automated operation education the need for education and training in design and operation was recognised early john andrews 1930 2011 noted in 1974 buhr et al 1974 a course in process dynamics and control is commonly found in most chemical engineering curricula we would be well advised to include a course in dynamics and control of wastewater treatment systems in environmental engineering curricula still today the need for training in dynamics modelling and control is insufficient hug et al 2009 beck 2005 expresses a similar view all the major branches of engineering except civil engineering the traditional disciplinary host of environmental engineering have integral elements of instruction and research addressing the operational performance of their products i e process control recently a truly significant contribution to better design has been the development of dynamic simulators which assist designers to mimic possible plant behaviour under various load conditions ogurek et al 2015 designer incentives treatment plant designers often have incentives to over design the system designing high capacity systems expands the safety margins and ensures that regulatory requirements are met in many cases there is a government subsidy for the investment capital expenditure in the system but not for operation giving another reason for high capacity design load variations create less impact in over designed plants thus decreasing the demand for control to attenuate disturbances 7 perspectives 7 1 integrated control of urban water systems integrated control of sewer networks and wastewater treatment plants was discussed in section 4 2 4 to date efforts have been mainly limited to the control of hydraulics with the goal of protecting the receiving water quality however integrated control certainly has the potential to go beyond basic performance improvements during wet weather discharges for example rebosura et al 2018 showed that iron dosing to sewers not only controls dissolved sulfide in sewage thus reducing sewer corrosion and odour but also removes dissolved phosphate in aerobic bioreactors where fes in sewage is oxidised regenerating iron ions for phosphate precipitation in this case the iron dosing rate in sewers should be controlled not only for sulfide removal in sewers ganigué et al 2018 but also for phosphate removal in the downstream wastewater treatment plant many other opportunities will be identified in the future in particular following recent advances in wastewater management progressing from pollutant removal to resource recovery sewer systems could be used to provide tailored pre treatment prior to arriving at a treatment plant for resource recovery these integrated approaches could be site and case specific integrated control of urban water systems should also expand to include the water supply systems water treatment and distribution network the interconnections between water supply and wastewater systems are clearly recognisable as it is the same water that flows through both systems residual substances in drinking water can affect wastewater composition as well as the chemical and biochemical reactions in sewers and wwtps for example pikaar et al 2014 highlighted the major impact of sulfate in drinking water on sewer corrosion and odour and called for the use of non sulfate containing coagulants in drinking water treatment the study suggested that if a sulfate containing coagulant is used e g alum its dosing rate should be controlled not only to reduce the operational costs for drinking water treatment but also to reduce impact on sewer corrosion chloride containing coagulants e g ferric chloride are an alternative to sulfate containing coagulants however while not having an effect on sewer corrosion the presence of chloride in drinking water may cause corrosion of water supply pipes indeed the cause of the flint water crisis flint michigan usa was lead leaching from aging pipes due to a high concentration of chloride hanna attisha et al 2016 it was found that the chloride to sulfate ratio is a critical parameter affecting drinking water pipe corrosion nguyen et al 2010 edwards and simoni 2007 the role of ica in ensuring this ratio is maintained within a safe range should be explored in the future sun et al 2015 identified a new possible connection between a drinking water treatment plant and sewers where a ferric based coagulant is used for water treatment the ferric containing drinking water sludge can be discharged to sewer networks laboratory experiments showed that sulfide control in sewers could be achieved through re use of iron in the drinking water sludge given the dynamics of sulfide production in sewers sharma et al 2008 2012 the online control of sludge dosing would be essential for adequate sulfide control future water services will be provided through the integration of multiple sources such as catchment water reuse water stormwater groundwater and seawater at multiple scales through both centralised and decentralised services considerable opportunities will arise for the use of ica to optimise overall water supply and system operation one such opportunity is the optimised scheduling of alternative water source use leading to attenuated peak demand for centralised systems this could potentially defer the upgrading of both water production and distribution systems and water treatment plants the use of decentralised wastewater treatment and reuse systems is increasing in the urban water environment one of the challenges faced is that small treatment plants are subject to extreme fluctuations in both inflow rates and wastewater composition the flow rates can be intermittent and wastewater composition can vary within minutes yet these plants must consistently produce effluent of a quality which complies with environmental regulations without professional engineers or operators on site ica can play an important role in ensuring stable operation and consistent performance olsson et al 2005 olsson 2013 wilderer and schreff 2000 another particular challenge for ica application to a small decentralised treatment plant is that monitoring has to be achieved through relatively simple low cost instruments such as flow ph level and pressure meters this is because advanced expensive sensors are not economically justifiable given the small scale however early warning systems are critically important for such systems and telemetry is needed for remote monitoring and supervisory control the use of decentralised systems will also have a major impact on existing wastewater services particularly on the sewer networks that collect and transport wastewater to centralised wastewater treatment facilities the increased use of decentralised wastewater treatment and reuse systems will change both the flow and composition of wastewater discharged to sewer networks in many cases sludge produced by decentralised treatment systems will need to be disposed to existing sewer networks due to the lack of cost effective on site sludge treatment and disposal opportunities these changes in practice have significant implications for in sewer sedimentation potentially causing sewer blockage and to the management of corrosion odour and greenhouse gas emissions in sewer networks to alleviate issues with sludge sedimentation in sewers the potential role for ica is to automatically control sludge discharge from decentralised systems in periods with high sewer flows increased aeration occurs in high flow periods and as such the oxygen demand of the biologically active wasted activated sludge discharged from decentralised wastewater treatment systems can be more easily met in sewer decreasing the likelihood of anaerobic conditions developing with the availability of stormwater harvesting another opportunity for ica application is the controlled use of stormwater for sewer flushing reduced wastewater flows and increased solids concentration in wastewater due to water conservation measures lead to increased solids sedimentation in sewer networks at some locations drinking water is being introduced into sewer networks to increase sewer flow completely defeating the purpose of water conservation and water reuse here stormwater is an attractive alternative to using drinking water the timing and duration of sewer flushing will depend not only on what is required to erode the sediments but also the stormwater availability while in pipe sewer flushing installations are common the use of ica to monitor and release stored stormwater for sewer flushing is uncommon but has great potential e g pisano et al 2003 integrated urban water management could reach beyond water the nexus of water and energy has been clearly identified olsson 2015 energy use in the urban water cycle should be analysed and considered from a total systems point of view as such ica is expected to have a significant role in integrated urban water management but opportunities are yet to be fully identified and explored future research is required to thoroughly and systematically address the challenges and exploit ica opportunities olsson 2013 the aforementioned examples show that opportunities for ica application will be case specific and that multiple benefits be achieved in an era of integrated urban water management 7 2 application of internet of things iot to urban water systems the internet of things iot an emerging collection of technologies is expected to have a major impact on the future of ica in urban water systems a search of internet of things on web of science search topic 11 july 2018 revealed that 249 iot articles were published in 2010 and this increased to 7 104 articles in 2017 out of a total of 23 295 publications this indicates iot has developed very rapidly in the last decade and is creating value through widespread applications the definition of iot is still evolving but it is commonly accepted that iot comprises the connection of physical things to the internet enabling data exchange based on low cost sensors and low power consuming wireless telecommunication these features distinguish iot sensors from traditional sensors and telemetry used for urban water systems and enables their deployment to a much wider range of locations and at much higher densities consequently the use of iot sensors allows the collection of much larger volumes of data possibly orders of magnitude larger compared to traditional sensors such large data sets enable machine learning or data driven modelling to provide support to online control or off line decision making a global trend in smart cities is the installation of sensors for surveillance of infrastructure including urban water wastewater systems however the application of iot sensors to urban water management has been limited relative to many other application areas in spite of this the value of iot enabled ica in comparison with traditional ica has been demonstrated in many case studies for example abdelhafidh et al 2017 used iot sensors for pipelines sensors cameras and rfid tags and water flow pressure and ph to enable real time management of a 50 km long drinking water pipeline han et al 2017 used iot sensing data for fast detection of multiple simultaneous pipe failures by reducing the detection time by orders of magnitude i e from hours days to minutes smart water metering which uses a digital electronic device that collects information on water use and sends it wirelessly to the water utility is an example of innovative and effective iot infrastructure for smart cities lloret et al 2016 the real time water demand data available to the utility and end users enables an understanding of consumption habits thereby supporting the development of strategies for improving network efficiency and contributing to water saving iot was also used with an artificial neural network model to understand human water use behaviour with different intervention procedures for improved and sustained hygiene practice fu and wu 2016 in addition iot was employed with scada for integrated drinking water production and distribution roy and mukhopadhyay 2016 iot has also found applications in urban drainage systems including wastewater and stormwater sewers the first and most successful application is the management of combined sewer overflow cso different neural networks including the recently developed deep learning method i e long short term memory lstm and gated recurrent unit gru have been successfully applied to predict the cso water levels based on real time iot sensors and rainfall zhang et al 2018a many commercial technologies have been trialled and implemented with success the ibm intelligent operations center dashboard built upon 116 smart valve sensors helped the city of south bend indiana usa to reduce wet weather wastewater overflows by 23 and almost entirely eliminated dry weather incidents such as blocked sewers clancy 2013 in europe severn trent water deployed more than 4 000 iot sensors over 94 000 km of sewers to monitor flow and to prevent blockage and sewage overflow brakoniecki 2017 the metropolitan sewer district of greater cincinnati usa developed a real time monitoring based smart sewer that reduces overflow at a cost that is 20 40 times lower as compared with other commonly used methods such as green stormwater controls and larger pipes gaskell 2017 onebox a smart sewer wastewater level monitor designed and developed by iota services australia was adopted by christchurch in the rebuild of the city after the 2011 earthquake dickers 2016 savings in capital cost was achieved through reduced peak flows and general flow management capabilities it has been reported that many major water utilities in australia are trialling or implementing iot sensors for monitoring and managing wastewater levels flow temperature and even hydrogen sulfide hoey 2017 the current application of iot in sewers is mostly limited to cso or blockage reduction however corrosion and odour are two important aspects of sewer management providing many opportunities for the application of iot technologies iot water quality monitoring in sewers could also provide wastewater data for improved operation of the downstream wastewater treatment plant wwtp the operation of a wwtp can be optimised using iot and analytics too ibm research haifa undertook an iot pilot to improve efficiency at a treatment plant in lleida spain zadorojniy 2016 zadorojniy et al 2017 the one year trial was successful through updating process operations every 2 h rather than adjusting on a seasonal basis the consumption of electricity use of chemicals for phosphorus removal and the production of sludge dropped by 13 5 14 and 17 respectively the overall effluent quality and compliance with regulation were also improved iot coupled with cloud based data analysis has proven useful for small wastewater treatment facilities in remote locations or small communities such as the imetland under development in europe libelium 2017 iot will likely become the backbone of next generation ica required for the success of integrated urban water management as a key attribute of smart cities more iot applications in urban water systems have become feasible because the cost and size of such devices continues to decrease while their capability for measuring different parameters keeps increasing data gathered through iot sensors can be used for many purposes through powerful big data systems e g hadoop and spark two distributed systems on the market to manage large data

conclusions instrumentation control and automation ica are currently applied to various components of urban water systems with significant benefits reported the primary application of ica has focused on the control of various process units in water and wastewater treatment plants leading to improved performance reduced operational costs and increased capacity of the plants in addition diverse applications of ica include leakage detection and localisation in water distribution networks and motivating consumer behavioural change through feedback mechanisms leading to reduced water consumption future research will focus on the integrated control of urban water systems through properly recognising the connections and interactions between various units in a treatment plant and between sub systems in an urban water system ica will play a significant role in more efficient use of existing urban water infrastructure leading to system wide optimisation ica will enable us to better utilise existing assets and defer capital intensive upgrades that would otherwise be necessary iot will contribute intrinsically to ica applications and shows great potential with advanced

18922,instrumentation control and automation ica are currently applied throughout the urban water system at water treatment plants in water distribution networks in sewer networks and at wastewater treatment plants however researchers and practitioners specialising in respective urban water sub systems do not frequently interact and in most cases to date the application of ica has been achieved in silo here we review start of the art ica throughout these sub systems and discuss the benefits achieved in terms of performance improvement cost reduction and more importantly the enhanced capacity of the existing infrastructure to cope with increased service demand caused by population growth and continued urbanisation we emphasise the importance of integrated control within each of the sub systems and also across the entire urban water system system wide ica will have increasing importance with the growing complexity of the urban water environment in cities of the future keywords distribution ica iuwm sewer water supply wwtp 1 introduction 1 1 urban water grand challenges population growth urbanisation and climate change are causing major impacts around the world these megatrends present fundamental challenges to the water sector significant changes in water quantity and quality are occurring around the world wmo 2018 lall et al 2018 ipcc 2018 kunkel et al 2018 and more changes are predicted for decades to come oecd 2012 predicted that without any new policies water demand globally will increase by 55 over the years 2012 2050 the main increases in water requirement will be in emerging economies and developing countries the rise in demand for manufacturing electricity production and domestic use are predicted to increase by 400 140 and 130 respectively the demand for water for irrigation is also expected to increase substantially fao 2018 projects that feeding a world population of 9 billion people in 2050 would require raising overall food production by some 60 over the years 2018 2050 production in developing countries would need to almost double in the face of these competing needs water scarcity already affects more than 40 people in the world a proportion predicted to reach around 65 by 2050 fao 2018 consequently there will be increasing competition for freshwater in the near future there is an urgent need for more water sources and for improved efficiency of water use it also must be acknowledged that around 80 of population growth will take place in urban areas which will create a herculean challenge for urban water management in addition to population growth and urbanisation urban water services also face the challenges caused by climate change including temperature rise changed precipitation patterns and extreme weather conditions current water infrastructure is typically designed based on historical climate and environmental conditions how to operate such infrastructure in the wake of on going climate change is a critical question requiring complex answers similarly how new infrastructure should be designed and operated requires a new way of thinking the new design and operational strategies must account for changing climate conditions in order to reduce future risks to urban water management typically to overcome a lack of water supply we look for water sources which are often less accessible e g remotely sourced or from deep groundwater with substantially increased costs and environmental impact it is becoming clear that future cities must apply integrated solutions and manage the whole urban water cycle future water services will require the integrated use of multiple water sources such as surface waters recycled water stormwater and seawater there is also a trend towards a hybrid structure involving water production and wastewater treatment at both centralised and decentralised scales jones and olsson 2017 fit for purpose water production will also become more important as different water uses do not necessarily require the same water quality these strategies add another level of complexity to the already complex urban water system 1 2 ica in urban water systems an urban water system consists of several sub systems including catchments for water collection and storage water treatment plants water distribution systems domestic and industrial water consumption wastewater collection and treatment systems stormwater collection and retention treatment systems and receiving waters the recycling of wastewater and harvesting of stormwater at multiple scales are recent augmentations to urban water systems instrumentation control and automation ica is currently widespread in water and wastewater treatment plants ica attracted the attention of the water and wastewater industry in the early 1970s because many operators recognised that while treatment plants were designed for average loads the true load varies significantly over time olsson et al 1973 olsson 2012 therefore to date the primary function of ica has been to keep treatment systems running efficiently achieving the desired performance at an affordable cost in the presence of large fluctuations in loading olsson et al 2005 in recent years there has been a greater emphasis on the use of ica to improve the capacity of existing systems to cope with increased loading caused by population increase and urban growth in this case the use of ica defers the need for infrastructure upgrade which typically requires substantial capital investment such opportunities are available because conventional planning for increased drinking water demand and wastewater services involved designing the treatment plants to handle a sufficiently large volume as a result existing infrastructure has additional capacity to cope with higher average loads provided that there are proper methods to deal with the peak loads in this context ica can help attenuate the load temporarily shift the operational targets and temporarily or even permanently reduce the load notably most of the control systems used today focus on individual units in a sub system at most covering several process units in a sub system integrated control of multiple sub systems is still rare with the exception of combined sewer overflow control for the benefit of receiving water quality benedetti et al 2013 widening the perspective from individual processes to sub systems and then to the entire urban system is necessary considering the increasing complexity of urban water systems rodriguez roda et al 2002 contributed to this school of thought over a decade ago this transition requires systems thinking where the multitude of couplings between processes and individual controllers are considered beck 2005 all systems and components in the urban water cycle from the water source to the receiving water are parts of a whole system ica is considered an enabling technology for integrated urban water management the rapid development of sensors instruments and communication systems enables real time data collection from a wide range of process units across the entire urban water system while more powerful computers and advanced data analytics support system level optimisation achieving global rather than local optimum olsson 2012 however system wide ica is still in the early stages of development in this paper we review the current state of ica application in various components of the urban water system with a particular focus on the roles of ica in increasing the capacity of existing infrastructure to cope with future needs i e in sweating the assets we also identify and discuss new opportunities for ica including iot internet of things in the context of integrated urban water management 2 control architecture and methodology and hierarchy in an urban water system control systems consist of four key components the process the measurement the decision making and the implementation fig 1 presents a conceptual view of a simple feedback and a simple feedforward control system feedback control fig 1 upper is a powerful concept it can stabilise unstable systems and improve the reliability of poorly performing components the controller senses the operative state of a system compares it against a desired response computes corrective actions sometimes based on a model of the system s response to external inputs and actuates the system to effect the desired change this basic feedback loop of sensing computation and actuation is the central concept in control and this conceptual view is applicable to any processes alternatively feedforward compensation fig 1 lower is where we measure the disturbances and take anticipatory actions to compensate or cancel out the effects of the disturbance an example of feedforward control is measuring a concentration or a flow rate deviation upstream of a wastewater treatment plant and then correcting the plant operation to eliminate the consequence of the deviation however models are needed to determine how much compensation is required feedforward control is normally used for a fast anticipatory response while feedback control takes care of model inaccuracies in the compensation as well as unmeasured disturbances in an urban water system the aforementioned basic control concepts can be applied at multiple levels namely equipment level this involves controlling the actuators including pumps compressors valves and motors control at this level is not unique for water operations and is applied in all process industries however at this level the operation is limited in many water systems often the designer does diligent work in static design but leaves too little flexibility to manipulate the system to handle significant disturbances kukudis 1973 stated at the first ica conference arranged by iawprc predecessor of iwa even if we had the most sophisticated automated plant in existence it still would not be able to operate at maximum efficiency because the designs of wastewater treatment plants are based on uniform combined sewer flow without consideration for periodic intensity due to storm flow or periodic lows during dry weather spells or hours of least demand so much of the time the flow into the plant is either above or below the maximum efficiency level unit process level once the basic operations are functioning attention can be paid to the various unit processes usually controllers at this level are relatively simple i e based on one sensor and influencing one actuator the primary focus is to satisfy effluent quality requirements once regulatory constraints are satisfied operations can be optimised with respect to resource utilisation such as energy and chemicals sub system level in order to better utilise resources it is necessary to apply sub system wide perspective there are sequential couplings between various process units within a sub system this means that actions taken at a process unit will often affect downstream units in the case of a wastewater treatment plant recirculation also occurs between process units e g between secondary settlers and bioreactors which further complicates unit level control therefore it is necessary to apply a plant wide perspective and to implement integrated control of multiple process units to achieve plant wide optimisation entire urban water system level the goal to operate the complete water cycle as one system under one organisation is not new beck 1976 one good example for integrated control of multiple sub systems is the connectivity of a sewer system and a wastewater treatment plant wwtp with water quality in the receiving water body as the control objective in such a case the influent flow to the wwtp is no longer an uncontrollable disturbance but an internal variable of the combined system measurements and control in the sewer will obviously have a profound impact on the operation of the wwtp the final test of the accomplishment of integrated sewer and wwtp control is the receiving water quality feedback from measurements of the receiving water quality should guide operation of the upstream sub systems a natural consequence of integration is that each sub system cannot be optimised individually instead there must be compromises in the operation of each sub system in order to achieve the best for the whole system schütze et al 1999 olsson and newell 1999 ch 20 this is not an easy task and involves a lot of non technical issues related to governance and individual operator responsibility why should i run my unit process at a sub optimal level in order to help the other parts of the system i do not want to be blamed for low performance the principles of feedback and feedforward control are applicable all the way up to high level strategic decisions the framework is always the same whereas the measurements the analyses and the decisions are different hence it is vital to understand this way of thinking in order for utilities to become smarter more robust resilient efficient effective and most importantly more sustainable ingildsen and olsson 2016 to maximise the capacity of urban water systems it will be important to systematically address challenges and opportunities of control such as translating the general goal of protecting the urban and natural environment into operational goals of urban water system control meeting the need for information with sensors sensors will provide a huge amount of online information about operations from real time basic equipment function to sophisticated water quality analysis on a slower timescale utilising the rich spectrum of analytical methods and computing tools to analyse raw data for interpretation into reliable and useful information that can form the basis for decisions developing sufficient control authority control methods can handle all possible operational challenges that appear in water supply and wastewater treatment systems can the controllability be increased by installing more actuators developing flexible actuator hardware that translates decisions into real actions in the urban water system and building an information management system with connectivity to sensors control computers actuators and people it is important to acknowledge the role of people in the control systems outlined previously particularly at upper levels forming human in the loop hitl control systems in this case the machine system serves to collect and transmit data provide early warning and analyse the data to provide information to operators managers who make the operational management decisions to be implemented through the control system the feedback and feedforward principles are still the underpinning methodology with the rapid development of machine learning and artificial intelligence humans may eventually be replaced by machines in this complex decision making process this will be further discussed in section 6 in any case systems thinking is the key to integrated urban water management beck 2005 the tasks described are a challenge for control and systems engineers and due to the truly cross disciplinary nature will also influence urban planners architects civil electrical chemical and mechanical engineers as well as non technical specialists in human and social systems it should be noted that water has been recognised as a crucial topic for electrical engineers by ieee the institute of electrical and electronics engineers and for mechanical engineers by asme the american society of mechanical engineers water is certainly a topic not only for water professionals however we water professionals must reach out and try to understand what we can expect from other specialists in order to solve the water system challenges 3 ica in water supply systems water supply systems are large and complex requiring significant economic investment for construction maintenance and operation therefore in the last few decades many researchers have focused on the optimisation of these systems including minimising energy requirements early detection and localization of leaks and meeting customer demand at minimum cost the optimisation of water distribution systems wds have become even more important recently as increasing water demand and dwindling available sources due to climate change cause additional stress on wds it is imperative to find the best solutions able to meet service requirements with the minimum economic and environmental impact the following sections highlight the benefits and possibilities in application of ica to manage water supply systems in particular for water treatment processes for the design and operation of wds for the detection of leaks and for customer water demand management 3 1 ica in drinking water treatment plants in recent decades most drinking water treatment plants dwtps have been automated for consistent operation the use of automated operation increases objectivity and alleviates the problem of variable and contradictory heuristics between operating personnel olsson et al 2003 however for the first automation projects the goal was to operate the dwtps in the same manner as human operators therefore the configurations consisted of a heuristic control strategy based on historical operator experience there is currently a shift in the operation of dwtps from experience based to knowledge based driven by the actual state of the plant the use of feedforward and feedback control in various units in dwtps enhances the water quality as well as reduces the operational costs for example van schagen et al 2010 developed a design method for the control of dwtps which focuses on disturbance identification and using control to take known disturbances into account using this design method chemical usage was reduced by 15 in the softening treatment step thereby also reducing the maintenance effort the previously existing control was deduced from steady state calculations but when taking into account dynamic disturbances such as changing water temperature the steady state optimum was not achieved the new design method focuses on disturbance rejection keeping the process condition close to optimum coagulation followed by separation is one of the most important treatment processes for drinking water treatment worldwide several million tons of metal salts al or febased coagulants are used annually for water and wastewater treatment costing multiple billions of us dollars pa ratnaweera and fettig 2015 the on line control of coagulant dosing in water treatment has been extensively studied as reviewed in dentel 1991 ratnaweera 2014 and ratnaweera and fettig 2015 feedforward control with chemical dosing rate determined based on the measurements of feedwater flow rate and feed water quality e g turbidity ph conductivity and temperature in some cases is the most commonly used approach this is typically done by establishing an empirical relationship between the dosing rate and the flowrate and feedwater quality parameters based on operational or experimental data the relationship is subsequently used to calculate the dosing rates on line based on real time measurements of water quantity and quality parameters the feedforward controllers are in some cases augmented by feedback loops with controlled variables being water quality parameters of the coagulant dosed water or finished water e g streaming current ph turbidity and size shape and strength of flocs formed after coagulation full scale demonstration of a feedforward feedback algorithm delivered better water qualities compared with the feedforward only controller although chemical consumption was not reduced liu and ratnaweera 2016 it was showed however savings in chemical consumption of 3 7 15 5 could have been achieved if the control objective was only to avoid over dosage rather than to also simultaneously improve water quality coagulant dosing control in ultrafiltration uf which is often used prior to reverse osmosis for solids and organic matter removal has also been studied recently with the aim of reducing the uf membrane fouling gao et al 2017 presented a dosing controller that relied on real time tracking of cycle to cycle uf resistance after each backwashing the so called pb resistance the controller increased or decreased the coagulant dose depending on improvements in the cycle to cycle change in uf pb resistance the controller was implemented and field demonstrated on a pilot seawater desalination plant 18 000 gpd and shown to achieve lower pb resistance with reduced chemical dosing chew et al 2018 developed controllers to automatically adjust the filtration and backwashing time of a dead end uf to enhance its efficiency an artificial neural network ann predictive model was used to estimate specific cake resistance using transmembrane pressure and turbidity data the model prediction was subsequently utilized by two ann controllers to control filtration and backwash durations the water loss due to backwash was significantly reduced compared with a case with constant filtration and backwash durations due to increased filtration time in addition to achieving improved water quality and reduced operational costs ica has been used to level the production demand for dwtps in a survey conducted in the netherlands in 2011 involving all ten dutch water supply companies it was found that 57 of the total production flow was controlled by model predictive flow control the other 43 of production flow was controlled by level based flow control table 1 to compare the performance of level based with model based production control bakker et al 2013 switched off model based production control at five treatment plants for one week and compared plant performance with and without model based control in the level based control loop the production flow set point was directly related to the level in the reservoir the production flow set point increases decreases with the water level in the reservoir fig 2 a model predictive flow control algorithm consists of a short term water demand forecasting algorithm and a control algorithm for the production flow control the forecasting horizon is typically 24 48 h bakker et al 2003 the control algorithm calculates the production flow set point that matches the forecasted demand on the condition that the level in the reservoir stays between a chosen upper and lower limit with this method the water production was stabilised at approximately 2 000 m3 day throughout the day fig 2 as opposed to varying between 1 000 and 4000 m3 day without the forecasting facility this implies that with advanced model predictive control to attenuate the variation the treatment plant has the capacity to meet a much higher average water demand caused by for example population growth in addition to production capacity increase bakker et al 2013 also showed that the model predictive control led to better water quality and higher energy efficiency production variation was 3 8 times lower turbidity values were 12 28 lower particle volume values were 12 42 lower overall energy consumption was 1 0 5 3 lower overall energy costs were 1 7 7 4 lower the increased use of soft sensors in water treatment is worth highlighting soft sensors are computer models that calculate estimates of variables that are difficult to measure directly the estimates are based on other variables that can be more easily and or more frequently measured van schagen et al 2008 rietveld et al 2010 wuister et al 2012 and worm et al 2013 showed that quality improvements can be achieved by monitoring treatment processes using soft sensors for example the direct measurement of water quality for process optimisation is difficult changes in water quality often test the accuracy of the measurement device however water quality can be estimated using physical parameters such as pressure flow and valve position simple chemical parameters such as redox and conductivity and accurate models the mathematical models that can be used vary from white box models to grey box models if white box models are available the modelling effort for application in a new treatment plant is minimal the white box model can then be used to determine measurement accuracy directly without model calibration applying grey box models makes it possible to acquire more information from the plant data even without knowing the exact processes that are taking place moreover less modelling effort is required in comparison to back box modelling before the model can be applied to real process data however black box models are partly data driven and application is more plant specific than using a white box model 3 2 water distribution system optimisation water distribution systems wds comprise a set of pipes pumps valves and tanks arranged together to deliver water of suitable quality from the water source or sources to the final users wds are designed to guarantee a satisfactory level of service for a set of normal and abnormal operating conditions a typical operational challenge is the optimisation of pump operations which consists of finding a set of controls that minimises pumping costs while also meeting the system requirements the pump optimisation problem has been well studied in the literature using different formulations these include for example minimisation of cost lópez ibáñez et al 2008 minimisation of cost and number of pump switches savić et al 1997 and minimisation of cost and greenhouse gas emissions stokes et al 2015 various optimisation algorithms have been used including linear programming jowitt and germanopoulos 1992 non linear programming rastogi 1989 dynamic programming zessler and shamir 1989 genetic algorithm savić et al 1997 and ant colony optimization algorithm lópez ibáñez et al 2008 the optimisation of wds operation can potentially result in large savings the electric power research institute epri 2002 estimated that electricity costs for treatment and distribution are approximately 80 of the cost of municipal water processing and distribution this energy accounts for about 4 of the u s power generation in california 19 of the state s electricity is used to satisfy the energy requirements of water related uses california energy commission 2005 it should be noted however the majority of this energy is used by the customer for heating water and statistics from various countries show that more than 90 of water related energy use is in the home doe 2001 reffold et al 2008 kenway et al 2011 olsson 2015 despite extensive research on water related energy consumption and costs the application of energy and cost saving measures is still limited because often only a 24 h operational period is optimised given the variability in water demand applying the optimal pump regime developed for a specific period may result in failures or in sub optimal operation for other demand conditions to overcome these issues research is moving towards near real time control of pump operations where ica is fundamental salomons et al 2007 were the first in outlining the 3 step process 1 a tool e g an artificial neural network to predict the daily demands is required 2 the wds hydraulic model with the forecasted demands is optimised and 3 the optimal pump regime is implemented measurement of the system characteristics e g pressures and tank levels are used to verify the predicted network behaviour and to initialise the next period of the optimisation supervisory control and data acquisition scada facilities are required for monitoring the network sending the data to the control centre and remotely implementing the optimal pump regime using recorded data salomons et al 2007 estimated an annual saving of 25 in energy costs for the haifa a case study in israel using the same methodology martinez et al 2007 showed that costs could be reduced by 18 for wds operation in valencia spain cost savings within a similar range were also predicted for a medium sized water transmission system in seoul south korea jung et al 2015 in order to save computational time and efficiently determine the optimal pump regime odan et al 2014 replaced the wds hydraulic model with a meta model based on an artificial neural network algorithm savings of approximately 16 were predicted in applying this methodology to a wds in brazil implementation of optimised real time control of pump operations was described by ganidi and holden 2014 after a first phase in which the optimisation model was tested off line a semi automated version was incorporated into the operational routine the telemetry data were uploaded automatically and the pump schedule was generated in an automated way however implementation of the pump schedule remained a manual process during this second phase 97 1 of all pump schedules were successful while 1 7 needed to be optimised again the remaining 1 2 failures were related to it and telemetry issues the conservative estimate of the savings carried out during the off line phase of the project was a 3 4 reduction in costs which corresponded to 217 000 year and 787 mwh year equivalent to a reduction of 428 tonco2 eq year in greenhouse gas emissions ganidi and holden 2014 demonstrated that real time control could be successfully applied to full scale wds however for the correct operation of the system the authors highlighted the importance of the quality and quantity of the measurements and that a shorter scheduling period 3 h instead of 12 h decreased the failure rate thus to improve the reliability of ica practical applications require faster optimisation algorithms other aspects of wds can also benefit from ica at a basic level instrumentation can be used to quantify parameters such as pressure and flow which can help monitor the system while off line data data that is collected and analysed at a later time is still beneficial for wds management analysing real time data can shorten the detection times of anomalies such as water leakages component malfunctioning and water thefts and reduce water and energy wastage and associated costs stoianov et al 2007 armon et al 2011 mounce et al 2010 measurements and therefore instrumentation are necessary to calibrate a wds hydraulic model e g salomons et al 2007 broad et al 2010 gibbs et al 2010 which can then be used to simulate the consequences of changes in the layout or operation of the network components the only full scale example known to the authors where measurements from wds sensors are automatically used to calibrate the hydraulic model is the wireless water sentinel in singapore allen et al 2011 this system allows modifications to the network to be automatically incorporated into the model so that engineers can assess the performance of the wds in real time ideally this could also be used to automatically modify the normal operation of the system in order to improve the service to the users well calibrated hydraulic models and good data are important in the expansion of existing wds where the design of the new part should take into account the existing parts in order to minimise the whole of life costs the minimisation of capital and operational costs has been investigated previously e g farmani et al 2006 wu et al 2010a but it is less commonly reported for complex case studies sa eea south australian engineering excellence awards 2010 brought to light an application of ica to deliver water from a desalination plant to the metropolitan area of adelaide south australia in this case the contribution of ica to the wds design was limited to model calibration however depending on the characteristics of the network it may have been possible to avoid the capital cost of system augmentation by controlling valves and pumps in real time this option although interesting is difficult to explore because of the uncertainty of water demand the numerous requirements associated with wds and the uniqueness of each case 3 3 leakage detection in water distribution systems leak management in wds is a significant problem worldwide water utilities lose a considerable amount of treated water due to leaks particularly in ageing water infrastructure for example the energy and water department of the world bank estimated that the total global annual cost of leakage to utility companies was approximately us 14 billion comprising 48 billion m3 of wasted treated water with a third of this occurring in developing nations kingdom et al 2006 in western australia it is estimated that 30 billion litres 8 4 of all water supplied was lost to pipeline leakage in 2012 13 oag 2014 australia s national performance report on urban water utilities for 2012 13 reports median real losses of 79 l c d litres connection day with outliers as high as 416 l c d for some utilities nwc 2014 in the united states an estimated 7 000 km of pipe requires replacement each year at a cost of us 2 7 billion while water losses estimated to be 10 are valued at us 4 3 billion per year whittle et al 2013 the challenge of leak mitigation requires a water entity to predict the size and location of leaks in a wds given measurements such as flows at certain locations pipe materials and age or acoustic measurements leak quantification is one part of the broader task of managing water losses in distribution networks by assessing detecting and controlling losses puust et al 2010 the main challenge of leak detection is to obtain reliable evidence on the size and location of leaks at a reasonable cost for equipment and effort leak detection methods fall into three categories based on the data source 1 data obtained outside the distribution network 2 data from sensors brought into the network at certain times and 3 data from a permanent network of sensors methods for the first two categories are well established fanner 2007 farley and trow 2005 farley 2010 puust et al 2010 mutikanga et al 2013 the third category is a novel approach for water distribution systems made possible by new sensor technologies at lower cost and improved telemetry shiddiqi et al 2018 decisions on the approach of choice for leakage reduction are ultimately cost driven although informed by governance regulations nwc 2014 fanner 2007 water utilities need to establish strategies that balance the cost of water with the cost of leak reduction for their own unique circumstances several low cost approaches exist for leak management managing water pressure throughout the network is a commonly used proactive method because leakage volume is positively related to network pressure maintaining network pressure as low as possible while still satisfying customer demand is a cost effective strategy for leak reduction puust et al 2010 fanner 2007 another low cost strategy is purely reactive i e water utilities respond to and repair leaks when they are reported by the public or staff fanner 2007 minimising the response time for repairing these reported leaks reduces water losses condition based maintenance methods use historical data to find correlations between pipe failure rates and factors such as pipe material climate and soil parameters this information can be used to prioritise pipe replacements before leaks occur pratt 2011 step testing is a top down method used since the 1980s for leak detection it subdivides a network by closing valves during minimum night flow to create district metered areas dmas flow meters are then used to measure the water balance within a district and this indicates the size of leaks in a locality farley 2010 to pinpoint the position of the leak acoustic logging ultrasonic sensing ground motion sensors or ground penetrating radar can be used puust et al 2010 leak noise correlation uses two microphones in contact with a pipe or valve stem on either side of the leak it can detect a leak position to within 1 m and is most effective for clean small diameter metal pipes in high water pressure areas puust et al 2010 but not suitable for plastic pipes a network of permanent sensors can be used to monitor pipeline distribution systems continuously in order to detect anomalies such as leaks shiddiqi et al 2018 recent developments of new types of sensors with lower costs and better telemetry are making this approach more reliable and cost effective examples of new sensor technologies include ultrasonic and electromagnetic flow meters and flow meters that can be inserted directly into a pipe farley 2010 sensor network leak detection uses a combination of sensed field measurements from the network hydraulic models and machine learning algorithms leak detection can be posed as an inverse problem system characteristics such as flows in pipes pipe length network topology and pipe diameters are known while leak size and location are unknown pudar and liggett 1992 solving a system of non linear hydraulic modelling equations for the unknowns enables leak predictions to be made sensor networks provide current flow information for predicting leaks in an early study de silva et al 2011 used a machine learning algorithm to train a support vector machine as the classifier for leak size and location based on pressure measurements in the network however they reported low accuracy for their classifier the epanet hydraulic model has been combined with a rule learning algorithm to generate human readable prediction rules for quantifying leaks cardell oliver et al 2015 leak signatures can be used to optimise the placement of a limited number of sensors shiddiqi et al 2017 these methods allow for measurement uncertainty and can optimise the number and placement of flow sensors allowing trade offs to be made between prediction accuracy and network cost wu et al 2010b used a genetic algorithm to determine the hydraulic model that gives the best explanation of leak position and size to account for known pressure and flow values in a pipeline network possible areas of water loss were narrowed down under low flow rate conditions but the model could not identify the size of leaks or their precise location only a few studies have reported industry trials of leak detection methods the waterwise project in singapore has tested real time monitoring of a wds using a wireless sensor network and a suite of decision making algorithms whittle et al 2013 with a focus on minimising cost the system can detect and locate burst leaks and monitor hydraulic parameters burst detection is performed using transient pressure signals triangulated from relative time difference of arrival measurements from network sensors the intelligent water network of victoria australia reported practical field trials of several sensor technologies the trials showed that flow sensors and acoustic sensors are more effective than pressure sensors for identifying small leaks teo 2012 leak detection using permanent sensor networks is a promising approach but there are many open research problems research is needed to address the multi objective problem of trade offs between leak detection accuracy and the type and placement of sensors emphasis should be placed on establishing design principles for new infrastructure to facilitate leak detection as is now common for dmas farley 2010 practical demonstrations of novel sensing technologies and techniques as reported by teo 2012 and whittle et al 2013 are needed in order for industry to adopt new leak detection methods 3 4 smart metering for customer water demand management water conservation targets such as a 15 demand reduction by 2030 water corporation of western australia 2009 are common in the water industry achieving these targets requires a detailed understanding of the patterns of water use that affect demand smart metering is a key emerging technology for discovering usage patterns that are needed for customer demand management data for this task is provided by smart meters that record end user consumption automatically each hour or more often and report it daily data mining methods are then applied for analysis of this data data mining can be used to answer four types of questions 1 explore e g what patterns of water use occur for a given population 2 explain e g how is water used during summer months when does highest water use occur 3 predict e g based on past history how much water will a certain individual use next week at what times and 4 plan e g how do current trends in water use inform future infrastructure planning several commonly used computer based methods that can transform data into useful information are reviewed in corominas et al 2018 customer demand has been studied using different types of water meter data low medium or high resolution low resolution data reports annual quarterly or monthly water consumption medium resolution has a period of one or more hours and high resolution has a period of seconds or minutes low resolution data has been used to correlate consumption with possible influencing factors including dwelling characteristics socio demographic attributes attitudes and beliefs and policy levers corral verdugo et al 2002 grafton et al 2011 fox et al 2009 syme et al 2004 jorgensen et al 2009 medium resolution data for large populations has only recently become widely available as water utilities deploy smart meters on a large scale cardell oliver 2013 cardell oliver et al 2016 there are only a few studies of pattern discovery in medium resolution data britton et al 2008 use smart meter data to identify customer side leaks and to inform a customer intervention program more generally water use signature patterns have been proposed to characterise leaks ad hoc and periodic usage patterns and their significance for individuals and for large populations cardell oliver 2013 high resolution data can be used to train a recognition system to identify human activities such as flushing a toilet taking a shower or running the dishwasher willis et al 2013 beal et al 2011 each of these activities is associated with a continuous subsequence of high resolution meter readings human experts label examples of these activities as they occur in a training set of smart meter readings for each user machine learning algorithms are then used to create an automatic software program that recognizes the same classes of activities in unlabelled meter data this training process is labour intensive and so current techniques are not suitable for analysing large populations nguyen et al 2013 another drawback is that only activities that have been identified by the trainer are recognised unknown unknowns in the data remain hidden for example relatively rare activities such as garden watering can play a significant role in overall water use but are challenging to recognize as activity sequences particularly when activities overlap one another the business case for smart metering can be difficult to quantify especially in the short term since the current cost of smart meters is relatively high compared with the price of water and achievable demand reductions apart from these costs recent industry studies have shown that effective customer engagement is critical for realising the benefits of smart metering atkinson and medbury 2013 devitt 2014 a significant economic benefit of reducing consumption can be the delay of capital infrastructure upgrades delays are beneficial because the cost of capital interest redemption and depreciation is typically a high contributor to water utility business costs for example one study estimated that a reduction of 10 in peak daily demand in the dry season could extend the life of a current treatment plant by 4 years devitt 2014 other benefits of smart metering include lower occupational health and safety costs related to automated versus manual collection of data and increased metering accuracy another important factor is to integrate smart metering insights into existing operations workflows to build trust and confidence for the end users patabendige et al 2018 automated pattern discovery in water use offers many opportunities for improving customer demand management research is needed on approaches that support more nuanced evidence based decision making for water conservation for example for large populations automatic methods are needed that combine data from water meters with contextual information such as climate data and customer demographics pattern discovery at the population level is also an area that promises significant efficiency gains for example segmentation of users with inefficient consumption habits can be used to prioritize customer engagement campaigns smart metering is a key technology for achieving these goals 4 ica in wastewater systems for many decades ica has been applied to wastewater systems consisting of sewer networks and wwtps initially control was limited to hydraulic processes but since the latter part of the last century control has been extended to biological and chemical treatment processes most of the conventional control systems are unit process oriented with the aim to enhance treatment performance leading to improved effluent quality and reduced energy and chemical consumption however there has been an increasing trend in recent years to design control systems that consider multiple units in the plant to achieve plant wide control and in some cases to control the entire wastewater system comprising sewers and treatment plants the use of ica for improving the capacity of wastewater systems to handle increased loading has also attracted considerable attention in the past decade the use of ica for the operation and management of wastewater systems will increase in coming years due to push and pull forces pull forces include continued population growth and urbanisation leading to increased wastewater load a continued increase in the complexity of wastewater treatment plant function and capability e g wwtps are now often called resource recovery facilities wrf and extreme weather conditions associated with climate change several technology push forces will make ica increasingly economical to implement with concomitant computational and instrumentation improvements there is an interesting trend towards smart sensors with multiple detectors and transmission abilities which can be placed anywhere in the process train actuators mostly variable speed drives for pumps and compressors make control much more flexible control theory and practice today can offer almost anything that the water operator would need 4 1 ica in wastewater treatment plants the control of unit processes in a wwtp is relatively mature some examples of state of the art unit process control include dissolved oxygen do control with a constant or a variable set point as part of the aerator unit process operation variation in the do set point is typically guided by nitrogen removal performance monitored with nutrient sensors aeration phase length control in alternating plants based on nutrients do ph or oxidation reduction potential orp measurements nitrate recirculation control in a pre denitrification plant based on nitrate and do measurements in the aerobic and anoxic zones external carbon dosage control based on nitrate measurement in the anoxic zone srt solids retention time control based on sludge inventory using turbidity data return activated sludge flow control based on proportional to the influent flow rate step feed control based on influent flow to limit sludge overloading of secondary clarifiers control of anaerobic processes aimed at stabilizing the process and maximizing the biogas production and chemical precipitation control based on local measurements of phosphate concentration it has been demonstrated that ica can increase the capacity of biological nutrient removal plants by 10 30 with further understanding and exploitation of the relationship between operational parameters and the microbial population dynamics and biochemical reactions combined with increased maturity of advanced online sensors the improvements offered by ica will likely be greater than 30 within the next 10 20 years comprehensive reviews of these control systems can be found in olsson et al 2005 2014 and olsson 2008 2012 a review of literature comparing different control structures for aeration is found in åmand et al 2013 and several lessons from full scale implementations of aeration control are documented in åmand et al 2014 ammonia based control can lead to energy savings through limiting aeration as well as reducing effluent ammonia peaks rieger et al 2014 over the years the function of a wastewater treatment plant has evolved from cod chemical oxygen demand removal only to cod and nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus removal and further to resource water energy and nutrients recovery consequently the complexity of a wastewater treatment plant has increased substantially with strong interactions among different process units such interactions represent both challenges and opportunities for ica interaction between different parts of the treatment plant can cause unintentional disturbances for example a sudden release of nitrogen rich sludge supernatant from an anaerobic digester back to the influent of the wastewater treatment plant will cause an unnecessary overload of the plant if it happens during the high load periods of the day fig 3 shows how the oxygen uptake rate increases significantly as the supernatant is recycled within the plant the controlled release of such streams during low load periods will beneficially attenuate the disturbance the interaction between different parts of the treatment plant can be positively exploited through integrated control or plant wide control to derive additional benefits for example the bioenergy recovery from waste activated sludge can be enhanced by controlling the sludge age in the secondary treatment to a level just allowing full nitrification this is because a relatively young sludge is more biodegradable giving a higher yield for bioenergy recovery this aim can be achieved through sludge retention time control olsson et al 2005 integrated control will be a key focus of control design in the coming years such an approach is expected to not only deliver benefits in terms of treatment efficiency and costs but also enhance the ability of a plant to cope with increased loading thus deferring plant upgrades one good example is the well known aeration tank settling technology nielsen et al 2000 during a storm event the flow to a wwtp is expected to increase by several fold this is the case even for separate sanitary sewers the hydraulic capacity of a wwtp is typically limited by its secondary settler as the solids loading to the settler during a high flow period can exceed its capacity nielsen et al 2000 proposed to switch off aeration and mixing in the last part of the aerobic reactor which feeds into the settler a few hours prior to the arrival of the stormwater the activated sludge settles in the reactor reducing the solids loading to the settler and the amount of solids to be buffered in the settler this significantly increases the hydraulic capacity of the plant which is highly desirable for plants operated in an era of climate change and extreme weather conditions sharma et al 2013 the paradigm shift from wastewater treatment to resource recovery is also leading to the development of novel processes in conventional wwtps energy contained in organic carbon is not recovered rather organic carbon is used to support denitrification or removed by aerobic processes that require much energy input the a b process has recently been applied at full scale with the aim to minimise aerobic oxidation of organic carbon and to enhance bioenergy recovery in this process the organic carbon in wastewater is firstly absorbed or bio assimilated by the activated sludge in the a stage the energy rich activated sludge is then passed on to the anaerobic digester for the production of methane as a renewable energy as a large fraction of the organic carbon has been removed from the wastewater in the a stage the b stage requires much less aeration hence less energy consumption in comparison to a conventional one sludge system as a result the aeration requirement is reduced in the a b process and a larger fraction of organic carbon compared to conventional activated sludge processes is converted to biogas in an anaerobic digester supported by this technology two municipal wastewater treatment plants in austria strass and wolfgangsee ischl treatment plants are achieving energy self sufficiency and also feeding surplus electrical energy from the plant to grid nowak et al 2011 however the organic carbon used for energy production in the a b process is no longer available for achieving a high level of nitrogen removal by conventional means consequently nitrogen removal processes with a lower carbon demand such as the shortcut process nitritation followed by denitritation are needed the ground breaking discovery in the early 1990s of unique microorganisms which carry out anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox potentially provides an alternative more attractive solution to the problem associated with the a b process anammox bacteria have the unique metabolic ability to combine ammonium and nitrite to form nitrogen gas strous et al 1999 through a partnership between ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and anammox bacteria completely autotrophic nitrogen removal via nitrite is possible aob consume a limited amount of oxygen to partially oxidise ammonia to nitrite while anammox bacteria convert residual ammonia and nitrite into nitrogen gas under anoxic conditions these novel process designs pose control challenges firstly the a stage should be operated such that a maximum amount of cod is absorbed adsorbed bio assimilated thus making more carbon available for bio energy recovery the manipulatable variables in an a stage process are similar to those in a conventional activated sludge process namely aeration sludge wastage flow and sludge return flow miller et al 2017 however the control objectives are different in a conventional activated sludge process the effluent cod and tss total suspended solids concentrations should be kept below their respective discharge limit in comparison there are no similar strict limits for the a stage effluent although lower levels of cod and tss in the a stage effluent are desirable when autotrophic nitrogen removal is employed in the b stage another important goal is that the mineralized carbon i e converted to co2 in the a stage should be minimised to enable maximum bioenergy recovery miller et al 2017 employed a cascade controller with an airflow feedback loop being the slave controller to control do dissolved oxygen at pre selected set points no obvious correlation between cod removal and do was observed in general the impact of do on the fate of organic carbon in the a stage reactor is not fully understood at present as cod removal in such a reactor involves multiple mechanisms including absorption adsorption bio assimilation as cells or extracellular polymeric substances and mineralization kinyua et al 2017 do level also affects sludge settleability and hence the effluent tss and vss volatile suspended solids levels more research is required to fully understand these effects before appropriate do set points can be identified miller et al 2017 trialled two controllers for the manipulation of the waste activated sludge flow one aimed to control srt at a set point by also considering sludge loss via the effluent different from a conventional activated sludge process where tss in secondary effluent can typically be neglected in srt control tss in the a stage effluent has a much higher concentration and thus a much higher impact on srt the srt controller therefore required not only an mlss mixed liquor suspended solids sensor in the bioreactor but also a tss sensor to measure the effluent this design failed as the controller was very sensitive to the accuracy of the sensors the other controller aimed to keep the mlss concentration in the a stage bioreactor at a constant level which was reported to be successful in the pilot plant study however the applicability of such a controller in practice is in question as mlss is sensitive to the influent flow and composition which vary substantially in full scale plants it makes little sense to keep a constant mlss level by increasing the wastage flow in a period when more cod is to be removed in a high load period possibly requiring more biomass or vice versa the control of returned activated sludge in an a stage system is similar to that in a conventional system i e to have it paced with influent miller et al 2017 kept at a constant level e g the average influent flow rate even more challenging is the provision of suitable conditions in the aob anammox reactor s such that aob and anammox bacteria develop in partnership while nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob are eliminated yuan et al 2008 online control of aeration is often necessary to out select nob through kinetic selection or through substrate competition with nitrite reducers ordinary denitrifiers or anammox bacteria for example online control to maintain a constant ratio between the concentrations of do and the total ammonia nitrogen bartrolí et al 2010 or between the concentrations of nh4 and no2 no3 also termed avn control regmi et al 2014 was found to favour nob out selection online aeration control to suppress nob based on ph lee et al 2013 yang et al 2007 gu et al 2012 and our oxygen uptake rate blackburne et al 2008 lemaire et al 2008 has also been reported a further challenge that future ica systems have to address is the mitigation of n2o emissions from biological nitrogen removal plants it is known that operational conditions such as do nitrite and inorganic carbon concentrations ph and biomass specific nitrogen loading rate play critical roles law et al 2012 among these factors do control has been used to mitigate n2o emissions for example based on simulation results ni et al 2015 the south australian water corporation australia replaced the previously adopted intermittent aeration strategy with a continuous aeration system with do concentration controlled at 0 5 mg o2 l and achieved a 30 reduction in n2o emissions from a full scale sequencing batch reactor personal communication with dr ben van den akker sa water the integrated control of multiple operational parameters to minimise n2o emissions in biological nitrogen removal while deemed to be necessary is yet to be developed and demonstrated 4 2 flow control in sewer systems the primary function of a sewer system is to transport wastewater and stormwater in the case of a combined sewer away from the community to a wastewater treatment plant to protect both public health and the environment correspondingly the two key objectives for sewer flow control are 1 to prevent wastewater spill and flooding during its transport and 2 to minimise the impact of wastewater on the receiving water the latter in particular should involve the integrated control of sewers and wwtps with the quality of the receiving water as the ultimate goal fu et al 2008 dong et al 2012 4 2 1 sewer flow monitoring and prediction in contrast to a wwtp a sewer is a distributed system the two key requisites for sewer flow control are sensors that can be widely deployed at key locations in the system and accurate dynamic models that can predict flows across the network based on somewhat limited sensor data sensors for online measurement of water velocities water levels and rain intensities are available and have been widely deployed for sewer monitoring it should be noted that flow measurement in sewers may not be as trivial as expected as flow rates in sewers are typically low leading to large relative errors when a sensor has a limited accuracy also the location of a flow sensor is important since the accuracy may depend on the position of the device mignot et al 2012 sewer sensors are currently being developed with iot internet of things capacity with built in wireless telecommunication abilities for known reliability low power consumption and low costs this new development will enable the acquisition of much larger volumes of data from sewer networks this aspect will be further discussed in section 7 2 in addition to physical sensors software sensors have also been developed to estimate unmeasured parameters from other sensor signals for example chen et al 2014 estimated the sewage flow rate into a pumping station based on the on off timing of a pumping station the method made use of the fact that at an intermittently operated pumping station the pump is turned on when the water level in the wet well reaches a pre defined upper water level and turned off when a pre defined lower water level is reached as such the average water flow entering the pumping station between the off time in the previous pump cycle and the on time of the current cycle must be equal to the known wet well volume between the upper and lower water levels based on a similar principle the authors also developed an algorithm to estimate sewage flow entering a continuously operated pumping station in this case the algorithm requires continuous monitoring of the water level in the wet well chen et al 2014 in a slightly more complicated case ahm et al 2016 calculated the volume of combined sewer overflow cso by estimating flow rates based on level measurements the data driven software sensor was developed by correlating the physical water levels and discharges the authors achieved good accuracy when the estimates were compared with electromagnetic flow measurements another software sensor concept was based on computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations of the physical layout of the cso structures this software sensor is an independent estimation and does not need any calibration to discharge measurements the real time simulation of flows in a network requires prediction of the flows entering the network based on real time monitoring chen et al 2014 developed a methodology for predicting future flows a few hours ahead using an arma auto regressive moving average model and multi step iterative prediction this methodology was validated with flow data collected from two pumping stations with different flow characteristics and different wet well storage capacities the proposed methodology was shown to be capable of predicting future flow rates with good accuracy under both dry and wet weather conditions li et al 2019 extended the arma model into an armax auto regressive moving average with external input model with real time rainfall data as an external input the armax model was shown to substantially reduce the prediction delays associated with the previously developed arma model li et al 2019 for a given network the flow profiles across the network can theoretically be predicted in real time harremoës and rauch 1999 once all the external flows entering the network are known measured and or predicted indeed dynamic models have increasingly been used for simulation of the hydraulics of sewer systems pollution transport in the sewer is often included in such simulations as it is highly important for estimating the pollutant load to the treatment plant or to the receiving water when csos occur however there is often a high level of uncertainty associated with such simulations particularly for large networks for a number of reasons including inflow and infiltration that are often unaccounted for see 4 2 2 it is necessary to perform additional physical measurements of hydraulic parameters e g velocity and levels within the network in order to verify model predictions an important question here is how many flow rate and level measurements are required to get a confident picture of the hydraulics of the sewer system the more measurements the higher the confidence however there must be a balance between cost of measurements and accuracy of the estimated parameters or state variables of the system 4 2 2 estimating inflow and infiltration one of the challenges for real time prediction of wastewater flow through a network is the uncertainties associated with inflow and infiltration i i which are often un or inadequately accounted for during the prediction inflow and infiltration of unwanted water in the sewer system is not desirable since this will lead to a substantially higher hydraulic load to a wwtp de bénédittis and bertrand krajewski 2005 ellis and bertrand krajewski 2010 beheshti et al 2015 in australia for example it has been found that sewer i i could raise sewage flow rate in a sanitary sewer to several times that of the dry weather chen et al 2014 li et al 2019 obviously any reduction in the i i will decrease the probability for cso or an overload of the treatment plant there are various methods to detect localize and quantify i i in sewer systems traditional methods to estimate the i i are based on flow rate measurements analysis of diurnal flow and load variation and balancing of water inputs and outputs ellis and bertrand krajewski 2010 flow rate methods are typically used off line the tracer test is another off line method one qualitative online monitoring method is based on temperature measurements fibre optic distributed temperature sensing dts can measure temperature with high resolution and frequency this method has been widely used in other industries for example to detect fractures in oil pipelines vosse et al 2013 schilperoort et al 2013 stormwater inflow can be detected as long as the temperature of this inflow differs from the in sewer temperatures langeveld et al 2012 online conductivity measurements have also been used to estimate rainfall derived i i when overflow happens at the same time zhang et al 2018b usually it is difficult to distinguish between the two phenomena variations in the flow and water quality during dry weather conditions were analysed using fast fourier transform and a model was developed for estimating the rainfall derived i i based on conductivity data the method has been successfully tested for light medium and heavy rains 4 2 3 sewer flow control to prevent sewer spill and flooding sewer spill and local flooding should be avoided to protect public health often the first notification of a spill comes from a member of the public hours and sometimes days after the first spill the challenge is to find a way to predict the spill before it happens so that appropriate actions can be taken in a timely manner sewer spill can happen when sewer lines are blocked a common pump problem in sewer operations is clogging caused by rags pre moistened wipes and other consumer goods marketed as flushable this causes sewage backups in the collection system indeed the pump clog problem is increasingly caused by the use of flushable wipes one solution that has been applied is installing a special impeller that helps to counterbalance hydraulic forces and create a balanced single flow path that passes problematic flushables an early warning approach has also been used where the online monitored flow rate is compared with the motor current a standard method in many pumping applications a rise in power consumption for a certain flow is reported as an early sign for clogging an early warning method for spills has also been developed by nukon http www nukon com au a model was developed using data from previous spills with the goal to find out if the model could detect a spill earlier than other methods one indicator is the time between pump runs a pump will start running when a wet well is filled the time to fill was identified for on peak off peak weekends and weekdays under normal behaviour the model identifies blockages by detecting abnormal time to fill behaviour for example if the fill time is unexpectedly long during peak times or the pump does not run it is an indicator of abnormality or possible blockage the model has been tested successfully and could detect historical blockages more than 12 h before they were reported by a customer high sewer flows during wet weather when exceeding the hydraulic capacity of the sewer system also cause spill and flooding hydraulic predictions as outlined in sections 4 2 1 and 4 2 2 are needed to predict flows and the likelihood of spill and flooding and to guide operation the prediction often consists of coupled 1d drainage network and 2d surface models to predict inundation depths in the surrounding area as emphasized by savić 2017 the prediction horizon is crucial the model must provide enough lead time for the flood prediction so that necessary actions can be taken model simplifications of large networks may have to be realised so that the computations can be finished in time savić 2017 describes two methods fast overland flood modelling and data driven machine learning sewer surcharge modelling the overland flood modelling is realized by a 2d cellular automata model ghimire et al 2013 guidolin et al 2016 this approach increases the computational speed by about an order of magnitude compared to traditional methods the other approach is using machine learning where the model is updated using an artificial neural network ann model that uses computational data from several flood calculations via traditional models which is combined with rainfall radar forecasts duncan et al 2011 2013 the model is then compared to real events a similar approach is described by rjeily et al 2017 the flood risk is calculated by estimating the water depth variation within critical manholes the ann parameters describe how water depth variation in manholes is related to rainfall intensities it is crucial to find out how far the urban drainage system can be controlled and then know how to act if it is not controllable for example a gravity sewer has much less controllability than a sewer supplied with pumps as demonstrated in christchurch new zealand after the major earthquake in 2011 several pumps have been installed in the sewer system since to make it more controllable climate change is causing an increase in extreme wet weather events kleidorfer et al 2018 analysed a heavy rain event in austria the authors emphasize that the models may be calibrated for more common events like a 10 year rain event however data for extreme and rare events is seldom available which makes flood prediction models unreliable because the relationship between rainfall intensities and flooding is nonlinear some actions may have to be taken outside the drainage system to reduce the flooding risk one approach to deal with the sewer capacity problem is to store rainwater at source which decreases the flow into the sewer butler and parkinson 1997 this also enables rainwater harvesting and use after treatment see section 5 it was realized early kollatsch 1993 that the exclusion of stormwater from urban wastewater would be the most important measure to obtain more efficient drainage systems 4 2 4 integrated control of sewer networks and wastewater treatment plants the sequential relationship between the sewer the wwtp and the receiving water is obvious and the need for control of flow in the sewers for the benefit of the downstream components was recognized early for example sewer control was applied in the early 1970s in cleveland usa kukudis 1973 during dry periods flow equalisation was employed during storm periods the system was primarily designed to capture and treat the first 20 min of flow i e the first flush any water which was bypassed out of necessity after the first period would have been heavily diluted a sewer flow control strategy integrating sewers and wastewater treatment plants seeks to prevent or reduce the detrimental direct discharge of wastewater into receiving water due to sewer overflow an integrated control strategy can be used to equalize flows to the treatment plants in particular during wet weather when wastewater flow rates varying substantially the two key requisites for successful implementation of integrated control are accurate dynamic models for both systems and reliable sensors following the advent of deterministic models of integrated drainage approximately two decades ago integrated control was investigated by several groups mostly in europe nielsen et al 1996 bauwens et al 1996 pfister et al 1998 rauch and harremoës 1996a 1996b 1999 schütze et al 1999 nearly all investigations focused on semi virtual cases utilizing simulation studies while the implementation was demonstrated through computer modelling the infrastructure studied was real and these theoretical studies demonstrated the potential of integrated control paving the way for practical implementation the early studies extensively researched stimulations based on models and control concepts e g weinreich et al 1997 pleau et al 2001 schütze et al 2002 zacharof et al 2003 erbe and schütze 2005 butler and schütze 2005 vanrolleghem et al 2005 benedetti et al 2008 case studies e g erbe et al 2002 seggelke et al 2005 and novel optimisation methods e g brdys et al 2008 muschalla 2008 an overview of these developments can be found in schütze et al 2004 rauch et al 2005 olsson and jeppsson 2006 beeneken et al 2013 and garcía et al 2015 among these olsson and jeppsson 2006 emphasised the role of plant wide control and considering the inflow while various control structures and algorithms have been presented it is difficult to compare the benefits of these methods since the systems and the operating conditions are not identical a similar dilemma was expressed in the early 1990s concerning wastewater treatment control this led to the development of a benchmark system called the benchmark simulation model bsm that has been extremely successful in testing and comparing control strategies for wastewater treatment systems gernaey et al 2014 based on a similar philosophy a benchmark scheme for urban drainage systems astlingen has now been developed by working group integral real time control of the german water association dwa schütze et al 2018 following development of the models researchers together with operators developed the necessary technologies and experience for reliable online monitoring of sewer systems which complemented the more established monitoring of the treatment plants online sensor development together with data quality control proved to be a significant step forward for implementation bertrand krajewski et al 2003 gruber et al 2005 rieger and vanrolleghem 2008 métadier and bertrand krajewski 2012 schilperoort et al 2012 vezzaro et al 2013 recent developments include the use of distributed sensing via fibre optics hoes et al 2009 novel concepts for extracting information from sensors dürrenmatt et al 2013 and the implementation of low power consumption wireless telecommunication in particular the latter has potential for major innovation as it allows for spatially refined high density information integrated control is now being achieved in full scale application e g eindhoven in the netherlands weijers et al 2012 copenhagen in denmark grum et al 2011 quebec canada fradet et al 2011 and wilhelmshaven in germany seggelke et al 2013 although the number of successful implementations is still limited benedetti et al 2013 a key barrier for wider implementation of integrated control is the fragmented urban water management framework sewers and wastewater treatment plants are typically managed by different departments or entities which have different aims procedures and cultures thus the goals of sewer operation versus those of wastewater treatment are often contradictory a major benefit of integrated control is mitigation of sewer overflows particularly during wet weather while the prevention of sewer overflow brings direct environmental benefits it causes hydraulic stress to the treatment plant which may affect treatment performance in contrast while sewers can be used to equalise hydraulic load to the treatment plant thus improving treatment performance and potentially reducing aeration costs aymerich et al 2015 such an operation does not necessarily improve the sewer performance in both cases the benefit is only apparent when sewers and treatment plants together are seen as an integrated wastewater system with a unified goal but unfortunately this is uncommon because cross discipline collaboration is not established easily another barrier to implementation is the absence of a standard solution a one size fits all approach is not feasible as each case is different and requires a tailored approach to design due to the inherent complexity and need for reliability capacity building is also another challenge as training of operators in how to manage the integrated system is critical 4 3 chemical dosing control in sewers for corrosion and odour management sewer systems are critical infrastructure for modern urban societies today s underground sewer infrastructure is the result of enormous investment over the last 100 years in the usa sewers represent an estimated asset value of one trillion 1012 dollars equating to approximately 7 of the current gross domestic product brongers et al 2002 however globally sewer infrastructure is under serious threat due to deterioration with an estimated annual asset loss of around 14 billion in the usa alone brongers et al 2002 sulfide induced concrete sewer corrosion costs billions of dollars annually and has been identified as a main cause of sewer deterioration us environmental protection agency 1991 under the anaerobic conditions typical in sewage sulfate reducing bacteria convert sulfate so4 2 in sewage to hydrogen sulfide h2s due to its low solubility in the wastewater hydrogen sulfide is emitted from sewage into the air space of gravity sewer sections sewage pumping stations and inlet structures of wastewater treatment plants on concrete surfaces exposed to air gaseous sulfide is oxidised forming highly corrosive sulfuric acid water utilities around the world have focused on the removal of sulfide after its formation incurring mitigation costs comparable to the value of asset losses there are currently several methods to control this sulfide induced problem with chemical dosing being the most widely used according to a recent survey conducted among the major water utilities in australia ganigué et al 2011 the commonly used chemicals for sulfide control in sewers include oxygen and nitrate which both oxidise sulfide iron salts to precipitate sulfide and magnesium hydroxide to elevate ph thereby decreasing hydrogen sulfide transfer from the liquid to the gas phase the way chemical dosing is conducted has not only a major influence on the effectiveness of the chemical on sulfide control but also significant implications for operational cost controlling chemical dosing in rising main sewers ganigué et al 2011 is very challenging due to the plug flow behaviour of a sewer system according to the same industry survey ganigué et al 2011 flow paced or profiled dosing strategies are used at the majority of dosing sites these strategies which are commonly based on empirical guidelines developed through experience de haas et al 2008 can lead to over or under dosage as sewers have a distinct dynamic behaviour with large variations in sewage flow and characteristics occurring throughout the day week and year additionally rainwater inflow and infiltration may dilute sewage and decrease its hydraulic retention time within the pipe dramatically reducing the amount of chemical required for suitable sulfide control online control of chemical dosing of magnesium hydroxide to a rising main was studied recently by ganigué et al 2016 fig 4 the controller consisted of three components the first being a local feedback controller which raises the sewage ph to the set point before it is pumped into the rising main pipe the second component was a feedforward controller which adds additional magnesium hydroxide to the sewage while it enters the pipe to neutralise the predicted acid production in sewage while it is being transported through the pipe the third component was a feedback controller that makes further adjustment to the dosing rate based on the long term average ph at the end of the pipe in a two month field study at a pumping station with a total average dry weather flow of 12 ml d followed by a rising main with a total length of 5 29 km and a pipe diameter of 600 mm the chemical consumption was reduced by 15 at the same time the ph variation at the end of the pipe was also reduced substantially a similar method was applied to iron salts dosing for sulfide control through precipitation ganigué et al 2018 the controller was applied to a 10 km sewer main with diameters varying between 603 and 750 mm and an average dry weather flow of 21 ml d the control system achieved 25 savings in chemical consumption combined with better sulfide control performance ganigué et al 2018 to support the design of the aforementioned controllers chen et al 2014 developed a methodology for real time future flow prediction in sewers based on arma models and multi step iterative prediction the validation of the model and a later developed armax model with real time rainfall data as an external input using real sewer data have been described in section 4 2 1 online control of chemical dosing with real time sewer flow prediction using these models was tested through simulation studies chen et al 2014 li et al 2019 and yielded improved control performance and reduced costs liu et al 2013 extended the control design from a single pipe to a more complex system by controlling the dosing and pump operations via hybrid automata control strategy sulfide control was achieved across a network 5 control of stormwater systems flooding and environmental degradation due to polluted urban discharges are managed using a variety of structural and non structural stormwater management options in the 20th century large stormwater drainage gutter pipe channel systems were introduced alongside wet and more often dry detention and retention basins to manage pluvial flooding stormwater quality management is more recent started in late 1980s and is applied through water sensitive urban design systems such as wetlands ponds swales and biofilters also known as bioretention systems or rain gardens wong et al 2013 over the past 10 15 years rainwater and stormwater harvesting was introduced at an unprecedented scale in some regions that experienced prolonged droughts grant et al 2012 for example rainwater tanks are used at large scale in australia for irrigation of urban gardens and toilet flushing ferguson et al 2013 over the past 50 years the complexity of stormwater management increased enormously because stormwater is regarded and managed as both a nuisance and a valuable water source some stormwater structural measures can serve more than one purpose rainwater harvesting rwh systems such as rainwater harvesting tanks rwht are good examples of multifunctional systems they can provide an alternate source of water while serving as detention retention for roof runoff that would otherwise be discharged into the stormwater network leading to potential flooding and pollution however to achieve these often competing multiple objectives the rwh systems have to be controlled often in real time control of rwh systems is a recent innovation with only a few being demonstrated in practice control of rwht can be via 1 a passive system that slowly releases accumulated water between two rain events and therefore prepares the tank to detain runoff from the next event or 2 an active system that uses real time control to purge accumulated rainwater before a large storm event the benefits of passive rwht have been demonstrated by several desktop studies e g herrmann and schmida 1999 melville shreeve et al 2014 bishop et al 2013 burns et al 2012 only a few passively controlled tanks have been installed and monitored in australia e g burns et al 2012 and in the usa e g debusk et al 2012 it can be speculated that the efficiency of stormwater infrastructure could be much improved if active controls are included in the traditionally passive systems a good example of an active rwht system installed in new bern north carolina usa is presented in debusk et al 2012 the system captures runoff from 290 m2 of rooftop into five plastic tanks of 12 300 l in total water is extracted from the tanks using a pump for garden irrigation the system is equipped with an rtc device optirtc by geosyntec https www optirtc com that automatically releases stored water based on real time forecasted precipitation and current conditions within the rwh system using forecasted precipitation from the national weather service of the usa the device triggers the rwh system to slowly release a given amount of water to ensure that the rainfall can be captured water is released before the critical storm events only if there is insufficient storage capacity within the tank to accommodate the forecasted precipitation the maximum amount of water released by the system is equivalent to the volume of water associated with a 1 year 1 h storm event to meet the state water quality target this system has been monitored but so far no data have been published in open literature another example of rtc rainwater tanks has been installed by south east water in melbourne australia this talk tank releases water based on forecast data using a mobile phone app to manage i e monitor and purge water volume in the tank only in the past few years have rtc systems been considered for management of stormwater discharge quality a good example is an active stormwater tank installed as a part of drainage system in quebec city in canada where the stormwater detention time is actively controlled to manage both the available storage volume for flood protection and whenever possible quality of realeased water muschalla et al 2014 gaborit et al 2013 recent laboratory based work has also shown that efficiency of typical raingardens for stormwater treatment could be highly improved if an rtc system is included the quality of treated water using an actively managed raingarden could improve to the point to enable safe stormwater harvesting for some non potable uses shen submitted in conclusion the application of ica technology in stormwater systems is in its infancy although modelling studies are showing that there is great potential 6 why is ica adoption progressing slowly in urban water management load variations in a wastewater treatment system are considerable compared to most other process industries the influent must be accepted and treated regardless and there is no returning it to the supplier water supply operations resemble electricity delivery where the customer demand cannot be controlled under normal circumstances the production at all times must adapt to the need these are just some of the features of urban water systems calling for the use of ica however the adoption of ica in urban water management is far behind other process industries there are a number of reasons for the slow progress in application of ica in urban water systems not only technical but also economic regulatory and social 6 1 economic reasons profit motives urban water utilities are not as sensitive to capital and operational costs as other industries water utilities or private operators rightfully place serious focus on compliance they are willing to employ safer but more expensive design and operational strategies to operate the systems comfortably within the boundaries rather than its more aggressive counterpart by taking up online control to operate the systems closer to the boundaries while these companies are under pressure to cut costs for their services customers have so far been willing to pay for the services product price the low product price of water has certainly been playing a critical role in slow uptake of ica the price per m3 of oil is 100 200 times higher than that of drinking water not surprisingly a lot of methods and instruments have been developed for leakage detection and localization in oil pipelines swift et al 2011 vosse et al 2013 schilperoort et al 2013 it is quite pleasing to observe that the value of water both economic and social is being increasingly recognised which has led to the development and application of more advanced leakage detection and localisation methods in recent years section 3 3 6 2 technical reasons some technical aspects of water operations give control a lower priority process dynamics most process units in urban water systems are inherently stable this means that online control is not required for ensuring process stability for example except for anaerobic sludge digesters virtually all units in an activated sludge wastewater treatment system can work stably without process control anaerobic sludge digesters will also operate stably if operated well below critical organic loading rates however it is increasingly recognised that connecting unit processes through recirculation creates internal disturbances often causing operational problems with increasing system complexity associated with these interactions the human ability to predict and handle all the consequences of disturbances is becoming a limiting factor the one end control objective of product quality unlike most other process industries where products are required to have a well defined composition water and wastewater treatment plants are typically required to produce effluents with contaminant concentrations to be maintained below certain levels specified in regulations such one end type of specifications can be met without process control through conservative design and operational strategies such as over aeration or over dosing of chemicals with concomitant costs as discussed the urban water sector is not overly sensitive to costs and consequently high effluent quality safety margins are often prioritised over operational costs take nitrogen and phosphorus removal as an example the economic goal would mean that the total effluent nitrogen phosphorus should be controlled as close as possible to the discharge limits with reduced aeration and chemical costs instead of keeping the concentration significantly below the limits the former goal cannot be achieved without online control but the latter can be through over design and conservative operation unfortunately a conservative attitude which outweighs the focus on costs prevents the use of advanced control even when the economic benefits are demonstrated ingildsen 2002 ch 11 online instrumentation the reliability of advanced online sensors such as nutrient sensors for monitoring wastewater treatment systems is a current limitation to ica application simpler sensors such as do ph flow and level sensors have long been proven to be reliable and robust with required level of accuracy and they can be used with minimum maintenance therefore such sensors have been widely used in the control of urban water systems in comparison more complicated water quality sensors such as ammonium nitrate nitrite and phosphate sensors which are critical for controlling biological nutrient removal and recovery processes are far less reliable and require more frequent maintenance this has resulted in an inadequate level of confidence in these sensors which has prevented wider application of the well developed control algorithms required by these sensors insufficient flexibility in design the coupling of design and operation in a control integrated design is seldom seen instead ica is often implemented as a complementary step in existing plants to improve efficiency or reduce costs inflexible design limits control potential and opportunities for example on off instead of variable speed pumps or compressors are often used and valves are often designed for most favorable pressure drop rather than for control 6 3 regulatory reasons the common practice at least in european countries is that laboratory measurements are the golden standard increasingly plant managers favour online sensors but face opposition from regulatory agencies which only accept results from manual sampling combined with laboratory analysis the fact that both laboratory analysis and online sensors are prone to errors is often discussed but has not led to meaningful changes in practice one key factor is the need for better information and education there is a wide competence range among plant operation and online sensors may be used for measurements outside the recommended range this kind of misuse is often used as an argument against using sensors for operational oversight and compliance with good reason in an ongoing culture change sensor manufacturers are improving their product information and plant operators are being better educated and trained 6 4 the human factor the human factor involved in successful operation is often neglected though it can pose a greater challenge than the technology olsson and newell 1998 incentives and motivations of the involved stakeholders the public federal agencies provincial agencies local political leadership plant managers operator in chief and operators their interests incentives and pressures must be taken into account rieger and olsson 2012 for example do and ammonia control is implemented in many activated sludge plants however quite often the operator changes the setpoints to increase the safety margins for effluent quality the operator does not want to be blamed for not meeting the quality criteria but is seldom praised for saving electrical energy or chemicals the following summarises some critical elements of the human factor job protection automation of certain unit processes in wastewater treatment plants together with remote supervision has been applied since the early 1990s automation can lower personnel costs lumley et al 1993 however union resistance at many places has slowed progress towards automated operation education the need for education and training in design and operation was recognised early john andrews 1930 2011 noted in 1974 buhr et al 1974 a course in process dynamics and control is commonly found in most chemical engineering curricula we would be well advised to include a course in dynamics and control of wastewater treatment systems in environmental engineering curricula still today the need for training in dynamics modelling and control is insufficient hug et al 2009 beck 2005 expresses a similar view all the major branches of engineering except civil engineering the traditional disciplinary host of environmental engineering have integral elements of instruction and research addressing the operational performance of their products i e process control recently a truly significant contribution to better design has been the development of dynamic simulators which assist designers to mimic possible plant behaviour under various load conditions ogurek et al 2015 designer incentives treatment plant designers often have incentives to over design the system designing high capacity systems expands the safety margins and ensures that regulatory requirements are met in many cases there is a government subsidy for the investment capital expenditure in the system but not for operation giving another reason for high capacity design load variations create less impact in over designed plants thus decreasing the demand for control to attenuate disturbances 7 perspectives 7 1 integrated control of urban water systems integrated control of sewer networks and wastewater treatment plants was discussed in section 4 2 4 to date efforts have been mainly limited to the control of hydraulics with the goal of protecting the receiving water quality however integrated control certainly has the potential to go beyond basic performance improvements during wet weather discharges for example rebosura et al 2018 showed that iron dosing to sewers not only controls dissolved sulfide in sewage thus reducing sewer corrosion and odour but also removes dissolved phosphate in aerobic bioreactors where fes in sewage is oxidised regenerating iron ions for phosphate precipitation in this case the iron dosing rate in sewers should be controlled not only for sulfide removal in sewers ganigué et al 2018 but also for phosphate removal in the downstream wastewater treatment plant many other opportunities will be identified in the future in particular following recent advances in wastewater management progressing from pollutant removal to resource recovery sewer systems could be used to provide tailored pre treatment prior to arriving at a treatment plant for resource recovery these integrated approaches could be site and case specific integrated control of urban water systems should also expand to include the water supply systems water treatment and distribution network the interconnections between water supply and wastewater systems are clearly recognisable as it is the same water that flows through both systems residual substances in drinking water can affect wastewater composition as well as the chemical and biochemical reactions in sewers and wwtps for example pikaar et al 2014 highlighted the major impact of sulfate in drinking water on sewer corrosion and odour and called for the use of non sulfate containing coagulants in drinking water treatment the study suggested that if a sulfate containing coagulant is used e g alum its dosing rate should be controlled not only to reduce the operational costs for drinking water treatment but also to reduce impact on sewer corrosion chloride containing coagulants e g ferric chloride are an alternative to sulfate containing coagulants however while not having an effect on sewer corrosion the presence of chloride in drinking water may cause corrosion of water supply pipes indeed the cause of the flint water crisis flint michigan usa was lead leaching from aging pipes due to a high concentration of chloride hanna attisha et al 2016 it was found that the chloride to sulfate ratio is a critical parameter affecting drinking water pipe corrosion nguyen et al 2010 edwards and simoni 2007 the role of ica in ensuring this ratio is maintained within a safe range should be explored in the future sun et al 2015 identified a new possible connection between a drinking water treatment plant and sewers where a ferric based coagulant is used for water treatment the ferric containing drinking water sludge can be discharged to sewer networks laboratory experiments showed that sulfide control in sewers could be achieved through re use of iron in the drinking water sludge given the dynamics of sulfide production in sewers sharma et al 2008 2012 the online control of sludge dosing would be essential for adequate sulfide control future water services will be provided through the integration of multiple sources such as catchment water reuse water stormwater groundwater and seawater at multiple scales through both centralised and decentralised services considerable opportunities will arise for the use of ica to optimise overall water supply and system operation one such opportunity is the optimised scheduling of alternative water source use leading to attenuated peak demand for centralised systems this could potentially defer the upgrading of both water production and distribution systems and water treatment plants the use of decentralised wastewater treatment and reuse systems is increasing in the urban water environment one of the challenges faced is that small treatment plants are subject to extreme fluctuations in both inflow rates and wastewater composition the flow rates can be intermittent and wastewater composition can vary within minutes yet these plants must consistently produce effluent of a quality which complies with environmental regulations without professional engineers or operators on site ica can play an important role in ensuring stable operation and consistent performance olsson et al 2005 olsson 2013 wilderer and schreff 2000 another particular challenge for ica application to a small decentralised treatment plant is that monitoring has to be achieved through relatively simple low cost instruments such as flow ph level and pressure meters this is because advanced expensive sensors are not economically justifiable given the small scale however early warning systems are critically important for such systems and telemetry is needed for remote monitoring and supervisory control the use of decentralised systems will also have a major impact on existing wastewater services particularly on the sewer networks that collect and transport wastewater to centralised wastewater treatment facilities the increased use of decentralised wastewater treatment and reuse systems will change both the flow and composition of wastewater discharged to sewer networks in many cases sludge produced by decentralised treatment systems will need to be disposed to existing sewer networks due to the lack of cost effective on site sludge treatment and disposal opportunities these changes in practice have significant implications for in sewer sedimentation potentially causing sewer blockage and to the management of corrosion odour and greenhouse gas emissions in sewer networks to alleviate issues with sludge sedimentation in sewers the potential role for ica is to automatically control sludge discharge from decentralised systems in periods with high sewer flows increased aeration occurs in high flow periods and as such the oxygen demand of the biologically active wasted activated sludge discharged from decentralised wastewater treatment systems can be more easily met in sewer decreasing the likelihood of anaerobic conditions developing with the availability of stormwater harvesting another opportunity for ica application is the controlled use of stormwater for sewer flushing reduced wastewater flows and increased solids concentration in wastewater due to water conservation measures lead to increased solids sedimentation in sewer networks at some locations drinking water is being introduced into sewer networks to increase sewer flow completely defeating the purpose of water conservation and water reuse here stormwater is an attractive alternative to using drinking water the timing and duration of sewer flushing will depend not only on what is required to erode the sediments but also the stormwater availability while in pipe sewer flushing installations are common the use of ica to monitor and release stored stormwater for sewer flushing is uncommon but has great potential e g pisano et al 2003 integrated urban water management could reach beyond water the nexus of water and energy has been clearly identified olsson 2015 energy use in the urban water cycle should be analysed and considered from a total systems point of view as such ica is expected to have a significant role in integrated urban water management but opportunities are yet to be fully identified and explored future research is required to thoroughly and systematically address the challenges and exploit ica opportunities olsson 2013 the aforementioned examples show that opportunities for ica application will be case specific and that multiple benefits be achieved in an era of integrated urban water management 7 2 application of internet of things iot to urban water systems the internet of things iot an emerging collection of technologies is expected to have a major impact on the future of ica in urban water systems a search of internet of things on web of science search topic 11 july 2018 revealed that 249 iot articles were published in 2010 and this increased to 7 104 articles in 2017 out of a total of 23 295 publications this indicates iot has developed very rapidly in the last decade and is creating value through widespread applications the definition of iot is still evolving but it is commonly accepted that iot comprises the connection of physical things to the internet enabling data exchange based on low cost sensors and low power consuming wireless telecommunication these features distinguish iot sensors from traditional sensors and telemetry used for urban water systems and enables their deployment to a much wider range of locations and at much higher densities consequently the use of iot sensors allows the collection of much larger volumes of data possibly orders of magnitude larger compared to traditional sensors such large data sets enable machine learning or data driven modelling to provide support to online control or off line decision making a global trend in smart cities is the installation of sensors for surveillance of infrastructure including urban water wastewater systems however the application of iot sensors to urban water management has been limited relative to many other application areas in spite of this the value of iot enabled ica in comparison with traditional ica has been demonstrated in many case studies for example abdelhafidh et al 2017 used iot sensors for pipelines sensors cameras and rfid tags and water flow pressure and ph to enable real time management of a 50 km long drinking water pipeline han et al 2017 used iot sensing data for fast detection of multiple simultaneous pipe failures by reducing the detection time by orders of magnitude i e from hours days to minutes smart water metering which uses a digital electronic device that collects information on water use and sends it wirelessly to the water utility is an example of innovative and effective iot infrastructure for smart cities lloret et al 2016 the real time water demand data available to the utility and end users enables an understanding of consumption habits thereby supporting the development of strategies for improving network efficiency and contributing to water saving iot was also used with an artificial neural network model to understand human water use behaviour with different intervention procedures for improved and sustained hygiene practice fu and wu 2016 in addition iot was employed with scada for integrated drinking water production and distribution roy and mukhopadhyay 2016 iot has also found applications in urban drainage systems including wastewater and stormwater sewers the first and most successful application is the management of combined sewer overflow cso different neural networks including the recently developed deep learning method i e long short term memory lstm and gated recurrent unit gru have been successfully applied to predict the cso water levels based on real time iot sensors and rainfall zhang et al 2018a many commercial technologies have been trialled and implemented with success the ibm intelligent operations center dashboard built upon 116 smart valve sensors helped the city of south bend indiana usa to reduce wet weather wastewater overflows by 23 and almost entirely eliminated dry weather incidents such as blocked sewers clancy 2013 in europe severn trent water deployed more than 4 000 iot sensors over 94 000 km of sewers to monitor flow and to prevent blockage and sewage overflow brakoniecki 2017 the metropolitan sewer district of greater cincinnati usa developed a real time monitoring based smart sewer that reduces overflow at a cost that is 20 40 times lower as compared with other commonly used methods such as green stormwater controls and larger pipes gaskell 2017 onebox a smart sewer wastewater level monitor designed and developed by iota services australia was adopted by christchurch in the rebuild of the city after the 2011 earthquake dickers 2016 savings in capital cost was achieved through reduced peak flows and general flow management capabilities it has been reported that many major water utilities in australia are trialling or implementing iot sensors for monitoring and managing wastewater levels flow temperature and even hydrogen sulfide hoey 2017 the current application of iot in sewers is mostly limited to cso or blockage reduction however corrosion and odour are two important aspects of sewer management providing many opportunities for the application of iot technologies iot water quality monitoring in sewers could also provide wastewater data for improved operation of the downstream wastewater treatment plant wwtp the operation of a wwtp can be optimised using iot and analytics too ibm research haifa undertook an iot pilot to improve efficiency at a treatment plant in lleida spain zadorojniy 2016 zadorojniy et al 2017 the one year trial was successful through updating process operations every 2 h rather than adjusting on a seasonal basis the consumption of electricity use of chemicals for phosphorus removal and the production of sludge dropped by 13 5 14 and 17 respectively the overall effluent quality and compliance with regulation were also improved iot coupled with cloud based data analysis has proven useful for small wastewater treatment facilities in remote locations or small communities such as the imetland under development in europe libelium 2017 iot will likely become the backbone of next generation ica required for the success of integrated urban water management as a key attribute of smart cities more iot applications in urban water systems have become feasible because the cost and size of such devices continues to decrease while their capability for measuring different parameters keeps increasing data gathered through iot sensors can be used for many purposes through powerful big data systems e g hadoop and spark two distributed systems on the market to manage large data volumes and varieties there are many possibilities for application including prediction of system status flow consumption water level reduction in overflows detection of incidents and characterisation of water end user habits the power of advanced artificial intelligence such as deep learning in advanced data analytics real time control and decision making systems are yet to be fully realised 8 conclusions instrumentation control and automation ica are currently applied to various components of urban water systems with significant benefits reported the primary application of ica has focused on the control of various process units in water and wastewater treatment plants leading to improved performance reduced operational costs and increased capacity of the plants in addition diverse applications of ica include leakage detection and localisation in water distribution networks and motivating consumer behavioural change through feedback mechanisms leading to reduced water consumption future research will focus on the integrated control of urban water systems through properly recognising the connections and interactions between various units in a treatment plant and between sub systems in an urban water system ica will play a significant role in more efficient use of existing urban water infrastructure leading to system wide optimisation ica will enable us to better utilise existing assets and defer capital intensive upgrades that would otherwise be necessary iot will contribute intrinsically to ica applications and shows great potential with advanced

18923,microplastics have recently been detected in drinking water as well as in drinking water sources this presence has triggered discussions on possible implications for human health however there have been questions regarding the quality of these occurrence studies since there are no standard sampling extraction and identification methods for microplastics accordingly we assessed the quality of fifty studies researching microplastics in drinking water and in its major freshwater sources this includes an assessment of microplastic occurrence data from river and lake water groundwater tap water and bottled drinking water studies of occurrence in wastewater were also reviewed we review and propose best practices to sample extract and detect microplastics and provide a quantitative quality assessment of studies reporting microplastic concentrations further we summarize the findings related to microplastic concentrations polymer types and particle shapes microplastics are frequently present in freshwaters and drinking water and number concentrations spanned ten orders of magnitude 1 10 2 to 108 m3 across individual samples and water types however only four out of 50 studies received positive scores for all proposed quality criteria implying there is a significant need to improve quality assurance of microplastic sampling and analysis in water samples the order in globally detected polymers in these studies is pe pp ps pvc pet which probably reflects the global plastic demand and a higher tendency for pvc and pet to settle as a result of their higher densities fragments fibres film foam and pellets were the most frequently reported shapes we conclude that more high quality data is needed on the occurrence of microplastics in drinking water to better understand potential exposure and to inform human health risk assessments graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastics drinking water waste water surface water human health 1 introduction microplastics are generally characterised as water insoluble solid polymer particles that are 5 mm in size bergmann et al 2015 a formal definition for the lower size boundary does not exist but particles below 1 μm are usually referred to as nanoplastics rather than microplastic koelmans et al 2015 although microplastics are often detected in the environment the risks they pose are debated and largely unknown one key challenge in assessing the risks of microplastics to humans and the environment relates to the variability of the physical and chemical properties composition and concentration of the particles further microplastics in the environment are difficult to identify and standardized methods do not exist mintenig et al 2018 the dominant source of microplastics often is the fragmentation of larger plastics or product wear however the rate of fragmentation under natural conditions is unknown eerkes medrano and thompson 2018 these challenges and unknowns hamper the prospective assessment of exposure and risk koelmans et al 2017 in this uncertain field regulatory efforts to examine microplastic safety have been raised sam 2018a b the presence of microplastics has been reported for air samples food and drinking water efsa 2016 gasperi et al 2018 lusher et al 2017 van cauwenberghe and janssen 2014 wright and kelly 2017 yang et al 2015 and recently the implications of microplastics for human health have been reviewed wright and kelly 2017 although microplastic exposure via ingestion or inhalation could occur the human health effects are still unknown if inhaled or ingested limited data from animal studies suggest that microplastics may accumulate and cause particle toxicity by inducing an immune response deng et al 2017 gasperi et al 2018 chemical toxicity could occur due to leaching of plastic associated chemicals additives as well as adsorbed toxins diepens and koelmans 2018 sapea 2019 such effects are likely to be dose dependent however knowledge of exposure levels is currently lacking furthermore biofilms growing on microplastics may be a source of microbial pathogens gesamp 2016 hence although there are potential chemical particle and microbial hazards associated with microplastics current exposure levels including through drinking water need to be assessed first the ubiquity of microplastics of all sizes in surface water groundwater and wastewater sapea 2019 has raised the question if pollution of drinking water occurs to date there is only a limited number of studies that address this issue and they indeed reported the presence of microplastics in tap water and bottled water kosuth et al 2018 mason et al 2018 mintenig et al 2019b schymanski et al 2018 some of these studies triggered a great deal of attention in the scientific community as well as the media putting the issue of human exposure to microplastics via drinking water high on the agenda of public health agencies worldwide more broadly ensuring safe drinking water is high on the political agenda with a dedicated target on safe and affordable drinking water under the sustainable development goals sdg 6 who and unicef 2017 to date about 50 studies exist that provide concentration data for microplastics in drinking water or its freshwater sources i e surface water and groundwater as well as indirectly wastewater these studies provide data for specific types of water but methods of sampling isolating purifying and identifying microplastics vary enormously among studies a systematic review of methodologies used and study characteristics is currently lacking there are several scoping reviews that emphasise the relevance of microplastics in freshwaters eerkes medrano and thompson 2018 li et al 2018 wagner et al 2014 or that specifically discuss processes or models in freshwaters kooi et al 2018 we are aware of only a limited number of reviews that touch upon methodologies and concentration data eerkes medrano and thompson 2018 li et al 2018 besides variation in methodologies used and concentrations reported existing studies are likely to vary with respect to the level of quality assurance deployed the quality of microplastic research has been debated recently burton 2017 connors et al 2017 koelmans et al 2016 and has been quantitatively assessed for studies on microplastic ingestion by biota hermsen et al 2018 however a critical review of studies reporting concentration data in freshwater and drinking water which also evaluates the quality of applied sampling methods microplastic extraction and identification steps is currently lacking for chemical risk assessments in a regulatory context quality criteria have been set in order to be able to evaluate the reliability of data from toxicological studies kase et al 2016 klimisch et al 1997 schneider et al 2009 such criteria contribute to the harmonization of the hazard and risk assessments of chemicals across different regulatory frameworks recently hermsen et al proposed a weight of evidence scoring method for studies of microplastic ingestion by marine biota hermsen et al 2018 this method defined minimum quality criteria for various aspects of the analytical procedure such as sampling sample treatment use of controls and polymer identification it assigns a score for each aspect and provides a total reliability score for data reported in a study such a method can also be developed for the analysis of microplastics in freshwater samples and can be applied to quantify the relative reliability of reported concentration data the aim of the present paper is to critically review the available literature on microplastics in drinking water and its freshwater sources from a quality assurance perspective and by using a quantitative approach wastewater studies were also assessed as these are discharged into the environment further aims are to review data on concentration polymer type shape and size distribution data across studies guidance is provided to improve the quality of future occurrence studies our paper is organised as follows we first present the key areas that should be assessed to determine the reliability of studies these areas are presented in separate sections and are sampling method sample size sample processing and storage laboratory preparation and clean air conditions negative controls positive controls sample treatment and polymer identification for each of these areas we discuss quality assurance aspects considerations for scoring and present the assessment scores for each of these criteria subsequently the combined overall reliability scores are discussed followed by a discussion on implications for human health risk assessments in the section thereafter we discuss the outcomes of the reviewed studies an overview of the concentrations shapes and polymer types measured is provided and trends are discussed with respect to sample type location or system characteristics finally we provide recommendations to improve the analysis of microplastics in water samples and summarize the key conclusions 2 methods 2 1 literature search fifty five records from fifty studies reporting microplastic concentrations in drinking water 2 tap 3 bottled water or its freshwater sources 1 groundwater 30 surface water 18 wastewater were reviewed some studies reported data on microplastics in more than one water type most papers were retrieved from the scopus database search strings used were microplastic and bottle or surface or tap or wastewater or groundwater three studies were from the grey i e not peer reviewed literature and were found via google searches using the same or similar key word combinations searches were performed until august 2018 only those studies that reported original concentration data were reviewed 2 2 quantitative quality assessment the reliability of data in studies was evaluated based on criteria originally developed for microplastic in biota samples by hermsen et al 2018 and surface water samples by mintenig et al 2019a in prep the present approach further refines the method to different categories of water samples including tap or bottled drinking water surface water groundwater and wastewater the method uses nine crucial criteria which are detailed below criteria relate to those that are common in analytical chemistry such as reproducibility of described methods precision accuracy and sensitivity which together determine the robustness of an applied method reproducibility does not imply that another researcher would obtain the same result which is due to the variability in conditions inherent to nature reproducibility in the context of analytical chemistry refers to minimizing the contribution of random or systematic error to the total observed variability for each criterion a value of 2 reliable 1 reliable to a limited extent or 0 unreliable is assigned a total accumulated score tas is calculated by adding scores for individual criteria maximum 18 points tables 1 s2 s3 for data to be considered sufficiently reliable a study should preferably have no zero values for any of the individual scores hermsen et al 2018 2 3 study characteristics for each study the following characteristics were summarized in tabular form table s1 reference country area source water type treatment

discussion 3 1 quality assessment of studies reporting data on microplastics in water samples in this section methodological aspects are reviewed in subsections and the final total quality scores are presented and discussed following hermsen et al 2018 for each aspect scoring criteria are provided and each criterion is explained and justified table s2 such a score based quantitative evaluation does not result in an absolute judgment but is an indicator of the reliability of these studies for monitoring purposes and to inform risk assessments of microplastics in the drinking water supply chain the quality criteria provided here are considered adequate for the present assessment yet may develop over time with increased experience in sampling and analysing microplastics and better understanding of global concentrations here we review the general trends for details on specific studies the reader is referred to tables s1 and s3 3 1 1 sampling methods sampling methods were reviewed to understand the variety of approaches utilized to assess whether sampling was described in sufficient detail and to be able to define quality assessment criteria for sampling tables s1 and s2 surface water is sampled by pumping trawling or filling bottles or buckets followed by sieving to isolate particles of the desired size range table s1 li et al 2018 for wastewater samples are either grabbed with bottles pumped directly or collected with automatic composite samplers then sieved whereas tap and bottled water are directly sieved residues in nets or sieves are typically flushed into glass or metal jars or bottles to obtain a maximum score of 2 the date location and materials used should be reported specific further criteria were defined for wastewater surface water untreated and treated tap water and bottled water for wastewater the applied treatment type should be mentioned as this can impact the microplastic concentrations and should be considered when assessing retention or removal efficiencies of individual technologies for the same reason this should be done when taking samples on dwtps for surface water the depth of sampling should be reported as this may affect concentration kooi et al 2018 for tap water when the aim is to assess concentration in general running the tap before sampling is recommended e g 1 min in order to avoid incidental contamination from air wesch et al 2017 unless it is specifically mentioned that the aim is to measure the first portion of the water e g the first glass furthermore flowrate and source of tap water e g storage tank groundwater surface water should be reported as this may be relevant for data interpretation for the same reason for bottled drinking water the source batch production lot and bottled water type sparkling vs still water should be specified to maximize particle recovery from the bottle the sample should be shaken before filtration and the emptied bottle should be flushed three times with filtered water a score of 1 was assigned if a study provided a subset of the required characteristics e g date location but is still fairly reproducible about half of the studies score 2 on this criterion whereas only three studies score 0 3 1 2 sample size different factors were considered when recommending an optimum water volume to be sampled for microplastics the limit of detection can be seen as the methods capability of reliably detecting at least one particle with statistical rigor a sample volume that is too low reduces the chance of finding particles reduces the power of a study and increases the margin of error this means that detection limits benefit from large sample volumes similar approaches i e sufficient sample size are used when analysing chemicals in environmental matrices einax et al 2004 however for samples with particles samples should be small enough to prevent clogging of filters or sieves this means that recommendations for sample sizes will differ for different water types because the actual concentration cannot be predicted occurrence of non detects or filter clogging can never be fully prevented detection limits also depend on the particle size range aimed for in a study various studies have shown that smaller particles are more abundant cabernard et al 2018 implying that smaller sample volumes are required when exclusively examining small microplastics that are analytically challenging to detect e g 100 300 μm however if such a study would also aim to detect larger microplastics accurately a large volume would still be required establishing sample volume recommendations for studies primarily aiming for larger roughly 300 μm microplastics should consider both expected microplastic concentrations for a given water type and practical considerations most studies reviewed belong to this category that aimed to detect also larger microplastics in surface water 300 μm microplastic concentrations span a wide range of concentrations roughly 1 10 3 to 10 particles per litre fig 1 because of the low concentrations and ease of obtaining large volumes from surface waters we set 500 l as a minimum sample volume for surface water however given the often very low particle number concentrations in some lakes and rivers a volume greater than 500 l is recommended for remote locations for tap water range 1 10 4 to 100 particles per litre a greater sample volume is proposed compared to surface water we advise a minimum volume of 1000 l because of the concentrations that can be very low mintenig et al 2019b uncertainties with the representativeness of this range given the low number of studies identified and ease of sample collection for bottled water there were also a limited number of studies available yet they all demonstrate presence of at least several particles per litre such that even a minimum of 1 l would be defensible in case a 1 l bottle would be the study unit and only very small particles 100 μm would be targeted however the study unit in such studies is often the brand or production lot and also larger particles are targeted in which case we recommend to sample 10 l for a more representative result as bottled water usually is provided in volumes smaller than 10 l this would imply the need to either analyse multiple bottles or to treat the total volume of multiple bottles as one sample for wwtp influents where concentrations of particles are expected to be higher fig 1 a sample volume of 1 l is considered sufficient for wwtp effluent a sample volume greater than 500 l is recommended or a reported clogging of the sieve e g carr et al 2016 mintenig et al 2017 vollertsen and hansen 2017 ziajahromi et al 2017 these volumes mentioned would lead to roughly 5 to 500 particles detected which is considered sufficiently representative if the detection limit would be 1 particle as mentioned above use of these volumes would receive a maximum score of 2 however in some cases lower volumes have been used with good reason and may still yield fair results in these cases a score of 1 is assigned table s2 studies that explicitly aim for only smaller particles can use smaller volumes as long as detection limits are met and still receive the maximum score 3 1 3 sample processing and storage for the transfer of a primary sample e g material in a net or sieve to a storage bottle or for preservation or storage of samples before reaching the laboratory certain criteria need to be met some studies rinse jars bottles or other materials with targeted water e g kosuth et al 2018 talvitie et al 2015 however particles from that rinsing water could easily stick to surfaces and remain which thus would lead to contamination of the actual sample ideally sample containers should be rinsed in the laboratory with filtered water before bringing them to the field in general samples should be stored shortly after sampling and further handling avoided before arriving in the laboratory when sampling use of plastic materials should be avoided as much as possible to again minimize contamination many studies use a fixative like ethanol formalin or methyl aldehyde anderson et al 2017 baldwin et al 2016 eriksen et al 2013 fischer et al 2016 mason et al 2016a su et al 2016 wang et al 2018 xiong et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 2017 however the effects of the fixative on different types of plastic should be evaluated before application or studies should report evidence from the literature hermsen et al 2018 ethanol and formalin for instance have been shown not to affect polymer characteristics courtene jones et al 2017 some of the studies reviewed here used volunteers for sampling and sample processing christiansen 2018 kosuth et al 2018 citizen science cs approaches have been used in environmental monitoring and are increasingly being used in research on plastic debris liboiron et al 2016 syberg et al 2018 it has been argued that this may improve risk perception within society and therefore improve the foundation for timely and efficient societal measures syberg et al 2018 there is also an economic incentive to collect data with volunteers rather than by paid professionals and some monitoring research would even be impracticable if data were not collected by volunteers brett 2017 however concerns with respect to the quality of cs have been raised and validation studies have shown that the reliability of cs based data is highly uncertain brett 2017 other than for macroplastics quality assurance for sampling and sample processing of microplastics is technically demanding and the error rate can be expected to be higher for volunteers than for professionals since no cs validation studies for microplastics sampling and analysis exist to date it is not clear to what extent the quality of data is affected by having some of the crucial steps performed by non professionals therefore as scientific quality assurance is the primary perspective of this paper use of volunteers for major parts of the sampling work was considered less reliable leading to a score of 1 in case of validation of the adequacy of the protocols and 0 in all other cases for this criterion 3 1 4 laboratory preparation contamination of samples due to airborne polymer particles and fibres has been described as a major problem in microplastic analysis hermsen et al 2017 2018 torre et al 2016 vandermeersch et al 2015 wesch et al 2016 therefore to avoid contamination and prior to actual sample preparation and analysis certain measures need to be taken these include avoiding synthetic components in clothing wearing of cotton lab coats and pre rinsing and cleaning of all materials used as well as laboratory bench laminar flow cabinet surfaces if precautions were not fully reported but sufficient blanks i e three blanks see section negative controls below were included to keep track of background contamination then a score of 1 was assigned table s2 3 1 5 clean air conditions to avoid contamination with airborne microplastic particles or fibres sample handling should be performed in a laminar flow cabinet or in a clean air laboratory to receive the maximum score hermsen et al 2018 recent studies are increasingly using such conditions mason et al 2018 oβmann et al 2018 schymanski et al 2018 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 in case clean air conditions were not used but covering of samples and sufficient blanks were reported a score of 1 was assigned cable et al 2017 dris et al 2015 2018b miller et al 2017 mintenig et al 2019b pivokonsky et al 2018 3 1 6 negative controls to verify and correct for contamination or to demonstrate absence of contamination replicated n 3 procedural blanks need to be analysed all reviewed studies reported particles counts if the variability of contamination was quantified and if it was clearly indicated that actual sample results were corrected for blank values a score of 2 was assigned some precautions are less reliable but still provide some useful information on the level of contamination like the filtration of air or the sole examination of petri dishes soaked papers placed next to the samples cable et al 2017 dris et al 2015 2018b estahbanati and fahrenfeld 2016 hendrickson et al 2018 lares et al 2018 mani et al 2015 mccormick et al 2016 rodrigues et al 2018 simon et al 2018 ziajahromi et al 2017 if these precautions were taken a score of 1 was assigned 3 1 7 positive controls losses of particles may occur during various steps of sampling sample preparation and analysis and it is recommended to quantify losses using positive controls estahbanati and fahrenfeld 2016 assessed particle losses during sampling with nets by adding plastic particles in distilled water subsequent sample handling in the laboratory often includes complex steps to remove organic matter from samples see sample treatment below particularly from wwtp influent or effluent or surface waters to verify a sufficiently high recovery of particles during filtration digestion transfer and analytical identification steps representative replicated positive controls n 3 should be performed hermsen et al 2018 if recoveries are low yet reproducible the reported counts should be corrected for this incomplete recovery positive controls should be conducted for the targeted microplastics covering different size classes and polymer types microplastic sizes span a wide range and it cannot be assumed that recoveries are constant across the range of sizes and polymer types in practice it is important to at least use small enough microplastics as controls as these are more difficult to recover in some cases larger microplastics still require separate controls especially when different methods are applied for instance the method used by mason et al 2018 for particles smaller than 100 μm was different from that for particles larger than 100 μm whereas positive controls were only performed for the smaller particles only three studies provided full data on positive controls simon et al 2018 vollertsen and hansen 2017 wang et al 2018 and received maximum scores indicating that it is not yet a very common practice other studies conducted positive controls but with no or insufficient replicates di and wang 2018 dyachenko et al 2017 hendrickson et al 2018 or only for one step in the analysis rodrigues et al 2018 or for part of the targeted size range mason et al 2018 and received a score of 1 3 1 8 sample treatment to assure the quality of visual inspection and subsequent polymer identification which is especially critical for 300 μm particles and to enable the usage of more advanced identification techniques see section polymer identification a sample digestion step should be performed for surface and wwtp water samples in order to score 2 points tap and bottled water do not require a digestion step and thus were always assigned 2 points on this criterion digestion should be done under conditions that do not affect the microplastics weights counts or shapes in the context of biota analysis use of potassium hydroxide koh or enzymes has been demonstrated to be acceptable catarino et al 2016 cole et al 2014 kühn et al 2017 munno et al 2018 the reviewed studies here commonly used hydrogen peroxide h2o2 which is known to affect some polymers hurley et al 2018 however its effects have been demonstrated to be minimal within an exposure of 48 h löder et al 2017 and was therefore deemed acceptable several studies kept the temperature around 35 45 c e g by using a cooling or ice bath simon et al 2018 however sometimes higher temperatures up to 75 c anderson et al 2017 baldwin et al 2016 estahbanati and fahrenfeld 2016 hendrickson et al 2018 hoellein et al 2017 pivokonsky et al 2018 or even 80 c were used in some of the digestion steps vermaire et al 2017 or even 90 c for drying estahbanati and fahrenfeld 2016 hendrickson et al 2018 ziajahromi et al 2017 effects of temperature in combination with various digestion chemicals were studied by munno et al 2018 based on comparison of data on polymer mass losses during heating and digestion the authors concluded it was best to stay below 60 c we set 50 c as the safe upper limit and as a criterion to assign a maximum score as a precautionary measure and since many of the reviewed studies were below 50 c digestion without such considerations of mass losses was assigned a score of 1 a score of 1 was also assigned for surface water when it was reported to be very clear and clean even without digestion applied furthermore studies that did not apply digestion but explicitly were aiming for the detection of 300 μm particles only were assigned a score of 1 hermsen et al 2018 3 1 9 polymer identification to assure reliable assessment of plastic particles the polymer identity needs to be confirmed preferably by using micro ftir or raman spectroscopy pyrolysis gcms or tga gcms techniques hermsen et al 2018 löder and gerdts 2015 mintenig et al 2018 although subsampling should be avoided these techniques are so laborious that representative sub sampling is often required best practice for subsampling and subsequent polymer identification will differ for different microplastic size classes and technologies applied mintenig et al 2018 the manual sorting and subsequent identification of microplastics has a bias compared to the identification of particles enriched on filters with ftir or raman microscopy i e avoid missing transparent or small particles and is therefore discouraged when analysing particles 300 μm for manually sorted particles following hermsen et al 2018 we argue that analysis of all particles is feasible and therefore recommended if the numbers of pre sorted particles per study are 100 for particle numbers 100 50 should be identified with a minimum of 100 particles if polymer identities are reported on a per sample basis we also advise to analyse all particles found however with a minimum of 50 this minimum is considered reasonable to represent the variety of particle shapes and polymer types in environmental samples anyway for such hand picked representative subsets studies generally still should describe how representativeness was assured for smaller micropastics and when applying ftir or raman microscopy the representativeness of subsampling the area of a filter that was measured is relatively easy to assess particularly when coupling a focal plane array detector to the microscope many more particles especially the small and transparent particles can be assessed in one analysis although measurement times can be long at least 25 of the filter needs to be analysed mintenig et al 2017 redondo hasselerharm et al 2018 if these criteria for number of particles and or percentage of the filter are met a score of 2 is assigned if polymers were identified for a too low number of particles or on a smaller part of the filter a score of 1 was assigned also if sem eds or edx was applied to distinguish polymers from non polymeric materials anderson et al 2017 cable et al 2017 mason et al 2016b su et al 2016 a score of 1 was assigned 3 1 10 overall reliability of method aspects and studies for each study we assessed against all quality criteria and calculated a total accumulated score tas table s3 whereas the maximum achievable tas score is 18 average min max tas scores were 13 7 13 14 for bottled water 11 5 8 15 for treated tap water 12 5 11 14 for dwtp water 7 9 4 15 for surface water and 7 3 3 13 for waste water studies respectively table 1 this ranking in average scores for the different water types probably reflects the relative ease of analysing these different water types for instance bottled and tap water require no digestion which means that 2 points were always assigned to the sample digestion criteria it should be noted though that the number of studies examining dwtp and treated tap water each n 2 and bottled water studies n 3 was very low rendering the averages to be less rigorous on average studies were assigned roughly half 8 41 18 of the maximum score for data quality a result which is very similar to the average score assigned to studies reporting data on ingestion of microplastic by biota hermsen et al 2018 only four studies received non zero scores for all criteria these were the study on surface water by wang et al 2018 tas 15 the study on bottled water by mason et al 2018 tas 14 and two studies on wastewater by ziajahromi et al 2017 tas 12 and hendrickson et al 2018 tas 11 for the ranking of such non zero studies a multiplied score x can be calculated hermsen et al 2018 followed by a 2log x transformation in order to obtain a linear scale for a maximum score of 9 this would lead to a score of 6 for the data provided by wang et al 2018 a score of 5 for the data provided by mason et al 2018 a score of 3 by ziajahromi et al 2017 and a score of 2 for the data provided by hendrickson et al 2018 these four studies were published in the years 2017 or 2018 which may reflect recent progress in the quality of applied methods to analyse microplastics in environmental samples with only four studies having all non zero scores it can be concluded that the majority of the reviewed studies 46 studies or 92 cannot be considered fully complete or reliable on at least one crucial aspect of quality assurance this does not mean that studies may not be useable or important as a more specific consideration of scores and study outcomes in hindsight can still make a study very well fit for certain research questions besides insights in methodological differences among individual studies the scores allow for a cross comparison of reliability differences per criterion table 1 hermsen et al 2018 average scores per criterion were all lower than 2 which means there is room for improvement of quality assurance in this field of research the average scores per criterion across 55 records were lower than 1 for the criteria sample treatment 0 93 polymer identification 0 89 laboratory preparation 0 77 clean air conditions 0 64 and positive controls 0 21 therefore significant improvements are needed especially for these five out of nine quality aspects our analysis further illustrates that besides actual quality assurance also full reportage of method details is important to assure traceability and reproducibility of data reporting is a quality aspect in itself and some studies may have scored higher had they been reported better in this respect we recommend to also include detection limits in terms of number and mass concentrations but also in terms of minimum and maximum detectable particles sizes inherent to the applied methodology 3 1 11 implications of quality criteria and reliability of studies for human health risk assessment human health risks depend on exposure and it is well known that drinking water is an uptake pathway for microplastics consequently quality in the analysis of microplastics in drinking water and its sources is very relevant to accurately assess risks to human health in this respect it should be mentioned that the proposed criteria are related to concentrations in the water which however may not fully correlate with exposure for instance we recommended running the tap before sampling to avoid contamination of the first portion of water to assure reproducibility of results and further because many consumers would do this anyway however others may not do this and addressing this variability may be relevant for exposure assessment exposure to microplastics may also depend on the level of shaking of a bottle before drinking whereas our criteria recommend shaking in order to maximize the chance that all particles are measured and to assure reproducibility of the analysis exposure in drinking water can additionally be influenced by direct contamination of drinking water through contact with air but to better understand contamination that is coming directly from the water supply and to support comparability and reproduciblity we recommend procedures to prevent airborne contamination finally exposure to microplastics would also include uptake via inhalation or food wright and kelly 2017 which is not covered in this paper that only addresses drinking water and its sources the fact that high quality data are limited also has implications for human health risk assessment which considers both exposure as well as health effects only four out of 50 studies which were published in 2017 and 2018 were of such a level of reliability i e having no zero scores that they could be used confidently for an exposure assessment importantly of these four studies the recent study on microplastic particles in bottled drinking water mason et al 2018 would be highly relevant for human health risk assessment based on the criteria used here although the study only had maximum scores in 5 out of 9 criteria therefore this uncertainty in the overall exposure data precludes the ability to conduct a robust risk assessment whether related to particle toxicity chemical toxicity or microbial toxicity we therefore conclude that more high quality data is needed on the occurrence of microplastics in drinking water to more confidently assess potential exposure as a critical piece for understanding the potential human health risks 3 2 microplastics in freshwater 3 2 1 global microplastic concentrations in different water types we reviewed the available literature on microplastics in drinking water fresh water and wastewater monitoring has been conducted in multiple locations in asia australia europe and north america a selection of studies reporting particle number concentrations were used for a further analysis figs 1 and 4 if they reported means and or raw data on a volume basis these microplastic concentrations reported as number of particles spanned ten orders of magnitude 1 10 2 to 108 m3 across all individual samples and water types also when excluding wastewaters fig 1 the number of microplastic particles in samples per water type was statistically different p 0 05 for all pairwise comparisons of water types except for the comparisons between ground water and all other water types wwtp effluent versus untreated dwtp and tap water and wwtp influent versus untreated dwtp water fig 1 table s4 as these concentration data relate to numbers they do not distinguish between particle size shape or material type differences that will be discussed in the sections below studies often do not mention a lower nor an upper size limit or only mention the targeted size class the data include particles reported as microplastics that is we did not take out suspect non polymer particles as identified either by authors themselves or based on our quality assessment discussed above the range for 50 of the data per water type the boxes in fig 1 is 1 2 orders of magnitude and quite similar for influent effluent lake river and bottled water data for canal and tap water only a few studies were available which may have caused the variation to be much smaller for bottled water the number of studies was also low mason et al 2018 oβmann et al 2018 schymanski et al 2018 however there were many samples bottled water brands for this water type available in these studies the median concentrations per water type vary over four orders of magnitude some general patterns exist in the concentration data fig 1 surface waters have the lowest concentrations of all water types with bottled water closer to the higher end the lower concentrations observed in surface water particularly compared to drinking water is likely attributed to the fact that most surface water studies targeted only larger particles whereas smaller particles are more abundant cabernard et al 2018 wwtp influent shows the highest concentrations based on the median and interquartile range of reported concentrations fig 1 although wwtp studies generally did not monitor small particles the high concentrations therefore reflect direct domestic inputs and inputs from those diffuse land based sources that are routed via waste water wwtp effluent has a lower median compared to wwtp influent which probably reflects the retention of microplastics in wwtps similarly untreated tap water has higher concentrations than treated tap water concentrations in bottled water are higher than in tap water which may reflect the higher influx of airborne particles in the factories which are inherently more locked in wear from caps or bottle walls after production or the fact that these studies also included smaller sized particles for instance schymanski et al 2018 used raman microscopy and was thus able to identify down to 5 μm which also explains the high number concentrations the general trends observed here fig 1 still remain when only the studies that received highest quality scores are taken into account fig s1 still the generalities listed here should be interpreted with caution given the low number of bottled water n 3 treated tap water n 2 untreated dwtp water n 2 and ground water studies 1 although as noted earlier there were many bottled water samples available in the limited number of studies 3 2 2 microplastic shapes in global freshwaters microplastics of different shapes were reported several factors limit a potential quantitative analysis of reported data on the relative abundance of shapes among water types first many studies typically only analysed shapes of a subset of all isolated particles and it is not clear how representative these subsets were when it comes to particle shape second studies targeted different size ranges which also limits their comparability for instance fibres are typically small cole 2016 so easily missed when trawling third studies differed in the extent their water samples were representative of the studied water systems or water type which in turn is affected by spatial and temporal variability fourth although some particles shapes were quite well defined and thus interpreted similarly across studies some others are more ambiguous like nurdle pellet pre production pellet sphere resin or granule nevertheless we can provide a relatively robust view of the relative importance of particle shapes by showing the frequency of shapes observed across studies fig 2 the reviewed studies n 50 reported in the order of decreasing reporting frequency fragment fibre film foam pellet sphere line bead flake sheet granule paint foil and nurdle fig 2 we argue that this order also reflects a relative order of importance of shapes that is the most frequent shapes detected in a high number of locations globally as the reviewed studies concerned many different locations on the globe 3 2 3 polymer types reported in global studies on freshwater microplastics for 32 out of 55 records polymer types were assessed similar to particle shape as discussed above and rather than discussing relative abundances per study we consider the relative frequency of reported polymer types observed in water types on a global level often relative abundances per study are not provided or may not be considered accurate due to limited or biased subsets of particles used for the polymer identification most frequently observed polymer types across studies and records are pe pp ps pvc pet with acrylic or acrylic related compounds pa pest and pmma reported in five or more records fig 3 the order of the five most abundant polymers can be roughly explained by two factors global plastic demand and polymer density andrady 2011 bond et al 2018 global plastic demand would cause an order of pe pp pvc pet ps bond et al 2018 geyer et al 2017 however whereas pe and pp have densities below 1 g cm3 and are buoyant and ps has a density close to that of water pvc and pet have densities of 1 3 1 7 g cm3 therefore a relatively high degree of settling could explain the lower abundances of pvc and pet in the surface water samples mostly assessed here specific subsets i e lakes rivers versus wwtp samples were checked for differences in relative abundances of polymer types but no such differences were found for a more detailed analysis of polymers reported in studies the reader is referred to table s1 which provides all observed polymers on an individual record basis recently bond et al 2018 provided a review of polymer abundance data across environmental compartments in europe including 3 surface water and 5 wwtp studies instead of providing the reporting incidence across a large number of global studies they averaged relative abundances reported across these 8 european studies yet found the same order of abundances for the 5 most dominant polymers 3 2 4 sizes of microplastic particles studies generally did not report sizes or size distributions relating to individual particles which precludes a meta analysis of particle size across studies however size classes were reported table s1 as well as the number of particles observed per size class still this does not allow for a meaningful quantitative analysis because the size bins vary widely across studies fig 4a furthermore often lower or upper size limits are not specified so that it is not clear to what size class reported number concentrations actually relate instead of plotting the reported size ranges across studies fig 4a reported ranges can be plotted against mean particle number concentrations fig 4b the latter graph clearly shows that studies aiming for smaller particles like some of the bottled water and tap water studies generally find the higher particle number concentrations 4 conclusions we conclude that based on the limited number of high quality studies identified standardization of microplastic analysis in water is needed quality assurance criteria that require the most improvements are sample treatment polymer identification laboratory preparation clean air conditions and positive controls in addition to ensuring that individual studies are of higher quality in order to achieve more confidence in study findings standardized methods will allow reproducibility and comparability of results and will lead to the quality of data that are needed to conduct risk assessments among water types reported microplastic concentrations differed widely but the fact that studies target different size classes contributes to this variability despite the quality limitations our analysis confirmed that microplastic is frequently present in freshwaters and drinking water there is a high need to improve the analysis of very small microplastics and to identify them in different water samples fragments fibers film foam and pellets were the most frequently found microplastic shapes in surface water samples relative abundance of polymer types found across studies reflected plastic production and polymer densities conclusions on size comparisons among studies and water types are difficult to draw due to the aforementioned differences in targeted particle sizes more studies are needed to better understand occurrence shape polymer types and particle sizes particularly for the small plastic particles

18923,microplastics have recently been detected in drinking water as well as in drinking water sources this presence has triggered discussions on possible implications for human health however there have been questions regarding the quality of these occurrence studies since there are no standard sampling extraction and identification methods for microplastics accordingly we assessed the quality of fifty studies researching microplastics in drinking water and in its major freshwater sources this includes an assessment of microplastic occurrence data from river and lake water groundwater tap water and bottled drinking water studies of occurrence in wastewater were also reviewed we review and propose best practices to sample extract and detect microplastics and provide a quantitative quality assessment of studies reporting microplastic concentrations further we summarize the findings related to microplastic concentrations polymer types and particle shapes microplastics are frequently present in freshwaters and drinking water and number concentrations spanned ten orders of magnitude 1 10 2 to 108 m3 across individual samples and water types however only four out of 50 studies received positive scores for all proposed quality criteria implying there is a significant need to improve quality assurance of microplastic sampling and analysis in water samples the order in globally detected polymers in these studies is pe pp ps pvc pet which probably reflects the global plastic demand and a higher tendency for pvc and pet to settle as a result of their higher densities fragments fibres film foam and pellets were the most frequently reported shapes we conclude that more high quality data is needed on the occurrence of microplastics in drinking water to better understand potential exposure and to inform human health risk assessments graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastics drinking water waste water surface water human health 1 introduction microplastics are generally characterised as water insoluble solid polymer particles that are 5 mm in size bergmann et al 2015 a formal definition for the lower size boundary does not exist but particles below 1 μm are usually referred to as nanoplastics rather than microplastic koelmans et al 2015 although microplastics are often detected in the environment the risks they pose are debated and largely unknown one key challenge in assessing the risks of microplastics to humans and the environment relates to the variability of the physical and chemical properties composition and concentration of the particles further microplastics in the environment are difficult to identify and standardized methods do not exist mintenig et al 2018 the dominant source of microplastics often is the fragmentation of larger plastics or product wear however the rate of fragmentation under natural conditions is unknown eerkes medrano and thompson 2018 these challenges and unknowns hamper the prospective assessment of exposure and risk koelmans et al 2017 in this uncertain field regulatory efforts to examine microplastic safety have been raised sam 2018a b the presence of microplastics has been reported for air samples food and drinking water efsa 2016 gasperi et al 2018 lusher et al 2017 van cauwenberghe and janssen 2014 wright and kelly 2017 yang et al 2015 and recently the implications of microplastics for human health have been reviewed wright and kelly 2017 although microplastic exposure via ingestion or inhalation could occur the human health effects are still unknown if inhaled or ingested limited data from animal studies suggest that microplastics may accumulate and cause particle toxicity by inducing an immune response deng et al 2017 gasperi et al 2018 chemical toxicity could occur due to leaching of plastic associated chemicals additives as well as adsorbed toxins diepens and koelmans 2018 sapea 2019 such effects are likely to be dose dependent however knowledge of exposure levels is currently lacking furthermore biofilms growing on microplastics may be a source of microbial pathogens gesamp 2016 hence although there are potential chemical particle and microbial hazards associated with microplastics current exposure levels including through drinking water need to be assessed first the ubiquity of microplastics of all sizes in surface water groundwater and wastewater sapea 2019 has raised the question if pollution of drinking water occurs to date there is only a limited number of studies that address this issue and they indeed reported the presence of microplastics in tap water and bottled water kosuth et al 2018 mason et al 2018 mintenig et al 2019b schymanski et al 2018 some of these studies triggered a great deal of attention in the scientific community as well as the media putting the issue of human exposure to microplastics via drinking water high on the agenda of public health agencies worldwide more broadly ensuring safe drinking water is high on the political agenda with a dedicated target on safe and affordable drinking water under the sustainable development goals sdg 6 who and unicef 2017 to date about 50 studies exist that provide concentration data for microplastics in drinking water or its freshwater sources i e surface water and groundwater as well as indirectly wastewater these studies provide data for specific types of water but methods of sampling isolating purifying and identifying microplastics vary enormously among studies a systematic review of methodologies used and study characteristics is currently lacking there are several scoping reviews that emphasise the relevance of microplastics in freshwaters eerkes medrano and thompson 2018 li et al 2018 wagner et al 2014 or that specifically discuss processes or models in freshwaters kooi et al 2018 we are aware of only a limited number of reviews that touch upon methodologies and concentration data eerkes medrano and thompson 2018 li et al 2018 besides variation in methodologies used and concentrations reported existing studies are likely to vary with respect to the level of quality assurance deployed the quality of microplastic research has been debated recently burton 2017 connors et al 2017 koelmans et al 2016 and has been quantitatively assessed for studies on microplastic ingestion by biota hermsen et al 2018 however a critical review of studies reporting concentration data in freshwater and drinking water which also evaluates the quality of applied sampling methods microplastic extraction and identification steps is currently lacking for chemical risk assessments in a regulatory context quality criteria have been set in order to be able to evaluate the reliability of data from toxicological studies kase et al 2016 klimisch et al 1997 schneider et al 2009 such criteria contribute to the harmonization of the hazard and risk assessments of chemicals across different regulatory frameworks recently hermsen et al proposed a weight of evidence scoring method for studies of microplastic ingestion by marine biota hermsen et al 2018 this method defined minimum quality criteria for various aspects of the analytical procedure such as sampling sample treatment use of controls and polymer identification it assigns a score for each aspect and provides a total reliability score for data reported in a study such a method can also be developed for the analysis of microplastics in freshwater samples and can be applied to quantify the relative reliability of reported concentration data the aim of the present paper is to critically review the available literature on microplastics in drinking water and its freshwater sources from a quality assurance perspective and by using a quantitative approach wastewater studies were also assessed as these are discharged into the environment further aims are to review data on concentration polymer type shape and size distribution data across studies guidance is provided to improve the quality of future occurrence studies our paper is organised as follows we first present the key areas that should be assessed to determine the reliability of studies these areas are presented in separate sections and are sampling method sample size sample processing and storage laboratory preparation and clean air conditions negative controls positive controls sample treatment and polymer identification for each of these areas we discuss quality assurance aspects considerations for scoring and present the assessment scores for each of these criteria subsequently the combined overall reliability scores are discussed followed by a discussion on implications for human health risk assessments in the section thereafter we discuss the outcomes of the reviewed studies an overview of the concentrations shapes and polymer types measured is provided and trends are discussed with respect to sample type location or system characteristics finally we provide recommendations to improve the analysis of microplastics in water samples and summarize the key conclusions 2 methods 2 1 literature search fifty five records from fifty studies reporting microplastic concentrations in drinking water 2 tap 3 bottled water or its freshwater sources 1 groundwater 30 surface water 18 wastewater were reviewed some studies reported data on microplastics in more than one water type most papers were retrieved from the scopus database search strings used were microplastic and bottle or surface or tap or wastewater or groundwater three studies were from the grey i e not peer reviewed literature and were found via google searches using the same or similar key word combinations searches were performed until august 2018 only those studies that reported original concentration data were reviewed 2 2 quantitative quality assessment the reliability of data in studies was evaluated based on criteria originally developed for microplastic in biota samples by hermsen et al 2018 and surface water samples by mintenig et al 2019a in prep the present approach further refines the method to different categories of water samples including tap or bottled drinking water surface water groundwater and wastewater the method uses nine crucial criteria which are detailed below criteria relate to those that are common in analytical chemistry such as reproducibility of described methods precision accuracy and sensitivity which together determine the robustness of an applied method reproducibility does not imply that another researcher would obtain the same result which is due to the variability in conditions inherent to nature reproducibility in the context of analytical chemistry refers to minimizing the contribution of random or systematic error to the total observed variability for each criterion a value of 2 reliable 1 reliable to a limited extent or 0 unreliable is assigned a total accumulated score tas is calculated by adding scores for individual criteria maximum 18 points tables 1 s2 s3 for data to be considered sufficiently reliable a study should preferably have no zero values for any of the individual scores hermsen et al 2018 2 3 study characteristics for each study the following characteristics were summarized in tabular form table s1 reference country area source water type treatment applied for wastewater treatment plants wwtp or drinking water treatment plants dwtp bottled and tap water sampling date size shape of microplastics detected polymer types of microplastics detected chemicals analysed on microplastic value of microplastics detected in water sample quality assurance applied detection limit positive controls negative controls sampling method analysis method comments raw concentration data were pooled per water type wwtp influent wwtp effluent lake river canal groundwater untreated and treated tap water and bottled water and analysed for means ranges and significance of differences among the water types as data were not normally distributed the differences were assessed with the mann whitney wilcoxon test with bonferroni correction 3 results and discussion 3 1 quality assessment of studies reporting data on microplastics in water samples in this section methodological aspects are reviewed in subsections and the final total quality scores are presented and discussed following hermsen et al 2018 for each aspect scoring criteria are provided and each criterion is explained and justified table s2 such a score based quantitative evaluation does not result in an absolute judgment but is an indicator of the reliability of these studies for monitoring purposes and to inform risk assessments of microplastics in the drinking water supply chain the quality criteria provided here are considered adequate for the present assessment yet may develop over time with increased experience in sampling and analysing microplastics and better understanding of global concentrations here we review the general trends for details on specific studies the reader is referred to tables s1 and s3 3 1 1 sampling methods sampling methods were reviewed to understand the variety of approaches utilized to assess whether sampling was described in sufficient detail and to be able to define quality assessment criteria for sampling tables s1 and s2 surface water is sampled by pumping trawling or filling bottles or buckets followed by sieving to isolate particles of the desired size range table s1 li et al 2018 for wastewater samples are either grabbed with bottles pumped directly or collected with automatic composite samplers then sieved whereas tap and bottled water are directly sieved residues in nets or sieves are typically flushed into glass or metal jars or bottles to obtain a maximum score of 2 the date location and materials used should be reported specific further criteria were defined for wastewater surface water untreated and treated tap water and bottled water for wastewater the applied treatment type should be mentioned as this can impact the microplastic concentrations and should be considered when assessing retention or removal efficiencies of individual technologies for the same reason this should be done when taking samples on dwtps for surface water the depth of sampling should be reported as this may affect concentration kooi et al 2018 for tap water when the aim is to assess concentration in general running the tap before sampling is recommended e g 1 min in order to avoid incidental contamination from air wesch et al 2017 unless it is specifically mentioned that the aim is to measure the first portion of the water e g the first glass furthermore flowrate and source of tap water e g storage tank groundwater surface water should be reported as this may be relevant for data interpretation for the same reason for bottled drinking water the source batch production lot and bottled water type sparkling vs still water should be specified to maximize particle recovery from the bottle the sample should be shaken before filtration and the emptied bottle should be flushed three times with filtered water a score of 1 was assigned if a study provided a subset of the required characteristics e g date location but is still fairly reproducible about half of the studies score 2 on this criterion whereas only three studies score 0 3 1 2 sample size different factors were considered when recommending an optimum water volume to be sampled for microplastics the limit of detection can be seen as the methods capability of reliably detecting at least one particle with statistical rigor a sample volume that is too low reduces the chance of finding particles reduces the power of a study and increases the margin of error this means that detection limits benefit from large sample volumes similar approaches i e sufficient sample size are used when analysing chemicals in environmental matrices einax et al 2004 however for samples with particles samples should be small enough to prevent clogging of filters or sieves this means that recommendations for sample sizes will differ for different water types because the actual concentration cannot be predicted occurrence of non detects or filter clogging can never be fully prevented detection limits also depend on the particle size range aimed for in a study various studies have shown that smaller particles are more abundant cabernard et al 2018 implying that smaller sample volumes are required when exclusively examining small microplastics that are analytically challenging to detect e g 100 300 μm however if such a study would also aim to detect larger microplastics accurately a large volume would still be required establishing sample volume recommendations for studies primarily aiming for larger roughly 300 μm microplastics should consider both expected microplastic concentrations for a given water type and practical considerations most studies reviewed belong to this category that aimed to detect also larger microplastics in surface water 300 μm microplastic concentrations span a wide range of concentrations roughly 1 10 3 to 10 particles per litre fig 1 because of the low concentrations and ease of obtaining large volumes from surface waters we set 500 l as a minimum sample volume for surface water however given the often very low particle number concentrations in some lakes and rivers a volume greater than 500 l is recommended for remote locations for tap water range 1 10 4 to 100 particles per litre a greater sample volume is proposed compared to surface water we advise a minimum volume of 1000 l because of the concentrations that can be very low mintenig et al 2019b uncertainties with the representativeness of this range given the low number of studies identified and ease of sample collection for bottled water there were also a limited number of studies available yet they all demonstrate presence of at least several particles per litre such that even a minimum of 1 l would be defensible in case a 1 l bottle would be the study unit and only very small particles 100 μm would be targeted however the study unit in such studies is often the brand or production lot and also larger particles are targeted in which case we recommend to sample 10 l for a more representative result as bottled water usually is provided in volumes smaller than 10 l this would imply the need to either analyse multiple bottles or to treat the total volume of multiple bottles as one sample for wwtp influents where concentrations of particles are expected to be higher fig 1 a sample volume of 1 l is considered sufficient for wwtp effluent a sample volume greater than 500 l is recommended or a reported clogging of the sieve e g carr et al 2016 mintenig et al 2017 vollertsen and hansen 2017 ziajahromi et al 2017 these volumes mentioned would lead to roughly 5 to 500 particles detected which is considered sufficiently representative if the detection limit would be 1 particle as mentioned above use of these volumes would receive a maximum score of 2 however in some cases lower volumes have been used with good reason and may still yield fair results in these cases a score of 1 is assigned table s2 studies that explicitly aim for only smaller particles can use smaller volumes as long as detection limits are met and still receive the maximum score 3 1 3 sample processing and storage for the transfer of a primary sample e g material in a net or sieve to a storage bottle or for preservation or storage of samples before reaching the laboratory certain criteria need to be met some studies rinse jars bottles or other materials with targeted water e g kosuth et al 2018 talvitie et al 2015 however particles from that rinsing water could easily stick to surfaces and remain which thus would lead to contamination of the actual sample ideally sample containers should be rinsed in the laboratory with filtered water before bringing them to the field in general samples should be stored shortly after sampling and further handling avoided before arriving in the laboratory when sampling use of plastic materials should be avoided as much as possible to again minimize contamination many studies use a fixative like ethanol formalin or methyl aldehyde anderson et al 2017 baldwin et al 2016 eriksen et al 2013 fischer et al 2016 mason et al 2016a su et al 2016 wang et al 2018 xiong et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 2017 however the effects of the fixative on different types of plastic should be evaluated before application or studies should report evidence from the literature hermsen et al 2018 ethanol and formalin for instance have been shown not to affect polymer characteristics courtene jones et al 2017 some of the studies reviewed here used volunteers for sampling and sample processing christiansen 2018 kosuth et al 2018 citizen science cs approaches have been used in environmental monitoring and are increasingly being used in research on plastic debris liboiron et al 2016 syberg et al 2018 it has been argued that this may improve risk perception within society and therefore improve the foundation for timely and efficient societal measures syberg et al 2018 there is also an economic incentive to collect data with volunteers rather than by paid professionals and some monitoring research would even be impracticable if data were not collected by volunteers brett 2017 however concerns with respect to the quality of cs have been raised and validation studies have shown that the reliability of cs based data is highly uncertain brett 2017 other than for macroplastics quality assurance for sampling and sample processing of microplastics is technically demanding and the error rate can be expected to be higher for volunteers than for professionals since no cs validation studies for microplastics sampling and analysis exist to date it is not clear to what extent the quality of data is affected by having some of the crucial steps performed by non professionals therefore as scientific quality assurance is the primary perspective of this paper use of volunteers for major parts of the sampling work was considered less reliable leading to a score of 1 in case of validation of the adequacy of the protocols and 0 in all other cases for this criterion 3 1 4 laboratory preparation contamination of samples due to airborne polymer particles and fibres has been described as a major problem in microplastic analysis hermsen et al 2017 2018 torre et al 2016 vandermeersch et al 2015 wesch et al 2016 therefore to avoid contamination and prior to actual sample preparation and analysis certain measures need to be taken these include avoiding synthetic components in clothing wearing of cotton lab coats and pre rinsing and cleaning of all materials used as well as laboratory bench laminar flow cabinet surfaces if precautions were not fully reported but sufficient blanks i e three blanks see section negative controls below were included to keep track of background contamination then a score of 1 was assigned table s2 3 1 5 clean air conditions to avoid contamination with airborne microplastic particles or fibres sample handling should be performed in a laminar flow cabinet or in a clean air laboratory to receive the maximum score hermsen et al 2018 recent studies are increasingly using such conditions mason et al 2018 oβmann et al 2018 schymanski et al 2018 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 in case clean air conditions were not used but covering of samples and sufficient blanks were reported a score of 1 was assigned cable et al 2017 dris et al 2015 2018b miller et al 2017 mintenig et al 2019b pivokonsky et al 2018 3 1 6 negative controls to verify and correct for contamination or to demonstrate absence of contamination replicated n 3 procedural blanks need to be analysed all reviewed studies reported particles counts if the variability of contamination was quantified and if it was clearly indicated that actual sample results were corrected for blank values a score of 2 was assigned some precautions are less reliable but still provide some useful information on the level of contamination like the filtration of air or the sole examination of petri dishes soaked papers placed next to the samples cable et al 2017 dris et al 2015 2018b estahbanati and fahrenfeld 2016 hendrickson et al 2018 lares et al 2018 mani et al 2015 mccormick et al 2016 rodrigues et al 2018 simon et al 2018 ziajahromi et al 2017 if these precautions were taken a score of 1 was assigned 3 1 7 positive controls losses of particles may occur during various steps of sampling sample preparation and analysis and it is recommended to quantify losses using positive controls estahbanati and fahrenfeld 2016 assessed particle losses during sampling with nets by adding plastic particles in distilled water subsequent sample handling in the laboratory often includes complex steps to remove organic matter from samples see sample treatment below particularly from wwtp influent or effluent or surface waters to verify a sufficiently high recovery of particles during filtration digestion transfer and analytical identification steps representative replicated positive controls n 3 should be performed hermsen et al 2018 if recoveries are low yet reproducible the reported counts should be corrected for this incomplete recovery positive controls should be conducted for the targeted microplastics covering different size classes and polymer types microplastic sizes span a wide range and it cannot be assumed that recoveries are constant across the range of sizes and polymer types in practice it is important to at least use small enough microplastics as controls as these are more difficult to recover in some cases larger microplastics still require separate controls especially when different methods are applied for instance the method used by mason et al 2018 for particles smaller than 100 μm was different from that for particles larger than 100 μm whereas positive controls were only performed for the smaller particles only three studies provided full data on positive controls simon et al 2018 vollertsen and hansen 2017 wang et al 2018 and received maximum scores indicating that it is not yet a very common practice other studies conducted positive controls but with no or insufficient replicates di and wang 2018 dyachenko et al 2017 hendrickson et al 2018 or only for one step in the analysis rodrigues et al 2018 or for part of the targeted size range mason et al 2018 and received a score of 1 3 1 8 sample treatment to assure the quality of visual inspection and subsequent polymer identification which is especially critical for 300 μm particles and to enable the usage of more advanced identification techniques see section polymer identification a sample digestion step should be performed for surface and wwtp water samples in order to score 2 points tap and bottled water do not require a digestion step and thus were always assigned 2 points on this criterion digestion should be done under conditions that do not affect the microplastics weights counts or shapes in the context of biota analysis use of potassium hydroxide koh or enzymes has been demonstrated to be acceptable catarino et al 2016 cole et al 2014 kühn et al 2017 munno et al 2018 the reviewed studies here commonly used hydrogen peroxide h2o2 which is known to affect some polymers hurley et al 2018 however its effects have been demonstrated to be minimal within an exposure of 48 h löder et al 2017 and was therefore deemed acceptable several studies kept the temperature around 35 45 c e g by using a cooling or ice bath simon et al 2018 however sometimes higher temperatures up to 75 c anderson et al 2017 baldwin et al 2016 estahbanati and fahrenfeld 2016 hendrickson et al 2018 hoellein et al 2017 pivokonsky et al 2018 or even 80 c were used in some of the digestion steps vermaire et al 2017 or even 90 c for drying estahbanati and fahrenfeld 2016 hendrickson et al 2018 ziajahromi et al 2017 effects of temperature in combination with various digestion chemicals were studied by munno et al 2018 based on comparison of data on polymer mass losses during heating and digestion the authors concluded it was best to stay below 60 c we set 50 c as the safe upper limit and as a criterion to assign a maximum score as a precautionary measure and since many of the reviewed studies were below 50 c digestion without such considerations of mass losses was assigned a score of 1 a score of 1 was also assigned for surface water when it was reported to be very clear and clean even without digestion applied furthermore studies that did not apply digestion but explicitly were aiming for the detection of 300 μm particles only were assigned a score of 1 hermsen et al 2018 3 1 9 polymer identification to assure reliable assessment of plastic particles the polymer identity needs to be confirmed preferably by using micro ftir or raman spectroscopy pyrolysis gcms or tga gcms techniques hermsen et al 2018 löder and gerdts 2015 mintenig et al 2018 although subsampling should be avoided these techniques are so laborious that representative sub sampling is often required best practice for subsampling and subsequent polymer identification will differ for different microplastic size classes and technologies applied mintenig et al 2018 the manual sorting and subsequent identification of microplastics has a bias compared to the identification of particles enriched on filters with ftir or raman microscopy i e avoid missing transparent or small particles and is therefore discouraged when analysing particles 300 μm for manually sorted particles following hermsen et al 2018 we argue that analysis of all particles is feasible and therefore recommended if the numbers of pre sorted particles per study are 100 for particle numbers 100 50 should be identified with a minimum of 100 particles if polymer identities are reported on a per sample basis we also advise to analyse all particles found however with a minimum of 50 this minimum is considered reasonable to represent the variety of particle shapes and polymer types in environmental samples anyway for such hand picked representative subsets studies generally still should describe how representativeness was assured for smaller micropastics and when applying ftir or raman microscopy the representativeness of subsampling the area of a filter that was measured is relatively easy to assess particularly when coupling a focal plane array detector to the microscope many more particles especially the small and transparent particles can be assessed in one analysis although measurement times can be long at least 25 of the filter needs to be analysed mintenig et al 2017 redondo hasselerharm et al 2018 if these criteria for number of particles and or percentage of the filter are met a score of 2 is assigned if polymers were identified for a too low number of particles or on a smaller part of the filter a score of 1 was assigned also if sem eds or edx was applied to distinguish polymers from non polymeric materials anderson et al 2017 cable et al 2017 mason et al 2016b su et al 2016 a score of 1 was assigned 3 1 10 overall reliability of method aspects and studies for each study we assessed against all quality criteria and calculated a total accumulated score tas table s3 whereas the maximum achievable tas score is 18 average min max tas scores were 13 7 13 14 for bottled water 11 5 8 15 for treated tap water 12 5 11 14 for dwtp water 7 9 4 15 for surface water and 7 3 3 13 for waste water studies respectively table 1 this ranking in average scores for the different water types probably reflects the relative ease of analysing these different water types for instance bottled and tap water require no digestion which means that 2 points were always assigned to the sample digestion criteria it should be noted though that the number of studies examining dwtp and treated tap water each n 2 and bottled water studies n 3 was very low rendering the averages to be less rigorous on average studies were assigned roughly half 8 41 18 of the maximum score for data quality a result which is very similar to the average score assigned to studies reporting data on ingestion of microplastic by biota hermsen et al 2018 only four studies received non zero scores for all criteria these were the study on surface water by wang et al 2018 tas 15 the study on bottled water by mason et al 2018 tas 14 and two studies on wastewater by ziajahromi et al 2017 tas 12 and hendrickson et al 2018 tas 11 for the ranking of such non zero studies a multiplied score x can be calculated hermsen et al 2018 followed by a 2log x transformation in order to obtain a linear scale for a maximum score of 9 this would lead to a score of 6 for the data provided by wang et al 2018 a score of 5 for the data provided by mason et al 2018 a score of 3 by ziajahromi et al 2017 and a score of 2 for the data provided by hendrickson et al 2018 these four studies were published in the years 2017 or 2018 which may reflect recent progress in the quality of applied methods to analyse microplastics in environmental samples with only four studies having all non zero scores it can be concluded that the majority of the reviewed studies 46 studies or 92 cannot be considered fully complete or reliable on at least one crucial aspect of quality assurance this does not mean that studies may not be useable or important as a more specific consideration of scores and study outcomes in hindsight can still make a study very well fit for certain research questions besides insights in methodological differences among individual studies the scores allow for a cross comparison of reliability differences per criterion table 1 hermsen et al 2018 average scores per criterion were all lower than 2 which means there is room for improvement of quality assurance in this field of research the average scores per criterion across 55 records were lower than 1 for the criteria sample treatment 0 93 polymer identification 0 89 laboratory preparation 0 77 clean air conditions 0 64 and positive controls 0 21 therefore significant improvements are needed especially for these five out of nine quality aspects our analysis further illustrates that besides actual quality assurance also full reportage of method details is important to assure traceability and reproducibility of data reporting is a quality aspect in itself and some studies may have scored higher had they been reported better in this respect we recommend to also include detection limits in terms of number and mass concentrations but also in terms of minimum and maximum detectable particles sizes inherent to the applied methodology 3 1 11 implications of quality criteria and reliability of studies for human health risk assessment human health risks depend on exposure and it is well known that drinking water is an uptake pathway for microplastics consequently quality in the analysis of microplastics in drinking water and its sources is very relevant to accurately assess risks to human health in this respect it should be mentioned that the proposed criteria are related to concentrations in the water which however may not fully correlate with exposure for instance we recommended running the tap before sampling to avoid contamination of the first portion of water to assure reproducibility of results and further because many consumers would do this anyway however others may not do this and addressing this variability may be relevant for exposure assessment exposure to microplastics may also depend on the level of shaking of a bottle before drinking whereas our criteria recommend shaking in order to maximize the chance that all particles are measured and to assure reproducibility of the analysis exposure in drinking water can additionally be influenced by direct contamination of drinking water through contact with air but to better understand contamination that is coming directly from the water supply and to support comparability and reproduciblity we recommend procedures to prevent airborne contamination finally exposure to microplastics would also include uptake via inhalation or food wright and kelly 2017 which is not covered in this paper that only addresses drinking water and its sources the fact that high quality data are limited also has implications for human health risk assessment which considers both exposure as well as health effects only four out of 50 studies which were published in 2017 and 2018 were of such a level of reliability i e having no zero scores that they could be used confidently for an exposure assessment importantly of these four studies the recent study on microplastic particles in bottled drinking water mason et al 2018 would be highly relevant for human health risk assessment based on the criteria used here although the study only had maximum scores in 5 out of 9 criteria therefore this uncertainty in the overall exposure data precludes the ability to conduct a robust risk assessment whether related to particle toxicity chemical toxicity or microbial toxicity we therefore conclude that more high quality data is needed on the occurrence of microplastics in drinking water to more confidently assess potential exposure as a critical piece for understanding the potential human health risks 3 2 microplastics in freshwater 3 2 1 global microplastic concentrations in different water types we reviewed the available literature on microplastics in drinking water fresh water and wastewater monitoring has been conducted in multiple locations in asia australia europe and north america a selection of studies reporting particle number concentrations were used for a further analysis figs 1 and 4 if they reported means and or raw data on a volume basis these microplastic concentrations reported as number of particles spanned ten orders of magnitude 1 10 2 to 108 m3 across all individual samples and water types also when excluding wastewaters fig 1 the number of microplastic particles in samples per water type was statistically different p 0 05 for all pairwise comparisons of water types except for the comparisons between ground water and all other water types wwtp effluent versus untreated dwtp and tap water and wwtp influent versus untreated dwtp water fig 1 table s4 as these concentration data relate to numbers they do not distinguish between particle size shape or material type differences that will be discussed in the sections below studies often do not mention a lower nor an upper size limit or only mention the targeted size class the data include particles reported as microplastics that is we did not take out suspect non polymer particles as identified either by authors themselves or based on our quality assessment discussed above the range for 50 of the data per water type the boxes in fig 1 is 1 2 orders of magnitude and quite similar for influent effluent lake river and bottled water data for canal and tap water only a few studies were available which may have caused the variation to be much smaller for bottled water the number of studies was also low mason et al 2018 oβmann et al 2018 schymanski et al 2018 however there were many samples bottled water brands for this water type available in these studies the median concentrations per water type vary over four orders of magnitude some general patterns exist in the concentration data fig 1 surface waters have the lowest concentrations of all water types with bottled water closer to the higher end the lower concentrations observed in surface water particularly compared to drinking water is likely attributed to the fact that most surface water studies targeted only larger particles whereas smaller particles are more abundant cabernard et al 2018 wwtp influent shows the highest concentrations based on the median and interquartile range of reported concentrations fig 1 although wwtp studies generally did not monitor small particles the high concentrations therefore reflect direct domestic inputs and inputs from those diffuse land based sources that are routed via waste water wwtp effluent has a lower median compared to wwtp influent which probably reflects the retention of microplastics in wwtps similarly untreated tap water has higher concentrations than treated tap water concentrations in bottled water are higher than in tap water which may reflect the higher influx of airborne particles in the factories which are inherently more locked in wear from caps or bottle walls after production or the fact that these studies also included smaller sized particles for instance schymanski et al 2018 used raman microscopy and was thus able to identify down to 5 μm which also explains the high number concentrations the general trends observed here fig 1 still remain when only the studies that received highest quality scores are taken into account fig s1 still the generalities listed here should be interpreted with caution given the low number of bottled water n 3 treated tap water n 2 untreated dwtp water n 2 and ground water studies 1 although as noted earlier there were many bottled water samples available in the limited number of studies 3 2 2 microplastic shapes in global freshwaters microplastics of different shapes were reported several factors limit a potential quantitative analysis of reported data on the relative abundance of shapes among water types first many studies typically only analysed shapes of a subset of all isolated particles and it is not clear how representative these subsets were when it comes to particle shape second studies targeted different size ranges which also limits their comparability for instance fibres are typically small cole 2016 so easily missed when trawling third studies differed in the extent their water samples were representative of the studied water systems or water type which in turn is affected by spatial and temporal variability fourth although some particles shapes were quite well defined and thus interpreted similarly across studies some others are more ambiguous like nurdle pellet pre production pellet sphere resin or granule nevertheless we can provide a relatively robust view of the relative importance of particle shapes by showing the frequency of shapes observed across studies fig 2 the reviewed studies n 50 reported in the order of decreasing reporting frequency fragment fibre film foam pellet sphere line bead flake sheet granule paint foil and nurdle fig 2 we argue that this order also reflects a relative order of importance of shapes that is the most frequent shapes detected in a high number of locations globally as the reviewed studies concerned many different locations on the globe 3 2 3 polymer types reported in global studies on freshwater microplastics for 32 out of 55 records polymer types were assessed similar to particle shape as discussed above and rather than discussing relative abundances per study we consider the relative frequency of reported polymer types observed in water types on a global level often relative abundances per study are not provided or may not be considered accurate due to limited or biased subsets of particles used for the polymer identification most frequently observed polymer types across studies and records are pe pp ps pvc pet with acrylic or acrylic related compounds pa pest and pmma reported in five or more records fig 3 the order of the five most abundant polymers can be roughly explained by two factors global plastic demand and polymer density andrady 2011 bond et al 2018 global plastic demand would cause an order of pe pp pvc pet ps bond et al 2018 geyer et al 2017 however whereas pe and pp have densities below 1 g cm3 and are buoyant and ps has a density close to that of water pvc and pet have densities of 1 3 1 7 g cm3 therefore a relatively high degree of settling could explain the lower abundances of pvc and pet in the surface water samples mostly assessed here specific subsets i e lakes rivers versus wwtp samples were checked for differences in relative abundances of polymer types but no such differences were found for a more detailed analysis of polymers reported in studies the reader is referred to table s1 which provides all observed polymers on an individual record basis recently bond et al 2018 provided a review of polymer abundance data across environmental compartments in europe including 3 surface water and 5 wwtp studies instead of providing the reporting incidence across a large number of global studies they averaged relative abundances reported across these 8 european studies yet found the same order of abundances for the 5 most dominant polymers 3 2 4 sizes of microplastic particles studies generally did not report sizes or size distributions relating to individual particles which precludes a meta analysis of particle size across studies however size classes were reported table s1 as well as the number of particles observed per size class still this does not allow for a meaningful quantitative analysis because the size bins vary widely across studies fig 4a furthermore often lower or upper size limits are not specified so that it is not clear to what size class reported number concentrations actually relate instead of plotting the reported size ranges across studies fig 4a reported ranges can be plotted against mean particle number concentrations fig 4b the latter graph clearly shows that studies aiming for smaller particles like some of the bottled water and tap water studies generally find the higher particle number concentrations 4 conclusions we conclude that based on the limited number of high quality studies identified standardization of microplastic analysis in water is needed quality assurance criteria that require the most improvements are sample treatment polymer identification laboratory preparation clean air conditions and positive controls in addition to ensuring that individual studies are of higher quality in order to achieve more confidence in study findings standardized methods will allow reproducibility and comparability of results and will lead to the quality of data that are needed to conduct risk assessments among water types reported microplastic concentrations differed widely but the fact that studies target different size classes contributes to this variability despite the quality limitations our analysis confirmed that microplastic is frequently present in freshwaters and drinking water there is a high need to improve the analysis of very small microplastics and to identify them in different water samples fragments fibers film foam and pellets were the most frequently found microplastic shapes in surface water samples relative abundance of polymer types found across studies reflected plastic production and polymer densities conclusions on size comparisons among studies and water types are difficult to draw due to the aforementioned differences in targeted particle sizes more studies are needed to better understand occurrence shape polymer types and particle sizes particularly for the small plastic particles

18924,effectively eutrophication control and phosphate recovery have received increasing attention in recent years in this study a regenerable magnetic nala co3 2 fe3o4 composites mlc which includes a novel phosphate binding lanthanum species nala co3 2 hybridized with fe3o4 nanoparticle was developed through a modified solvothermal method for phosphate removal from contaminated water based upon preliminary screening of synthesized mlc with different la to fe molar ratios in terms of phosphate adsorption capacity and synthetic product yield a mlc composite with a la to fe molar ratio of 2 1 mlc 21 was selected for further characterization and evaluation mlc 21 exhibits a high magnetic separation efficiency of 97 high phosphate adsorption capacity of 77 85 mg p g wide applicable scope of ph ranging from 4 to 11 excellent selectivity for phosphate in the presence of competing ions cl no3 hco3 so4 2 ca2 and mg2 good reusability with above 98 desorption efficiency using naohnacl mixture and 83 adsorption capacity remained during five recycles furthermore a real effluent wastewater with phosphate concentration of 1 96 mg p l was used to verify the performance of mlc 21 through a magnetic separation integrated system amss by using the response surface methodology rsm the optimum parameters were determined to be 0 26 g l of adsorbent dosage 26 28 h of adsorption time and 24 12 min of magnetic separation time for meeting the phosphate emission standard of 0 5 mg p l the phosphorus in three representative eutrophic water bodies can be efficiently reduced to below 0 1 mg p l by mlc 21 adsorption at different dosages electrostatic attraction and the inner sphere complexation between la hco3 2 la co3 2 and p via ligand exchange forming lapo4 were responsible for the phosphate adsorption mechanisms of mlc graphical abstract image 1 keywords eutrophication magnetic separation lanthanum carbonate phosphate adsorption 1 introduction phosphorus p needed for dna rna and energy transfer of aquatic plant is the key limiting nutrients in most aquatic ecosystems conley et al 2009 however excessive discharge of p to water bodies can induce severe eutrophication leading to harmful algal blooms water quality deterioration and aquatic ecosystem damage schindler et al 2008 xu et al 2017 multiple lines of evidence show that p control works to mitigate eutrophication schindler et al 2016 causing many countries tighten up p effluent limits in the usa federal and state regulators have been applying strict total p effluent limits of 0 01 0 5 mg p l sengupta and pandit 2011 in the european union wastewater treatment plants have been regulated to meet discharge standard of 0 1 mg p l shepherd et al 2016 in china the primary a standard of total p concentration in wastewater treatment plants effluent does not exceed 0 5 mg p l however traditional techniques such as chemical precipitation and biological treatment often fail to reduce p concentrations to below the regulation levels for these waters zhou et al 2018 hence there are urgent needs for some new p removal techniques thus far numerous methods have been studied for p removal or recovery from contaminated waters and adsorption is a preferable approach due to its simplicity and effectiveness loganathan et al 2014 over recent decades many kinds of materials have been used for p adsorbents among them la modified materials or la bearing compounds are often considered as effective geo engineering tools to lock p from aquatic ecosystems spears et al 2014 2013a because of a strong affinity between la and p even at trace levels wu et al 2007 thus a number of la containing adsorbents have been developed for phosphate abatement such as la modified bentonite clay phoslock spears et al 2013b la immobilized polyacrylonitrile nanofibers he et al 2015 la doped ion exchange resin la 201 zhang et al 2016 and la loaded magnetic cationic hydrogel dong et al 2017 these adsorbents were all fabricated through lanthanum ions la3 lanthanum oxides la2o3 and la2o3 xh2o or lanthanum hydroxides la oh 3 being loaded to the host materials to improve the dispersity and utilization of lanthanum la3 ion was common loaded to the host materials such as zeolite he et al 2016 bentonite clay robb et al 2003 and mesoporous silica huang et al 2014 zhang et al 2011 by chemisorption and then enhanced phosphate adsorption capacities were obtained compared with their own original ones the adsorption mechanisms of these la3 modified adsorbents have been identified as the electrical interaction and ligand exchange between lanthanum and po4 3 moreover the phosphate uptake on these adsorbents was favored at neutral ph and inhibited at acid or alkaline ph values la oh 3 was often doped onto the carrier such as biochar liao et al 2018 nanofibers he et al 2015 and pvdf filtration membrane chen et al 2018 by in situ precipitation method when the initial phosphate concentrations were 400 mg p l 80 mg p l and 140 mg p l respectively the relevant phosphate adsorption capacities were increased to 101 16 mg p g 172 2 mg p g la and 256 6 mg p g la respectively besides the combination of electrical attraction ligand exchange inner sphere complexation and lapo4 precipitate contributed to these results but the phosphate uptake by these la oh 3 loaded adsorbents was ph dependent with the highest adsorption capacities occurred in a ph range of 4 6 for lanthanum oxides loaded mesoporous silica huang et al 2015 ion exchange resin d 201 zhang et al 2016 and magnetic cationic hydrogel dong et al 2017 their satisfactory phosphate adsorption capacities toward the phosphate solution 50 250 and 40 mg p g respectively were 44 82 113 64 and 90 2 mg p g respectively electrical attraction and lapo4 precipitate were responsible for the phosphate adsorption furthermore their phosphate adsorption capacities could maintain stable over a wide ph range of 4 10 in recent years lanthanum carbonate has been reported as an orally administrated phosphate binder and was approved by the united states food and drug administration for the control of hyperphosphataemia p et al 2006 mohammed and hutchison 2008 s et al 2017 lanthanum carbonate is highly insoluble la2 co3 3 pka la3 2 co3 2 3 29 9 firsching and mohammadzadei 1986 and can retain its phosphate binding capacity across the full ph range from 1 to 7 even at low p concentrations albaaj and hutchison 2005 furthermore the absolute bioavailability of lanthanum carbonate was extremely low 0 00127 0 0008 with individual values in the range of 0 00015 0 00224 pennick et al 2013 implying an encouraging safety up to now the application of such lanthanum species for p sequestration from water or wastewater has been rarely studied lanthanum carbonate could potentially serve as a new class lanthanum species in the construction of novel la containing adsorbents in addition a feasible liquid solid separation for adsorbents is of paramount importance since it is associated with both of the leakage and reusability traditional separation methods including centrifugation and filtration are energy intensive and unstable for separating adsorbents from water or wastewater dong and wang 2016 thus magnetic separation has elicited increasing interest because of its high separation efficiency short separation time low energy consumption and high selectivity tang and lo 2013 motivated by this concept incorporation of fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles with la appears a prospective adsorbent for tackling p resource depletion alleviating eutrophication and avoiding high consumption of la resource fang et al 2018a wu et al 2017 to date limited studies on the use of magnetic la based adsorbents for phosphate removal have been found in the literature wu et al 2017 given the relatively complicated synthesis procedures used in these studies i e 1st step for fe3o4 preparation and 2nd step for la loading a more facile synthesis method for effective la based magnetic adsorbents should be explored thus the objectives of this work are to 1 develop magnetic adsorbent nala co3 2

kh2po4 in 1000 ml deionized water the co existing ion solutions were generated by dissolving their corresponding sodium salts into deionized water the effluent wastewater sample was collected from the secondary sink of the anaerobic anoxic oxic a2 o processes in a municipal wastewater treatment plant of beijing china the eutrophic water samples were collected from three reservoirs in beijing yangzhou and shenzhen which are located in the northern central and southern of china respectively these real water samples were all filtered using a medium speed quantitative filter paper and stored at 4 c 2 2 synthesis of mlc composites mlc composites were fabricated by a modified version of solvothermal method wang et al 2005 briefly 5 0 mmol of fecl3 6h2o and predetermined amounts 2 5 5 0 7 5 10 0 20 0 and 30 0 mmol of lacl3 nh2o were dissolved in 80 ml of ethylene glycol under ultrasonic condition to form a clear solution followed by addition of 7 2 g of naac 2 g of peg and 1 g of urea the mixture was stirred vigorously for 30 min and then sealed in a 100 ml teflon lined stainless steel autoclave then the autoclave was heated to and maintained at 200 c for 12 h after cooling to room temperature the black or gray particles were magnetically separated and washed twice by ethanol and deionized water finally mlc composites with five la to fe molar ratios of 1 2 1 1 1 5 1 2 1 4 1 and 6 1 were obtained using the above method and the product yield was calculated as a ratio of the actual product mass to the theoretical product mass 2 3 adsorbents characterization the morphology of the adsorbents was studied using a transmission electron microscopy tem jem 2100f fei usa at an accelerating voltage of 20 kv and by a scanning electron microscope sem jeol jsm 6460lv japan with eds the crystal structure was analyzed using an x ray diffraction spectrometer xrd 7000 shimadzu japan with cu ka radiation and the data were collected from 2θ 10 80 at a continuous scan rate of 5 s the

in a typical experiment 10 mg of adsorbents were added into 100 ml of solution with known phosphate concentration solution ph was adjusted in the range 7 0 0 2 by hcl and naoh the reactors were shaken at 25 c under 150 rpm for 24 h as suggested from preliminary kinetic study to ensure adsorption equilibrium samples were withdrawn from the suspension and filtered through a 0 45 μm filters for p po4 3 concentration analysis the adsorption kinetics were conducted by mixing 200 mg of adsorbents with 400 ml phosphate solution of 10 mg p l and 5 ml supernatant was sampled periodically to determine p po4 3 concentration adsorption isotherms experiments were performed by dispersing 10 mg of the adsorbents into 100 ml of phosphate solution with the initial phosphate concentration ranging from 0 5 to 50 mg p l the influence of ph on phosphate removal was analyzed by adjusting the initial ph from 2 to 11 before adding adsorbents the leaching concentrations of iron and lanthanum at different phs were also measured the effects of competing ions on phosphate adsorption were examined by adding common coexisting ions i e cl no3 so4 2 hco3 ca2 and mg2 to the phosphate solutions the concentrations of coexisting ions were imposed at 10 50 and 100 mg l respectively to mimic the typical phosphate concentration of real wastewater an initial phosphate concentration of 2 mg p l was selected li et al 2009 2016 for studying the effects of ph and coexisting ions the exhausted adsorbents were collected by magnetic separation after a 24 h adsorption afterward the gradients desorption solution were mixed and stirred with adsorbents at 40 c to optimize the desorption solvent then the regenerated adsorbent was washed with deionized water and used in the next reuse regeneration cycle the phosphate desorption efficiencies were calculated as a ratio of the desorbed phosphate to the initially adsorbed all the batch experiments were performed in duplicate and the experimental details are available in the related figures and tables 2 5 phosphate removal from the effluent wastewater real effluent wastewater was also used as the treatment target to demonstrate the applicability of mlc composites a novel adsorption and magnetic separation integrated system amss illustrated in fig 1 was employed for phosphate removal and rapid separation of adsorbents magnetic separation was performed using a double layer hollow tube with the glass liebig condenser like structure and a removable magnet inside the magnet is assembled from 100 to 140 nd2fe14b beads with a diameter of 5 mm when the wastewater flows into the outer tube mlc can be easily adsorbed to the surface of the inner tube due to the magnetism in the inner tube to optimize the operation parameters response surface methodology rsm was carried out with a central composite design ccd li et al 2018 three independent factors denoted as x 1 x 2 and x 3 were selected namely adsorbent dosage adsorption time and separation time phosphate removal efficiency and effluent turbidity were considered as responses to y 1 and y 2 respectively ranges and levels of these three constituents were determined based on the results of preliminary tests as shown in table 1 twenty runs were required for a complete experimental design table s1 the experimental was analyzed by the design expert 8 software stat ease inc minneapolis mn usa the importance value of the sorbent dosage was assigned as 5 due to its most predominated influence on the removal effect and technical cost while the other four parameters were all set to 3 due to their equal importance to the sorption process the criteria and response sets for optimization are presented in table 2 2 6 chemical analysis phosphate concentration was determined using molybdate blue spectrophotometric method federation and association 2005 and a uv vis spectrometer uv 6100 mapada china the metal ions were detected by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes shimadzu 9800 japan the anions concentrations were determined by an ion chromatography analyzer ics 1000 dionex ion chromatography system usa total organic carbon toc was analyzed using a toc analyzer toc shimadzu japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of la to fe molar ratio on phosphate adsorption phosphate uptake vs la to fe molar ratio in the precursor solution as well as the product yield is shown in fig 2 phosphate adsorption capacity sharply increased as the la to fe molar ratio increased from 1 2 to 2 1 then leveling off at 6 1 the increasing phosphate adsorption capacity was in accordance with the la content in mlc composites confirmed by icp oes table s2 indicating that la is the main p adsorption site in mlc furthermore the highest product yield was obtained when la to fe molar ratio was 2 1 which may be related to the urea precipitating agent or the changes in reaction conditions such as reaction pressure or temperature caused by insufficient reaction volume for the simultaneous optimization of phosphate adsorption capacity and product yield mlc 2 1 composite simplified as mlc 21 was selected for further studies including detailed characterization and phosphate adsorption performance in fact potential commercialization of phosphate adsorbents for full scale application requires minimal chemical use and high p uptake capacity mlc with low la to fe molar ratio of 0 5 1 could be the superior choices accordingly 3 2 characterization the xrd pattern of mlc 21 is shown in fig 3 a the diffraction peaks matched well with standard cubic fe3o4 jcpds 88 0315 sun et al 2018 and orthorhombic nala co3 2 patterns jcpds 35 0961 respectively which demonstrated that the fabricated composition was nala co3 2 fe3o4 the crystallized structure of mlc 21 was further investigated by the hrtem as illustrated in fig 3b it is clearly noted that the fe3o4 nanoparticles grow onto the surface of nala co3 2 the distinct lattice fringe spacings were measured to be 0 25 and 0 40 nm which can be attributed to 311 crystal plane of cubic phase fe3o4 liu et al 2010 and 110 crystal plane of orthorhombic phase nala co3 2 respectively furthermore it was also observed that there is a wide diffuse ring in fft image of nala co3 2 phase fig 3b suggesting the characteristic of an amorphous like structure which could be favorable to phosphate uptake the morphologies of fe3o4 nala co3 2 and mlc 21 were confirmed by sem and tem images as shown in fig 4 the fe3o4 synthesized via the solvothermal method have a well defined spherical morphology with the diameter ranging from 200 to 500 nm nala co3 2 show obvious petal like lamellar structure after assembling the two components mlc exhibits a hybridized structure with spherical fe3o4 particles adhering to lamellar nala co3 2 the eds map scanning fig 4e confirms the formation of mlc and reveals the uniform loading of fe3o4 on the supported nala co3 2 the physiochemical properties of fe3o4 nala co3 2 and mlc 21 are summarized in table 3 the saturation magnetization m s of mlc 21 was 8 23 emu g less than that of pure fe3o4 63 80 emu g but higher than that of the recoverable la based magnetic cationic hydrogel adsorbent 0 2 1 emu g dong et al 2017 the relative lower m s is the result of hybridizing more nala co3 2 with fe3o4 however as indicated in fig 5 a mlc 21 showed a superparamagnetic property meaning that it can be magnetized with an external magnetic field and immediately redispersed once the magnet is removed an hui et al 2007 the magnetic separability of mlc 21 was tested through the magnetic separation unit in amss and the results are presented in fig 5b the magnetic separation efficiency wu et al 2017 was calculated based on the turbidity of inlet and outlet of the magnetic separation unit the magnetic separation efficiency sharply increased to 93 22 in 1 min and equilibrium around 97 was achieved within 30 min the high efficient magnetic separability could greatly enhance the availability of mlc 21 additionally as shown in table 3 due to the introduction of nala co3 2 with large specific surface area and pore parameters the specific surface area pore size and pore volume of mlc are much larger than that of fe3o4 this phenomenon was observed in the report of other metal doped fe3o4 qi et al 2017 furthermore mlc 21 has larger pore size and pore volume than nala co3 2 indicating that nano fe3o4 expands the nala co3 2 sheet zeta potential measurements of mlc indicated that the surface of the mlc was positively charged over a wide ph ranging from 2 to 8 9 fig s1 with a point of zero charge phpzc of 8 9 compared with fe3o4 the doping of electropositive nala co3 2 contributes to mlc with more positive charges thereby implying high electrical attraction to phosphate 3 3 the adsorption performance 3 3 1 adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherms of phosphate onto fe3o4 nala co3 2 and mlc 21 are shown in fig 6 the phosphate adsorption capacities of mlc 21 sharply increased as the equilibrium phosphate concentration increased to 2 64 mg l then gradually approached its maximum adsorption capacities of 76 78 mg p g in addition under the initial phosphate concentration ranging from 0 5 to 10 mg p l mlc 21 exhibited the same phosphate adsorption capacities compared with la oh 3 fe3o4 adsorbents fang et al 2018b wu et al 2017 remarkably the maximum phosphate adsorption capacity of pure nala co3 2 reached up to 120 23 mg p g due to its high la content table 3 this value is higher than the reported commercial lanthanum hydroxide 55 56 mg p g xie et al 2014 and lanthanum oxide 46 95 mg p g xie et al 2015 demonstrating a superiority of nala co3 2 for phosphate removal the naked fe3o4 exhibited negligible phosphate adsorption 2 3 mg p g hence the results implied that nala co3 2 was the main component of mlc 21 for phosphate adsorption and the contribution of fe3o4 in mlc 21 composites to the total phosphate removal appears to be minor the data of phosphate adsorption isotherms were analyzed by langmuir freundlich and sips models and the obtained parameters are reported in table s3 adsorption isotherms were better fitted to sips r2 0 98 and langmuir r2 0 97 suggesting a monolayer phosphate adsorption onto mlc 21 composites 1 α s 10 the maximum phosphate adsorption capacity q m determined from langmuir model was 77 85 mg p g the phosphate adsorption capacities of mlc 21 and other magnetic of la based absorbents were shown in table s4 the maximum phosphate adsorption capacity of mlc 21 is among one of the most promising magnetic la based adsorbents which is even higher than some of host guest la based materials dong et al 2017 huang et al 2015 the higher content of la is responsible for the higher phosphate adsorption capacity as la mainly serves as active sites for phosphate adsorption wu et al 2017 additionally the molar p la ratio of 0 92 for mlc 21 indicates the use efficiency of la within mlc 21 is relatively low but its magnetic separability makes mlc 21 easy to separate and reuse which could further improve the la usage 3 3 2 adsorption kinetics the time dependent adsorption of phosphate by mlc 21 is shown in fig 7 the phosphate uptake was initially rapid within the first 60 min and thereafter the adsorption capacity gradually increased and finally reached equilibrium after 8 h adsorption the maximum adsorption capacity occurred at 10 h with 99 9 phosphate removal for an initial phosphate concentration of 10 mg p l and a mlc 21 dosage of 0 5 g l two kinetic models were used to fit the curve in fig 7 and the corresponding results are presented in table s5 better fitted by pseudo second order model indicates that the phosphate adsorption to mlc 21 is mainly controlled by chemisorption involving valence forces wang 2018 the fitting results are also in agreement with the phosphate adsorption by other lanthanum based adsorbents such as fe3o4 la oh 3 fang et al 2018a la oh 3 fe3o4 wu et al 2017 mch la oh 3 ew dong et al 2017 3 3 3 effect of co existing ions to evaluate the selectivity of mlc 21 composites for phosphate removal the effects of competitive anions cl no3 hco3 so4 2 and cations ca2 mg2 were evaluated and the results are illustrated in fig 8 to simulate the real wastewater condition the concentrations of co existing ions varied from 10 to 100 mg l warwick et al 2013 which was 5 50 times the initial concentration of phosphate obviously the presence of these co existing ions had negligible interference on phosphate adsorption the results are in line with the previous studies on phosphate removal by la based materials lai et al 2016 wu et al 2017 xie et al 2014 indicating that lanthanum carbonate also has a strong selectivity for phosphate compared with lanthanum hydroxide or lanthanum oxide such strong selectivity could further support the practical utilization of this magnetic adsorbent for effluent wastewater treatment 3 3 4 phosphate desorption recycles of mlc 21 composites the regeneration of an effective adsorbent is a significant factor in assessing its potential for commercial application the phosphate desorption from saturated mlc 21 by several grade mixtures were conducted and the results are presented in fig s4 comparison of the phosphate desorption capacity and la fe leaching of mlc 21 after treated by different desorbents indicated that 2 0 m naoh and 1 0 m nacl mixture was the optimum desorption solvent thus 2 0 m naoh and 1 0 m nacl mixture was selected for further phosphate adsorption desorption cycles the regeneration and recycling behaviors of mlc 21 evaluated through 5 regeneration cycles are presented in fig 9 after the first two regeneration the adsorption capacity of the regenerated mlc 21 remained 92 and 85 respectively of that capacity of fresh mlc 21 afterward the adsorption capacity of the regenerated mlc 21 became stable and less than 20 decrease in adsorption capacity occurred this decreased adsorption capacity could be due to the inevitable changes of lanthanum species illustrated in fig s6 in addition more than 98 phosphate desorption efficiencies through 5 regeneration cycles can further strengthen its practical application appeal in real water remediation in fact more adsorption desorption cycles as well as the sustainable p recovery should be carried out to fulfill potential engineering applications in future 3 3 5 phosphate removal from effluent wastewater and eutrophic water real effluent wastewater was treated by mlc 21 composites using amss prior to being treated the treated wastewater effluent was filtered using a 0 45 μm membrane filter and characterized as shown in table 4 the optimization of the experimental conditions was done using ccd and corresponding results and anova are presented in tables s1 s7 and s8 the second order polynomial and linear equations 1 and 2 were obtained after the data fitting respectively 1 y 1 33 34 249x 1 4 47x 2 0 31x 3 1 31x 1 x 2 0 02x 1 x 3 8 06e 003 x 2 x 3 167 09 1 2 0 08 2 2 7 90e 003 3 2 2 y 2 8 49 22 47x 1 0 26x 2 0 33x 3 values of prob f less than 0 0500 tables s7 and s8 indicated the model terms were significant reliable models could then be used to predict the optimum operation parameters of amss for the treated wastewater effluent it is noted that the optimum condition is basically dependent on the assumption for the relative importance of parameter values table 2 as shown in table 5 the optimum parameters were determined to be 0 26 g l of adsorbent dosage 26 28 h of adsorption time and 24 12 min of magnetic separation time accordingly the actual experiment under the optimum parameters was also performed with a residual phosphate concentration of 0 29 mg p l the phosphate removal efficiency of 85 11 and a turbidity of 3 94 ntu the concentrations of la and fe in the effluent were also monitored and no extraneous metal ions were detected by icp oes demonstrating good stability of the adsorbents based on the enhanced phosphate removal performance mlc 21 was also used for treating eutrophic lake water through amss as shown in fig s5 the residual phosphate concentrations of the three samples were reduced below 0 1 mg p l under mlc 21 dosage of 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 g l respectively then more than 95 of dosed mlc 21 can be effectively recovery from water furthermore the ecotoxicological effects of lanthanum to organisms are of paramount importance when using la based adsorbents for eutrophic drinking water here lanthanum carbonate is administered for patients with renal failure to reduce the absorption of phosphate and keep optimum phosphate levels ban et al 2017 preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated a good safety profile mohammed and hutchison 2008 thus the influence of trace lanthanum carbonate on the human body could be neglected 3 4 adsorption mechanisms 3 4 1 ph effect analysis the effect of ph on phosphate uptake is presented in fig 10 the phosphate uptake gradually increased with ph increase from 2 1 to 4 0 and then maintained stable as ph increased to 9 1 afterward the phosphate uptake showed a slight decrease within the range of ph 9 1 11 0 the results indicated mlc 21 composites exhibited high phosphate removal performance over a wide ph range which was comparable to the performance of lanthanum oxides loaded cationic host adsorbents dong et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 such a wide ph tolerance range of mlc 21 greatly expands its application range it has been known that the carbonate species varied with the solution ph fig s2 correspondingly different carbonate species could occur in mlc at different ph values at neutral phs the na ions in mlc 21 are dissociated into water and the la co3 2 species first appeared then under acidic or basic conditions the protonated form original form of la co3 2 or la oh 3 on the surface of mlc 21 will occur the corresponding reactions could be deduced by combining fig s1 fig s2 and fig s3 with the following eqs 3 6 in the ph range of 2 4 the high lanthanum leaching was occurred as eq 5 as ph increased from 4 0 to 8 6 la hco3 2 is becoming the major surface species of mlc 21 according to eq 4 thus the mcl 21 presented positive zeta potential at ph 8 6 when the ph further increased both la hco3 2 eq 4 and la co3 2 eq 6 existed simultaneously furthermore the ligand exchange between la co3 2 eq 6 and oh was also occurred in alkali conditions eq 7 according to the solubility product comparison between la oh 3 pka la3 oh 3 22 8 bouyer et al 2006 and la2 co3 3 pka la3 2 co3 2 3 29 9 the stoichiometric coefficient of la3 is 2 firsching and mohammadzadei 1986 hence more la hco3 2 were consumed generating a negatively charged mlc 21 3 nala c o 3 2 n a l a c o 3 2 4 l a c o 3 2 2 h l a h c o 3 2 5 l a h c o 3 2 2 h l a 3 2 h 2 c o 3 a q 6 l a h c o 3 2 2 o h l a c o 3 2 2 h 2 o 7 l a c o 3 2 3 o h l a o h 3 2 c o 3 2 thus based on both the phosphate species distribution and the surface chemical species of mlc 21 versus ph the phosphate uptake by mlc 21 varied with ph at ph of 2 3 h3po4 is still present in considerable amount 10 50 which has a direct impact on the lower phosphate uptake dong et al 2017 xie et al 2014 and the high lanthanum leaching table s6 of mlc is also responsible for the dramatic drop of phosphate uptake in the ph range of 3 4 h2po4 is the major species thereby resulting in an increased phosphate adsorption capacity with the increase of ph from 4 0 to 8 6 two species of divalent hpo4 2 and monovalent h2po4 are coexistent the ligand exchanges between la hco3 2 and hpo4 2 h2po4 as well as electrostatic attraction between them promote the phosphate adsorption simultaneously although the zeta potential of mcl 21 decreased as ph increased the predominated ligand exchanges could counteract the decreased electrostatic attraction and the p adsorption capacity of mcl 21 maintains stable and high as ph further increased over 8 6 the surface of mlc became negatively charged which was not favorable for electrostatic attraction at this point hpo4 2 is the dominant species with the increasing fraction of po4 3 the p adsorption capacity of mcl 21 still maintains stable as ph increased up to about 9 afterward when ph further increased to 11 the p adsorption capacity of mcl 21 shows a slow decrease it can be seen that the stronger electrostatic repulsion and oh competitive adsorption could contribute to this decrease however the la co3 2 species could still adsorb po4 3 through ligand exchange which was stronger than that between la oh 3 and po4 3 by comparing the solubility product of la oh 3 pka 22 8 la2 co3 3 pka 29 9 and lapo4 pka 26 16 3 4 2 atr ir and raman spectra atr ir and raman spectra of mlc before and after phosphate adsorption are exhibited in fig 11 as shown in the atr ir spectra fig 11a peaks at 1420 and 860 cm 1 are assigned to ν3 and ν2 band vibrations of co3 2 in nala co3 2 zhang et al 2015 2014 the bands at 613 and 560 cm 1 are attributed to feo vibrations these results were coincident with the characterization results of mlc after phosphate adsorption the new peaks at 1045 and 540 cm 1 corresponding to the ν3 and ν4 band vibrations of hpo4 2 or h2po4 hint the presence of the adsorbed phosphate kwaśniak kominek et al 2015 wu et al 2017 fig 11b shows the raman spectra for mlc in which the bands at 344 393 440 and 1074 cm 1 are related to nala co3 2 cornaglia et al 2004 rangel et al 2017 peaks at 260 518 and 640 cm 1 are assigned to eg t2g and a1g modes of fe3o4 carmona carmona et al 2017 zhang and kong 2011 after phosphate adsorption the weak spectra at 974 and 483 cm 1 were observed as ν1 and ν2 of lapo4 pelczarska et al 2015 pragatheeswaran et al 2015 which is in agreement with previous studies dong et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 in addition xrd pattern of mlc before and after phosphate adsorption showed in fig s6 also confirmed lapo4 was formed during phosphate uptake by mlc this result was in accordance with the phosphate adsorption mechanism by most other lanthanum based adsorbents chen et al 2018 dong et al 2017 he et al 2015 liao et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 however recent studies on extended x ray fine structure exafs spectra analysis of the phosphate loaded la oh 3 do not support the formation of lapo4 fang et al 2017 xu et al 2017 thus relevant mechanisms still need to be further studied 3 4 3 xps spectra xps spectra of mlc before and after phosphate adsorption were also evaluated the appearance of the p 2p peak in the xps wide scan spectrum shown in fig 12a and fig s7 indicates that phosphate has been successfully adsorbed high resolution spectra of o 1s la 3d and fe 2p are presented in fig 12 b d and the o 1s fitted peak parameters are listed in table s9 after phosphate adsorption new oxygen fitting peak and the increase of the binding energy of iron and lanthanum were observed which could be attributed to the formation of inner sphere complexation laop and feop bonding fig 12c and d fang et al 2018a 2015 wu et al 2017 4 conclusion the magnetic mlc composites were fabricated by a modified solvothermal method for phosphate removal from wastewater nala co3 2 acts as active sites for the removal of phosphate while fe3o4 allows for the magnetic separation mlc composites exhibit a high magnetic separation efficiency in amss batch adsorption results showed that the maximum phosphate adsorption capacity of mlc was 77 85 mg p g in a 10 mg p l solution the phosphate adsorption equilibrium was reached within 8 h with the adsorbent dosage of 0 5 g l mlc 21 composites exhibited high phosphate removal performance over a wide ph range of 4 11 excellent selectivity for phosphate in the presence of common competing ions good reusability in addition real wastewater and eutrophic lake water treatment by using magnetic separation integrated system implied that mlc 21 composites had practical value for application the atr ir raman xrd and xps spectra showed that phosphate sorption can be attributed to electrostatic attraction and the inner sphere complexation between la hco3 2 la co3 2 and p via ligand exchange acknowledgments this work was supported by national key research and development program of china 2016yfa0203204

18924,effectively eutrophication control and phosphate recovery have received increasing attention in recent years in this study a regenerable magnetic nala co3 2 fe3o4 composites mlc which includes a novel phosphate binding lanthanum species nala co3 2 hybridized with fe3o4 nanoparticle was developed through a modified solvothermal method for phosphate removal from contaminated water based upon preliminary screening of synthesized mlc with different la to fe molar ratios in terms of phosphate adsorption capacity and synthetic product yield a mlc composite with a la to fe molar ratio of 2 1 mlc 21 was selected for further characterization and evaluation mlc 21 exhibits a high magnetic separation efficiency of 97 high phosphate adsorption capacity of 77 85 mg p g wide applicable scope of ph ranging from 4 to 11 excellent selectivity for phosphate in the presence of competing ions cl no3 hco3 so4 2 ca2 and mg2 good reusability with above 98 desorption efficiency using naohnacl mixture and 83 adsorption capacity remained during five recycles furthermore a real effluent wastewater with phosphate concentration of 1 96 mg p l was used to verify the performance of mlc 21 through a magnetic separation integrated system amss by using the response surface methodology rsm the optimum parameters were determined to be 0 26 g l of adsorbent dosage 26 28 h of adsorption time and 24 12 min of magnetic separation time for meeting the phosphate emission standard of 0 5 mg p l the phosphorus in three representative eutrophic water bodies can be efficiently reduced to below 0 1 mg p l by mlc 21 adsorption at different dosages electrostatic attraction and the inner sphere complexation between la hco3 2 la co3 2 and p via ligand exchange forming lapo4 were responsible for the phosphate adsorption mechanisms of mlc graphical abstract image 1 keywords eutrophication magnetic separation lanthanum carbonate phosphate adsorption 1 introduction phosphorus p needed for dna rna and energy transfer of aquatic plant is the key limiting nutrients in most aquatic ecosystems conley et al 2009 however excessive discharge of p to water bodies can induce severe eutrophication leading to harmful algal blooms water quality deterioration and aquatic ecosystem damage schindler et al 2008 xu et al 2017 multiple lines of evidence show that p control works to mitigate eutrophication schindler et al 2016 causing many countries tighten up p effluent limits in the usa federal and state regulators have been applying strict total p effluent limits of 0 01 0 5 mg p l sengupta and pandit 2011 in the european union wastewater treatment plants have been regulated to meet discharge standard of 0 1 mg p l shepherd et al 2016 in china the primary a standard of total p concentration in wastewater treatment plants effluent does not exceed 0 5 mg p l however traditional techniques such as chemical precipitation and biological treatment often fail to reduce p concentrations to below the regulation levels for these waters zhou et al 2018 hence there are urgent needs for some new p removal techniques thus far numerous methods have been studied for p removal or recovery from contaminated waters and adsorption is a preferable approach due to its simplicity and effectiveness loganathan et al 2014 over recent decades many kinds of materials have been used for p adsorbents among them la modified materials or la bearing compounds are often considered as effective geo engineering tools to lock p from aquatic ecosystems spears et al 2014 2013a because of a strong affinity between la and p even at trace levels wu et al 2007 thus a number of la containing adsorbents have been developed for phosphate abatement such as la modified bentonite clay phoslock spears et al 2013b la immobilized polyacrylonitrile nanofibers he et al 2015 la doped ion exchange resin la 201 zhang et al 2016 and la loaded magnetic cationic hydrogel dong et al 2017 these adsorbents were all fabricated through lanthanum ions la3 lanthanum oxides la2o3 and la2o3 xh2o or lanthanum hydroxides la oh 3 being loaded to the host materials to improve the dispersity and utilization of lanthanum la3 ion was common loaded to the host materials such as zeolite he et al 2016 bentonite clay robb et al 2003 and mesoporous silica huang et al 2014 zhang et al 2011 by chemisorption and then enhanced phosphate adsorption capacities were obtained compared with their own original ones the adsorption mechanisms of these la3 modified adsorbents have been identified as the electrical interaction and ligand exchange between lanthanum and po4 3 moreover the phosphate uptake on these adsorbents was favored at neutral ph and inhibited at acid or alkaline ph values la oh 3 was often doped onto the carrier such as biochar liao et al 2018 nanofibers he et al 2015 and pvdf filtration membrane chen et al 2018 by in situ precipitation method when the initial phosphate concentrations were 400 mg p l 80 mg p l and 140 mg p l respectively the relevant phosphate adsorption capacities were increased to 101 16 mg p g 172 2 mg p g la and 256 6 mg p g la respectively besides the combination of electrical attraction ligand exchange inner sphere complexation and lapo4 precipitate contributed to these results but the phosphate uptake by these la oh 3 loaded adsorbents was ph dependent with the highest adsorption capacities occurred in a ph range of 4 6 for lanthanum oxides loaded mesoporous silica huang et al 2015 ion exchange resin d 201 zhang et al 2016 and magnetic cationic hydrogel dong et al 2017 their satisfactory phosphate adsorption capacities toward the phosphate solution 50 250 and 40 mg p g respectively were 44 82 113 64 and 90 2 mg p g respectively electrical attraction and lapo4 precipitate were responsible for the phosphate adsorption furthermore their phosphate adsorption capacities could maintain stable over a wide ph range of 4 10 in recent years lanthanum carbonate has been reported as an orally administrated phosphate binder and was approved by the united states food and drug administration for the control of hyperphosphataemia p et al 2006 mohammed and hutchison 2008 s et al 2017 lanthanum carbonate is highly insoluble la2 co3 3 pka la3 2 co3 2 3 29 9 firsching and mohammadzadei 1986 and can retain its phosphate binding capacity across the full ph range from 1 to 7 even at low p concentrations albaaj and hutchison 2005 furthermore the absolute bioavailability of lanthanum carbonate was extremely low 0 00127 0 0008 with individual values in the range of 0 00015 0 00224 pennick et al 2013 implying an encouraging safety up to now the application of such lanthanum species for p sequestration from water or wastewater has been rarely studied lanthanum carbonate could potentially serve as a new class lanthanum species in the construction of novel la containing adsorbents in addition a feasible liquid solid separation for adsorbents is of paramount importance since it is associated with both of the leakage and reusability traditional separation methods including centrifugation and filtration are energy intensive and unstable for separating adsorbents from water or wastewater dong and wang 2016 thus magnetic separation has elicited increasing interest because of its high separation efficiency short separation time low energy consumption and high selectivity tang and lo 2013 motivated by this concept incorporation of fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles with la appears a prospective adsorbent for tackling p resource depletion alleviating eutrophication and avoiding high consumption of la resource fang et al 2018a wu et al 2017 to date limited studies on the use of magnetic la based adsorbents for phosphate removal have been found in the literature wu et al 2017 given the relatively complicated synthesis procedures used in these studies i e 1st step for fe3o4 preparation and 2nd step for la loading a more facile synthesis method for effective la based magnetic adsorbents should be explored thus the objectives of this work are to 1 develop magnetic adsorbent nala co3 2

secondary sink of the anaerobic anoxic oxic a2 o processes in a municipal wastewater treatment plant of beijing china the eutrophic water samples were collected from three reservoirs in beijing yangzhou and shenzhen which are located in the northern central and southern of china respectively these real water samples were all filtered using a medium speed quantitative filter paper and stored at 4 c 2 2 synthesis of mlc composites mlc composites were fabricated by a modified version of solvothermal method wang et al 2005 briefly 5 0 mmol of fecl3 6h2o and predetermined amounts 2 5 5 0 7 5

the mixture was stirred vigorously for 30 min and then sealed in a 100 ml teflon lined stainless steel autoclave then the autoclave was heated to and maintained at 200 c for 12 h after cooling to room temperature the black or gray particles were magnetically separated and washed twice by ethanol and deionized water finally mlc composites with five la to fe molar ratios of 1 2 1 1 1 5 1 2 1 4 1 and 6 1 were obtained using the above method and the product yield was calculated as a ratio of the actual product mass to the theoretical product mass 2 3 adsorbents characterization the morphology of

in a typical experiment 10 mg of adsorbents were added into 100 ml of solution with known phosphate concentration solution ph was adjusted in the range 7 0 0 2 by hcl and naoh the reactors were shaken at 25 c under 150 rpm for 24 h as suggested from preliminary kinetic study to ensure adsorption equilibrium samples were withdrawn from the suspension and filtered through a 0 45 μm filters for p po4 3 concentration analysis the adsorption kinetics were conducted by mixing 200 mg of adsorbents with 400 ml phosphate solution of 10 mg p l and 5 ml supernatant was sampled periodically to determine p po4 3 concentration adsorption isotherms experiments were performed by dispersing 10 mg of the adsorbents into 100 ml of phosphate solution with the initial phosphate concentration ranging from 0 5 to 50 mg p l the influence of ph on phosphate removal was analyzed by adjusting the initial ph from 2 to 11 before adding adsorbents the leaching concentrations of iron and lanthanum at different phs were also measured the effects of competing ions on phosphate adsorption were examined by adding common coexisting ions i e cl no3 so4 2 hco3 ca2 and mg2 to the phosphate solutions the concentrations of coexisting ions were imposed at 10 50 and 100 mg l respectively to mimic the typical phosphate concentration of real wastewater an initial phosphate concentration of 2 mg p l was selected li et al 2009 2016 for studying the effects of ph and coexisting ions the exhausted adsorbents were collected by magnetic separation after a 24 h adsorption afterward the gradients desorption solution were mixed and stirred with adsorbents at 40 c to optimize the desorption solvent then the regenerated adsorbent was washed with deionized water and used in the next reuse regeneration cycle the phosphate desorption efficiencies were calculated as a ratio of the desorbed phosphate to the initially adsorbed all the batch experiments were performed in duplicate and the experimental details are available in the related figures and tables 2 5 phosphate removal from the effluent wastewater real effluent wastewater was also used as the treatment target to demonstrate the applicability of mlc composites a novel adsorption and magnetic separation integrated system amss illustrated in fig 1 was employed for phosphate removal and rapid separation of adsorbents magnetic separation was performed using a double layer hollow tube with the glass liebig condenser like structure and a removable magnet inside the magnet is assembled from 100 to 140 nd2fe14b beads with a diameter of 5 mm when the wastewater flows into the outer tube mlc can be easily adsorbed to the surface of the inner tube due to the magnetism in the inner tube to optimize the operation parameters response surface methodology rsm was carried out with a central composite design ccd li et al 2018 three independent factors denoted as x 1 x 2 and x 3 were selected namely adsorbent dosage adsorption time and separation time phosphate removal efficiency and effluent turbidity were considered as responses to y 1 and y 2 respectively ranges and levels of these three constituents were determined based on the results of preliminary tests as shown in table 1 twenty runs were required for a complete experimental design table s1 the experimental was analyzed by the design expert 8 software stat ease inc minneapolis mn usa the importance value of the sorbent dosage was assigned as 5 due to its most predominated influence on the removal effect and technical cost while the other four parameters were all set to 3 due to their equal importance to the sorption process the criteria and response sets for optimization are presented in table 2 2 6 chemical analysis phosphate concentration was determined using molybdate blue spectrophotometric method federation and association 2005 and a uv vis spectrometer uv 6100 mapada china the metal ions were detected by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes shimadzu 9800 japan the anions concentrations were determined by an ion chromatography analyzer ics 1000 dionex ion chromatography system usa total organic carbon toc was analyzed using a toc analyzer toc shimadzu japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of la to fe molar ratio on phosphate adsorption phosphate uptake vs la to fe molar ratio in the precursor solution as well as the product yield is shown in fig 2 phosphate adsorption capacity sharply increased as the la to fe molar ratio increased from 1 2 to 2 1 then leveling off at 6 1 the increasing phosphate adsorption capacity was in accordance with the la content in mlc composites confirmed by icp oes table s2 indicating that la is the main p adsorption site in mlc furthermore the highest product yield was obtained when la to fe molar ratio was 2 1 which may be related to the urea precipitating agent or the changes in reaction conditions such as reaction pressure or temperature caused by insufficient reaction volume for the simultaneous optimization of phosphate adsorption capacity and product yield mlc 2 1 composite simplified as mlc 21 was selected for further studies including detailed characterization and phosphate adsorption performance in fact potential commercialization of phosphate adsorbents for full scale application requires minimal chemical use and high p uptake capacity mlc with low la to fe molar ratio of 0 5 1 could be the superior choices accordingly 3 2 characterization the xrd pattern of mlc 21 is shown in fig 3 a the diffraction peaks matched well with standard cubic fe3o4 jcpds 88 0315 sun et al 2018 and orthorhombic nala co3 2 patterns jcpds 35 0961 respectively which demonstrated that the fabricated composition was nala co3 2 fe3o4 the crystallized structure of mlc 21 was further investigated by the hrtem as illustrated in fig 3b it is clearly noted that the fe3o4 nanoparticles grow onto the surface of nala co3 2 the distinct lattice fringe spacings were measured to be 0 25 and 0 40 nm which can be attributed to 311 crystal plane of cubic phase fe3o4 liu et al 2010 and 110 crystal plane of orthorhombic phase nala co3 2 respectively furthermore it was also observed that there is a wide diffuse ring in fft image of nala co3 2 phase fig 3b suggesting the characteristic of an amorphous like structure which could be favorable to phosphate uptake the morphologies of fe3o4 nala co3 2 and mlc 21 were confirmed by sem and tem images as shown in fig 4 the fe3o4 synthesized via the solvothermal method have a well defined spherical morphology with the diameter ranging from 200 to 500 nm nala co3 2 show obvious petal like lamellar structure after assembling the two components mlc exhibits a hybridized structure with spherical fe3o4 particles adhering to lamellar nala co3 2 the eds map scanning fig 4e confirms the formation of mlc and reveals the uniform loading of fe3o4 on the supported nala co3 2 the physiochemical properties of fe3o4 nala co3 2 and mlc 21 are summarized in table 3 the saturation magnetization m s of mlc 21 was 8 23 emu g less than that of pure fe3o4 63 80 emu g but higher than that of the recoverable la based magnetic cationic hydrogel adsorbent 0 2 1 emu g dong et al 2017 the relative lower m s is the result of hybridizing more nala co3 2 with fe3o4 however as indicated in fig 5 a mlc 21 showed a superparamagnetic property meaning that it can be magnetized with an external magnetic field and immediately redispersed once the magnet is removed an hui et al 2007 the magnetic separability of mlc 21 was tested through the magnetic separation unit in amss and the results are presented in fig 5b the magnetic separation efficiency wu et al 2017 was calculated based on the turbidity of inlet and outlet of the magnetic separation unit the magnetic separation efficiency sharply increased to 93 22 in 1 min and equilibrium around 97 was achieved within 30 min the high efficient magnetic separability could greatly enhance the availability of mlc 21 additionally as shown in table 3 due to the introduction of nala co3 2 with large specific surface area and pore parameters the specific surface area pore size and pore volume of mlc are much larger than that of fe3o4 this phenomenon was observed in the report of other metal doped fe3o4 qi et al 2017 furthermore mlc 21 has larger pore size and pore volume than nala co3 2 indicating that nano fe3o4 expands the nala co3 2 sheet zeta potential measurements of mlc indicated that the surface of the mlc was positively charged over a wide ph ranging from 2 to 8 9 fig s1 with a point of zero charge phpzc of 8 9 compared with fe3o4 the doping of electropositive nala co3 2 contributes to mlc with more positive charges thereby implying high electrical attraction to phosphate 3 3 the adsorption performance 3 3 1 adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherms of phosphate onto fe3o4 nala co3 2 and mlc 21 are shown in fig 6 the phosphate adsorption capacities of mlc 21 sharply increased as the equilibrium phosphate concentration increased to 2 64 mg l then gradually approached its maximum adsorption capacities of 76 78 mg p g in addition under the initial phosphate concentration ranging from 0 5 to 10 mg p l mlc 21 exhibited the same phosphate adsorption capacities compared with la oh 3 fe3o4 adsorbents fang et al 2018b wu et al 2017 remarkably the maximum phosphate adsorption capacity of pure nala co3 2 reached up to 120 23 mg p g due to its high la content table 3 this value is higher than the reported commercial lanthanum hydroxide 55 56 mg p g xie et al 2014 and lanthanum oxide 46 95 mg p g xie et al 2015 demonstrating a superiority of nala co3 2 for phosphate removal the naked fe3o4 exhibited negligible phosphate adsorption 2 3 mg p g hence the results implied that nala co3 2 was the main component of mlc 21 for phosphate adsorption and the contribution of fe3o4 in mlc 21 composites to the total phosphate removal appears to be minor the data of phosphate adsorption isotherms were analyzed by langmuir freundlich and sips models and the obtained parameters are reported in table s3 adsorption isotherms were better fitted to sips r2 0 98 and langmuir r2 0 97 suggesting a monolayer phosphate adsorption onto mlc 21 composites 1 α s 10 the maximum phosphate adsorption capacity q m determined from langmuir model was 77 85 mg p g the phosphate adsorption capacities of mlc 21 and other magnetic of la based absorbents were shown in table s4 the maximum phosphate adsorption capacity of mlc 21 is among one of the most promising magnetic la based adsorbents which is even higher than some of host guest la based materials dong et al 2017 huang et al 2015 the higher content of la is responsible for the higher phosphate adsorption capacity as la mainly serves as active sites for phosphate adsorption wu et al 2017 additionally the molar p la ratio of 0 92 for mlc 21 indicates the use efficiency of la within mlc 21 is relatively low but its magnetic separability makes mlc 21 easy to separate and reuse which could further improve the la usage 3 3 2 adsorption kinetics the time dependent adsorption of phosphate by mlc 21 is shown in fig 7 the phosphate uptake was initially rapid within the first 60 min and thereafter the adsorption capacity gradually increased and finally reached equilibrium after 8 h adsorption the maximum adsorption capacity occurred at 10 h with 99 9 phosphate removal for an initial phosphate concentration of 10 mg p l and a mlc 21 dosage of 0 5 g l two kinetic models were used to fit the curve in fig 7 and the corresponding results are presented in table s5 better fitted by pseudo second order model indicates that the phosphate adsorption to mlc 21 is mainly controlled by chemisorption involving valence forces wang 2018 the fitting results are also in agreement with the phosphate adsorption by other lanthanum based adsorbents such as fe3o4 la oh 3 fang et al 2018a la oh 3 fe3o4 wu et al 2017 mch la oh 3 ew dong et al 2017 3 3 3 effect of co existing ions to evaluate the selectivity of mlc 21 composites for phosphate removal the effects of competitive anions cl no3 hco3 so4 2 and cations ca2 mg2 were evaluated and the results are illustrated in fig 8 to simulate the real wastewater condition the concentrations of co existing ions varied from 10 to 100 mg l warwick et al 2013 which was 5 50 times the initial concentration of phosphate obviously the presence of these co existing ions had negligible interference on phosphate adsorption the results are in line with the previous studies on phosphate removal by la based materials lai et al 2016 wu et al 2017 xie et al 2014 indicating that lanthanum carbonate also has a strong selectivity for phosphate compared with lanthanum hydroxide or lanthanum oxide such strong selectivity could further support the practical utilization of this magnetic adsorbent for effluent wastewater treatment 3 3 4 phosphate desorption recycles of mlc 21 composites the regeneration of an effective adsorbent is a significant factor in assessing its potential for commercial application the phosphate desorption from saturated mlc 21 by several grade mixtures were conducted and the results are presented in fig s4 comparison of the phosphate desorption capacity and la fe leaching of mlc 21 after treated by different desorbents indicated that 2 0 m naoh and 1 0 m nacl mixture was the optimum desorption solvent thus 2 0 m naoh and 1 0 m nacl mixture was selected for further phosphate adsorption desorption cycles the regeneration and recycling behaviors of mlc 21 evaluated through 5 regeneration cycles are presented in fig 9 after the first two regeneration the adsorption capacity of the regenerated mlc 21 remained 92 and 85 respectively of that capacity of fresh mlc 21 afterward the adsorption capacity of the regenerated mlc 21 became stable and less than 20 decrease in adsorption capacity occurred this decreased adsorption capacity could be due to the inevitable changes of lanthanum species illustrated in fig s6 in addition more than 98 phosphate desorption efficiencies through 5 regeneration cycles can further strengthen its practical application appeal in real water remediation in fact more adsorption desorption cycles as well as the sustainable p recovery should be carried out to fulfill potential engineering applications in future 3 3 5 phosphate removal from effluent wastewater and eutrophic water real effluent wastewater was treated by mlc 21 composites using amss prior to being treated the treated wastewater effluent was filtered using a 0 45 μm membrane filter and characterized as shown in table 4 the optimization of the experimental conditions was done using ccd and corresponding results and anova are presented in tables s1 s7 and s8 the second order polynomial and linear equations 1 and 2 were obtained after the data fitting respectively 1 y 1 33 34 249x 1 4 47x 2 0 31x 3 1 31x 1 x 2 0 02x 1 x 3 8 06e 003 x 2 x 3 167 09 1 2 0 08 2 2 7 90e 003 3 2 2 y 2 8 49 22 47x 1 0 26x 2 0 33x 3 values of prob f less than 0 0500 tables s7 and s8 indicated the model terms were significant reliable models could then be used to predict the optimum operation parameters of amss for the treated wastewater effluent it is noted that the optimum condition is basically dependent on the assumption for the relative importance of parameter values table 2 as shown in table 5 the optimum parameters were determined to be 0 26 g l of adsorbent dosage 26 28 h of adsorption time and 24 12 min of magnetic separation time accordingly the actual experiment under the optimum parameters was also performed with a residual phosphate concentration of 0 29 mg p l the phosphate removal efficiency of 85 11 and a turbidity of 3 94 ntu the concentrations of la and fe in the effluent were also monitored and no extraneous metal ions were detected by icp oes demonstrating good stability of the adsorbents based on the enhanced phosphate removal performance mlc 21 was also used for treating eutrophic lake water through amss as shown in fig s5 the residual phosphate concentrations of the three samples were reduced below 0 1 mg p l under mlc 21 dosage of 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 g l respectively then more than 95 of dosed mlc 21 can be effectively recovery from water furthermore the ecotoxicological effects of lanthanum to organisms are of paramount importance when using la based adsorbents for eutrophic drinking water here lanthanum carbonate is administered for patients with renal failure to reduce the absorption of phosphate and keep optimum phosphate levels ban et al 2017 preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated a good safety profile mohammed and hutchison 2008 thus the influence of trace lanthanum carbonate on the human body could be neglected 3 4 adsorption mechanisms 3 4 1 ph effect analysis the effect of ph on phosphate uptake is presented in fig 10 the phosphate uptake gradually increased with ph increase from 2 1 to 4 0 and then maintained stable as ph increased to 9 1 afterward the phosphate uptake showed a slight decrease within the range of ph 9 1 11 0 the results indicated mlc 21 composites exhibited high phosphate removal performance over a wide ph range which was comparable to the performance of lanthanum oxides loaded cationic host adsorbents dong et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 such a wide ph tolerance range of mlc 21 greatly expands its application range it has been known that the carbonate species varied with the solution ph fig s2 correspondingly different carbonate species could occur in mlc at different ph values at neutral phs the na ions in mlc 21 are dissociated into water and the la co3 2 species first appeared then under acidic or basic conditions the protonated form original form of la co3 2 or la oh 3 on the surface of mlc 21 will occur the corresponding reactions could be deduced by combining fig s1 fig s2 and fig s3 with the following eqs 3 6 in the ph range of 2 4 the high lanthanum leaching was occurred as eq 5 as ph increased from 4 0 to 8 6 la hco3 2 is becoming the major surface species of mlc 21 according to eq 4 thus the mcl 21 presented positive zeta potential at ph 8 6 when the ph further increased both la hco3 2 eq 4 and la co3 2 eq 6 existed simultaneously furthermore the ligand exchange between la co3 2 eq 6 and oh was also occurred in alkali conditions eq 7 according to the solubility product comparison between la oh 3 pka la3 oh 3 22 8 bouyer et al 2006 and la2 co3 3 pka la3 2 co3 2 3 29 9 the stoichiometric coefficient of la3 is 2 firsching and mohammadzadei 1986 hence more la hco3 2 were consumed generating a negatively charged mlc 21 3 nala c o 3 2 n a l a c o 3 2 4 l a c o 3 2 2 h l a h c o 3 2 5 l a h c o 3 2 2 h l a 3 2 h 2 c o 3 a q 6 l a h c o 3 2 2 o h l a c o 3 2 2 h 2 o 7 l a c o 3 2 3 o h l a o h 3 2 c o 3 2 thus based on both the phosphate species distribution and the surface chemical species of mlc 21 versus ph the phosphate uptake by mlc 21 varied with ph at ph of 2 3 h3po4 is still present in considerable amount 10 50 which has a direct impact on the lower phosphate uptake dong et al 2017 xie et al 2014 and the high lanthanum leaching table s6 of mlc is also responsible for the dramatic drop of phosphate uptake in the ph range of 3 4 h2po4 is the major species thereby resulting in an increased phosphate adsorption capacity with the increase of ph from 4 0 to 8 6 two species of divalent hpo4 2 and monovalent h2po4 are coexistent the ligand exchanges between la hco3 2 and hpo4 2 h2po4 as well as electrostatic attraction between them promote the phosphate adsorption simultaneously although the zeta potential of mcl 21 decreased as ph increased the predominated ligand exchanges could counteract the decreased electrostatic attraction and the p adsorption capacity of mcl 21 maintains stable and high as ph further increased over 8 6 the surface of mlc became negatively charged which was not favorable for electrostatic attraction at this point hpo4 2 is the dominant species with the increasing fraction of po4 3 the p adsorption capacity of mcl 21 still maintains stable as ph increased up to about 9 afterward when ph further increased to 11 the p adsorption capacity of mcl 21 shows a slow decrease it can be seen that the stronger electrostatic repulsion and oh competitive adsorption could contribute to this decrease however the la co3 2 species could still adsorb po4 3 through ligand exchange which was stronger than that between la oh 3 and po4 3 by comparing the solubility product of la oh 3 pka 22 8 la2 co3 3 pka 29 9 and lapo4 pka 26 16 3 4 2 atr ir and raman spectra atr ir and raman spectra of mlc before and after phosphate adsorption are exhibited in fig 11 as shown in the atr ir spectra fig 11a peaks at 1420 and 860 cm 1 are assigned to ν3 and ν2 band vibrations of co3 2 in nala co3 2 zhang et al 2015 2014 the bands at 613 and 560 cm 1 are attributed to feo vibrations these results were coincident with the characterization results of mlc after phosphate adsorption the new peaks at 1045 and 540 cm 1 corresponding to the ν3 and ν4 band vibrations of hpo4 2 or h2po4 hint the presence of the adsorbed phosphate kwaśniak kominek et al 2015 wu et al 2017 fig 11b shows the raman spectra for mlc in which the bands at 344 393 440 and 1074 cm 1 are related to nala co3 2 cornaglia et al 2004 rangel et al 2017 peaks at 260 518 and 640 cm 1 are assigned to eg t2g and a1g modes of fe3o4 carmona carmona et al 2017 zhang and kong 2011 after phosphate adsorption the weak spectra at 974 and 483 cm 1 were observed as ν1 and ν2 of lapo4 pelczarska et al 2015 pragatheeswaran et al 2015 which is in agreement with previous studies dong et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 in addition xrd pattern of mlc before and after phosphate adsorption showed in fig s6 also confirmed lapo4 was formed during phosphate uptake by mlc this result was in accordance with the phosphate adsorption mechanism by most other lanthanum based adsorbents chen et al 2018 dong et al 2017 he et al 2015 liao et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 however recent studies on extended x ray fine structure exafs spectra analysis of the phosphate loaded la oh 3 do not support the formation of lapo4 fang et al 2017 xu et al 2017 thus relevant mechanisms still need to be further studied 3 4 3 xps spectra xps spectra of mlc before and after phosphate adsorption were also evaluated the appearance of the p 2p peak in the xps wide scan spectrum shown in fig 12a and fig s7 indicates that phosphate has been successfully adsorbed high resolution spectra of o 1s la 3d and fe 2p are presented in fig 12 b d and the o 1s fitted peak parameters are listed in table s9 after phosphate adsorption new oxygen fitting peak and the increase of the binding energy of iron and lanthanum were observed which could be attributed to the formation of inner sphere complexation laop and feop bonding fig 12c and d fang et al 2018a 2015 wu et al 2017 4 conclusion the magnetic mlc composites were fabricated by a modified solvothermal method for phosphate removal from wastewater nala co3 2 acts as active sites for the removal of phosphate while fe3o4 allows for the magnetic separation mlc composites exhibit a high magnetic separation efficiency in amss batch adsorption results showed that the maximum phosphate adsorption capacity of mlc was 77 85 mg p g in a 10 mg p l solution the phosphate adsorption equilibrium was reached within 8 h with the adsorbent dosage of 0 5 g l mlc 21 composites exhibited high phosphate removal performance over a wide ph range of 4 11 excellent selectivity for phosphate in the presence of common competing ions good reusability in addition real wastewater and eutrophic lake water treatment by using magnetic separation integrated system implied that mlc 21 composites had practical value for application the atr ir raman xrd and xps spectra showed that phosphate sorption can be attributed to electrostatic attraction and the inner sphere complexation between la hco3 2 la co3 2 and p via ligand exchange acknowledgments this work was supported by national key research and development program of china 2016yfa0203204
