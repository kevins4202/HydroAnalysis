1605,fresh groundwater in an island aquifer is an extremely important resource that is highly vulnerable to variations in natural weather cycles and climate change effects on small islands precipitation creates subsurface freshwater lenses that float on top of coalesced saltwater that has intruded from the surrounding seawater the volume and shape of these highly vulnerable freshwater lenses depend on the size and shape of the island underlying geology and the rate and duration of groundwater recharge this study focuses on the transient changes in freshwater storage volume within these lenses we completed a sand tank experiment to visualize an evolving freshwater lens that undergoes a dry and wet recharge cycle resulting in forming a shrinking and an expanding lens the physical experiments provided a dataset to develop a robust numerical model that can rigorously simulate different types of evolving transient freshwater lenses our laboratory data along with past literature information have indicated that the shrinking of a freshwater lens occurred at a slower rate relative to an expanding freshwater lens this aspect of a rather rapid freshwater volume recovery was investigated further using the numerical model by imposing cyclic recharge patterns to study the impacts of shortened recharge periods on freshwater storage in island aquifers the results show that a sustainable dynamic equilibrium condition can be achieved within a few cycles of periodic recharge unsustainable conditions were only encountered at extremely short recharge periods the model was then extended to simulate a freshwater lens in dauphin island alabama to assess changes in freshwater storage under realistic wet and dry recharge cycles the experimental data together with the modeling results presented in this study provide a better understanding of transient changes in freshwater storage patterns in small islands keywords saltwater intrusion strip islands transient freshwater lens transient saltwater wedge island aquifers recharge cycles 1 introduction according to estimates by the united nations the small island developing states sids have a combined population of about 65 million un ohrlls 2015 most of these islands have a limited amount of surface storage potential to capture freshwater and therefore groundwater aquifers are critical water resources in these islands on several of these islands streams and lakes are simply non existent hence the local groundwater has to be optimally used to support the needs of local communities agriculture and also to support the local tourism industry that could be a major source of income for these tropical islands custodio and bruggeman 1987 díaz arenas and huertas 1986 freshwater recharge entering into a typical strip island aquifer will float over the intruded dense saltwater forming a lens see fig 1 the extent of this freshwater lens will depend on the geology recharge and the shape and size of the island changes in precipitation patterns due to climate change effects and sea level rise can adversely impact the size and shape of the freshwater lens which in many cases could be the only source of potable water in small islands falkland and custodio 1991 therefore understanding the transient behavior of these freshwater lenses is vital for optimally managing the limited amount of fresh groundwater available in these islands since the mid 1960s due to industrialization and rapid population growth freshwater in small islands has been depleted and hence small island aquifers have become the focus of several theoretical and field investigations researchers have presented analytical and semi analytical solutions for predicting the location of saltwater freshwater interface in coastal aquifers including islands henry 1960 henry 1964 fetter 1972 ketabchi et al 2014 numerical models have also been used by researchers to study freshwater lens beneath oceanic strip islands for example anderson 1976 used a predictor corrector technique to develop a finite difference model for predicting unsteady flow in a freshwater lens beneath an oceanic strip island underwood et al 1992 analyzed a two layer atoll island and concluded that mixing of freshwater and saltwater occurs primarily as a result of oscillating vertical flow due to tidal fluctuations other studies have focused on field observations on islands wheatcraft and buddemeier 1981 collected field data in enjebi island located within enewark atoll ayers and vacher 1986 presented a detailed hydrogeological study of a small island called deke on pingelap atoll located within the eastern caroline islands presley 2005 studied the effects of the 1998 drought on majuro atoll marshall islands and duncan 2011 provided a vulnerability assessment of fourteen developing pacific island countries un ohrlls 2015 investigated the vulnerability of various freshwater resources in small islands particularly to changes in precipitation patterns and prolonged drought conditions and pointed out the importance of rainwater harvesting in developing sustainable water resources in island aquifers researchers have also developed several physical and mathematical models to study the freshwater flow processes near a saltwater wedge in coastal aquifers e g chang and clement 2013 chang et al 2011 goswami and clement 2007 gulley et al 2016 michael et al 2005 robinson et al 2007 however almost all of these efforts involve a uniform freshwater flow system with a single saltwater wedge intruding from the coastal boundary in recent years studies have investigated freshwater lenses bounded by double wedges in idealized sand tank models stoeckl and houben 2012 stoeckl et al 2016 stoeckl et al 2016 provided a benchmark analysis employing the simpson and clement 2003 coupled uncoupled approach to establish that double wedge problems are highly worthy benchmark problems for testing density coupled flow codes dose et al 2014 investigated the steady state interface geometry of freshwater lenses in layered aquifers stoeckl et al 2015 investigated groundwater age stratification and travel times in a non homogeneous island aquifer houben et al 2018 demonstrated using physical and numerical experiments the influence of discrete and spatially distributed heterogeneity on forming unique distribution of saltwater interface climate change effects can dramatically change the rainfall patterns worldwide increasing the annual rainfall variability of many islands duncan 2011 un ohrlls 2015 furthermore large scale ocean atmospheric cyclical events such as el niño and la niña could force periodic dry and wet hydrological cycles extreme events such as extended droughts resulting from the coupling of these ocean atmosphere cycles with climate change could potentially lead to extremely low recharge and even zero recharge during lengthy drought periods duncan 2011 falkland 1992 un ohrlls 2015 for example during the 1982 83 el niño event rainfall in many parts of western pacific was only 10 30 of the long term average falkland 1992 these extreme drought events could induce severe saltwater intrusion in island aquifers and this can adversely impact the highly vulnerable population living in these islands the consequences of such extreme dry and wet cycles are difficult to predict for example it is currently unclear whether rainfall events resulting from wet cycles would be able to fully reverse the adverse impacts of dry cycles and reestablish a productive freshwater lens in published literature there have been a few studies that examine the temporal changes in the saltwater interface after a dry and wet recharge cycle chang and clement 2013 studied the movement of saltwater wedge and identified the asymmetry in intruding and receding saltwater wedges after a dry and wet cycle stoeckl and houben 2012 and stoeckl et al 2016 examined the asymmetry between the time needed for the change in the height of saltwater interface during the development and depletion of the freshwater lens using both physical and numerical models lu and werner 2013 used a numerical model to quantify the timescale associated with the saltwater wedge toe response in a confined aquifer system due to water level variations at the boundary and inland and developed empirical relations relating the changes in boundary head with toe locations abdoulhalik and ahmed 2018 studied the transient motion of toe location of a single saltwater wedge using a physical tank model and simulated the data using a numerical model the study examined the temporal response of saltwater interface using different hydraulic conductivity materials and also using different boundary conditions all aforementioned studies have investigated the temporal changes in saltwater wedge intrusion and retreating processes however none of these studies have quantified the changes in freshwater volume within islands or explored the temporal changes in freshwater storage patterns due to variations in recharge cycles the objective of this study is to perform both qualitative and quantitative analyses of the temporal changes in the two dimensional patterns of freshwater lens in strip islands which are impacted by wet and dry recharge cycles both experimental and numerical modeling studies were completed to explore the temporal asymmetry between the freshwater lens depletion and lens formation under dry no recharge and wet recharge conditions additionally in this study we investigated the impacts of cyclical weather patterns with extended drought periods on the freshwater availability in island aquifers in order to extend the findings of the small scale tank studies to field scale and to assess the timescale of transient processes under real world precipitation and aquifer properties a field scale numerical model was developed the model was used to conduct a numerical investigation for dauphin island alabama 2 methods 2 1 laboratory methods fig 2 shows the experimental sand tank model used in this study the physical model was used to simulate the cross section of a strip island with ocean boundary at both sides freshwater input to the system was delivered through areal recharge simulating the direct rainfall induced recharge over the entire island aquifer the dimension of the plexi glass tank is 50 cm 28 cm 2 5 cm the overall thickness of the experimental aquifer is much smaller than its length and width hence the tank can be conceptualized as a two dimensional aquifer system as shown in the figure the flow tank has three distinct sections a right hand seaside chamber a central porous media chamber and a left hand seaside chamber the central section was packed with uniform glass beads with average diameter of 1 1 mm hydraulic conductivity of the porous media was measured by creating a head gradient across the tank and measuring flow rate and head differences between the ends of the tank at various flow rates the porous medium was packed under water by submerging the entire tank within a large water container glass beads were added layer by layer and each layer was compacted manually before adding the next layer packing the tank under submerged conditions helped prevent air bubbles getting trapped within the system constant head boundary conditions were maintained at both left and right seaside boundaries by continuously pumping dense water simulating seawater into the two chambers the head in these chambers were maintained at a fixed level and the excess volume of seawater was allowed to overflow through multiple 1 mm diameter holes drilled in the side plates of the tank the experimental method used was identical to the approach discussed in goswami and clement 2007 during our experiments the measured values of constant head in the two chambers were 25 2 cm and 25 5 cm for the dry no recharge and wet recharge cycles respectively the denser water representing seawater was colored red using a food grade dye our previous investigations have shown that the dye used did not adsorb to the glass porous medium used in this study chang and clement 2013 goswami and clement 2007 the saltwater was prepared using non iodized salt and the food dye was added at a ratio of about 50 ml per 20 l of saltwater the density of the saltwater was measured using the astm 11h hydrometer and the measured density of the colored saltwater was 1 016 0 001 g ml the measured density of freshwater was 0 999 0 001 to simulate areal recharge a multi head peristaltic pump masterflex tygon e 3603 pump was used to deliver flow at 6 injection points before using the pump the pumping rate of individual heads were measured and at different speeds to ensure uniform pumping the total amount of recharge distributed from the six recharge points was 252 ml min the total area over which the recharge was applied was 50 cm 2 5 cm making the recharge rate equal to 2 016 cm min the recharge tubes were placed on the top of a porous media chamber at distances of 4 2 cm 12 5 cm 20 8 cm 29 1 cm 37 4 cm and 45 7 cm away from the left boundary a porous cotton cloth was placed at the top of the porous media chamber to uniformly distribute the recharged water over the entire area of the aquifer the experiments were recorded using a digital camera and the pictures were later post processed to map wedge locations and to calculate freshwater lens volumes the first set of experiments were conducted under uniform areal recharge conditions 2 016 cm min to simulate an initial steady state wedge later two different dry and wet stress periods were applied to the sand tank system to induce transient conditions the dry stress period started at 0 min and lasted for 45 min during this period the areal recharge was turned off to allow the red colored denser saltwater to intrude into the sand tank from both sides allowing us to record the shrinking phase of the freshwater lens under dry conditions after 45 min the wet stress period was started by turning on the areal recharge recharge flow was maintained at 2 016 cm min and system was allowed to evolve for another 45 min allowing us to record the redevelopment phase of the freshwater lens under wet recharge conditions 2 2 modeling methods seawat langevin et al 2008 a three dimensional variable density groundwater flow and transport simulation code was used to develop a numerical model for this study to simulate the two dimensional flow tank experiment the numerical model was discretized into 50 layers 1 row and 102 columns to represent the tank with dimensions 25 cm in height and 50 cm in width the two model columns at both ends were used for specifying the lateral boundary conditions layers and columns were discretized with 0 5 cm grid spacing with the exception of model layer 1 the top layer that represents the water table layer the top layer was assigned a thickness of 2 5 cm to accommodate the changes in phreatic surface levels and to simulate unconfined flow conditions an average uniform hydraulic conductivity value of 1050 m day which was measured in the laboratory was assigned to the entire model domain the confined storage coefficient was assumed to be negligible and was set to a very low value of 10 7 porosity value was set to be equal to 0 39 which was the average measured value the left and right boundaries of the model were imposed as prescribed head and prescribed concentration boundaries a uniform recharge boundary was imposed at the top and the bottom face of the model was simulated as a no flow boundary the densities of freshwater and saltwater were set to 999 and 1016 kg m3 respectively assuming a concentration of 35 kg m3 for the red colored denser seawater which is close to the actual seawater concentration the slope of the linear equation of state that relates of density and concentration ρ c was estimated to be 0 4857 note in seawat any arbitrary concentration value can be assumed provided an appropriate density slope value is calculated and used to simulate consistent scaled concentration results temporal discretization included three stress periods 1 the initial period to simulate the initial steady state conditions with constant recharge 2 a transient forty five minutes period without recharge zero recharge to simulate dry conditions and 3 a transient period with uniform recharge to simulate wet conditions for the three stress periods prescribed head values at the lateral boundaries were set at 25 5 cm 25 2 cm and 25 5 cm respectively and recharge was set at 2 016 cm min for the first and third stress period and zero for the second stress period for numerical stability flow and transport were tightly coupled with equal flow and transport time step sizes set at 0 54 s seawat uses a generalized conjugate gradient solver to solve the linear system of equations for dispersion sources and sinks the total variation diminishing tvd scheme was used as the advection solution scheme which calculates the time step size honoring the courant number cr constraint of cr 1 the numerical model was later extended to simulate the impacts of cyclical wet dry conditions on the experimental system in addition we also present a real world modeling study that simulated a freshwater lens in dauphin island alabama to assess realistic timescales of freshwater volume change the model parameters used in this study are discussed in detail in the case study section 3 results and discussion 3 1 steady state experimental conditions fig 3a shows the symmetric salt wedges obtained under steady state conditions to obtain these steady state profiles the aquifer was originally filled with freshwater and then forced with saltwater boundary conditions this was accomplished by replacing the freshwater in the left and right reservoirs with seawater by pumping excess amount of saltwater the saltwater head at the two boundaries were maintained at a constant level and the recharge from the top remained zero these conditions allowed red colored saltwater to rapidly intrude from both sides into this recharge free freshwater aquifer after about 10 min of intrusion the recharge pumps were turned on to maintain a constant flow rate of 2 016 cm min which was uniformly distributed over the top of the aquifer the recharged system was allowed to evolve for about an hour to reach the steady state condition shown in fig 3a these wedge profiles were set as the base case initial condition in this experimental study at this steady state condition the freshwater recharge supplied from the top fully balanced the saltwater forced from the boundaries forming two symmetric wedges fig 3b shows the steady state conditions simulated using the seawat model the model was developed using the measured experimental parameters and it was run for a long time starting with a freshwater state as the initial condition fig 3b shows the model simulated steady state profile in the model the top layer was simulated as an unconfined layer and all other internal lower layers were assumed as confined layers the model was run in a predictive mode using low longitudinal and transverse dispersivity values of 0 01 and 0 001 cm respectively these values are similar to the values used in other experimental studies to simulate similar type of sharp saltwater wedges abarca and clement 2009 chang and clement 2012 goswami and clement 2007 preliminary sensitivity simulations completed using higher dispersivity values indicated that use of larger dispersivity values induced more dispersion than what was observed in the system larger dispersivitiy values in the simulations resulted in a more vertical saltwater wedge during saltwater intrusion comparison of fig 3a and fig 3b results indicate excellent agreement between the experimental data and numerical results 3 2 transient experimental conditions the steady state system discussed above was used as the initial condition to simulate two distinct transient flow conditions involving dry and wet recharge cycles in order to simulate transient conditions we first instantaneously shut the recharge pump to simulate a dry cycle the no recharge condition was allowed to evolve for 45 mins to simulate a dry period transient salt wedge profiles observed after 5 10 15 25 35 and 45 min are shown in the left panel of fig 4 as shown in fig 4a in the initial steady system the recharge flow minimizes saltwater intrusion effects and the wedges intruded only to about 10 4 cm from both saltwater boundaries fig 4b shows that once the recharge was stopped the wedges started to rapidly intrude into the system from both sides and the toe of the wedge reached about 18 75 cm from the lateral boundary after 5 min of transport after about 11 to 12 min of transport the two wedges started to coalesce close to the center of the tank and fig 4c shows the fully merged wedge observed after 15 min it is interesting to note that after coalescing the wedges formed a v shaped profile with the lowest point located at about 6 25 cm from the bottom of the tank with time the wedge developed a u shaped profile and the low point started to lift and was located at about 14 18 5 and 20 3 cm from the bottom of the tank at 25 35 and 45 min respectively see fig 4d e and f note the true steady state pattern for this no recharge condition will be a flat profile and our preliminary experiments showed that it will take about 2 h to approach this flat steady state condition where the saltwater will fully intrude and replace the entire freshwater however in this experiment we only maintained the zero recharge condition for 45 mins to simulate the wet cycle we turned on the recharge pump and supplied a uniform recharge at a rate of 2 016 cm min which was identical to the recharge used to simulate the base case steady state wedge the recharged water infiltrated into the aquifer and reestablished the freshwater lens by forcing the saltwater wedge to recede back toward the left and right seaside boundaries the figures presented in the right panel of fig 4 show the transient movement of the receding wedge interestingly the intruding and receding wedges have very different patterns one of the major differences was that the intruding wedge initially formed a v shaped profile that later evolved into a u shaped profile whereas the receding wedge always had an elongated u shaped profile in the past research studies have primarily focused on the toe location of the saltwater wedge however in our dry and wet cycle comparison analysis we integrated the area above the wedge to quantify the total amount of freshwater storage in the system to define the state of the system the volume of water stored at any given time was then used to compare the differences in the overall shapes of intruding and receding saltwater wedges fig 4h shows the location of the receding wedge after receiving 5 min of recharge the experimental data show that the system formed an elongated u shaped wedge and the lower most point of this wedge was located at about 12 3 cm from the bottom of the aquifer fig 4i j and k show the wedge profiles observed after 15 25 and 35 min of recharge or 60 70 and 80 total minutes and the low points of the wedges were located about 4 2 1 8 and 0 7 cm from the bottom of the tank for the three times respectively fig 4l shows that after 45 mins of recharge or total experimental time of 90 min the wedges were totally disconnected and the toes of the two disconnected wedges were located approximately 13 5 cm from the boundary note the true steady state location is about 10 4 cm the seawat code was used to simulate this dataset and the model simulated profiles of the intruding and receding wedges are also shown in fig 4 these figures show that the model was able to closely reproduce the experimental observations these results indicate that this stable wedge problem has three states involving distinctly different types of salt wedge patterns including the traditional exponentially decaying wedge a v shaped intruding wedge and a u shaped receding wedge these data provide a unique set of transient wedge profiles which can be useful for benchmarking density coupled flow models that involve stable interfaces i e dense water present at the bottom to quantify the changes in freshwater storage patterns the amount of freshwater in the tank experiments was computed by post processing the digital images to estimate the area above the wedge the simulated freshwater fractions were delineated using a threshold of a normalized concentration of 0 25 the changes in the amount of freshwater stored within the system estimated for different times are summarized in fig 5 a good agreement is seen in simulated and observed changes in freshwater fractions fig 5 also shows the sensitivity of freshwater fraction changes to recharge rate the freshwater recovery is most sensitive to the recharge rate and it is seen that the rate of recovery increases with the increase in the recharge intensity the asymmetry observed between depletion and recovery cycles is enhanced with a higher recharge rate for the base simulation the figure shows that during both dry and wet cycles the greatest change in the freshwater volume occurred during the inception of the transient period this can also be seen in fig 4 as time progressed the rate of change of net freshwater storage decreased considerably fig 6 shows the absolute rate of change of freshwater storage observed during the dry and wet stress periods for visual comparison both the rate of decrease and increase in freshwater volume is plotted as the absolute value on the positive y axis these rates were calculated as the change in the freshwater fraction over time interval divided by the length of time interval over which the change occurred when we compared these rates of storage change data for both dry and wet cycles during the first 10 min the rate of change is high for the expanding freshwater lens which was accumulating water under receding saltwater wedge conditions during the wet period our estimations show that during the dry period the freshwater fraction decreased by 33 of the total storage within 10 min on the other hand during the wet period the storage increased to about 53 within 10 min at the beginning of the wet period the recovery rate was almost double as compared to the depletion rate at the onset of the dry period however after the initial surge in freshwater storage the rate of change slowed down as the freshwater forced the intruded saltwater to split into two separate wedges chang and clement 2012 discuss potential reasons for the observed asymmetry between intruding and receding wedges based on their findings one can postulate that the asymmetry observed in the time scales of shrinking and expanding freshwater lens can be attributed to the velocity variations occurring within the saltwater wedge during intruding and receding conditions during intrusion or shrinking freshwater lens conditions saltwater flow from the lateral boundary is moving inward within the saltwater wedge which will be opposite to the outward freshwater flow occurring within the lens the freshwater flow will eventually exit through the lateral boundary within a narrow area close to the top of the tank on the contrary during recession or expanding freshwater lens conditions both freshwater and saltwater flows will align to move toward the lateral boundary and the entire lateral boundary area will be available for outflow these well aligned processes facilitate the saltwater recession to occur at a much higher rate as compared to intrusion these results imply that the freshwater volume stored within a strip island will recover and accumulate water rather rapidly during the initial phase of a rainfall event when compared to the freshwater volume lost during the initial phase of a drought event overall these results show a unique emerging pattern where natural systems can potentially manage water storage rather efficiently the findings observed in the laboratory scale experiments were extended to a field scale investigation using a numerical model representing a realistic system in dauphin island alabama the field scale investigation uses real world spatial domain precipitation data and aquifer parameters and the model was used to observe expected time scale differences in asymmetric transient processes and these results are discussed in section 3 4 3 3 understanding freshwater sustainability under variable recharge conditions the observations made in the experimental study where the freshwater lens recovery process was found to be relatively faster than depletion led us to conduct further numerical simulations for the experimental system for cyclic wet dry conditions cyclic wet dry conditions were simulated using multiple stress periods steady state conditions were simulated under constant recharge conditions as the first stress period dry conditions were invoked by implementing zero recharge during even numbered stress periods and recharge was implemented in subsequent odd numbered stress periods to represent wet conditions one cycle of wet dry conditions therefore comprised of two consecutive stress periods one without recharge followed by one with recharge six such wet dry cycles were simulated the dimensions of the numerical model used for these simulations were the same as the sand tank model the duration representing dry conditions in all simulations was set to a constant time of 25 min however the duration of wet periods was allowed to vary in different simulations note that the recharge rate was the same in all simulations and only the duration was varied for the first simulation the recharge period was set to ten minutes which resulted in a wet dry cycle which was 35 min long comprising of a 25 min dry period followed by 10 min of wet recharge period six such cycles were employed in all these simulation experiments for the second simulation the duration of wet period was reduced to 5 min and a dry period was set to 25 min therefore the duration of each cycle in the second simulation was 30 min in subsequent simulations the recharge period was reduced to 2 min 1 min and 0 1 min the last simulation with a wet period duration of 0 1 min was considered as an extreme case of recharge period fig 7 shows the time series plots for all five cyclical wet dry scenarios the results show that the freshwater volumes decrease from one simulation to the other as the duration of wet period was decreased within every simulation experiment which consisted for six cycles a dynamic equilibrium was achieved after about three wet dry cycles i e the freshwater volume roughly changed by the same amount after three cycles the only exception to that is the extreme case of a recharge duration of one tenth of a minute in this case the freshwater volume continued to decrease after every cycle fig 8 shows the cyclic change in the maximum freshwater achieved at the end of each wet dry cycle the shape of the curve for each simulation stabilizes within a few wet dry cycles indicating that a dynamic equilibrium is achieved but with different freshwater volumes the higher the duration of recharge the higher is the freshwater volume achieved at the dynamic equilibrium condition for example with a 25 min dry and a 10 min wet cycle the maximum freshwater volume fraction under a dynamic equilibrium condition is found to be 0 71 note the freshwater volume fraction indicates the fraction of system that is occupied by freshwater for a simulation with recharge period as low as 1 min and with a dry period of 25 min the maximum freshwater fraction is 0 24 at the dynamic equilibrium condition as seen in figs 7 and 8 a sustained freshwater volume level was attained for simulations in which recharge occurred as briefly as for 1 min after a 25 min dry period only when the recharge duration was shortened to a tenth of a minute with a 25 min dry period the freshwater lens became unsustainable these results show that the freshwater recharge accumulated even during short recharge cycles can help sustain freshwater storage during extended dry periods 3 4 case study for dauphin island alabama a field scale study was completed to assess the real world implication of the observations made in this experimental study dauphin island is located at the southwest end of alabama in the us was selected for this example the western end of the island which has an elongated strip of land of approximately 20 km long with an average width of approximately 400 m was used as the model domain this island region is ideally suited for simulating conditions on an infinite strip island a cross sectional model of the strip of land was created to assess changes in freshwater lens volumes parameterization of the field model was based on a modeling study of dauphin island presented by chang et al 2016 the 400 m width of the strip was discretized into 160 model cells using a 2 5 m horizontal discretization the depth of the model was selected as 21 m the top hydrogeologic unit being 13 m thick representing holocene sand underlain by a 7 m thick clay unit chang et al 2016 the model grid was discretized vertically into 42 layers with a uniform vertical spacing of 0 5 m real world field conditions and rainfall data were used to simulate the freshwater lens in dauphin island alabama to illustrate the differences in the rate of decrease and the rate of increase in freshwater volumes precipitation data was obtained for mobile regional airport alabama available from noaa s national climatic data center ncdc monthly calculated precipitation rates used for generating transient groundwater recharge for the model is shown in fig 9 net groundwater recharge was set at 5 of the precipitation amount the figure shows a large monthly variation in precipitation values on a larger timescale there was an extended drought period between 2010 and the first half of 2011 which occurred in between two relatively wet years of 2009 and 2012 see inset plot in fig 9 other site parameters were taken from the calibrated model parameters presented in a previously published study chang et al 2016 and the data are summarized in table 1 the objective of this field scale simulation was to test whether the laboratory scale observations made were applicable for field scale conditions specifically to test whether the freshwater recharge rapidly accumulated during the short recharge cycles will be able to sustain freshwater storage during extended dry periods a transient model was simulated for the period of 2007 2013 to isolate the impacts of recharge on the freshwater volumes only recharge was varied on a monthly basis during the transient period all other boundary conditions were held constant initial conditions were set as steady state conditions with average 2007 2013 recharge fig 10 shows the monthly variation in freshwater volume fraction predicted by the model the relative changes in freshwater volume largely follow the variation in recharge applied to the model freshwater volume increases with increased recharge and vice versa the results show that increase in recharge causes the freshwater to increase within the same month decrease in recharge however shows a delayed response in freshwater lens depletion the recession limb of the freshwater lens took several months to manifest on the decrease in freshwater volumes during dry cycles this pattern can be observed in almost all the events in which recharge drops but it is most prominent during the extended dry cycle beginning in 2010 and lasting through the middle of 2011 during this period the decrease in freshwater volume is not as drastic as the decrease in recharge conditions intermittent increase in recharge even by a small amount of rain in 2010 helped slow down the decrease in freshwater lens volume through the entire year on the other hand a large increase in recharge during 2009 2011 and 2012 is reflected by an almost instantaneous increase in freshwater volume while the absolute change in freshwater volume may not be significant it is interesting to note that like the laboratory scale results these field scale simulations also show a delayed pattern of freshwater lens depletion relative to the freshwater lens formation the real world example simulated here qualitatively demonstrates the delayed response of freshwater volume depletion over several months due to the decrease in recharge and an almost instantaneous recovery of freshwater volume resulting from increased recharge these observations highlight the importance of managing groundwater replenishment from even short rainfall events after or during an extended dry period efforts to capture recharge from these short rainfall events are consequential to better manage freshwater resources in island aquifers 4 conclusions a laboratory experiment was conducted to study the patterns of a shrinking and expanding freshwater lens in an infinite strip island the laboratory data were simulated using a numerical model developed using seawat the modeled results closely matched the experimental data the data show asymmetry in the time scales of the shrinking and expanding freshwater lens it was also observed that the initial period of stress causes the highest change in freshwater volume storage both loss and gain and the rate of change of freshwater storage rapidly decreases with the passage of time interestingly the freshwater lens expansion or accumulation of freshwater during the early period of the wet cycle occurred at a greater rate when compared to the freshwater lens shrinkage or loss of freshwater rate during the dry cycle these results show that natural systems could support an efficient non linear feedback mechanism that has an emerging property where the groundwater system loses water slowly during a dry cycle but it can recover fast by gaining water rather rapidly during a wet cycle this non linear feedback mechanism and its implication on faster freshwater recovery greatly emphasizes the importance of implementing careful recharge management strategies to maximize freshwater storage in small island aquifers our experimental data as well as model simulation results show that even short duration rainfall events can greatly enhance the freshwater availability in small islands 5 acknowledgements this work was in

1605,fresh groundwater in an island aquifer is an extremely important resource that is highly vulnerable to variations in natural weather cycles and climate change effects on small islands precipitation creates subsurface freshwater lenses that float on top of coalesced saltwater that has intruded from the surrounding seawater the volume and shape of these highly vulnerable freshwater lenses depend on the size and shape of the island underlying geology and the rate and duration of groundwater recharge this study focuses on the transient changes in freshwater storage volume within these lenses we completed a sand tank experiment to visualize an evolving freshwater lens that undergoes a dry and wet recharge cycle resulting in forming a shrinking and an expanding lens the physical experiments provided a dataset to develop a robust numerical model that can rigorously simulate different types of evolving transient freshwater lenses our laboratory data along with past literature information have indicated that the shrinking of a freshwater lens occurred at a slower rate relative to an expanding freshwater lens this aspect of a rather rapid freshwater volume recovery was investigated further using the numerical model by imposing cyclic recharge patterns to study the impacts of shortened recharge periods on freshwater storage in island aquifers the results show that a sustainable dynamic equilibrium condition can be achieved within a few cycles of periodic recharge unsustainable conditions were only encountered at extremely short recharge periods the model was then extended to simulate a freshwater lens in dauphin island alabama to assess changes in freshwater storage under realistic wet and dry recharge cycles the experimental data together with the modeling results presented in this study provide a better understanding of transient changes in freshwater storage patterns in small islands keywords saltwater intrusion strip islands transient freshwater lens transient saltwater wedge island aquifers recharge cycles 1 introduction according to estimates by the united nations the small island developing states sids have a combined population of about 65 million un ohrlls 2015 most of these islands have a limited amount of surface storage potential to capture freshwater and therefore groundwater aquifers are critical water resources in these islands on several of these islands streams and lakes are simply non existent hence the local groundwater has to be optimally used to support the needs of local communities agriculture and also to support the local tourism industry that could be a major source of income for these tropical islands custodio and bruggeman 1987 díaz arenas and huertas 1986 freshwater recharge entering into a typical strip island aquifer will float over the intruded dense saltwater forming a lens see fig 1 the extent of this freshwater lens will depend on the geology recharge and the shape and size of the island changes in precipitation patterns due to climate change effects and sea level rise can adversely impact the size and shape of the freshwater lens which in many cases could be the only source of potable water in small islands falkland and custodio 1991 therefore understanding the transient behavior of these freshwater lenses is vital for optimally managing the limited amount of fresh groundwater available in these islands since the mid 1960s due to industrialization and rapid population growth freshwater in small islands has been depleted and hence small island aquifers have become the focus of several theoretical and field investigations researchers have presented analytical and semi analytical solutions for predicting the location of saltwater freshwater interface in coastal aquifers including islands henry 1960 henry 1964 fetter 1972 ketabchi et al 2014 numerical models have also been used by researchers to study freshwater lens beneath oceanic strip islands for example anderson 1976 used a predictor corrector technique to develop a finite difference model for predicting unsteady flow in a freshwater lens beneath an oceanic strip island underwood et al 1992 analyzed a two layer atoll island and concluded that mixing of freshwater and saltwater occurs primarily as a result of oscillating vertical flow due to tidal fluctuations other studies have focused on field observations on islands wheatcraft and buddemeier 1981 collected field data in enjebi island located within enewark atoll ayers and vacher 1986 presented a detailed hydrogeological study of a small island called deke on pingelap atoll located within the eastern caroline islands presley 2005 studied the effects of the 1998 drought on majuro atoll marshall islands and duncan 2011 provided a vulnerability assessment of fourteen developing pacific island countries un ohrlls 2015 investigated the vulnerability of various freshwater resources in small islands particularly to changes in precipitation patterns and prolonged drought conditions and pointed out the importance of rainwater harvesting in developing sustainable water resources in island aquifers researchers have also developed several physical and mathematical models to study the freshwater flow processes near a saltwater wedge in coastal aquifers e g chang and clement 2013 chang et al 2011 goswami and clement 2007 gulley et al 2016 michael et al 2005 robinson et al 2007 however almost all of these efforts involve a uniform freshwater flow system with a single saltwater wedge intruding from the coastal boundary in recent years studies have investigated freshwater lenses bounded by double wedges in idealized sand tank models stoeckl and houben 2012 stoeckl et al 2016 stoeckl et al 2016 provided a benchmark analysis employing the simpson and clement 2003 coupled uncoupled approach to establish that double wedge problems are highly worthy benchmark problems for testing density coupled flow codes dose et al 2014 investigated the steady state interface geometry of freshwater lenses in layered aquifers stoeckl et al 2015 investigated groundwater age stratification and travel times in a non homogeneous island aquifer houben et al 2018 demonstrated using physical and numerical experiments the influence of discrete and spatially distributed heterogeneity on forming unique distribution of saltwater interface climate change effects can dramatically change the rainfall patterns worldwide increasing the annual rainfall variability of many islands duncan 2011 un ohrlls 2015 furthermore large scale ocean atmospheric cyclical events such as el niño and la niña could force periodic dry and wet hydrological cycles extreme events such as extended droughts resulting from the coupling of these ocean atmosphere cycles with climate change could potentially lead to extremely low recharge and even zero recharge during lengthy drought periods duncan 2011 falkland 1992 un ohrlls 2015 for example during the 1982 83 el niño event rainfall in many parts of western pacific was only 10 30 of the long term average falkland 1992 these extreme drought events could induce severe saltwater intrusion in island aquifers and this can adversely impact the highly vulnerable population living in these islands the consequences of such extreme dry and wet cycles are difficult to predict for example it is currently unclear whether rainfall events resulting from wet cycles would be able to fully reverse the adverse impacts of dry cycles and reestablish a productive freshwater lens in published literature there have been a few studies that examine the temporal changes in the saltwater interface after a dry and wet recharge cycle chang and clement 2013 studied the movement of saltwater wedge and identified the asymmetry in intruding and receding saltwater wedges after a dry and wet cycle stoeckl and houben 2012 and stoeckl et al 2016 examined the asymmetry between the time needed for the change in the height of saltwater interface during the development and depletion of the freshwater lens using both physical and numerical models lu and werner 2013 used a numerical model to quantify the timescale associated with the saltwater wedge toe response in a confined aquifer system due to water level variations at the boundary and inland and developed empirical relations relating the changes in boundary head with toe locations abdoulhalik and ahmed 2018 studied the transient motion of toe location of a single saltwater wedge using a physical tank model and simulated the data using a numerical model the study examined the temporal response of saltwater interface using different hydraulic conductivity materials and also using different boundary conditions all aforementioned studies have investigated the temporal changes in saltwater wedge intrusion and retreating processes however none of these studies have quantified the changes in freshwater volume within islands or explored the temporal changes in freshwater storage patterns due to variations in recharge cycles the objective of this study is to perform both qualitative and quantitative analyses of the temporal changes in the two dimensional patterns of freshwater lens in strip islands which are impacted by wet and dry recharge cycles both experimental and numerical modeling studies were completed to explore the temporal asymmetry between the freshwater lens depletion and lens formation under dry no recharge and wet recharge conditions additionally in this study we investigated the impacts of cyclical weather patterns with extended drought periods on the freshwater availability in island aquifers in order to extend the findings of the small scale tank studies to field scale and to assess the timescale of transient processes under real world precipitation and aquifer properties a field scale numerical model was developed the model was used to conduct a numerical investigation for dauphin island alabama 2 methods 2 1 laboratory methods fig 2 shows the experimental sand tank model used in this study the physical model was used to simulate the cross section of a strip island with ocean boundary at both sides freshwater input to the system was delivered through areal recharge simulating the direct rainfall induced recharge over the entire island aquifer the dimension of the plexi glass tank is 50 cm 28 cm 2 5 cm the overall thickness of the experimental aquifer is much smaller than its length and width hence the tank can be conceptualized as a two dimensional aquifer system as shown in the figure the flow tank has three distinct sections a right hand seaside chamber a central porous media chamber and a left hand seaside chamber the central section was packed with uniform glass beads with average diameter of 1 1 mm hydraulic conductivity of the porous media was measured by creating a head gradient across the tank and measuring flow rate and head differences between the ends of the tank at various flow rates the porous medium was packed under water by submerging the entire tank within a large water container glass beads were added layer by layer and each layer was compacted manually before adding the next layer packing the tank under submerged conditions helped prevent air bubbles getting trapped within the system constant head boundary conditions were maintained at both left and right seaside boundaries by continuously pumping dense water simulating seawater into the two chambers the head in these chambers were maintained at a fixed level and the excess volume of seawater was allowed to overflow through multiple 1 mm diameter holes drilled in the side plates of the tank the experimental method used was identical to the approach discussed in goswami and clement 2007 during our experiments the measured values of constant head in the two chambers were 25 2 cm and 25 5 cm for the dry no recharge and wet recharge cycles respectively the denser water representing seawater was colored red using a food grade dye our previous investigations have shown that the dye used did not adsorb to the glass porous medium used in this study chang and clement 2013 goswami and clement 2007 the saltwater was prepared using non iodized salt and the food dye was added at a ratio of about 50 ml per 20 l of saltwater the density of the saltwater was measured using the astm 11h hydrometer and the measured density of the colored saltwater was 1 016 0 001 g ml the measured density of freshwater was 0 999 0 001 to simulate areal recharge a multi head peristaltic pump masterflex tygon e 3603 pump was used to deliver flow at 6 injection points before using the pump the pumping rate of individual heads were measured and at different speeds to ensure uniform pumping the total amount of recharge distributed from the six recharge points was 252 ml min the total area over which the recharge was applied was 50 cm 2 5 cm making the recharge rate equal to 2 016 cm min the recharge tubes were placed on the top of a porous media chamber at distances of 4 2 cm 12 5 cm 20 8 cm 29 1 cm 37 4 cm and 45 7 cm away from the left boundary a porous cotton cloth was placed at the top of the porous media chamber to uniformly distribute the recharged water over the entire area of the aquifer the experiments were recorded using a digital camera and the pictures were later post processed to map wedge locations and to calculate freshwater lens volumes the first set of experiments were conducted under uniform areal recharge conditions 2 016 cm min to simulate an initial steady state wedge later two different dry and wet stress periods were applied to the sand tank system to induce transient conditions the dry stress period started at 0 min and lasted for 45 min during this period the areal recharge was turned off to allow the red colored denser saltwater to intrude into the sand tank from both sides allowing us to record the shrinking phase of the freshwater lens under dry conditions after 45 min the wet stress period was started by turning on the areal recharge recharge flow was maintained at 2 016 cm min and system was allowed to evolve for another 45 min allowing us to record the redevelopment phase of the freshwater lens under wet recharge conditions 2 2 modeling methods seawat langevin et al 2008 a three dimensional variable density groundwater flow and transport simulation code was used to develop a numerical model for this study to simulate the two dimensional flow tank experiment the numerical model was discretized into 50 layers 1 row and 102 columns to represent the tank with dimensions 25 cm in height and 50 cm in width the two model columns at both ends were used for specifying the lateral boundary conditions layers and columns were discretized with 0 5 cm grid spacing with the exception of model layer 1 the top layer that represents the water table layer the top layer was assigned a thickness of 2 5 cm to accommodate the changes in phreatic surface levels and to simulate unconfined flow conditions an average uniform hydraulic conductivity value of 1050 m day which was measured in the laboratory was assigned to the entire model domain the confined storage coefficient was assumed to be negligible and was set to a very low value of 10 7 porosity value was set to be equal to 0 39 which was the average measured value the left and right boundaries of the model were imposed as prescribed head and prescribed concentration boundaries a uniform recharge boundary was imposed at the top and the bottom face of the model was simulated as a no flow boundary the densities of freshwater and saltwater were set to 999 and 1016 kg m3 respectively assuming a concentration of 35 kg m3 for the red colored denser seawater which is close to the actual seawater concentration the slope of the linear equation of state that relates of density and concentration ρ c was estimated to be 0 4857 note in seawat any arbitrary concentration value can be assumed provided an appropriate density slope value is calculated and used to simulate consistent scaled concentration results temporal discretization included three stress periods 1 the initial period to simulate the initial steady state conditions with constant recharge 2 a transient forty five minutes period without recharge zero recharge to simulate dry conditions and 3 a transient period with uniform recharge to simulate wet conditions for the three stress periods prescribed head values at the lateral boundaries were set at 25 5 cm 25 2 cm and 25 5 cm respectively and recharge was set at 2 016 cm min for the first and third stress period and zero for the second stress period for numerical stability flow and transport were tightly coupled with equal flow and transport time step sizes set at 0 54 s seawat uses a generalized conjugate gradient solver to solve the linear system of equations for dispersion sources and sinks the total variation diminishing tvd scheme was used as the advection solution scheme which calculates the time step size honoring the courant number cr constraint of cr 1 the numerical model was later extended to simulate the impacts of cyclical wet dry conditions on the experimental system in addition we also present a real world modeling study that simulated a freshwater lens in dauphin island alabama to assess realistic timescales of freshwater volume change the model parameters used in this study are discussed in detail in the case study section 3 results and discussion 3 1 steady state experimental conditions fig 3a shows the symmetric salt wedges obtained under steady state conditions to obtain these steady state profiles the aquifer was originally filled with freshwater and then forced with saltwater boundary conditions this was accomplished by replacing the freshwater in the left and right reservoirs with seawater by pumping excess amount of saltwater the saltwater head at the two boundaries were maintained at a constant level and the recharge from the top remained zero these conditions allowed red colored saltwater to rapidly intrude from both sides into this recharge free freshwater aquifer after about 10 min of intrusion the recharge pumps were turned on to maintain a constant flow rate of 2 016 cm min which was uniformly distributed over the top of the aquifer the recharged system was allowed to evolve for about an hour to reach the steady state condition shown in fig 3a these wedge profiles were set as the base case initial condition in this experimental study at this steady state condition the freshwater recharge supplied from the top fully balanced the saltwater forced from the boundaries forming two symmetric wedges fig 3b shows the steady state conditions simulated using the seawat model the model was developed using the measured experimental parameters and it was run for a long time starting with a freshwater state as the initial condition fig 3b shows the model simulated steady state profile in the model the top layer was simulated as an unconfined layer and all other internal lower layers were assumed as confined layers the model was run in a predictive mode using low longitudinal and transverse dispersivity values of 0 01 and 0 001 cm respectively these values are similar to the values used in other experimental studies to simulate similar type of sharp saltwater wedges abarca and clement 2009 chang and clement 2012 goswami and clement 2007 preliminary sensitivity simulations completed using higher dispersivity values indicated that use of larger dispersivity values induced more dispersion than what was observed in the system larger dispersivitiy values in the simulations resulted in a more vertical saltwater wedge during saltwater intrusion comparison of fig 3a and fig 3b results indicate excellent agreement between the experimental data and numerical results 3 2 transient experimental conditions the steady state system discussed above was used as the initial condition to simulate two distinct transient flow conditions involving dry and wet recharge cycles in order to simulate transient conditions we first instantaneously shut the recharge pump to simulate a dry cycle the no recharge condition was allowed to evolve for 45 mins to simulate a dry period transient salt wedge profiles observed after 5 10 15 25 35 and 45 min are shown in the left panel of fig 4 as shown in fig 4a in the initial steady system the recharge flow minimizes saltwater intrusion effects and the wedges intruded only to about 10 4 cm from both saltwater boundaries fig 4b shows that once the recharge was stopped the wedges started to rapidly intrude into the system from both sides and the toe of the wedge reached about 18 75 cm from the lateral boundary after 5 min of transport after about 11 to 12 min of transport the two wedges started to coalesce close to the center of the tank and fig 4c shows the fully merged wedge observed after 15 min it is interesting to note that after coalescing the wedges formed a v shaped profile with the lowest point located at about 6 25 cm from the bottom of the tank with time the wedge developed a u shaped profile and the low point started to lift and was located at about 14 18 5 and 20 3 cm from the bottom of the tank at 25 35 and 45 min respectively see fig 4d e and f note the true steady state pattern for this no recharge condition will be a flat profile and our preliminary experiments showed that it will take about 2 h to approach this flat steady state condition where the saltwater will fully intrude and replace the entire freshwater however in this experiment we only maintained the zero recharge condition for 45 mins to simulate the wet cycle we turned on the recharge pump and supplied a uniform recharge at a rate of 2 016 cm min which was identical to the recharge used to simulate the base case steady state wedge the recharged water infiltrated into the aquifer and reestablished the freshwater lens by forcing the saltwater wedge to recede back toward the left and right seaside boundaries the figures presented in the right panel of fig 4 show the transient movement of the receding wedge interestingly the intruding and receding wedges have very different patterns one of the major differences was that the intruding wedge initially formed a v shaped profile that later evolved into a u shaped profile whereas the receding wedge always had an elongated u shaped profile in the past research studies have primarily focused on the toe location of the saltwater wedge however in our dry and wet cycle comparison analysis we integrated the area above the wedge to quantify the total amount of freshwater storage in the system to define the state of the system the volume of water stored at any given time was then used to compare the differences in the overall shapes of intruding and receding saltwater wedges fig 4h shows the location of the receding wedge after receiving 5 min of recharge the experimental data show that the system formed an elongated u shaped wedge and the lower most point of this wedge was located at about 12 3 cm from the bottom of the aquifer fig 4i j and k show the wedge profiles observed after 15 25 and 35 min of recharge or 60 70 and 80 total minutes and the low points of the wedges were located about 4 2 1 8 and 0 7 cm from the bottom of the tank for the three times respectively fig 4l shows that after 45 mins of recharge or total experimental time of 90 min the wedges were totally disconnected and the toes of the two disconnected wedges were located approximately 13 5 cm from the boundary note the true steady state location is about 10 4 cm the seawat code was used to simulate this dataset and the model simulated profiles of the intruding and receding wedges are also shown in fig 4 these figures show that the model was able to closely reproduce the experimental observations these results indicate that this stable wedge problem has three states involving distinctly different types of salt wedge patterns including the traditional exponentially decaying wedge a v shaped intruding wedge and a u shaped receding wedge these data provide a unique set of transient wedge profiles which can be useful for benchmarking density coupled flow models that involve stable interfaces i e dense water present at the bottom to quantify the changes in freshwater storage patterns the amount of freshwater in the tank experiments was computed by post processing the digital images to estimate the area above the wedge the simulated freshwater fractions were delineated using a threshold of a normalized concentration of 0 25 the changes in the amount of freshwater stored within the system estimated for different times are summarized in fig 5 a good agreement is seen in simulated and observed changes in freshwater fractions fig 5 also shows the sensitivity of freshwater fraction changes to recharge rate the freshwater recovery is most sensitive to the recharge rate and it is seen that the rate of recovery increases with the increase in the recharge intensity the asymmetry observed between depletion and recovery cycles is enhanced with a higher recharge rate for the base simulation the figure shows that during both dry and wet cycles the greatest change in the freshwater volume occurred during the inception of the transient period this can also be seen in fig 4 as time progressed the rate of change of net freshwater storage decreased considerably fig 6 shows the absolute rate of change of freshwater storage observed during the dry and wet stress periods for visual comparison both the rate of decrease and increase in freshwater volume is plotted as the absolute value on the positive y axis these rates were calculated as the change in the freshwater fraction over time interval divided by the length of time interval over which the change occurred when we compared these rates of storage change data for both dry and wet cycles during the first 10 min the rate of change is high for the expanding freshwater lens which was accumulating water under receding saltwater wedge conditions during the wet period our estimations show that during the dry period the freshwater fraction decreased by 33 of the total storage within 10 min on the other hand during the wet period the storage increased to about 53 within 10 min at the beginning of the wet period the recovery rate was almost double as compared to the depletion rate at the onset of the dry period however after the initial surge in freshwater storage the rate of change slowed down as the freshwater forced the intruded saltwater to split into two separate wedges chang and clement 2012 discuss potential reasons for the observed asymmetry between intruding and receding wedges based on their findings one can postulate that the asymmetry observed in the time scales of shrinking and expanding freshwater lens can be attributed to the velocity variations occurring within the saltwater wedge during intruding and receding conditions during intrusion or shrinking freshwater lens conditions saltwater flow from the lateral boundary is moving inward within the saltwater wedge which will be opposite to the outward freshwater flow occurring within the lens the freshwater flow will eventually exit through the lateral boundary within a narrow area close to the top of the tank on the contrary during recession or expanding freshwater lens conditions both freshwater and saltwater flows will align to move toward the lateral boundary and the entire lateral boundary area will be available for outflow these well aligned processes facilitate the saltwater recession to occur at a much higher rate as compared to intrusion these results imply that the freshwater volume stored within a strip island will recover and accumulate water rather rapidly during the initial phase of a rainfall event when compared to the freshwater volume lost during the initial phase of a drought event overall these results show a unique emerging pattern where natural systems can potentially manage water storage rather efficiently the findings observed in the laboratory scale experiments were extended to a field scale investigation using a numerical model representing a realistic system in dauphin island alabama the field scale investigation uses real world spatial domain precipitation data and aquifer parameters and the model was used to observe expected time scale differences in asymmetric transient processes and these results are discussed in section 3 4 3 3 understanding freshwater sustainability under variable recharge conditions the observations made in the experimental study where the freshwater lens recovery process was found to be relatively faster than depletion led us to conduct further numerical simulations for the experimental system for cyclic wet dry conditions cyclic wet dry conditions were simulated using multiple stress periods steady state conditions were simulated under constant recharge conditions as the first stress period dry conditions were invoked by implementing zero recharge during even numbered stress periods and recharge was implemented in subsequent odd numbered stress periods to represent wet conditions one cycle of wet dry conditions therefore comprised of two consecutive stress periods one without recharge followed by one with recharge six such wet dry cycles were simulated the dimensions of the numerical model used for these simulations were the same as the sand tank model the duration representing dry conditions in all simulations was set to a constant time of 25 min however the duration of wet periods was allowed to vary in different simulations note that the recharge rate was the same in all simulations and only the duration was varied for the first simulation the recharge period was set to ten minutes which resulted in a wet dry cycle which was 35 min long comprising of a 25 min dry period followed by 10 min of wet recharge period six such cycles were employed in all these simulation experiments for the second simulation the duration of wet period was reduced to 5 min and a dry period was set to 25 min therefore the duration of each cycle in the second simulation was 30 min in subsequent simulations the recharge period was reduced to 2 min 1 min and 0 1 min the last simulation with a wet period duration of 0 1 min was considered as an extreme case of recharge period fig 7 shows the time series plots for all five cyclical wet dry scenarios the results show that the freshwater volumes decrease from one simulation to the other as the duration of wet period was decreased within every simulation experiment which consisted for six cycles a dynamic equilibrium was achieved after about three wet dry cycles i e the freshwater volume roughly changed by the same amount after three cycles the only exception to that is the extreme case of a recharge duration of one tenth of a minute in this case the freshwater volume continued to decrease after every cycle fig 8 shows the cyclic change in the maximum freshwater achieved at the end of each wet dry cycle the shape of the curve for each simulation stabilizes within a few wet dry cycles indicating that a dynamic equilibrium is achieved but with different freshwater volumes the higher the duration of recharge the higher is the freshwater volume achieved at the dynamic equilibrium condition for example with a 25 min dry and a 10 min wet cycle the maximum freshwater volume fraction under a dynamic equilibrium condition is found to be 0 71 note the freshwater volume fraction indicates the fraction of system that is occupied by freshwater for a simulation with recharge period as low as 1 min and with a dry period of 25 min the maximum freshwater fraction is 0 24 at the dynamic equilibrium condition as seen in figs 7 and 8 a sustained freshwater volume level was attained for simulations in which recharge occurred as briefly as for 1 min after a 25 min dry period only when the recharge duration was shortened to a tenth of a minute with a 25 min dry period the freshwater lens became unsustainable these results show that the freshwater recharge accumulated even during short recharge cycles can help sustain freshwater storage during extended dry periods 3 4 case study for dauphin island alabama a field scale study was completed to assess the real world implication of the observations made in this experimental study dauphin island is located at the southwest end of alabama in the us was selected for this example the western end of the island which has an elongated strip of land of approximately 20 km long with an average width of approximately 400 m was used as the model domain this island region is ideally suited for simulating conditions on an infinite strip island a cross sectional model of the strip of land was created to assess changes in freshwater lens volumes parameterization of the field model was based on a modeling study of dauphin island presented by chang et al 2016 the 400 m width of the strip was discretized into 160 model cells using a 2 5 m horizontal discretization the depth of the model was selected as 21 m the top hydrogeologic unit being 13 m thick representing holocene sand underlain by a 7 m thick clay unit chang et al 2016 the model grid was discretized vertically into 42 layers with a uniform vertical spacing of 0 5 m real world field conditions and rainfall data were used to simulate the freshwater lens in dauphin island alabama to illustrate the differences in the rate of decrease and the rate of increase in freshwater volumes precipitation data was obtained for mobile regional airport alabama available from noaa s national climatic data center ncdc monthly calculated precipitation rates used for generating transient groundwater recharge for the model is shown in fig 9 net groundwater recharge was set at 5 of the precipitation amount the figure shows a large monthly variation in precipitation values on a larger timescale there was an extended drought period between 2010 and the first half of 2011 which occurred in between two relatively wet years of 2009 and 2012 see inset plot in fig 9 other site parameters were taken from the calibrated model parameters presented in a previously published study chang et al 2016 and the data are summarized in table 1 the objective of this field scale simulation was to test whether the laboratory scale observations made were applicable for field scale conditions specifically to test whether the freshwater recharge rapidly accumulated during the short recharge cycles will be able to sustain freshwater storage during extended dry periods a transient model was simulated for the period of 2007 2013 to isolate the impacts of recharge on the freshwater volumes only recharge was varied on a monthly basis during the transient period all other boundary conditions were held constant initial conditions were set as steady state conditions with average 2007 2013 recharge fig 10 shows the monthly variation in freshwater volume fraction predicted by the model the relative changes in freshwater volume largely follow the variation in recharge applied to the model freshwater volume increases with increased recharge and vice versa the results show that increase in recharge causes the freshwater to increase within the same month decrease in recharge however shows a delayed response in freshwater lens depletion the recession limb of the freshwater lens took several months to manifest on the decrease in freshwater volumes during dry cycles this pattern can be observed in almost all the events in which recharge drops but it is most prominent during the extended dry cycle beginning in 2010 and lasting through the middle of 2011 during this period the decrease in freshwater volume is not as drastic as the decrease in recharge conditions intermittent increase in recharge even by a small amount of rain in 2010 helped slow down the decrease in freshwater lens volume through the entire year on the other hand a large increase in recharge during 2009 2011 and 2012 is reflected by an almost instantaneous increase in freshwater volume while the absolute change in freshwater volume may not be significant it is interesting to note that like the laboratory scale results these field scale simulations also show a delayed pattern of freshwater lens depletion relative to the freshwater lens formation the real world example simulated here qualitatively demonstrates the delayed response of freshwater volume depletion over several months due to the decrease in recharge and an almost instantaneous recovery of freshwater volume resulting from increased recharge these observations highlight the importance of managing groundwater replenishment from even short rainfall events after or during an extended dry period efforts to capture recharge from these short rainfall events are consequential to better manage freshwater resources in island aquifers 4 conclusions a laboratory experiment was conducted to study the patterns of a shrinking and expanding freshwater lens in an infinite strip island the laboratory data were simulated using a numerical model developed using seawat the modeled results closely matched the experimental data the data show asymmetry in the time scales of the shrinking and expanding freshwater lens it was also observed that the initial period of stress causes the highest change in freshwater volume storage both loss and gain and the rate of change of freshwater storage rapidly decreases with the passage of time interestingly the freshwater lens expansion or accumulation of freshwater during the early period of the wet cycle occurred at a greater rate when compared to the freshwater lens shrinkage or loss of freshwater rate during the dry cycle these results show that natural systems could support an efficient non linear feedback mechanism that has an emerging property where the groundwater system loses water slowly during a dry cycle but it can recover fast by gaining water rather rapidly during a wet cycle this non linear feedback mechanism and its implication on faster freshwater recovery greatly emphasizes the importance of implementing careful recharge management strategies to maximize freshwater storage in small island aquifers our experimental data as well as model simulation results show that even short duration rainfall events can greatly enhance the freshwater availability in small islands 5 acknowledgements this work was in

hexachlorobenzene hcb were selected due to significantly higher human health and ecological risks in sediments batch biological dechlorination tests were conducted using an l9 34 orthogonal table according to the taguchi method the results showed that significant controlling factors for biological dechlorination were temperature and emulsion concentration a single operation of ispie can achieve the removal of aroclor 1254 and hcb at as high as 58 2 and 56 5 respectively column study on bird further removed about 30 of the residual aroclor 1254 and hcb at the upper and middle sections of the sediment cores in 35 days these results supported that ispie bird is feasible for hoc contaminated sediments remediation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords sediment remediation persistent organic pollutants polychlorinated biphenyl hexachlorobenzene phase inversion emulsification biological dechlorination 1 introduction river sediments provide versatile services in the river ecosystem such as self purification of river water habitats for planktons benthic and epibenthic organisms and ideal spawning sites for fishes sediment can act as a sink or a source of hocs in a river canadian council of ministers of the environment 2001 for pristine sediments hocs in river water can enter the sediment and accumulate when hocs reach a certain concentration in sediment it can turn into a source to release hocs back into the river water these hocs can also accumulate in organismal tissues especially fat tissues and could be biomagnified through trophic levels ultimately the health risk for human increased because human is one of the top level consumers according to the report by lijzen et al 2001 most pollutants in soil are more harmful than those in sediment such as heavy metals aromatic compounds and chlorophenols however chlorinated benzyl compounds exhibit higher ecological and human health risk in sediment than in soil among them polychlorinated biphenyls and chlorobenzenes exhibit significantly higher risk in sediments lijzen et al 2001 thus in this study hcb and aroclor 1254 were chosen to test the feasibility of this new remedial technology ispie bird currently there are various approaches for sediment remediation and can be categorized into three major groups physical chemical and biological for physical methods there are dredging solidification landfill incineration thermal extraction land farming underwater landfill and containment chemical methods include electro kinetic remediation chemical oxidation acid washing and active capping biological methods may involve composting bioleaching biotransformation phytoremediation natural recovery etc chowdhury et al 1996 adriaens et al 2006 mulligan et al 2010 among them dredging capping and natural recovery seem to be the most widely applied methods for sediment remediation adriaens et al 2006 förstner and apitz 2007 beckingham and ghosh 2011 however all these methods will face huge challenges in taiwan due to the high hydraulic gradient and frequent flooding in typhoon seasons thus to meet the objective of finishing a remediation project within a dry season in taiwan a rapid cost effective and eco friendly in situ approach is in demand here we propose an in situ remedial technology that integrates ispie with emulsion recovery of hocs heat selection of hydrogen producing bacteria and bird the heat enhanced emulsion recovery is expected to remove a significant portion of hocs in a few hours and the subsequent emulsion enhanced bird may further accelerate the biodegradation rate of hocs phase inversion is a phenomenon often encountered in an emulsion using nonionic surfactants as major emulsifiers e g tween series and span series these surfactants have polyethoxylene groups and their hydrophilicity decreases when the temperature increases thus in this emulsion system an oil in water o w emulsion at room temperature will turn into a water in oil w o emulsion when the temperature is above the so called phase inversion temperature pit förster et al 1992 forgiarini et al 2001 when the emulsion cools down to below the phase inversion temperature the emulsion will change back to o w emulsion with much finer oil droplets sometimes less than 100 nm förster et al 1992 chang et al 2012 if we inject this hot w o emulsion into a column filled with sediment particles from the bottom that lower part of sediment will experience a higher temperature higher than the pit for a period of time since it is well known that hydrogen producing bacteria are endospore forming bacteria they can be selected by holding a mixed culture at high temperature madigan et al 2015 thus the lower part of the sediments will have a bacterial community predominated by hydrogen producers and other endospore forming bacteria fig 1 this design is based on previous studies on pretreatment methods to enrich hydrogen producing bacteria heat shock pretreatment has been most widely used to eliminate non spore forming methanogens wang et al 2003 chang and lin 2004 mu et al 2007 since hydrogen producing bacteria like clostridium can form endospores and survive under a heated environment they can be enriched through this process the heating condition of this pretreatment ranged from 80 to 121 c and exposure time between 15 and 120 min ren et al 2008 it has also been reported that dechlorinating bacteria grow best in the range of 28 c to 37 c zhang et al 2000 hu et al 2013 and some are even thermophiles shimura et al 1999 matturro et al 2016 thus a short period of exposure to slightly higher temperature watery sediment is not a good heat conductor will not eliminate the dechlorinating bacteria in the upper part of the sediment core the injected hot w o emulsion will have similar transport behavior as these non wetting chlorinated compounds or hocs and will increase the contact probability between oil phase and hydrophobic contaminants saleh et al 2007 the higher temperature can also increase the mass transfer of these hocs between different phases di et al 2002 after a 30 min holding cool clean water is injected to displace the emulsion and trigger phase inversion it is expected that the w o emulsion will turn into an o w emulsion with much smaller oil particle usually less than 300 nm and a significant portion of hocs at the bottom part will be easily removed chang et al 2014 chang et al 2017 hocs concentration at the upper part may still be higher but dechlorinating bacteria could become predominant in this section then this treated layer of sediment about 30 cm thick becomes a bioactive capping material with different predominant bacteria at different horizons the hydrogen producing bacteria will generate dissolved hydrogen that will move upward to the upper section where dechlorinating bacteria can use it as an electron donor while aroclor 1254 and hcb act as electron acceptors in this study the biodegradability of aroclor 1254 and hcb was investigated using the taguchi method and two columns packed with real sediments were set up to test if this design can work in a real sediment environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 sediment preparation in order to test the recovery and biological dechlorination of aroclor 1254 and hcb on a consistent base simulated sediment samples were prepared for batch studies according to the size distribution of sediment samples from a heavily polluted section of er ren river err in southern taiwan the cumulative particle size distribution of real sediment samples is 5 4 47 5 57 1 94 1 97 2 98 8 and 100 0 for the size ranges of less than 2 μm 2 to 75 μm 75 to 106 μm 106 to 250 μm 250 to 425 μm 425 to 850 μm and 850 to 2000 μm respectively silica sands purchased from a local filter sand company were sieved acid washed then mixed according to the above size distributions that are larger than 75 μm for the portion of particle size less than 75 μm kaolinite and ultrafine glass beads rich sou technology co ltd kaohsiung taiwan were used these solids were then mixed with a specific growth medium see supporting information at a ratio of 1 9 aroclor 1254 and hcb were dissolved into hexane and then diluted by methanol to the designated concentration of 5 0 mg kg dry base before mixing with this prepared sediment in order to disperse the targeted pollutants evenly in this simulated sediment however for column study real sediment from err was used to pack two columns a control column and an experimental column 2 2 culture preparation in an anaerobic chamber coy laboratory products inc grass lake mi usa three sediment samples taken from err were mixed together and subsampled this subsample was then fully mixed with a sterile medium at a ratio of 1 1 as previously reported in literatures he et al 2006 robrock et al 2008 this mixture was left undisturbed for 10 min to let the bigger sediment particles settle down the supernatant was transferred to a 200 ml serum bottle for cell proliferation aroclor 1254 was dissolved into n hexane diluted by methanol and added into the growth medium to reach a final concentration of 1 0 mg kg dry base another one was prepared in the same way but hcb was added to reach 1 0 mg kg dry base concentration these bottles were kept under 30 c for 30 days for acclimation the cell density was checked and the concentrations of aroclor 1254 and hcb were analyzed to make sure the culture acclimation was successful 2 3 emulsion preparation in this study a food grade soybean oil emulsion was prepared for the ispie operation soybean oil cat no 0102010005 taiwan sugar corporation tainan taiwan was purchased from a local supermarket and all surfactants were nonionic surfactants span 80 tween 20 and tween 80 purchased from sigma aldrich 85548 p1379 and p1754 respectively sigma aldrich co llc st louis missouri usa soybean oil was mixed for 30 min with a mixture of span 80 tween 20 and tween 80 with a ratio of 1 2 1 water soybean oil and surfactant were mixed at a ratio of 44 1 10 if the mixture is heated up to above the phase inversion temperature of this system about 85 c the emulsion becomes a w o emulsion which was evidenced by an obvious shift in electric conductivity measurement after it cooled down the phase inversed and an o w emulsion was formed the oil droplet size can be less than 100 nm and it can easily travel through the pores in the sediments chang et al 2014 2 4 biological dechlorination batch studies two batch studies were conducted according to the taguchi method one on aroclor 1254 and the other on hcb an l9 34 orthogonal table was employed and four controlling factors were tested i e ph temperature soil organic matter and emulsion concentration table 1 the first three are often the principal environmental variables in a field remediation and the last one is to identify better concentration range of residual emulsions left in the sediment after an ispie operation the three different levels of each controlling factors are as listed in table 1 the initial concentrations of aroclor 1254 and hcb were both 5 0 mg kg which is within the range of historical monitoring results cornelissen et al 1997 booij et al 2003 all combinations of aroclor 1254 biological dechlorination tests were sampled on day 1 7 14 28 and 49 all combinations of hcb biological dechlorination tests were also sampled on the same days all samples were pretreated and analyzed by following the procedure described in the next section 2 5 sample pretreatment and analysis before analysis the samples were extracted by using an accelerated solvent extractor speed extractor e 916 büchi labortechnik ag switzerland extraction conditions are described below for aroclor 1254 the temperature was set at 100 c and the pressure at 120 bar extraction solvent was a mixture of 50 n hexane and 50 acetone 32293 and 34850 respectively sigma aldrich co llc st louis missouri usa the volumes of extraction cell and collection bottle were 20 and 60 ml respectively extraction cycle number was set at two the two cycles were identical 1 0 min for heating up 10 0 min for holding and 2 0 min for discharging the post run solvent flush was 1 0 min and nitrogen flush was 2 0 min each sample collected in the collection bottle was added 2 0 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid 30743 j t baker phillipsburg nj usa after being concentrated to 3 0 ml from about 40 ml of extract using a vacuum evaporator then the supernatant was transferred to a test tube containing 2 0 g of activated copper powder 200 mesh to remove any sulfide that might be present in the sample then the samples were cleaned up by passing through a column packed with activated silica gel 70 230 mesh r10040b silicycle inc quebec city quebec ca using n hexane the volume of each eluted sample was concentrated to 1 0 ml by using a rotary evaporator n 1100 series eyela tokyo rikakikai co ltd tokyo japan and then analyzed with a gas chromatography gc instrument clarus 580 perkinelmer waltham ma usa equipped with an electron capture detector ecd for aroclor 1254 quantification a 30 meter hp 5 column with 0 32

was at 300 c for the hcb analysis after the activated copper powder cleanup the samples were treated by passing through a column packed with magnesium silicate which was primed with 100 ml of petroleum ether then 200 ml of petroleum ether were used to clean up the sample and the eluted samples were concentrated to 1 0 ml using a rotary evaporator n 1100 series eyela tokyo rikakikai co ltd tokyo japan then the sample was analyzed using the same gc detector column and the same carrier gas with a flowrate of 1 4 ml per min injection port temperature was 200 c and the injection volume was 1 0 μl oven initial temperature was set at 100 c and held for 0 5 min then the temperature was ramped up to 140 c at 20 c per min and then ramped up to 280 c at 15 c per min then it was held for 15 0 min the detector temperature was 325 c 2 6 microbiological analysis the microbial community before and after ispie operation were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction and denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis pcr dgge to see if the hypothesized heat selection can be realized in real sediment sample deoxyribonucleic acid dna was extracted using a commercial kit ultra clean soil dna kit mo bio laboratories inc carlsbad ca usa dna was stored at 20 c in a freezer before pcr dgge the pcr is performed by using eubacterial primer 968f 1392r forward gc clamp 5 aacgcgaagaaccttac 3 reverse 5 acgggcggtgtgtac 3 pcr was performed using a thermocycler 2720 thermal cycler applied biosystems foster city ca usa and 50 μl of the extracted sample dna mixture was used the temperature program was 94

ensure the pcr products were at the right length by comparing to a dna ladder the denaturant was made of urea 40 acrylamide bis 50 tea buffer and formamide in this study a 30 to 70 of denaturing

the sequence was identified by using the nucleotide blast function on the internet database of national center for biotechnology information ncbi 2 7 column study as shown in fig 1 real sediment from err was used to pack two 6 in diameter clear pvc tubes jumpanny enterprise ltd co taichung taiwan in order to observe the ispie process these columns were constructed in such a way that the emulsion can be injected from the bottom and evenly distributed at the inlet by using stainless screens and a layer of acid washed silica sand the length of the packed sediment was 30 cm and a valve was connected at the side with about 30 cm water laid on top of the sediment to maintain a constant water height after the injection of about 0 5 pv of 95 c w o emulsion the pump is stopped and on hold for 30 min the tube was then connected to clean water at room temperature then after the 30 min holding room temperature water was injected and the water was sampled at each pv these water samples were processed and analyzed in the same way described in the section of sample pretreatment and chemical analysis after 4 0 pv was injected the loosened sediment was pressed back to 30 cm and then sampled at day 0 7 14 21 and 42 to monitor the change of aroclor 1254 and hcb along with elapsed time sampling was performed by taking three tiny core samples using glass tubes and the three core samples were extruded and separated into top 10 cm middle 10 cm and bottom 10 cm then the sediments at the same section of the three different core samples were pooled together and then processed by following the same pretreatment and analytical procedures 3 results and discussion 3 1 biological dechlorination batch studies the results of batch studies of aroclor 1254 and hcb are as shown in fig 2 among all the experimental combinations test number 7 30 c ph 7 0 10 emulsion and 0 0 organic matter exhibited the best removal for both arochlor 1254 and hcb followed by test number 9 30 c ph 5 5 1 0 emulsion and 1 0 organic matter test number 1 10 c ph 5 5 0 0 emulsion and 0 0 organic matter exhibited the worst for both pollutants since the concentrations were quantified along with time biological dechlorination rate constants can also be obtained by plotting the natural log values of c c0 versus time the results were tabulated as shown in table 2 from this table one can see that the rankings for both series of tests are in good agreement it seems that temperatures did heavily impact both the removal and kinetic of aroclor 1254 and hcb strikingly the ratios of respective rate constants of hcb to aroclor 1254 k hcb k pcb for each test combination are quite consistent here the subscripted pcb represents aroclor 1254 the average of these ratios was 2 59 with a coefficient of variance at 13 6 these results indicated that the microbial communities for dechlorinating aroclor 1254 and hcb may be highly similar and responded to the different environmental variables in highly similar patterns in the literature researchers have demonstrated that different temperatures may favor certain anaerobic microorganisms to degrade pcbs via specific pathways for example for 2 3 4 6 chlorobiphenyl it has been reported that flanked meta dechlorination occurred between 8 and 34 c and 50 60 c while between 18 c and 34 c unflanked para dechlorination occurred they also proposed an optimal temperature range of 20 27 c wiegel and wu 2000 these observations are not exactly the same as our findings the major reasons might be that the microbial culture in this study was taken from err in southern taiwan with an average sediment temperature higher than 25 c according to our daily monitoring the monthly average temperatures of err sediment are usually above 25 c from april to october with at least one month above 30 c unpublished data by applying the taguchi statistical analysis to these data four influence charts of controlling factors were obtained as shown in fig 3 from panel a and b for the total removal of both aroclor 1254 and hcb according to taguchi s one half principle temperature and emulsion concentration could be deemed as the more significant controlling factors the trends of both aroclor 1254 and hcb are highly similar that is higher temperature and higher emulsion concentration yielded better removal for both aroclor 1254 and hcb even though soil organic matter contents and ph values are not that significant it seemed that higher organic matter content may result in higher removal and probably optimum ph range was between 7 0 and 8 5 the biological dechlorination rate constants can also be computed and compared as shown in panel c and d of fig 3 since k values included the trends of all five data points in the time scale these results may give a clearer picture of the impacts of controlling factors for aroclor 1254 and hcb higher temperature did show again better biological dechlorination rates for hcb the ratios of the degradation rates of k hcb at 20 c to k hcb at 10 c and k hcb at 30 c to k hcb at 20 c were 1 80 times and 1 36 times respectively these ratios for aroclor 1254 were 1 70 and 1 18 respectively thus hcb degradation seemed to be enhanced more than aroclor 1254 when temperature increased due to thermodynamic reasons higher chlorinated aromatics or aliphatics more oxidized species have been shown to have higher degradation rates than those less chlorinated counterparts for example perchloroethylene chlorine to carbon ratio cl c is 2 and trichloroethylene cl c 1 5 have higher biological reductive dechlorination rates than dichloroethylene cl c 1 0 and vinyl chloride cl c 0 5 rhee 1999 alvarez and illman 2006 similarly major chlorinated congeners of aroclor 1254 have a cl c at the range of 0 33 0 58 while hcb has a much higher cl c i e 1 0 thus the biological dechlorination rate of aroclor 1254 is expected to be lower than that of hcb for the temperature dependence it should be linked to the arrhenius equation describing the relationship between reaction rates and the temperature in this case since the contaminants were dissolved in methanol and then mixed with the simulated sediment it can be safely assumed that bioavailability is not a major issue for aroclor 1254 or hcb from table 2 the degradation rate constants at the same temperature can be averaged and a plot of lnk versus 1 t was generated the slopes for hcb and aroclor 1254 were 110 3 r 2 0 9982 and 33 0 r 2 0 9596 respectively thus it is very clear that the reaction rate of hcb indeed showed much higher dependency on temperature change see fig s1 in supporting information one may argue that this average value of k is not like that from tradition factorial experiment design changing one factor at a time however according to the taguchi method this average can represent the average of k s of all possible combinations of experimental conditions at the designated temperature even though ph values and organic matter were not as significant higher ph seemed to be better for hcb but not so for aroclor 1254 from fig 3c and d it is evident that ph and organic matter content have very minor effects on the degradation rate constants of aroclor 1254 fig 3d for hcb higher ph may counteract the acidifying effect caused by the formation of hcl and volatile fatty acids in this biological dechlorination process in the literatures tce and pce dechlorination extent at the range of ph 7 8 was higher than that at the range of ph 6 7 zhuang and pavlostathis 1995 thus more chlorinated hcb fully chlorinated may also show better dechlorination at a higher ph range than less chlorinated aroclor 1254 congeners about 4 to 7 chlorine per biphenyl molecule furthermore from these charts one can conclude that the optimum environmental conditions for removal is 30 c and high emulsion concentration 10 while intermediate organic matter content and neutral ph may not negatively impact the removal and biological dechlorination rates thus for the column study room temperature about 25 c should be fine for residual emulsion after recovery it is not necessary to flush the test sediment multiple times to minimize the residual emulsion for organic matter content the influence was minor but higher organic matter content may be better the average organic matter content in err sediment is about 0 65 which is the middle level of organic matter content in the batch study the values of ph in real err sediment were slightly higher than 7 0 and dropped to less than 7 0 after the start of biodegradation of soybean oil in the residual emulsions chang et al 2017 the two most influential factors temperature and emulsion concentration were examined for their interaction the results are as shown in fig 4 for aroclor 1254 for rate constants at high and medium concentration of emulsion there is no interaction for the whole range of temperature 10 c 30 c the two lines were parallel indicating there is no additivity between these two factors however for rate constants at low emulsion concentration the biological dechlorination rate at 20 c seemed to be enhanced much more than that at 30 c there are probably two major reasons the complex congener contents of aroclor 1254 and the different microbial communities or enzyme systems were employed at different temperatures wu et al investigated the dechlorination of added 2 3 4 0 6 chlorobiphenyl 2346 cb and residual aroclor 1260 in woods pond sediment housatonic river lenox ma usa the samples were incubated at 18 temperature points from 4 to 66 c in their study they found the optimal temperature ranges were 18 30 c and 20 27 c for 2346 cb and residual aroclor 1262 respectively wu et al 1997 it was also reported that hudson river sediment samples incubated at five different temperature points the results showed that aroclor 1242 was dechlorinated at 12 c and at 25 c but not at 37 c or above tiedje et al 1993 even though the overall removal cannot fully represent the biological dechlorination rates these studies still implied that the optimum temperature range for the best dechlorination rate for aroclor 1254 may be around 20 25 c thus the results of the dechlorination rates peaking at around 20 c was in good agreement with the previous studies for the enzyme systems and corresponding degradation pathways researchers also found that different dechlorination pathways may only happen at different temperature ranges i e flanked meta dechlorination at 8 to 30 c flanked para dechlorination at 12 to 34 c unflanked para dechlorination at 18 to 30 c and meta dechlorination of specific hepta and octa chlorobiphenyls at 50 to 60 c wu et al 1997 however for hcb there was no interaction between temperature and emulsion concentration at all indicating that within the tested ranges the trends of the influences of these two factors are independent a major reason for this difference between aroclor 1254 and hcb could be that hcb biological dechlorination have highly preferential biodegradation pathways and the optimal temperature has been reported to be around 30 c beurskens et al 1994 pavlostathis and prytula 2000 for the toxicity of the dechlorination products two points need to be addressed one is the total mass of aroclor 1254 decreased and the other is that less chlorinated congeners are less toxic here in this study even without gc ms detection 110 peaks appeared in gc ecd histograms from the histograms it was evident that total mass decreased peak areas were reduced for individual peaks and heavier congeners more chlorinated moved toward lighter congeners less chlorinated see fig s2 in supporting information under anaerobic conditions only less chlorinated pcbs were formed and most toxic pcb congeners are those with at least 4 chlorines per biphenyl molecules i e pcb 77 pcb 81 pcb 105 pcb 114 pcb 118 pcb 123 pcb 126 pcb 156 pcb 157 pcb 167 pcb 169 and pcb 189 miao et al 2001 thus as long as only less chlorinated pcb congeners formed the total toxicity of aroclor 1254 decreased 3 2 ispie operation for this experiment a 95 c hot w o emulsion was injected from the bottom of a column packed with the sediments from err fig 1 after holding for 30 min the emulsion was displaced by adding room temperature water after flushing 4 0 pv of water the sediments were sampled and aroclor 1254 and hcb were quantified the concentration changes of aroclor 1254 and hcb before and after the operation are as shown in fig 5 a removal percentage was defined as 1 cbefore ispie cafter ispie thus for aroclor 1254 the removal percentages for upper middle and lower sections were 41 6 56 4 and 76 7 respectively for hcb the removal percentages for upper middle and lower sections were 41 2 46 7 and 81 7 respectively these removal trends were exactly as the way they were expected the overall removal for aroclor 1254 and hcb were 58 2 and 56 5 respectively since the log k ow values of aroclor 1254 and hcb were 6 5 and 5 73 respectively unknown 2015 this result seemed to be reasonable if only the lower section of the sediment was assessed the removal percentages of aroclor 1254 and hcb would be as high as 76 7 and 81 7 respectively however in this study we emphasize on how to incorporate this approach with the following bird step instead of achieving highest removal using only ispie here we added about 0 8 pv of hot w o emulsion into the column and the sediment surface rose up to about 10 cm higher than the original surface indicating that the pore volume probably increased for about 60 thus the hot emulsion may only impact 50 of the sediment without heating up the upper section of the sediments too much the temperature of the top surface of the sediment was measured by an infrared thermometer and it was always lower than 35 c this temperature will not kill most of the dechlorinating bacteria during the 30 min holding time because the reported optimum growth temperature range for most dechlorinating microorganisms was 25 35 c beurskens et al 1994 pavlostathis and prytula 2000 wiegel and wu 2000 schmidt et al 2014 using w o emulsion is better than using surfactants alone because the w o emulsion in a porous media will have less sorption on the mineral surface due to its less hydrophilic surface than an o w emulsion since the oil surface is nearly nonpolar the w o emulsion would transport through the porous media more like hocs that were not wetting the surface of the soil grains but adsorbed on organic matters dissolved in water or other nonpolar liquids or formed globules within the pores when this w o emulsion started phase inversion changing into an o w emulsion hocs would be carried away by injected cool water or nutrient buffer researchers have shown that for a w o emulsion while being pushed through a microchannel the emulsion flow experienced a dynamic blocking phenomenon even though the water droplet diameter is much smaller than the diameter of the channel khasanov et al 2011 dynamic blocking effect is defined as the flow of the water in oil emulsion almost completely ceases with time despite the permanent pressure gradient is applied it is more manifest when flowing through a cylindrical microchannel a plane flow in a fracture or a capillary structure when injecting the cool water we did encounter a back pressure in the column but it was overcome by manually increasing the pressure in this study transparent polyvinyl tubes were used to construct the columns so that a lot of gas bubbles were observed in the real river sediments probably due to gas production of anaerobic microorganisms these bubbles expanded after the introduction of hot emulsion and this expansion of pore size actually eased the displacing movement of the hot w o emulsion in the column thus it should be feasible by using a diaphragm pump in a real world application researchers have tried to use surfactants to wash hcb from soils and sediments edwards et al 1994 sun et al 1995 chu and chan 2003 and found that surfactant at higher than critical micelle concentration can incorporate hydrophobic liquid into the micelle that has a small nonpolar inner sphere however the nonpolar ends of the surfactant molecules tend to adsorb onto sediment organic matter by hydrophobic hydrophobic interaction that apparently increases the fraction of som thus in this case hocs may get adsorbed more in the sediment instead of being washed off the major obstacle in hcb washing is its strong affinity to som which makes the release of hcb slow tong and yuan 2012 electrokinetic ek method has also been applied but hcb is naturally neutral and insoluble and thus has very low electromigration without some agent to facilitate ek itself is not an effective option li et al 2010 reported that 40 of hcb in sediments could be removed by using hydroxypropyl β cyclodextrin enhanced electrokinetic remediation method other researchers tried a combination of pd fe or cu fe to increase the removal to 60 wan et al 2010 wan et al 2011 abiotic dechlorination using micro or nano scale fe0 has been tried and the inherent obstacle is that other oxidants present in the sediments may compete for the electrons donated by fe0 this approach usually leads to the accumulation of less chlorinated intermediates such as tetra and tri chlorobenzenes which were still toxic and more mobile than hcb in the environment wängnerud et al 1995 photodechlorination of hcb has also been proposed but may not be applicable to river sediments in heavily polluted rivers like err thermal decomposition may require dredging and may cause polymerization of hcb to form polychlorinated biphenyls or other high molecular weight compounds gao et al 2008 a highly effective method is sediment vitrification which still requires dredging and also large installation capital to build and operate therefore ispie may offer a more cost effective and eco friendly approach for hcb contaminated sediments for physicochemical removal or immobilization of pcbs in sediment the technologies are very much the same like zero valent iron desorption or surfactant washing except for the application of biochar fly ash or activated carbon for capping or immobilization chuang et al 1995 zimmerman et al 2004 riaza frutos et al 2007 among them activated carbon amendment could be the best one however the applied activated carbons left in the river may cause negative effects on benthic organisms nybom et al 2012 janssen and beckingham 2013 recently we reported that a double emulsion can be used to recover bde 209 from river sediments mainly composed of decabrominated diphenyl ether with a log k ow value of about 10 0 for single operation this double emulsion could recover 43 1 10 9 mean standard deviation of weathered bde 209 and 53 1 19 8 mean standard deviation of fresh bde 209 chang et al 2017 comparing the recovery efficiency and the values of log k ow it is obvious that ispie could be a better approach based on the results in a batch study 3 3 column study the heat treatment of the sediment also impacted the microbial community after the ispie operation one column apart from the other two for column study was sacrificed and separated into three sections sediments from each section underwent dna extraction after pcr dgge processing the gel was imaged as shown in fig 6 the lower section showed only one band as expected and there were more than 10 bands in the upper section indicating the existence of abundant microbial populations however the middle section showed no band at all this was probably due to the temperature at the middle section being around 60 c and the exposure time was long enough to deactivate and even kill almost all microorganisms like a pasteurization procedure the monitoring results of the concentration change of aroclor 1254 and hcb at the three different sections were as shown in fig 7 comparing the concentrations on day 0 and 7 it seemed there was an increase this could be due to some loss happened during sample pretreatment at the first data point at the beginning of the biodegradation after ispie the higher residual emulsion concentration meant a higher surfactant level the surfactant may affect the surface of silica gel used in the cleanup step during sample pretreatment thus lower recovery of aroclor 1254 and hcb may happen at the first data point starting from day 7 this effect was alleviated because the surfactants were also degradable and a clear trend of decrease appeared based on the concentrations on day 35 and day 7 the removal percentages were obtained the removal percentages at the upper section of aroclor 1254 and hcb were 26 4 and 27 9 respectively while at the middle 28 4 and 31 2 respectively it is quite astonishing that the microbial community rebuilt within a few days and reached similar removals the lower section showed minimal removal that is 3 5 and 3 9 of aroclor 1254 and hcb respectively this low removal was probably due to the high activity of predominant hydrogen producing bacteria at this section and probably low population density of dechlorination microorganisms overall within 35 days 64 6 of aroclor 1254 and 62 7 of hcb have been removed if this ispie bird procedure can be repeated every 35 days and the removal rates can be maintained within 3 5 months higher than 95 removal of both contaminants is probably achievable therefore this remediation scheme for hoc contaminated sediments is quite feasible for taiwan and other areas that have similar hydrogeographic conditions by integrating ispie heat selection of microbial populations and subsequent bird 4 conclusion in this study a new approach was successfully demonstrated for remediation of river sediments contaminated by two hocs aroclor 1254 and hcb this approach integrated ispie heat selection of microbial populations and bird in a batch biodegradation test within 49 days the removals of aroclor 1254 and hcb were 58 and 91 and half lives were 38 7 and 14 1 days respectively single operation of ispie can remove more than 56 of these contaminants and within 35 days subsequent bird further removed nearly 30 of the contaminants at the upper and middle sections of the tested sediment columns however when applying this technology to the field temperature an inherent field condition and residual emulsion concentrations an engineering controllable parameter may heavily influence the results thus site specific characteristic is still an indispensable factor in sediment remediation design acknowledgement this study was funded by the research project supported by the taiwan epa the views or opinions expressed in this article

1606,river sediment contamination is a critical environmental problem concentrations of certain hydrophobic organic compounds hocs in sediments in taiwan are ranked at the top in the world in this study we proposed a novel in situ phase inversion emulsification and biological reductive dechlorination ispie bird method that integrates 1 heating contaminated sediments by hot water in oil emulsion to increase the contact between hydrophobic organic contaminants hocs to accelerate the mass transfer between two phases and to select heat tolerant hydrogen producing bacteria 2 ispie forming oil in water emulsion to enhance recovery of hocs by pushing cool water and nutrient buffer through the sediment column and 3 subsequent bird using residual emulsion in sediment aroclor 1254 and hexachlorobenzene hcb were selected due to significantly higher human health and ecological risks in sediments batch biological dechlorination tests were conducted using an l9 34 orthogonal table according to the taguchi method the results showed that significant controlling factors for biological dechlorination were temperature and emulsion concentration a single operation of ispie can achieve the removal of aroclor 1254 and hcb at as high as 58 2 and 56 5 respectively column study on bird further removed about 30 of the residual aroclor 1254 and hcb at the upper and middle sections of the sediment cores in 35 days these results supported that ispie bird is feasible for hoc contaminated sediments remediation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords sediment remediation persistent organic pollutants polychlorinated biphenyl hexachlorobenzene phase inversion emulsification biological dechlorination 1 introduction river sediments provide versatile services in the river ecosystem such as self purification of river water habitats for planktons benthic and epibenthic organisms and ideal spawning sites for fishes sediment can act as a sink or a source of hocs in a river canadian council of ministers of the environment 2001 for pristine sediments hocs in river water can enter the sediment and accumulate when hocs reach a certain concentration in sediment it can turn into a source to release hocs back into the river water these hocs can also accumulate in organismal tissues especially fat tissues and could be biomagnified through trophic levels ultimately the health risk for human increased because human is one of the top level consumers according to the report by lijzen et al 2001 most pollutants in soil are more harmful than those in sediment such as heavy metals aromatic compounds and chlorophenols however chlorinated benzyl compounds exhibit higher ecological and human health risk in sediment than in soil among them polychlorinated biphenyls and chlorobenzenes exhibit significantly higher risk in sediments lijzen et al 2001 thus in this study hcb and aroclor 1254 were chosen to test the feasibility of this new remedial technology ispie bird currently there are various approaches for sediment remediation and can be categorized into three major groups physical chemical and biological for physical methods there are dredging solidification landfill incineration thermal extraction land farming underwater landfill and containment chemical methods include electro kinetic remediation chemical oxidation acid washing and active capping biological methods may involve composting bioleaching biotransformation phytoremediation natural recovery etc chowdhury et al 1996 adriaens et al 2006 mulligan et al 2010 among them dredging capping and natural recovery seem to be the most widely applied methods for sediment remediation adriaens et al 2006 förstner and apitz 2007 beckingham and ghosh 2011 however all these methods will face huge challenges in taiwan due to the high hydraulic gradient and frequent flooding in typhoon seasons thus to meet the objective of finishing a remediation project within a dry season in taiwan a rapid cost effective and eco friendly in situ approach is in demand here we propose an in situ remedial technology that integrates ispie with emulsion recovery of hocs heat selection of hydrogen producing bacteria and bird the heat enhanced emulsion recovery is expected to remove a significant portion of hocs in a few hours and the subsequent emulsion enhanced bird may further accelerate the biodegradation rate of hocs phase inversion is a phenomenon often encountered in an emulsion using nonionic surfactants as major emulsifiers e g tween series and span series these surfactants have polyethoxylene groups and their hydrophilicity decreases when the temperature increases thus in this emulsion system an oil in water o w emulsion at room temperature will turn into a water in oil w o emulsion when the temperature is above the so called phase inversion temperature pit förster et al 1992 forgiarini et al 2001 when the emulsion cools down to below the phase inversion temperature the emulsion will change back to o w emulsion with much finer oil droplets sometimes less than 100 nm förster et al 1992 chang et al 2012 if we inject this hot w o emulsion into a column filled with sediment particles from the bottom that lower part of sediment will experience a higher temperature higher than the pit for a period of time since it is well known that hydrogen producing bacteria are endospore forming bacteria they can be selected by holding a mixed culture at high temperature madigan et al 2015 thus the lower part of the sediments will have a bacterial community predominated by hydrogen producers and other endospore forming bacteria fig 1 this design is based on previous studies on pretreatment methods to enrich hydrogen producing bacteria heat shock pretreatment has been most widely used to eliminate non spore forming methanogens wang et al 2003 chang and lin 2004 mu et al 2007 since hydrogen producing bacteria like clostridium can form endospores and survive under a heated environment they can be enriched through this process the heating condition of this pretreatment ranged from 80 to 121 c and exposure time between 15 and 120 min ren et al 2008 it has also been reported that dechlorinating bacteria grow best in the range of 28 c to 37 c zhang et al 2000 hu et al 2013 and some are even thermophiles shimura et al 1999 matturro et al 2016 thus a short period of exposure to slightly higher temperature watery sediment is not a good heat conductor will not eliminate the dechlorinating bacteria in the upper part of the sediment core the injected hot w o emulsion will have similar transport behavior as these non wetting chlorinated compounds or hocs and will increase the contact probability between oil phase and hydrophobic contaminants saleh et al 2007 the higher temperature can also increase the mass transfer of these hocs between different phases di et al 2002 after a 30 min holding cool clean water is injected to displace the emulsion and trigger phase inversion it is expected that the w o emulsion will turn into an o w emulsion with much smaller oil particle usually less than 300 nm and a significant portion of hocs at the bottom part will be easily removed chang et al 2014 chang et al 2017 hocs concentration at the upper part may still be higher but dechlorinating bacteria could become predominant in this section then this treated layer of sediment about 30 cm thick becomes a bioactive capping material with different predominant bacteria at different horizons the hydrogen producing bacteria will generate dissolved hydrogen that will move upward to the upper section where dechlorinating bacteria can use it as an electron donor while aroclor 1254 and hcb act as electron acceptors in this study the biodegradability of aroclor 1254 and hcb was investigated using the taguchi method and two columns packed with real sediments were set up to test if this design can work in a real sediment environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 sediment preparation in order to test the recovery and biological dechlorination of aroclor 1254 and hcb on a consistent base simulated sediment samples were prepared for batch studies according to the size distribution of sediment samples from a heavily polluted section of er ren river err in southern taiwan the cumulative particle size distribution of real sediment samples is 5 4 47 5 57 1 94 1 97 2 98 8 and 100 0 for the size ranges of less than 2 μm 2 to 75 μm 75 to 106 μm 106 to 250 μm 250 to 425 μm 425 to 850 μm and 850 to 2000 μm respectively silica sands purchased from a local filter sand company were sieved acid washed then mixed according to the above size distributions that are larger than 75 μm for the portion of particle size less than 75 μm kaolinite and ultrafine glass beads rich sou technology co ltd kaohsiung taiwan were used these solids were then mixed with a specific growth medium see supporting information at a ratio of 1 9 aroclor 1254 and hcb were dissolved into hexane and then diluted by methanol to the designated concentration of 5 0 mg kg dry base before mixing with this prepared sediment in order to disperse the targeted pollutants evenly in this simulated sediment however for column study real sediment from err was used to pack two columns a control column and an experimental column 2 2 culture preparation in an anaerobic chamber coy laboratory products inc grass lake mi usa three sediment samples taken from err were mixed together and subsampled this subsample was then fully mixed with a sterile medium at a ratio of 1 1 as previously reported in literatures he et al 2006 robrock et al 2008 this mixture was left undisturbed for 10 min to let the bigger sediment particles settle down the supernatant was transferred to a 200 ml serum bottle for cell proliferation aroclor 1254 was dissolved into n hexane diluted by methanol and added into the growth medium to reach a final concentration of 1 0 mg kg dry base another one was prepared in the same way but hcb was added to reach 1 0 mg kg dry base concentration these bottles were kept under 30 c for 30 days for acclimation the cell density was checked and the concentrations of aroclor 1254 and hcb were analyzed to make sure the culture acclimation was successful 2 3 emulsion preparation in this study a food grade soybean oil emulsion was prepared for the ispie operation soybean oil cat no 0102010005 taiwan sugar corporation tainan taiwan was purchased from a local supermarket and all surfactants were nonionic surfactants span 80 tween 20 and tween 80 purchased from sigma aldrich 85548 p1379 and p1754 respectively sigma aldrich co llc st louis missouri usa soybean oil was mixed for 30 min with a mixture of span 80 tween 20 and tween 80 with a ratio of 1 2 1 water soybean oil and surfactant were mixed at a ratio of 44 1 10 if the mixture is heated up to above the phase inversion temperature of this system about 85 c the emulsion becomes a w o emulsion which was evidenced by an obvious shift in electric conductivity measurement after it cooled down the phase inversed and an o w emulsion was formed the oil droplet size can be less than 100 nm and it can easily travel through the pores in the sediments chang et al 2014 2 4 biological dechlorination batch studies two batch studies were conducted according to the taguchi method one on aroclor 1254 and the other on hcb an l9 34 orthogonal table was employed and four controlling factors were tested i e ph temperature soil organic matter and emulsion concentration table 1 the first three are often the principal environmental variables in a field remediation and the last one is to identify better concentration range of residual emulsions left in the sediment after an ispie operation the three different levels of each controlling factors are as listed in table 1 the initial concentrations of aroclor 1254 and hcb were both 5 0 mg kg which is within the range of historical monitoring results cornelissen et al 1997 booij et al 2003 all combinations of aroclor 1254 biological dechlorination tests were sampled on day 1 7 14 28 and 49 all combinations of hcb biological dechlorination tests were also sampled on the same days all samples were pretreated and analyzed by following the procedure described in the next section 2 5 sample pretreatment and analysis before analysis the samples were extracted by using an accelerated solvent extractor speed extractor e 916 büchi labortechnik ag switzerland extraction conditions are described below for aroclor 1254 the temperature was set at 100 c and the pressure at 120 bar extraction solvent was a mixture of 50 n hexane and 50 acetone 32293 and 34850 respectively sigma aldrich co llc st louis missouri usa the volumes of extraction cell and collection bottle were 20 and 60 ml respectively extraction cycle number was set at two the two cycles were identical 1 0 min for heating up 10 0 min for holding and 2 0

phillipsburg nj usa after being concentrated to 3 0 ml from about 40 ml of extract using a vacuum evaporator then the supernatant was transferred to a test tube containing 2 0 g of activated copper powder 200 mesh to remove any sulfide that might be present in the sample then the samples were cleaned up by passing through a column packed with activated silica gel 70 230 mesh r10040b silicycle inc quebec city quebec ca using n hexane the volume of each eluted sample was concentrated to 1 0 ml by using a rotary evaporator n 1100 series eyela tokyo rikakikai co ltd tokyo japan and then analyzed with a gas chromatography gc instrument clarus 580 perkinelmer waltham ma usa equipped with an electron capture detector ecd for aroclor 1254 quantification a 30 meter hp 5 column with 0 32

the sequence was identified by using the nucleotide blast function on the internet database of national center for biotechnology information ncbi 2 7 column study as shown in fig 1 real sediment from err was used to pack two 6 in diameter clear pvc tubes jumpanny enterprise ltd co taichung taiwan in order to observe the ispie process these columns were constructed in such a way that the emulsion can be injected from the bottom and evenly distributed at the inlet by using stainless screens and a layer of acid washed silica sand the length of the packed sediment was 30 cm and a valve was connected at the side with about 30 cm water laid on top of the sediment to maintain a constant water height after the injection of about 0 5 pv of 95 c w o emulsion the pump is stopped and on hold for 30 min the tube was then connected to clean water at room temperature then after the 30 min holding room temperature water was injected and the water was sampled at each pv these water samples were processed and analyzed in the same way described in the section of sample pretreatment and chemical analysis after 4 0 pv was injected the loosened sediment was pressed back to 30 cm and then sampled at day 0 7 14 21 and 42 to monitor the change of aroclor 1254 and hcb along with elapsed time sampling was performed by taking three tiny core samples using glass tubes and the three core samples were extruded and separated into top 10 cm middle 10 cm and bottom 10 cm then the sediments at the same section of the three different core samples were pooled together and then processed by following the same pretreatment and analytical procedures 3 results and discussion 3 1 biological dechlorination batch studies the results of batch studies of aroclor 1254 and hcb are as shown in fig 2 among all the experimental combinations test number 7 30 c ph 7 0 10 emulsion and 0 0 organic matter exhibited the best removal for both arochlor 1254 and hcb followed by test number 9 30 c ph 5 5 1 0 emulsion and 1 0 organic matter test number 1 10 c ph 5 5 0 0 emulsion and 0 0 organic matter exhibited the worst for both pollutants since the concentrations were quantified along with time biological dechlorination rate constants can also be obtained by plotting the natural log values of c c0 versus time the results were tabulated as shown in table 2 from this table one can see that the rankings for both series of tests are in good agreement it seems that temperatures did heavily impact both the removal and kinetic of aroclor 1254 and hcb strikingly the ratios of respective rate constants of hcb to aroclor 1254 k hcb k pcb for each test combination are quite consistent here the subscripted pcb represents aroclor 1254 the average of these ratios was 2 59 with a coefficient of variance at 13 6 these results indicated that the microbial communities for dechlorinating aroclor 1254 and hcb may be highly similar and responded to the different environmental variables in highly similar patterns in the literature researchers have demonstrated that different temperatures may favor certain anaerobic microorganisms to degrade pcbs via specific pathways for example for 2 3 4 6 chlorobiphenyl it has been reported that flanked meta dechlorination occurred between 8 and 34 c and 50 60 c while between 18 c and 34 c unflanked para dechlorination occurred they also proposed an optimal temperature range of 20 27 c wiegel and wu 2000 these observations are not exactly the same as our findings the major reasons might be that the microbial culture in this study was taken from err in southern taiwan with an average sediment temperature higher than 25 c according to our daily monitoring the monthly average temperatures of err sediment are usually above 25 c from april to october with at least one month above 30 c unpublished data by applying the taguchi statistical analysis to these data four influence charts of controlling factors were obtained as shown in fig 3 from panel a and b for the total removal of both aroclor 1254 and hcb according to taguchi s one half principle temperature and emulsion concentration could be deemed as the more significant controlling factors the trends of both aroclor 1254 and hcb are highly similar that is higher temperature and higher emulsion concentration yielded better removal for both aroclor 1254 and hcb even though soil organic matter contents and ph values are not that significant it seemed that higher organic matter content may result in higher removal and probably optimum ph range was between 7 0 and 8 5 the biological dechlorination rate constants can also be computed and compared as shown in panel c and d of fig 3 since k values included the trends of all five data points in the time scale these results may give a clearer picture of the impacts of controlling factors for aroclor 1254 and hcb higher temperature did show again better biological dechlorination rates for hcb the ratios of the degradation rates of k hcb at 20 c to k hcb at 10 c and k hcb at 30 c to k hcb at 20 c were 1 80 times and 1 36 times respectively these ratios for aroclor 1254 were 1 70 and 1 18 respectively thus hcb degradation seemed to be enhanced more than aroclor 1254 when temperature increased due to thermodynamic reasons higher chlorinated aromatics or aliphatics more oxidized species have been shown to have higher degradation rates than those less chlorinated counterparts for example perchloroethylene chlorine to carbon ratio cl c is 2 and trichloroethylene cl c 1 5 have higher biological reductive dechlorination rates than dichloroethylene cl c 1 0 and vinyl chloride cl c 0 5 rhee 1999 alvarez and illman 2006 similarly major chlorinated congeners of aroclor 1254 have a cl c at the range of 0 33 0 58 while hcb has a much higher cl c i e 1 0 thus the biological dechlorination rate of aroclor 1254 is expected to be lower than that of hcb for the temperature dependence it should be linked to the arrhenius equation describing the relationship between reaction rates and the temperature in this case since the contaminants were dissolved in methanol and then mixed with the simulated sediment it can be safely assumed that bioavailability is not a major issue for aroclor 1254 or hcb from table 2 the degradation rate constants at the same temperature can be averaged and a plot of lnk versus 1 t was generated the slopes for hcb and aroclor 1254 were 110 3 r 2 0 9982 and 33 0 r 2 0 9596 respectively thus it is very clear that the reaction rate of hcb indeed showed much higher dependency on temperature change see fig s1 in supporting information one may argue that this average value of k is not like that from tradition factorial experiment design changing one factor at a time however according to the taguchi method this average can represent the average of k s of all possible combinations of experimental conditions at the designated temperature even though ph values and organic matter were not as significant higher ph seemed to be better for hcb but not so for aroclor 1254 from fig 3c and d it is evident that ph and organic matter content have very minor effects on the degradation rate constants of aroclor 1254 fig 3d for hcb higher ph may counteract the acidifying effect caused by the formation of hcl and volatile fatty acids in this biological dechlorination process in the literatures tce and pce dechlorination extent at the range of ph 7 8 was higher than that at the range of ph 6 7 zhuang and pavlostathis 1995 thus more chlorinated hcb fully chlorinated may also show better dechlorination at a higher ph range than less chlorinated aroclor 1254 congeners about 4 to 7 chlorine per biphenyl molecule furthermore from these charts one can conclude that the optimum environmental conditions for removal is 30 c and high emulsion concentration 10 while intermediate organic matter content and neutral ph may not negatively impact the removal and biological dechlorination rates thus for the column study room temperature about 25 c should be fine for residual emulsion after recovery it is not necessary to flush the test sediment multiple times to minimize the residual emulsion for organic matter content the influence was minor but higher organic matter content may be better the average organic matter content in err sediment is about 0 65 which is the middle level of organic matter content in the batch study the values of ph in real err sediment were slightly higher than 7 0 and dropped to less than 7 0 after the start of biodegradation of soybean oil in the residual emulsions chang et al 2017 the two most influential factors temperature and emulsion concentration were examined for their interaction the results are as shown in fig 4 for aroclor 1254 for rate constants at high and medium concentration of emulsion there is no interaction for the whole range of temperature 10 c 30 c the two lines were parallel indicating there is no additivity between these two factors however for rate constants at low emulsion concentration the biological dechlorination rate at 20 c seemed to be enhanced much more than that at 30 c there are probably two major reasons the complex congener contents of aroclor 1254 and the different microbial communities or enzyme systems were employed at different temperatures wu et al investigated the dechlorination of added 2 3 4 0 6 chlorobiphenyl 2346 cb and residual aroclor 1260 in woods pond sediment housatonic river lenox ma usa the samples were incubated at 18 temperature points from 4 to 66 c in their study they found the optimal temperature ranges were 18 30 c and 20 27 c for 2346 cb and residual aroclor 1262 respectively wu et al 1997 it was also reported that hudson river sediment samples incubated at five different temperature points the results showed that aroclor 1242 was dechlorinated at 12 c and at 25 c but not at 37 c or above tiedje et al 1993 even though the overall removal cannot fully represent the biological dechlorination rates these studies still implied that the optimum temperature range for the best dechlorination rate for aroclor 1254 may be around 20 25 c thus the results of the dechlorination rates peaking at around 20 c was in good agreement with the previous studies for the enzyme systems and corresponding degradation pathways researchers also found that different dechlorination pathways may only happen at different temperature ranges i e flanked meta dechlorination at 8 to 30 c flanked para dechlorination at 12 to 34 c unflanked para dechlorination at 18 to 30 c and meta dechlorination of specific hepta and octa chlorobiphenyls at 50 to 60 c wu et al 1997 however for hcb there was no interaction between temperature and emulsion concentration at all indicating that within the tested ranges the trends of the influences of these two factors are independent a major reason for this difference between aroclor 1254 and hcb could be that hcb biological dechlorination have highly preferential biodegradation pathways and the optimal temperature has been reported to be around 30 c beurskens et al 1994 pavlostathis and prytula 2000 for the toxicity of the dechlorination products two points need to be addressed one is the total mass of aroclor 1254 decreased and the other is that less chlorinated congeners are less toxic here in this study even without gc ms detection 110 peaks appeared in gc ecd histograms from the histograms it was evident that total mass decreased peak areas were reduced for individual peaks and heavier congeners more chlorinated moved toward lighter congeners less chlorinated see fig s2 in supporting information under anaerobic conditions only less chlorinated pcbs were formed and most toxic pcb congeners are those with at least 4 chlorines per biphenyl molecules i e pcb 77 pcb 81 pcb 105 pcb 114 pcb 118 pcb 123 pcb 126 pcb 156 pcb 157 pcb 167 pcb 169 and pcb 189 miao et al 2001 thus as long as only less chlorinated pcb congeners formed the total toxicity of aroclor 1254 decreased 3 2 ispie operation for this experiment a 95 c hot w o emulsion was injected from the bottom of a column packed with the sediments from err fig 1 after holding for 30 min the emulsion was displaced by adding room temperature water after flushing 4 0 pv of water the sediments were sampled and aroclor 1254 and hcb were quantified the concentration changes of aroclor 1254 and hcb before and after the operation are as shown in fig 5 a removal percentage was defined as 1 cbefore ispie cafter ispie thus for aroclor 1254 the removal percentages for upper middle and lower sections were 41 6 56 4 and 76 7 respectively for hcb the removal percentages for upper middle and lower sections were 41 2 46 7 and 81 7 respectively these removal trends were exactly as the way they were expected the overall removal for aroclor 1254 and hcb were 58 2 and 56 5 respectively since the log k ow values of aroclor 1254 and hcb were 6 5 and 5 73 respectively unknown 2015 this result seemed to be reasonable if only the lower section of the sediment was assessed the removal percentages of aroclor 1254 and hcb would be as high as 76 7 and 81 7 respectively however in this study we emphasize on how to incorporate this approach with the following bird step instead of achieving highest removal using only ispie here we added about 0 8 pv of hot w o emulsion into the column and the sediment surface rose up to about 10 cm higher than the original surface indicating that the pore volume probably increased for about 60 thus the hot emulsion may only impact 50 of the sediment without heating up the upper section of the sediments too much the temperature of the top surface of the sediment was measured by an infrared thermometer and it was always lower than 35 c this temperature will not kill most of the dechlorinating bacteria during the 30 min holding time because the reported optimum growth temperature range for most dechlorinating microorganisms was 25 35 c beurskens et al 1994 pavlostathis and prytula 2000 wiegel and wu 2000 schmidt et al 2014 using w o emulsion is better than using surfactants alone because the w o emulsion in a porous media will have less sorption on the mineral surface due to its less hydrophilic surface than an o w emulsion since the oil surface is nearly nonpolar the w o emulsion would transport through the porous media more like hocs that were not wetting the surface of the soil grains but adsorbed on organic matters dissolved in water or other nonpolar liquids or formed globules within the pores when this w o emulsion started phase inversion changing into an o w emulsion hocs would be carried away by injected cool water or nutrient buffer researchers have shown that for a w o emulsion while being pushed through a microchannel the emulsion flow experienced a dynamic blocking phenomenon even though the water droplet diameter is much smaller than the diameter of the channel khasanov et al 2011 dynamic blocking effect is defined as the flow of the water in oil emulsion almost completely ceases with time despite the permanent pressure gradient is applied it is more manifest when flowing through a cylindrical microchannel a plane flow in a fracture or a capillary structure when injecting the cool water we did encounter a back pressure in the column but it was overcome by manually increasing the pressure in this study transparent polyvinyl tubes were used to construct the columns so that a lot of gas bubbles were observed in the real river sediments probably due to gas production of anaerobic microorganisms these bubbles expanded after the introduction of hot emulsion and this expansion of pore size actually eased the displacing movement of the hot w o emulsion in the column thus it should be feasible by using a diaphragm pump in a real world application researchers have tried to use surfactants to wash hcb from soils and sediments edwards et al 1994 sun et al 1995 chu and chan 2003 and found that surfactant at higher than critical micelle concentration can incorporate hydrophobic liquid into the micelle that has a small nonpolar inner sphere however the nonpolar ends of the surfactant molecules tend to adsorb onto sediment organic matter by hydrophobic hydrophobic interaction that apparently increases the fraction of som thus in this case hocs may get adsorbed more in the sediment instead of being washed off the major obstacle in hcb washing is its strong affinity to som which makes the release of hcb slow tong and yuan 2012 electrokinetic ek method has also been applied but hcb is naturally neutral and insoluble and thus has very low electromigration without some agent to facilitate ek itself is not an effective option li et al 2010 reported that 40 of hcb in sediments could be removed by using hydroxypropyl β cyclodextrin enhanced electrokinetic remediation method other researchers tried a combination of pd fe or cu fe to increase the removal to 60 wan et al 2010 wan et al 2011 abiotic dechlorination using micro or nano scale fe0 has been tried and the inherent obstacle is that other oxidants present in the sediments may compete for the electrons donated by fe0 this approach usually leads to the accumulation of less chlorinated intermediates such as tetra and tri chlorobenzenes which were still toxic and more mobile than hcb in the environment wängnerud et al 1995 photodechlorination of hcb has also been proposed but may not be applicable to river sediments in heavily polluted rivers like err thermal decomposition may require dredging and may cause polymerization of hcb to form polychlorinated biphenyls or other high molecular weight compounds gao et al 2008 a highly effective method is sediment vitrification which still requires dredging and also large installation capital to build and operate therefore ispie may offer a more cost effective and eco friendly approach for hcb contaminated sediments for physicochemical removal or immobilization of pcbs in sediment the technologies are very much the same like zero valent iron desorption or surfactant washing except for the application of biochar fly ash or activated carbon for capping or immobilization chuang et al 1995 zimmerman et al 2004 riaza frutos et al 2007 among them activated carbon amendment could be the best one however the applied activated carbons left in the river may cause negative effects on benthic organisms nybom et al 2012 janssen and beckingham 2013 recently we reported that a double emulsion can be used to recover bde 209 from river sediments mainly composed of decabrominated diphenyl ether with a log k ow value of about 10 0 for single operation this double emulsion could recover 43 1 10 9 mean standard deviation of weathered bde 209 and 53 1 19 8 mean standard deviation of fresh bde 209 chang et al 2017 comparing the recovery efficiency and the values of log k ow it is obvious that ispie could be a better approach based on the results in a batch study 3 3 column study the heat treatment of the sediment also impacted the microbial community after the ispie operation one column apart from the other two for column study was sacrificed and separated into three sections sediments from each section underwent dna extraction after pcr dgge processing the gel was imaged as shown in fig 6 the lower section showed only one band as expected and there were more than 10 bands in the upper section indicating the existence of abundant microbial populations however the middle section showed no band at all this was probably due to the temperature at the middle section being around 60 c and the exposure time was long enough to deactivate and even kill almost all microorganisms like a pasteurization procedure the monitoring results of the concentration change of aroclor 1254 and hcb at the three different sections were as shown in fig 7 comparing the concentrations on day 0 and 7 it seemed there was an increase this could be due to some loss happened during sample pretreatment at the first data point at the beginning of the biodegradation after ispie the higher residual emulsion concentration meant a higher surfactant level the surfactant may affect the surface of silica gel used in the cleanup step during sample pretreatment thus lower recovery of aroclor 1254 and hcb may happen at the first data point starting from day 7 this effect was alleviated because the surfactants were also degradable and a clear trend of decrease appeared based on the concentrations on day 35 and day 7 the removal percentages were obtained the removal percentages at the upper section of aroclor 1254 and hcb were 26 4 and 27 9 respectively while at the middle 28 4 and 31 2 respectively it is quite astonishing that the microbial community rebuilt within a few days and reached similar removals the lower section showed minimal removal that is 3 5 and 3 9 of aroclor 1254 and hcb respectively this low removal was probably due to the high activity of predominant hydrogen producing bacteria at this section and probably low population density of dechlorination microorganisms overall within 35 days 64 6 of aroclor 1254 and 62 7 of hcb have been removed if this ispie bird procedure can be repeated every 35 days and the removal rates can be maintained within 3 5 months higher than 95 removal of both contaminants is probably achievable therefore this remediation scheme for hoc contaminated sediments is quite feasible for taiwan and other areas that have similar hydrogeographic conditions by integrating ispie heat selection of microbial populations and subsequent bird 4 conclusion in this study a new approach was successfully demonstrated for remediation of river sediments contaminated by two hocs aroclor 1254 and hcb this approach integrated ispie heat selection of microbial populations and bird in a batch biodegradation test within 49 days the removals of aroclor 1254 and hcb were 58 and 91 and half lives were 38 7 and 14 1 days respectively single operation of ispie can remove more than 56 of these contaminants and within 35 days subsequent bird further removed nearly 30 of the contaminants at the upper and middle sections of the tested sediment columns however when applying this technology to the field temperature an inherent field condition and residual emulsion concentrations an engineering controllable parameter may heavily influence the results thus site specific characteristic is still an indispensable factor in sediment remediation design acknowledgement this study was funded by the research project supported by the taiwan epa the views or opinions expressed in this article

1607,this paper employed a one dimensional large deformation model in consideration of the coupling of mechanical consolidation and solute transport to study the transport of contaminants in a largely deformed aquitard an analytical solution has been derived to describe the drawdown variation in a largely deformed aquitard which is subjected to abrupt hydraulic head decline in adjacent confined aquifers the pore water flux and void ratio variation were obtained on the basis of the analytical solution the equation for transient contaminant flux was solved by the finite difference method a hypothetical case study was done to explore the effect of consolidation on the contaminant transport in a largely deformed aquitard the transit time of contaminant transport in the aquitard is mainly determined by the hydraulic conductivity thickness partitioning coefficient void ratio and effective diffusion coefficients of aquitard as well as the drawdown in the adjacent confined aquifer the impact of delayed drainage on the contaminant transport in the largely deformed aquitard is mainly controlled by two factors the transient water flow and the decrease of aquitard thickness in the process of aquitard consolidation the former increases the breakthrough time of contaminant transport in the aquitard and the latter gives rise to an opposite case with its effect decreasing with increasing contaminant partitioning coefficient for soil particles sorption a larger deformation which may be induced by a larger thickness higher specific storativity of aquitard or a larger drawdown of the adjacent confined aquifer and a lower hydraulic conductivity of aquitard cause a more significant impact of delayed drainage on the contaminant transport in an aquitard keywords aquitard solute transport delayed drainage hydrogeological parameters large strain consolidation 1 introduction groundwater pollution occurs from shallow aquifers to deep aquifers owing to the considerable exacerbation of groundwater exploitation and pollution foster and chilton 2003 the aquifers usually alternate with aquitards of relatively low permeability in between cihan et al 2011 zhuang et al 2015 these aquitards consist of fine sediments such as clay and silt in the low energy depositional environments and they are naturally hydrogeological barriers that protect regional aquifers from contamination neuzil 1986 yan et al 2001 delayed drainage of water in an aquitard occurs when the water head in adjacent aquifers declines due to the groundwater exploitation konikow and neuzil 2007 li and zhou 2015 this study focuses on an analysis of the contaminant transport in an aquitard involved with large strain consolidation caused by delayed drainage the aquitards may usually extend over large areas covering the entire basins and alluvial plains i e the south dakota aquifer system in the united states and the yangtze river delta in china konikow and neuzil 2007 zhou et al 2013 and some of them may even extend under the sea guo and li 2014 the compressibility of aquitards is often much larger than that of aquifers leake 1990 a considerable amount of water can be released from the storage of aquitards during the process of hydraulic head decline the hydraulic conductivity of aquitard is usually 10 8 m s and the permeability varies over a large range from 10 15 to 10 23 m2 neuzil 1994 once the contaminants enter an aquitard they cannot be extracted easily due to the high porosity and low permeability of aquitard layers as well as the bonding force between the contaminant ions and the negatively charged clay surface barbour et al 2012 therefore the contaminated aquitards become a long term source of contamination for the adjacent aquifers hendry et al 2004 liu and ball 2002 significant efforts have been made by hydrologists to study the important role of aquitards in the subsurface transport over the past several decades hendry et al 2004 yong et al 2015 zhan et al 2009b the migration of a nonreactive solute in layered porous media was studied under well controlled laboratory conditions with the injection of a tracer into a thin sand layer bounded by silt layers sudicky et al 1985 zhan et al 2009a proposed an analytical solution of two dimensional reactive solute transport in an aquifer aquitard system the advection longitudinal and vertical dispersion first order irreversible decay and linear sorption were taken into account in the aquifer transport barbour et al 2012 described and defined the limits of advection and diffusion dominated transport for a conservative tracer in a saturated unconsolidated and clay rich aquitard the above studies were based on the assumption that the water flow in an aquitard was steady which has not considered the influence of delayed drainage of the aquitard the solute transport in a deformable medium is an interesting problem since soil deformation occurs due to the dissipation of excess pore water pressure and the transient nonlinear water flow several studies have indicated that the volume change exerts an impact on the species mass transport in the deformable porous media smiles 2000 and smith 2000 provided an elaborate formulation to describe the dispersion advection solute transport in a deformable saturated soil peters and smith 2002 proposed the formulation of contaminant transport in deformable clay and studied the differences of contaminant transport process under small scale and large scale consolidation conditions the results showed that the breakthrough time of contaminant transport is significantly shorter in a large strain analysis than that in a small strain analysis peters and smith 2002 using the terzaghi s consolidation theory alshawabkeh et al 2005 and alshawabkeh and rahbar 2006 presented a model for the description of the advective diffusive transport in the consolidating subaqueous sediment with eulerian coordinates zhang et al 2012 developed an advection diffusion equation in an unsaturated and deforming porous medium based on the one dimensional biot consolidation theory li et al 2017 studied the effect of delayed drainage on the contaminant transport in an aquitard of small deformation the consolidation theory in these studies assumed that the hydraulic parameters of the aquitard are constant based on the works of peters and smith 2002 a sophisticated large deformation model which takes into account the non linear constitutive material properties relating to the void ratio i e the compressibility hydraulic conductivity and effective diffusion coefficient was employed to study the contaminant transport in a clayey landfill liner lewis et al 2009a zhang et al 2013 proposed a one dimensional coupled consolidation and solute transport model for a nearly saturated porous medium which has taken into consideration the finite strain and the geometry and material nonlinearity of deformable clay liner the consolidation of clay layers considered in aforementioned studies was almost caused by the external loads as groundwater in confined aquifers is extracted the hydraulic head in the confined aquifer declines and water is released from the adjacent aquitard leading to the deformation of aquitard there have been many studies investigating the delayed drainage phenomenon li et al 2016 neuman and gardner 1989 zhou et al 2013 defined the delay index characterizing the delay time of the hydraulic response in an aquitard the water flow in an aquitard would be transient owing to the delayed drainage of water in the aquitard for the aquitard subjected to large strain consolidation which refers to the newly formed sedimentary soft soil the variation of hydraulic properties is nonlinear during the aquitard consolidation gibson et al 1981 poskitt 1969 xie and leo 2004 in this case the small strain consolidation theory would not be suitable if the deformation of aquitards is larger than 10 of their thickness li et al 2018 olson and ladd 1979 this paper aims to develop an advection diffusion equation for the description of the contaminant transport in an aquitard suffering from delayed drainage the governing equation has taken into consideration the non linear constitutive material properties characterizing the hydraulic conductivity specific storativity void ratio variation and transient flow during the delayed drainage process a parametric study has been done to examine the contaminant transport in a deformable aquitard by considering the hydraulic head decline in adjacent confined aquifers 2 model formulations 2 1 coordinate system usually the small strain consolidation theory is established in the eulerian coordinate system in which the governing equation involves an integration over a time varying domain the representative element volume rev is assumed to contain the same soil particles and only the pore water is assumed to flow through the surfaces of rev in the lagrangian coordinate system gibson et al 1981 the advantage of the governing equation of soil consolidation in the lagrangian coordinate system is that it can be integrated with respect to a fixed domain the lagrangian coordinate a and time t are independent variables and the convective coordinate ξ is a variable depending on a and t the chain rule of differentiation can be used to derive the transformation rules between the convective and lagrangian coordinates gibson et al 1981 1 ξ a 1 e 1 e 0 1 n 0 1 n where e 0 e a 0 is the initial void ratio e e a t is void ratio at the time t n 0 is the initial porosity n is the porosity at the time t 2 2 consolidation equation the aquitards of relatively low permeability usually alternate between the aquifers of relatively high permeability in a multi layered aquifer system the scalar equivalent hydraulic conductivity of each aquifer is larger than that of the aquitard by at least two orders of magnitude konikow and neuzil 2007 then the seepage in the aquitard follows the path of least resistance that is water flows downward in the vertical direction and enters the aquifer with a sharp refraction at the boundary between the aquitard and the aquifer therefore it is reasonable to assume the water flow in the confining layer to be approximately vertical neuman and witherspoon 1969 assuming that the soil particles and pore water are incompressible the equations describing the one dimensional large strain consolidation of saturated clay in the lagrangian coordinate system are given as follows gibson et al 1981 1 equation for vertical equilibrium of soil mass is 2 σ a g s e γ w 1 e 0 where σ is the total vertical stress g s is the specific gravity of solid particles and γ w is the unit weight of water 2 equation for vertical equilibrium of pore water is 3 u a u hs u h p a where u is the total pore pressure u hs is the hydrostatic pore water pressure u h is the long term departure in the pore pressure from the hydrostatic pore water pressure related to a hydraulic gradient across the soil layer and p is the excess pore water pressure 3 equilibrium of the fluid phase requires 4 u hs a 1 e γ w 1 e 0 4 principle of effective stress is 5 σ σ u where σ is the effective vertical stress 5 the darcy s law is 6 e 1 e v w v s k v 1 e 0 γ w 1 e u a 1 e γ w 1 e 0 k v 1 e 0 γ w 1 e u h a p a where v w and vs are the velocities of the pore water and soil particle relative to the datum plane k v is the vertical permeability coefficient of clay note that eq 6 shows that the darcy flow velocity can be decomposed into two components which are the velocity arising from a long term hydraulic gradient across the consolidating soil layer and the velocity induced by the excess pore water pressure gradients in the soil layer 6 continuity equation of pore water flow is 7 a e 1 e v w v s 1 1 e 0 e t 7 governing equation for consolidation is just the combination of eqs 2 7 8 1 γ w a k v 1 e 0 1 e p a 1 1 e 0 e t it is assumed that the nonlinear variations of the compressibility and permeability of soil in the process of large strain consolidation respectively follow eq 9 davis and raymond 1965 and eq 10 xie and leo 2004 and the creep of soil is not taken into account here 9 m v 1 1 1 e de dσ 1 e 1 e 0 m v const 10 k v k v 0 1 e 1 e 0 2 where c v0 k v0 m v1 γ w is the consolidation coefficient of the aquitard k v0 is the initial hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard and m v and m v1 are the coefficients of volume compressibility of the aquitard at small and large strain states respectively the relationship between void ratio e and total pore water pressure u is 11 1 e 1 e 0 exp m v 1 σ u σ 0 where σ 0 is the initial effective vertical stress from eq 9 the relationship between the void ratio and the effective stress can be obtained as 12 e a t 1 e 0 exp m v 1 σ σ 0 0 1 13 e a 0 1 e 0 0 exp m v 1 σ 0 σ 0 0 1 where e 0 0 e 0 0 and σ 0 0 σ 0 0 are the initial void ratio and initial effective stress at the top surface of aquitard respectively the decrease of excess pore water pressure equals the increase of drawdown if the total stress is constant therefore the relation between the void ratio e and the drawdown s namely the decline of hydraulic head of aquitard is given as 14 1 e 1 e 0 exp s s s where s s m v1 γ w is the specific storativity of aquitard substituting eqs 9 10 and 14 into eq 8 gives 15 c v 0 2 s a 2 s s s a 2 s t eq 15 describes the drawdown variation in a largely deformed aquitard which is subjected to a hydraulic head decline in adjacent confined aquifers furthermore eq 15 uses a lagrangian coordinate system that moves with the solid phase which allows a moving boundary to be modeled appropriately and it also takes into account non linear constitutive material properties thus eq 15 will be used for the large deformation analysis in this study 2 3 solute transport equation the governing equation for solute transport through a soil layer with one dimensional large deformation consolidation has been derived in terms of lagrangian coordinates a t by peters and smith 2002 eq 45 in the reference 16 a d e 1 e 0 1 e 2 c a v d c a e 1 e 0 c t 1 1 e 0 c s t where d is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient it is given by the sum of effective diffusion and mechanical dispersion coefficients the mechanical dispersion becomes significant when the péclet number exceeds 50 the péclet number which is calculated by pe vd d where v is the pore water flow the soil particle diameter d is 2 10 3 m and the effective molecular diffusivity d is 1 10 9 m2 s perkins and johnston 1963 fig 24 in the reference is generally 10 when k v of porous medium is 10 6 m s the hydraulic conductivity of aquitard is usually 10 8 m s which results in a péclet number less than a unity hence it is reasonable to assume that the dispersion is controlled by molecular diffusion in a consolidating aquitard the effective molecular diffusion coefficient d e in an aquitard is defined to be the product of the free diffusion of solute in the pore fluid d 0 and the tortuosity factor τ which accounts for the irregular path that the diffusing molecules must go through the pore space acar and haider 1990 it is reasonable to take d e as a constant because the uncertainty in terms of the range of τ is in the same order of consolidation induced change of d e lewis et al 2009a c s is the contaminant concentration in the solid phase c is the contaminant concentration in the fluid phase v d n v w vs v dh v dc is the darcy flow velocity in an aquitard v w is the pore fluid velocity and v w vs denotes the relative velocity of pore fluid v dh is the darcy flow velocity arising from the long term hydraulic gradient across an aquitard v dc is the darcy flow velocity due to the solid consolidation to solve eq 16 a constitutive relationship between the mass of contaminant absorbed on the solid phase and the contaminant concentration in the pore water is required the sorption is here assumed to vary in a linear isotherm and reversible manner that is 17 c s ρ s k d c where ρ s is the density of solid phase k d is the partitioning coefficient of contaminant this assumption of linear sorption is valid in the condition of relatively low concentration substituting eq 17 into eq 16 leads to 18 a d e 1 e 0 1 e 2 c a v d c a e ρ s k d 1 e 0 c t on the basis of the assumptions of small deformation e e 0 and constant material properties k v s s eq 18 is simplified to be the following solute transport equation 19 a d c a v d n c a 1 1 n ρ s k d n c t the governing equation i e eq 19 of the small deformation model derived in this study is compared with the models proposed by other researchers the small deformation models previously employed by peters and smith 2002 and alshawabkeh et al 2005 are shown respectively as follows 20 a d c a v d n v s c a 1 1 n ρ s k d n c t 21 a d c a 1 d c v v d n c a 1 1 n ρ s k d n c t as compared with eq 19 eq 20 includes an additional term namely the advective component of contaminant resulting from the movement of soil particles eq 21 includes the advective component of contaminant caused by the porosity change in the positive direction however in the situation where the deformation of aquitards is small the terms i e d c v 1 and vs v d n are relatively insignificant li et al 2017 lewis et al 2009a the model without considering the effect of delayed drainage solves the transport problem for a rigid porous medium and it is a standard advection dispersion equation 22 a d c a v dh n c a 1 1 n ρ s k d n c t a comparison of the models of solute transport which are formulated based on the small and large strain theories has been made eq 19 sd model does not consider the variation of the void ratio and hydraulic parameters as compared with eq 18 ld model eq 22 is for a rigid porous medium nd model and it does not consider the transient flow in the aquitard as compared with eq 19 3 model application and validation 3 1 problem description a multi layered aquitard confining aquifer system was considered in this study this system consists of an aquitard of infinite lateral spread bounded by two aquifers lying respectively above and below the confining layer fig 1 the lagrangian coordinate a is considered to be positive in the vertical downward direction and the origin is located at the top of aquitard it is assumed that water in the above unconfined aquifer or surface water has been contaminated due to the excessive emissions the hydraulic head declines in the confined aquifer due to the groundwater exploitation to clearly evaluate the effect of delayed drainage on the contaminant transport in the aquitard a hypothetical case is considered under the condition that the hydraulic head of confined aquifer declines the scale of the breakthrough time of contaminant transport is much larger than that of drawdown change and the drawdown of pumping aquifer would not increase endlessly hence it is reasonable to assume that the drawdown in the confined aquifer is nearly constant the hydraulic parameters of the aquitard used in the subsequent analysis are based on a study of land subsidence by xie and leo 2004 and lewis et al 2009b the initial void ratio was assumed to be constant e 0 constant with the self weight of soil in the thin aquitard being neglected the dispersion coefficient adopted in the following analysis are based on a recent study of solute transport in composite liners by foose et al 2002 and alshawabkeh and rahbar 2006 table 1 summarizes the input parameters of the aquitards in three cases of different partitioning coefficients 3 2 boundary conditions and computation method the initial and boundary conditions for the consolidation and solute transport are introduced in eqs 23 25 it is assumed that the hydraulic head does not change in the aquifer above the aquitard and the hydraulic head declines by ϕ in the confined aquifer underlying the aquitard eq 15 is solved with the following initial and boundary conditions 23 s a 0 0 0 a l 24 s 0 t 0 t 0 25 s l t ϕ t 0 the water flow in the mass transport equations was worked out by an analytical method with the solution of the water velocity and void ratio at any time and at any position the solution of the large strain consolidation theory was facilitated by the variable transformation variable separation and fourier transform the drawdown variation in the aquitard was derived with the control equation i e eq 15 initial and boundary conditions eqs 23 25 26 s a t 1 s s ln 1 1 exp s s ϕ a l 2 π n 1 1 n n e n 2 π 2 c v 0 t l 2 sin nπa l with the combination of eqs 12 14 and 26 the void ratio in the aquitard can be obtained as 27 e a t e 0 1 e 0 1 exp s s ϕ a l 2 π n 1 1 n n e n 2 π 2 c v 0 t l 2 sin nπa l according to the darcy s law the flow rate per unit horizontal area at the position a and at the time t can be expressed as 28 v d a t k v 0 1 e 1 e 0 2 s a 1 e 0 1 e substituting s a t into eq 28 then leads to 29 v d a t c v 0 1 exp s s ϕ l 1 2 n 1 1 n e n 2 π 2 c v 0 t l 2 cos nπa l water in the unconfined aquifer is supposed to be contaminated due to the long term human activities to simplify the calculation the contaminant concentration in the unconfined aquifer is assumed to be constant and set to be one unit the lower boundary of aquitard is thought to be freely draining that is fluid drips freely from the aquitard to the confined aquifers this assumption gives a mass conserving boundary condition thereby the initial and boundary conditions for the species mass transport equations are as follows 30 c 0 0 a l t 0 31 c c 0 a 0 t 0 32 c a 0 a l t 0 the equations describing the species mass transport eqs 18 and 19 are solved by the explicit finite difference scheme eqs 18 and 19 are parabolic alshawabkeh and rahbar 2006 and the numerical technique of a centered finite difference in space and forward finite difference in time is used li et al 2017 the two equations are then discretized in space and time and the boundary conditions are imposed as well the discretized sizes of space and time need to be adjusted to achieve a better convergence in the simulation at each point i and each time step j the water flow velocity is identified by an analytical solution of water flow in the aquitard and it is then substituted into the discretized equations 3 3 results and analyses the drawdown in the largely deformed aquitard was calculated by eq 15 for a comparison with the small deformed case in which the small strain theory was based on the terzaghi s one dimensional consolidation theory zhou et al 2013 the spatial distribution of drawdown at different time t 1 2 3 4 years and its variation at different positions a 1 3 5 7 9 m were represented in fig 2a and b respectively the results show that the drawdown obtained by the large strain theory is less than that obtained by the small strain theory however the prediction difference between the large and small strain consolidation theories is insignificant the dissipation of excess pore water pressure in the large strain consolidation is slower than that in the small strain consolidation the pore water releases more quickly at a relatively high a value the drawdown increases initially and arrives at a stable value eventually at a given position the variation rate of drawdown is large at the beginning and then gradually decreases to zero it is also interesting to note that the drawdown increases with the increasing a value at a given moment the spatial distribution of void ratio at different time t 1 2 3 4 years and variation of void ratio at different positions a 1 3 5 7 9 m in the aquitard were calculated using the large strain consolidation theory the results are shown in fig 3a and b respectively it is found that the void ratio decreases gradually with the time and finally tends to be stable according to the effective stress principle the void ratio in the aquitard decreases during the consolidation process with the excess pore water pressure dissipating and the effective stress increasing the variation rate of void ratio is relatively large at the beginning and then decreases to zero the final void ratio change is greater at a larger a value the variation rate of void ratio at the bottom of the aquitard is 0 18 and it is zero at the upper surface of the aquitard due to the zero increase of effective stress in the process of aquitard consolidation the flow velocity in the aquitard was respectively calculated with the large strain and small strain consolidation theories the spatial distribution of flow velocity at different time t 1 2 3 4 years and its variation at different positions a 1 3 5 7 9 m were plotted in fig 4 the results show that the flow velocity at the upper part of the aquitard is smaller than that at the lower part and the difference narrows as the consolidation proceeds the flow velocity in the aquitard reaches a steady state finally the flow velocity is zero at the beginning in the upper part of aquitard and increases until it reaches a stable value the flow velocity increases at first in the lower part of aquitard and then decreases to a stable value the flow velocity determined by the large strain theory is less than that obtained by the small strain theory with the difference increasing with the value of a coordinate also the flow velocity difference is large at the upper part of aquitard and it is small at the lower part of aquitard during the consolidation process because the hydraulic conductivity of aquitard decreases with the decreasing void ratio the flow velocity calculated by the large strain theory is less than that given by the small strain theory before the end of aquitard consolidation in this study different models ld model sd model and nd model are solved and compared the ld sd and nd models are studied by eqs 18 19 and 22 respectively fig 5 gives the data of contaminant transit time in the form of breakthrough curves obtained from these models the results indicate that the contaminant transit time is very long due to the low permeability of aquitard the sorption of soil particles makes it even longer the delayed drainage influences the contaminant transport in the aquitard obviously for an easy comparison the breakthrough time is defined as the time at which the contaminant reaches a predetermined concentration of 0 01c 0 the starting point of horizontal axis in fig 5b is not set to be zero for a clear comparison the contaminant transit time predicted by the sd model which has considered the transient flow not considered the void ratio variation in the consolidation process is larger than that predicted by the nd model the discrepancy of breakthrough time between the sd and nd models which is about 3 years varies inconsiderably with the partitioning coefficient of sorption the contaminant transport predicted by the ld model is found to be faster than that predicted by the nd model at a relatively small k d value about 0 2 ml g in the concerned case the breakthrough time determined by the ld and nd models are respectively 94 and 96 6 years with k d 0 ml g and they are respectively 147 8 and 148 4 years for k d 0 2 ml g the contaminant transit time is larger for the ld model than that for the nd model at a relatively large k d value larger than 0 2 ml g in the study case the breakthrough time determined by the ld and nd models are respectively 228 6 and 226 1 years with k d 0 5 ml g and they are respectively 363 3 and 355 7 years with k d 1 ml g the difference in the breakthrough time given by the ld and nd models narrows at first and then widens with the increasing k d value and so does the difference of the breakthrough time predicted by the ld and sd models the results obtained from both ld and sd models for the case of sorption k d 0 5 ml g are very close fig 5b 3 4 parametric study the contaminant transport in an aquitard is governed by the soil and reactive contaminant transport characteristics including the consolidation and effective diffusion coefficients the results show that delayed drainage of water in the aquitard can significantly influence the contaminant transport through an aquitard the effect of the hydraulic conductivity specific storativity aquitard thickness void ratio and effective diffusion coefficient on the breakthrough time of contaminant transport in an aquitard involving delayed drainage is studied a comparison analysis between the ld and nd models is also conducted the difference in the breakthrough times dbt of solute transport in an aquitard which is given by the ld and nd models is examined as well the impact of k v and s s on the contaminant transport in an aquitard experiencing delayed drainage is described in fig 6 with the other parameters kept to be the same as those given in table 1 the sorption of soil particles is not considered in fig 6a k d 0 and k d 1 ml g in fig 6b the results have distinctly demonstrated the effect of delayed drainage on the contaminant transport in an aquitard at different k v 0 0315 0 0630 m y and s s 0 01 0 02 m 1 values the breakthrough time is shorter given a larger s s which leads to a larger deformation of the aquitard if the sorption is not considered and it is longer at a larger s s when k d 1 ml g the dbt becomes large with the increasing s s that is the effect of delayed drainage on the contaminant transport in an aquitard is more significant given a larger s s value it is also found that a higher k v value causes shorter breakthrough time the increase of k v decreases the dbt in other words the effect of delayed drainage on the contaminant transport in an aquitard is more significant at a small k v value fig 7 describes the effect of the variation of confined aquifer drawdown on the contaminant transport in an aquitard suffering from delayed drainage provided that k d 0 and k d 1 ml g the results show that the breakthrough time is greatly influenced by the drawdown in the confined aquifer in fig 7a the breakthrough time is 53 3 and 94 years according to the prediction of ld model respectively at φ 10 and 20 m correspondingly the dbt is 1 and 2 6 years in fig 7b the breakthrough time is 209 9 and 363 3 years and the dbt is 7 6 and 11 years respectively at φ 10 and 20 m the dbt is shorter at a larger φ value which causes a larger deformation for the aquitard as well as a greater hydraulic gradient in the aquitard the breakthrough time is also predicted by the ld and nd models in consideration of varying thickness for the aquitard l with other parameters maintained to be the same as those in table 1 the results in fig 8 show that a larger l value as given by the nd model causes longer breakthrough time which is respectively 96 6 and 396 9 years at l 10 and 20 m the aquitard consolidation accelerates the contaminant transport and the increasing l value tends to enhance the acceleration trend if the sorption is not considered the delayed drainage decelerates the contaminant transport and the increasing l value tends to mitigate the deceleration trend when k d 1 ml g in fig 8a the dbt is 2 6 and 11 7 years respectively for the thickness of 10 and 20 m in fig 8b the dbt is 7 6 and 29 3 years respectively for the thickness of 10 and 20 m the difference of breakthrough time between the ld and nd models increases significantly with the increasing l value which causes a larger deformation for the aquitard and a smaller hydraulic gradient in the aquitard figs 9 and 10 depict the effect of d and e 0 on the breakthrough time and dbt given that k d 0 and k d 1 ml g respectively fig 9 shows that a higher d value tends to accelerate the contaminant transport the variation of d value exerts little influence on the dbt 2 6 years if the sorption is not taken into account the results in fig 10 show that the dbt which is respectively 7 6 4 8 3 5 years at d 0 01 0 02 0 03 m2 s decreases with the increasing d value when k d 1 ml g the breakthrough time increases when k d 0 but it is an opposite case when k d 1 ml g as e 0 increases the pore water flow velocity is large at a relatively small void ratio but the transport deceleration of sorption weakens with the increase of void ratio the variation of e 0 has little impact on the dbt i e 2 4 2 6 years if the sorption is not taken into consideration the dbt is respectively 7 6 4 1 and 2 2 years for e 0 1 1 5 2 when k d 1 ml g which reduces with the increasing e 0 4 further discussion fig 2 indicates that the excess pore water pressure obtained by the large strain theory dissipates more quickly than that predicated by the small strain theory in addition it is also found that the velocity given by the large strain theory is smaller than that calculated by the small strain theory presented in the study of li et al 2017 such observations are due mainly to that the nonlinear variation of the hydraulic conductivity and compressibility coefficient has been considered in the process of aquitard consolidation the thickness variation of consolidated aquitard was considered in the contaminant transport model by the void ratio variation of aquitard as compared with the results of li et al 2017 the thickness variation of aquitard has a significant impact on the contaminant transport in the aquitard the decrease of aquitard thickness accelerates the contaminant transport through the aquitard while the partitioning coefficient is relatively small when the partitioning coefficient is adequately large the thickness variation of aquitard has little influence and the contaminant transport will be mainly affected by the transient flow in the process of aquitard consolidation fig 5 this may therefore give rise to an error in the prediction of the contaminant transit time without consideration the void ratio variation or thickness variation in the deformed aquitard it is seen from figs 5 10 that the transit time of contaminant transport in the aquitard is mainly determined by the hydraulic conductivity thickness partitioning coefficient void ratio and effective diffusion coefficients of aquitard as well as the drawdown in the adjacent confined aquifer the transit time of contaminant transport would increase with decreasing hydraulic conductivity and effective diffusion coefficients of aquitard and confined aquifer drawdown it also increases with increasing partitioning coefficient and thickness of aquitard the transit time of contaminant transport increases with increasing void ratio at a relatively small value of partitioning coefficient and it decreases with increasing void ratio at a relatively large value of partitioning coefficient it is also found that the impact of delayed drainage on the contaminant transport in the largely deformed aquitard is mainly controlled by two factors one is the transient water flow in the process of aquitard consolidation which increases the breakthrough time of contaminant transport in the aquitard the other is the decrease of aquitard thickness i e the length of contaminant transport path caused by the aquitard consolidation which decreases the breakthrough time of contaminant transport in the aquitard and its effect reduces with the increase of contaminant partitioning coefficient k d the impact of delayed drainage on the contaminant transport would be more significant given larger specific storativity and thickness of aquitard larger drawdown in the adjacent confined aquifer and smaller hydraulic conductivity of aquitard the void ratio and effective diffusion coefficient enhance the impact of delayed drainage on the contaminant transport with a relatively large partitioning coefficient and little impact is expected given a relatively small partitioning coefficient 5 summary and conclusions this study proposed a coupled consolidation contaminant transport analysis to numerically investigate the transport of contaminants through a largely deformed aquitard the governing equation of drawdown has been put forward to describe the one dimensional large strain consolidation of saturated and homogeneous clays an analytical solution has been derived to describe the variation of drawdown in a largely deformed aquitard which is subjected to an abrupt hydraulic head decline in the adjacent confined aquifer meaningful results have been obtained with consideration of the compressibility and permeability variation of aquitard which is related to the void ratio decrease in the consolidation process of aquitard the pore water flux and the variation of void ratio were examined by an analytical approach the governing equation of transient contaminant flux was solved simultaneously by the finite difference method to analyze the effect of consolidation on the contaminant transport a hypothetical aquitard of large deformation was brought into focus in this study finally the effect of variation of the hydraulic conductivity specific storativity void ratio thickness of aquitard and effective diffusion coefficient on the breakthrough time of contaminant transport in an aquitard involved with delayed drainage was studied based on these studies the following findings are summarized as follows the breakthrough time of contaminant transport in an aquitard is very long due to its low permeability and the sorption of soil particles the transit time of contaminant transport in the aquitard is mainly determined by the hydraulic conductivity thickness partitioning coefficient void ratio effective diffusion coefficients of aquitard and the drawdown in the adjacent confined aquifer the delayed drainage of water in an aquitard is expected to accelerate the contaminant breakthrough in an aquitard given a relatively small k d but it is an opposite case given a relatively large k d the impact of delayed drainage on the contaminant transport in the largely deformed aquitard is mainly affected by two factors the transient water flow in the process of aquitard consolidation and the decrease of aquitard thickness the former increases the breakthrough time of contaminant transport in the aquitard and the latter decreases the breakthrough time with its impact decreasing with the increase of contaminant partitioning coefficient k d the decreasing k v and increasing l and φ are able to notably increase the breakthrough time the increase of l φ s s would lead to a larger deformation for the aquitard a larger aquitard deformation and a lower k v value enhance the effect of delayed drainage on the contaminant transport in an aquitard the variation of d and e 0 exerts little influence on the dbt if the sorption of soil particles is not considered the dbt decreases with the increasing d and e 0 when the partitioning

1607,this paper employed a one dimensional large deformation model in consideration of the coupling of mechanical consolidation and solute transport to study the transport of contaminants in a largely deformed aquitard an analytical solution has been derived to describe the drawdown variation in a largely deformed aquitard which is subjected to abrupt hydraulic head decline in adjacent confined aquifers the pore water flux and void ratio variation were obtained on the basis of the analytical solution the equation for transient contaminant flux was solved by the finite difference method a hypothetical case study was done to explore the effect of consolidation on the contaminant transport in a largely deformed aquitard the transit time of contaminant transport in the aquitard is mainly determined by the hydraulic conductivity thickness partitioning coefficient void ratio and effective diffusion coefficients of aquitard as well as the drawdown in the adjacent confined aquifer the impact of delayed drainage on the contaminant transport in the largely deformed aquitard is mainly controlled by two factors the transient water flow and the decrease of aquitard thickness in the process of aquitard consolidation the former increases the breakthrough time of contaminant transport in the aquitard and the latter gives rise to an opposite case with its effect decreasing with increasing contaminant partitioning coefficient for soil particles sorption a larger deformation which may be induced by a larger thickness higher specific storativity of aquitard or a larger drawdown of the adjacent confined aquifer and a lower hydraulic conductivity of aquitard cause a more significant impact of delayed drainage on the contaminant transport in an aquitard keywords aquitard solute transport delayed drainage hydrogeological parameters large strain consolidation 1 introduction groundwater pollution occurs from shallow aquifers to deep aquifers owing to the considerable exacerbation of groundwater exploitation and pollution foster and chilton 2003 the aquifers usually alternate with aquitards of relatively low permeability in between cihan et al 2011 zhuang et al 2015 these aquitards consist of fine sediments such as clay and silt in the low energy depositional environments and they are naturally hydrogeological barriers that protect regional aquifers from contamination neuzil 1986 yan et al 2001 delayed drainage of water in an aquitard occurs when the water head in adjacent aquifers declines due to the groundwater exploitation konikow and neuzil 2007 li and zhou 2015 this study focuses on an analysis of the contaminant transport in an aquitard involved with large strain consolidation caused by delayed drainage the aquitards may usually extend over large areas covering the entire basins and alluvial plains i e the south dakota aquifer system in the united states and the yangtze river delta in china konikow and neuzil 2007 zhou et al 2013 and some of them may even extend under the sea guo and li 2014 the compressibility of aquitards is often much larger than that of aquifers leake 1990 a considerable amount of water can be released from the storage of aquitards during the process of hydraulic head decline the hydraulic conductivity of aquitard is usually 10 8 m s and the permeability varies over a large range from 10 15 to 10 23 m2 neuzil 1994 once the contaminants enter an aquitard they cannot be extracted easily due to the high porosity and low permeability of aquitard layers as well as the bonding force between the contaminant ions and the negatively charged clay surface barbour et al 2012 therefore the contaminated aquitards become a long term source of contamination for the adjacent aquifers hendry et al 2004 liu and ball 2002 significant efforts have been made by hydrologists to study the important role of aquitards in the subsurface transport over the past several decades hendry et al 2004 yong et al 2015 zhan et al 2009b the migration of a nonreactive solute in layered porous media was studied under well controlled laboratory conditions with the injection of a tracer into a thin sand layer bounded by silt layers sudicky et al 1985 zhan et al 2009a proposed an analytical solution of two dimensional reactive solute transport in an aquifer aquitard system the advection longitudinal and vertical dispersion first order irreversible decay and linear sorption were taken into account in the aquifer transport barbour et al 2012 described and defined the limits of advection and diffusion dominated transport for a conservative tracer in a saturated unconsolidated and clay rich aquitard the above studies were based on the assumption that the water flow in an aquitard was steady which has not considered the influence of delayed drainage of the aquitard the solute transport in a deformable medium is an interesting problem since soil deformation occurs due to the dissipation of excess pore water pressure and the transient nonlinear water flow several studies have indicated that the volume change exerts an impact on the species mass transport in the deformable porous media smiles 2000 and smith 2000 provided an elaborate formulation to describe the dispersion advection solute transport in a deformable saturated soil peters and smith 2002 proposed the formulation of contaminant transport in deformable clay and studied the differences of contaminant transport process under small scale and large scale consolidation conditions the results showed that the breakthrough time of contaminant transport is significantly shorter in a large strain analysis than that in a small strain analysis peters and smith 2002 using the terzaghi s consolidation theory alshawabkeh et al 2005 and alshawabkeh and rahbar 2006 presented a model for the description of the advective diffusive transport in the consolidating subaqueous sediment with eulerian coordinates zhang et al 2012 developed an advection diffusion equation in an unsaturated and deforming porous medium based on the one dimensional biot consolidation theory li et al 2017 studied the effect of delayed drainage on the contaminant transport in an aquitard of small deformation the consolidation theory in these studies assumed that the hydraulic parameters of the aquitard are constant based on the works of peters and smith 2002 a sophisticated large deformation model which takes into account the non linear constitutive material properties relating to the void ratio i e the compressibility hydraulic conductivity and effective diffusion coefficient was employed to study the contaminant transport in a clayey landfill liner lewis et al 2009a zhang et al 2013 proposed a one dimensional coupled consolidation and solute transport model for a nearly saturated porous medium which has taken into consideration the finite strain and the geometry and material nonlinearity of deformable clay liner the consolidation of clay layers considered in aforementioned studies was almost caused by the external loads as groundwater in confined aquifers is extracted the hydraulic head in the confined aquifer declines and water is released from the adjacent aquitard leading to the deformation of aquitard there have been many studies investigating the delayed drainage phenomenon li et al 2016 neuman and gardner 1989 zhou et al 2013 defined the delay index characterizing the delay time of the hydraulic response in an aquitard the water flow in an aquitard would be transient owing to the delayed drainage of water in the aquitard for the aquitard subjected to large strain consolidation which refers to the newly formed sedimentary soft soil the variation of hydraulic properties is nonlinear during the aquitard consolidation gibson et al 1981 poskitt 1969 xie and leo 2004 in this case the small strain consolidation theory would not be suitable if the deformation of aquitards is larger than 10 of their thickness li et al 2018 olson and ladd 1979 this paper aims to develop an advection diffusion equation for the description of the contaminant transport in an aquitard suffering from delayed drainage the governing equation has taken into consideration the non linear constitutive material properties characterizing the hydraulic conductivity specific storativity void ratio variation and transient flow during the delayed drainage process a parametric study has been done to examine the contaminant transport in a deformable aquitard by considering the hydraulic head decline in adjacent confined aquifers 2 model formulations 2 1 coordinate system usually the small strain consolidation theory is established in the eulerian coordinate system in which the governing equation involves an integration over a time varying domain the representative element volume rev is assumed to contain the same soil particles and only the pore water is assumed to flow through the surfaces of rev in the lagrangian coordinate system gibson et al 1981 the advantage of the governing equation of soil consolidation in the lagrangian coordinate system is that it can be integrated with respect to a fixed domain the lagrangian coordinate a and time t are independent variables and the convective coordinate ξ is a variable depending on a and t the chain rule of differentiation can be used to derive the transformation rules between the convective and lagrangian coordinates gibson et al 1981 1 ξ a 1 e 1 e 0 1 n 0 1 n where e 0 e a 0 is the initial void ratio e e a t is void ratio at the time t n 0 is the initial porosity n is the porosity at the time t 2 2 consolidation equation the aquitards of relatively low permeability usually alternate between the aquifers of relatively high permeability in a multi layered aquifer system the scalar equivalent hydraulic conductivity of each aquifer is larger than that of the aquitard by at least two orders of magnitude konikow and neuzil 2007 then the seepage in the aquitard follows the path of least resistance that is water flows downward in the vertical direction and enters the aquifer with a sharp refraction at the boundary between the aquitard and the aquifer therefore it is reasonable to assume the water flow in the confining layer to be approximately vertical neuman and witherspoon 1969 assuming that the soil particles and pore water are incompressible the equations describing the one dimensional large strain consolidation of saturated clay in the lagrangian coordinate system are given as follows gibson et al 1981 1 equation for vertical equilibrium of soil mass is 2 σ a g s e γ w 1 e 0 where σ is the total vertical stress g s is the specific gravity of solid particles and γ w is the unit weight of water 2 equation for vertical equilibrium of pore water is 3 u a u hs u h p a where u is the total pore pressure u hs is the hydrostatic pore water pressure u h is the long term departure in the pore pressure from the hydrostatic pore water pressure related to a hydraulic gradient across the soil layer and p is the excess pore water pressure 3 equilibrium of the fluid phase requires 4 u hs a 1 e γ w 1 e 0 4 principle of effective stress is 5 σ σ u where σ is the effective vertical stress 5 the darcy s law is 6 e 1 e v w v s k v 1 e 0 γ w 1 e u a 1 e γ w 1 e 0 k v 1 e 0 γ w 1 e u h a p a where v w and vs are the velocities of the pore water and soil particle relative to the datum plane k v is the vertical permeability coefficient of clay note that eq 6 shows that the darcy flow velocity can be decomposed into two components which are the velocity arising from a long term hydraulic gradient across the consolidating soil layer and the velocity induced by the excess pore water pressure gradients in the soil layer 6 continuity equation of pore water flow is 7 a e 1 e v w v s 1 1 e 0 e t 7 governing equation for consolidation is just the combination of eqs 2 7 8 1 γ w a k v 1 e 0 1 e p a 1 1 e 0 e t it is assumed that the nonlinear variations of the compressibility and permeability of soil in the process of large strain consolidation respectively follow eq 9 davis and raymond 1965 and eq 10 xie and leo 2004 and the creep of soil is not taken into account here 9 m v 1 1 1 e de dσ 1 e 1 e 0 m v const 10 k v k v 0 1 e 1 e 0 2 where c v0 k v0 m v1 γ w is the consolidation coefficient of the aquitard k v0 is the initial hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard and m v and m v1 are the coefficients of volume compressibility of the aquitard at small and large strain states respectively the relationship between void ratio e and total pore water pressure u is 11 1 e 1 e 0 exp m v 1 σ u σ 0 where σ 0 is the initial effective vertical stress from eq 9 the relationship between the void ratio and the effective stress can be obtained as 12 e a t 1 e 0 exp m v 1 σ σ 0 0 1 13 e a 0 1 e 0 0 exp m v 1 σ 0 σ 0 0 1 where e 0 0 e 0 0 and σ 0 0 σ 0 0 are the initial void ratio and initial effective stress at the top surface of aquitard respectively the decrease of excess pore water pressure equals the increase of drawdown if the total stress is constant therefore the relation between the void ratio e and the drawdown s namely the decline of hydraulic head of aquitard is given as 14 1 e 1 e 0 exp s s s where s s m v1 γ w is the specific storativity of aquitard substituting eqs 9 10 and 14 into eq 8 gives 15 c v 0 2 s a 2 s s s a 2 s t eq 15 describes the drawdown variation in a largely deformed aquitard which is subjected to a hydraulic head decline in adjacent confined aquifers furthermore eq 15 uses a lagrangian coordinate system that moves with the solid phase which allows a moving boundary to be modeled appropriately and it also takes into account non linear constitutive material properties thus eq 15 will be used for the large deformation analysis in this study 2 3 solute transport equation the governing equation for solute transport through a soil layer with one dimensional large deformation consolidation has been derived in terms of lagrangian coordinates a t by peters and smith 2002 eq 45 in the reference 16 a d e 1 e 0 1 e 2 c a v d c a e 1 e 0 c t 1 1 e 0 c s t where d is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient it is given by the sum of effective diffusion and mechanical dispersion coefficients the mechanical dispersion becomes significant when the péclet number exceeds 50 the péclet number which is calculated by pe vd d where v is the pore water flow the soil particle diameter d is 2 10 3 m and the effective molecular diffusivity d is 1 10 9 m2 s perkins and johnston 1963 fig 24 in the reference is generally 10 when k v of porous medium is 10 6 m s the hydraulic conductivity of aquitard is usually 10 8 m s which results in a péclet number less than a unity hence it is reasonable to assume that the dispersion is controlled by molecular diffusion in a consolidating aquitard the effective molecular diffusion coefficient d e in an aquitard is defined to be the product of the free diffusion of solute in the pore fluid d 0 and the tortuosity factor τ which accounts for the irregular path that the diffusing molecules must go through the pore space acar and haider 1990 it is reasonable to take d e as a constant because the uncertainty in terms of the range of τ is in the same order of consolidation induced change of d e lewis et al 2009a c s is the contaminant concentration in the solid phase c is the contaminant concentration in the fluid phase v d n v w vs v dh v dc is the darcy flow velocity in an aquitard v w is the pore fluid velocity and v w vs denotes the relative velocity of pore fluid v dh is the darcy flow velocity arising from the long term hydraulic gradient across an aquitard v dc is the darcy flow velocity due to the solid consolidation to solve eq 16 a constitutive relationship between the mass of contaminant absorbed on the solid phase and the contaminant concentration in the pore water is required the sorption is here assumed to vary in a linear isotherm and reversible manner that is 17 c s ρ s k d c where ρ s is the density of solid phase k d is the partitioning coefficient of contaminant this assumption of linear sorption is valid in the condition of relatively low concentration substituting eq 17 into eq 16 leads to 18 a d e 1 e 0 1 e 2 c a v d

contaminant caused by the porosity change in the positive direction however in the situation where the deformation of aquitards is small the terms i e d c v 1 and vs v d n are relatively insignificant li et al 2017 lewis et al 2009a the model without considering the effect of delayed drainage solves the transport problem for a rigid porous medium and it is a standard advection dispersion equation 22 a d c a v dh n c a 1 1 n ρ s k d n c t a comparison of the models of solute transport which are formulated based on the small and large strain theories has been made eq 19 sd model does not consider the variation of the void ratio and hydraulic parameters as compared with eq 18 ld model eq 22 is for a rigid porous medium nd model and it does not consider the transient flow in the aquitard as compared with eq 19 3 model application and validation 3 1 problem description a multi layered aquitard confining aquifer system was considered in this study this system consists of an aquitard of infinite lateral spread bounded by two aquifers lying respectively above and below the confining layer fig 1 the lagrangian coordinate a is considered to be positive in the vertical downward direction and the origin is located at the top of aquitard it is assumed that water in the above unconfined aquifer or surface water has been contaminated due to the excessive emissions the hydraulic head declines in the confined aquifer due to the groundwater exploitation to clearly evaluate the effect of delayed drainage on the contaminant transport in the aquitard a hypothetical case is considered under the condition that the hydraulic head of confined aquifer declines the scale of the breakthrough time of contaminant transport is much larger than that of drawdown change and the drawdown of pumping aquifer would not increase endlessly hence it is reasonable to assume that the drawdown in the confined aquifer is nearly constant the hydraulic parameters of the aquitard used in the subsequent analysis are based on a study of land subsidence by xie and leo 2004 and lewis et al 2009b the initial void ratio was assumed to be constant e 0 constant with the self weight of soil in the thin aquitard being neglected the dispersion coefficient adopted in the following analysis are based on a recent study of solute transport in composite liners by foose et al 2002 and alshawabkeh and rahbar 2006 table 1 summarizes the input parameters of the aquitards in three cases of different partitioning coefficients 3 2 boundary conditions and computation method the initial and boundary conditions for the consolidation and solute transport are introduced in eqs 23 25 it is assumed that the hydraulic head does not change in the aquifer above the aquitard and the hydraulic head declines by ϕ in the confined aquifer underlying the aquitard eq 15 is solved with the following initial and boundary conditions 23 s a 0 0 0 a l 24 s 0 t 0 t 0 25 s l t ϕ t 0 the water flow in the mass transport equations was worked out by an analytical method with the solution of the water velocity and void ratio at any time and at any position the solution of the large strain consolidation theory was facilitated by the variable transformation variable separation and fourier transform the drawdown variation in the aquitard was derived with the control equation i e eq 15 initial and boundary conditions eqs 23 25 26 s a t 1 s s ln 1 1 exp s s ϕ a l 2 π n 1 1 n n e n 2 π 2 c v 0 t l 2 sin nπa l with the combination of eqs 12 14 and 26 the void ratio in the aquitard can be obtained as 27 e a t e 0 1 e 0 1 exp s s ϕ a l 2 π n 1 1 n n e n 2 π 2 c v 0 t l 2 sin nπa l according to the darcy s law the flow rate per unit horizontal area at the position a and at the time t can be expressed as 28 v d a t k v 0 1 e 1 e 0 2 s a 1 e 0 1 e substituting s a t into eq 28 then leads to 29 v d a t c v 0 1 exp s s ϕ l 1 2 n 1 1 n e n 2 π 2 c v 0 t l 2 cos nπa l water in the unconfined aquifer is supposed to be contaminated due to the long term human activities to simplify the calculation the contaminant concentration in the unconfined aquifer is assumed to be constant and set to be one unit the lower boundary of aquitard is thought to be freely draining that is fluid drips freely from the aquitard to the confined aquifers this assumption gives a mass conserving boundary condition thereby the initial and boundary conditions for the species mass transport equations are as follows 30 c 0 0 a l t 0 31 c c 0 a 0 t 0 32 c a 0 a l t 0 the equations describing the species mass transport eqs 18 and 19 are solved by the explicit finite difference scheme eqs 18 and 19 are parabolic alshawabkeh and rahbar 2006 and the numerical technique of a centered finite difference in space and forward finite difference in time is used li et al 2017 the two equations are then discretized in space and time and the boundary conditions are imposed as well the discretized sizes of space and time need to be adjusted to achieve a better convergence in the simulation at each point i and each time step j the water flow velocity is identified by an analytical solution of water flow in the aquitard and it is then substituted into the discretized equations 3 3 results and analyses the drawdown in the largely deformed aquitard was calculated by eq 15 for a comparison with the small deformed case in which the small strain theory was based on the terzaghi s one dimensional consolidation theory zhou et al 2013 the spatial distribution of drawdown at different time t 1 2 3 4 years and its variation at different positions a 1 3 5 7 9 m were represented in fig 2a and b respectively the results show that the drawdown obtained by the large strain theory is less than that obtained by the small strain theory however the prediction difference between the large and small strain consolidation theories is insignificant the dissipation of excess pore water pressure in the large strain consolidation is slower than that in the small strain consolidation the pore water releases more quickly at a relatively high a value the drawdown increases initially and arrives at a stable value eventually at a given position the variation rate of drawdown is large at the beginning and then gradually decreases to zero it is also interesting to note that the drawdown increases with the increasing a value at a given moment the spatial distribution of void ratio at different time t 1 2 3 4 years and variation of void ratio at different positions a 1 3 5 7 9 m in the aquitard were calculated using the large strain consolidation theory the results are shown in fig 3a and b respectively it is found that the void ratio decreases gradually with the time and finally tends to be stable according to the effective stress principle the void ratio in the aquitard decreases during the consolidation process with the excess pore water pressure dissipating and the effective stress increasing the variation rate of void ratio is relatively large at the beginning and then decreases to zero the final void ratio change is greater at a larger a value the variation rate of void ratio at the bottom of the aquitard is 0 18 and it is zero at the upper surface of the aquitard due to the zero increase of effective stress in the process of aquitard consolidation the flow velocity in the aquitard was respectively calculated with the large strain and small strain consolidation theories the spatial distribution of flow velocity at different time t 1 2 3 4 years and its variation at different positions a 1 3 5 7 9 m were plotted in fig 4 the results show that the flow velocity at the upper part of the aquitard is smaller than that at the lower part and the difference narrows as the consolidation proceeds the flow velocity in the aquitard reaches a steady state finally the flow velocity is zero at the beginning in the upper part of aquitard and increases until it reaches a stable value the flow velocity increases at first in the lower part of aquitard and then decreases to a stable value the flow velocity determined by the large strain theory is less than that obtained by the small strain theory with the difference increasing with the value of a coordinate also the flow velocity difference is large at the upper part of aquitard and it is small at the lower part of aquitard during the consolidation process because the hydraulic conductivity of aquitard decreases with the decreasing void ratio the flow velocity calculated by the large strain theory is less than that given by the small strain theory before the end of aquitard consolidation in this study different models ld model sd model and nd model are solved and compared the ld sd and nd models are studied by eqs 18 19 and 22 respectively fig 5 gives the data of contaminant transit time in the form of breakthrough curves obtained from these models the results indicate that the contaminant transit time is very long due to the low permeability of aquitard the sorption of soil particles makes it even longer the delayed drainage influences the contaminant transport in the aquitard obviously for an easy comparison the breakthrough time is defined as the time at which the contaminant reaches a predetermined concentration of 0 01c 0 the starting point of horizontal axis in fig 5b is not set to be zero for a clear comparison the contaminant transit time predicted by the sd model which has considered the transient flow not considered the void ratio variation in the consolidation process is larger than that predicted by the nd model the discrepancy of breakthrough time between the sd and nd models which is about 3 years varies inconsiderably with the partitioning coefficient of sorption the contaminant transport predicted by the ld model is found to be faster than that predicted by the nd model at a relatively small k d value about 0 2 ml g in the concerned case the breakthrough time determined by the ld and nd models are respectively 94 and 96 6 years with k d 0 ml g and they are respectively 147 8 and 148 4 years for k d 0 2 ml g the contaminant transit time is larger for the ld model than that for the nd model at a relatively large k d value larger than 0 2 ml g in the study case the breakthrough time determined by the ld and nd models are respectively 228 6 and 226 1 years with k d 0 5 ml g and they are respectively 363 3 and 355 7 years with k d 1 ml g the difference in the breakthrough time given by the ld and nd models narrows at first and then widens with the increasing k d value and so does the difference of the breakthrough time predicted by the ld and sd models the results obtained from both ld and sd models for the case of sorption k d 0 5 ml g are very close fig 5b 3 4 parametric study the contaminant transport in an aquitard is governed by the soil and reactive contaminant transport characteristics including the consolidation and effective diffusion coefficients the results show that delayed drainage of water in the aquitard can significantly influence the contaminant transport through an aquitard the effect of the hydraulic conductivity specific storativity aquitard thickness void ratio and effective diffusion coefficient on the breakthrough time of contaminant transport in an aquitard involving delayed drainage is studied a comparison analysis between the ld and nd models is also conducted the difference in the breakthrough times dbt of solute transport in an aquitard which is given by the ld and nd models is examined as well the impact of k v and s s on the contaminant transport in an aquitard experiencing delayed drainage is described in fig 6 with the other parameters kept to be the same as those given in table 1 the sorption of soil particles is not considered in fig 6a k d 0 and k d 1 ml g in fig 6b the results have distinctly demonstrated the effect of delayed drainage on the contaminant transport in an aquitard at different k v 0 0315 0 0630 m y and s s 0 01 0 02 m 1 values the breakthrough time is shorter given a larger s s which leads to a larger deformation of the aquitard if the sorption is not considered and it is longer at a larger s s when k d 1 ml g the dbt becomes large with the increasing s s that is the effect of delayed drainage on the contaminant transport in an aquitard is more significant given a larger s s value it is also found that a higher k v value causes shorter breakthrough time the increase of k v decreases the dbt in other words the effect of delayed drainage on the contaminant transport in an aquitard is more significant at a small k v value fig 7 describes the effect of the variation of confined aquifer drawdown on the contaminant transport in an aquitard suffering from delayed drainage provided that k d 0 and k d 1 ml g the results show that the breakthrough time is greatly influenced by the drawdown in the confined aquifer in fig 7a the breakthrough time is 53 3 and 94 years according to the prediction of ld model respectively at φ 10 and 20 m correspondingly the dbt is 1 and 2 6 years in fig 7b the breakthrough time is 209 9 and 363 3 years and the dbt is 7 6 and 11 years respectively at φ 10 and 20 m the dbt is shorter at a larger φ value which causes a larger deformation for the aquitard as well as a greater hydraulic gradient in the aquitard the breakthrough time is also predicted by the ld and nd models in consideration of varying thickness for the aquitard l with other parameters maintained to be the same as those in table 1 the results in fig 8 show that a larger l value as given by the nd model causes longer breakthrough time which is respectively 96 6 and 396 9 years at l 10 and 20 m the aquitard consolidation accelerates the contaminant transport and the increasing l value tends to enhance the acceleration trend if the sorption is not considered the delayed drainage decelerates the contaminant transport and the increasing l value tends to mitigate the deceleration trend when k d 1 ml g in fig 8a the dbt is 2 6 and 11 7 years respectively for the thickness of 10 and 20 m in fig 8b the dbt is 7 6 and 29 3 years respectively for the thickness of 10 and 20 m the difference of breakthrough time between the ld and nd models increases significantly with the increasing l value which causes a larger deformation for the aquitard and a smaller hydraulic gradient in the aquitard figs 9 and 10 depict the effect of d and e 0 on the breakthrough time and dbt given that k d 0 and k d 1 ml g respectively fig 9 shows that a higher d value tends to accelerate the contaminant transport the variation of d value exerts little influence on the dbt 2 6 years if the sorption is not taken into account the results in fig 10 show that the dbt which is respectively 7 6 4 8 3 5 years at d 0 01 0 02 0 03 m2 s decreases with the increasing d value when k d 1 ml g the breakthrough time increases when k d 0 but it is an opposite case when k d 1 ml g as e 0 increases the pore water flow velocity is large at a relatively small void ratio but the transport deceleration of sorption weakens with the increase of void ratio the variation of e 0 has little impact on the dbt i e 2 4 2 6 years if the sorption is not taken into consideration the dbt is respectively 7 6 4 1 and 2 2 years for e 0 1 1 5 2 when k d 1 ml g which reduces with the increasing e 0 4 further discussion fig 2 indicates that the excess pore water pressure obtained by the large strain theory dissipates more quickly than that predicated by the small strain theory in addition it is also found that the velocity given by the large strain theory is smaller than that calculated by the small strain theory presented in the study of li et al 2017 such observations are due mainly to that the nonlinear variation of the hydraulic conductivity and compressibility coefficient has been considered in the process of aquitard consolidation the thickness variation of consolidated aquitard was considered in the contaminant transport model by the void ratio variation of aquitard as compared with the results of li et al 2017 the thickness variation of aquitard has a significant impact on the contaminant transport in the aquitard the decrease of aquitard thickness accelerates the contaminant transport through the aquitard while the partitioning coefficient is relatively small when the partitioning coefficient is adequately large the thickness variation of aquitard has little influence and the contaminant transport will be mainly affected by the transient flow in the process of aquitard consolidation fig 5 this may therefore give rise to an error in the prediction of the contaminant transit time without consideration the void ratio variation or thickness variation in the deformed aquitard it is seen from figs 5 10 that the transit time of contaminant transport in the aquitard is mainly determined by the hydraulic conductivity thickness partitioning coefficient void ratio and effective diffusion coefficients of aquitard as well as the drawdown in the adjacent confined aquifer the transit time of contaminant transport would increase with decreasing hydraulic conductivity and effective diffusion coefficients of aquitard and confined aquifer drawdown it also increases with increasing partitioning coefficient and thickness of aquitard the transit time of contaminant transport increases with increasing void ratio at a relatively small value of partitioning coefficient and it decreases with increasing void ratio at a relatively large value of partitioning coefficient it is also found that the impact of delayed drainage on the contaminant transport in the largely deformed aquitard is mainly controlled by two factors one is the transient water flow in the process of aquitard consolidation which increases the breakthrough time of contaminant transport in the aquitard the other is the decrease of aquitard thickness i e the length of contaminant transport path caused by the aquitard consolidation which decreases the breakthrough time of contaminant transport in the aquitard and its effect reduces with the increase of contaminant partitioning coefficient k d the impact of delayed drainage on the contaminant transport would be more significant given larger specific storativity and thickness of aquitard larger drawdown in the adjacent confined aquifer and smaller hydraulic conductivity of aquitard the void ratio and effective diffusion coefficient enhance the impact of delayed drainage on the contaminant transport with a relatively large partitioning coefficient and little impact is expected given a relatively small partitioning coefficient 5 summary and conclusions this study proposed a coupled consolidation contaminant transport analysis to numerically investigate the transport of contaminants through a largely deformed aquitard the governing equation of drawdown has been put forward to describe the one dimensional large strain consolidation of saturated and homogeneous clays an analytical solution has been derived to describe the variation of drawdown in a largely deformed aquitard which is subjected to an abrupt hydraulic head decline in the adjacent confined aquifer meaningful results have been obtained with consideration of the compressibility and permeability variation of aquitard which is related to the void ratio decrease in the consolidation process of aquitard the pore water flux and the variation of void ratio were examined by an analytical approach the governing equation of transient contaminant flux was solved simultaneously by the finite difference method to analyze the effect of consolidation on the contaminant transport a hypothetical aquitard of large deformation was brought into focus in this study finally the effect of variation of the hydraulic conductivity specific storativity void ratio thickness of aquitard and effective diffusion coefficient on the breakthrough time of contaminant transport in an aquitard involved with delayed drainage was studied based on these studies the following findings are summarized as follows the breakthrough time of contaminant transport in an aquitard is very long due to its low permeability and the sorption of soil particles the transit time of contaminant transport in the aquitard is mainly determined by the hydraulic conductivity thickness partitioning coefficient void ratio effective diffusion coefficients of aquitard and the drawdown in the adjacent confined aquifer the delayed drainage of water in an aquitard is expected to accelerate the contaminant breakthrough in an aquitard given a relatively small k d but it is an opposite case given a relatively large k d the impact of delayed drainage on the contaminant transport in the largely deformed aquitard is mainly affected by two factors the transient water flow in the process of aquitard consolidation and the decrease of aquitard thickness the former increases the breakthrough time of contaminant transport in the aquitard and the latter decreases the breakthrough time with its impact decreasing with the increase of contaminant partitioning coefficient k d the decreasing k v and increasing l and φ are able to notably increase the breakthrough time the increase of l φ s s would lead to a larger deformation for the aquitard a larger aquitard deformation and a lower k v value enhance the effect of delayed drainage on the contaminant transport in an aquitard the variation of d and e 0 exerts little influence on the dbt if the sorption of soil particles is not considered the dbt decreases with the increasing d and e 0 when the partitioning

1608,two important factors that affect groundwater contaminant persistence are the temporal pattern of contaminant source depletion and solute diffusion into and out of aquitards this study provides a framework to evaluate the relative importance of these effects on contaminant persistence with emphasis on the importance of thin aquitards we developed one dimensional 1d analytical solutions for forward and back diffusion in a finite domain with a no flux boundary using the method of images and demonstrated their applicability to measured data from three well controlled laboratory diffusion experiments with exponentially depleting sources we used both in situ aquitard solute concentrations and aquifer breakthrough curves for sorbing and non sorbing solutes the finite domain no flux boundary solutions showed better agreement with measured data than was available with semi infinite approaches with increasing discrepancy for dimensionless relative diffusion length scale beyond a critical threshold value z d 0 7 we also used a mass balance to demonstrate that the temporal pattern of contaminant source depletion controls the duration of solute mass accumulation in the aquitard as well as the total solute mass release back into the aquifer lower rates of source depletion result in a longer period of mass accumulation in the aquitard and later back diffusion initiation time the amount of solute mass stored in the aquitard increases with longer loading duration thereby contributing to overall longer contaminant persistence in aquifers this study entails widespread implications for anthropogenic waste and contamination sites which are all dependent on efficient and cost effective contaminant management strategies keywords diffusion back diffusion aquitard groundwater plume persistence 1 introduction diffusion is a fundamental element of solute transport that has recently gained considerable interest among groundwater researchers because of its role in long term persistence of contaminants ranging from industrial solvents radionuclides and landfill leachate chapman and parker 2005 xie et al 2013 zachara et al 2013 storage of contaminants that have diffused into low permeability zones such as aquitards or fractured rock matrix forward diffusion can attenuate concentrations in aquifers kumar 2008 lipson et al 2005 newell et al 2006 sudicky and frind 1982 while contaminant release from these low permeability zones back diffusion can greatly extend the period of water quality concern chapman et al 2012 seyedabbasi et al 2012 yang et al 2015 yang et al 2016 yang et al 2017a yang et al 2017b these processes are surprisingly well described by one dimensional 1d analytical models of solute diffusion and transport which have been shown to be consistent with laboratory and field observations over a very wide range of length 10 2 to 102 m and time scales 10 2 to 108 yrs yang et al 2017b many groundwater contaminant sources are of finite duration and the dynamics of the depletion of these sources has been shown to control the timing of the transition of aquitards from sinks to sources yang et al 2016 yang et al 2017a these works compared laboratory and field data to 1d diffusion models with both linear and exponential source depletion to assess contaminant persistence caused by the combined effects of gradual source depletion in the aquifer and subsequent back diffusion from the aquitard for mathematical simplicity those models treated the finite thickness of the diffusion domain as semi infinite however while those models were able to capture the general behavior the mass balance begins to fail for longer diffusion times as diffusing solutes reach the finite no flux boundary of the aquitard in other related studies yang et al 2015 2017b provide both measured and simulated data using a 1d diffusion model with a finite aquitard domain bounded by no flux in order to model advective transport in the aquifer as well as diffusion profiles in the aquitard in their study a step change concentration temporal boundary condition was employed this study seeks to fill a crucial gap in clear understanding of long term aquifer contaminant persistence from temporally finite depleting sources that diffuse into and out of aquitards of finite thickness bounded by no flux the combination of analytical and measurement based methods as presented here is essential for accurately evaluating environmental risks at contaminated sites carslaw and jaeger 1959 provided analytical solutions for diffusion in semi infinite and finite domains subject to an exponentially depleting source in this study we improved on previously described forward and back diffusion models yang et al 2015 yang et al 2016 yang et al 2017a yang et al 2017b by applying the method of images bear 2013 for finite thickness diffusion domains together with source strength functions ssfs falta et al 2005a falta et al 2005b that describe the depletion of finite solute sources moreover the solutions are validated by the results of three laboratory diffusion experiments using solute tracer tests based on in situ electrical conductivity measurement ecm for bromide and light reflection visualization lrv for new coccine red dye these solutes enable evaluation of both non sorbing and sorbing solute diffusion in a finite thickness kaolinite domain the analytical solutions are also validated by comparison with measured flux average concentration breakthrough curves btcs the specific objectives of this work were 1 to provide insights on the effects of exponentially decreasing sources and back diffusion on long tails in solute breakthrough 2 to develop a 1d analytical solution with exponential source depletion for a finite thickness clay domain with a no flux boundary using the method of images 3 to offer appropriate and reliable in situ measured data on solute diffusion including spatial profiles and btcs and 4 to validate the analytical solutions using measured data furthermore we used a transferable approach to assess the back diffusion initiation time and plume evolution during three stages based on relative contributions of source depletion and back diffusion from the aquitard we also provide guidance for the application of analytical solutions to determine when semi infinite and finite solutions can be used without errors based on a relative diffusion length scale 2 analytical modeling fig 1 features a conceptual diagram that illustrates the aquifer aquitard systems studied here both layers are homogenous and isotropic and are separated by a horizontal interface the aquifer groundwater flows at a constant rate in the x direction and the finite aquitard thickness l is characterized by the z direction the initial contaminant concentration is zero in both the aquifer and aquitard a contaminant source is introduced and then exponentially depleted by groundwater flow concentration gradients in the z direction may result in forward diffusion from the aquifer to the aquitard back diffusion then occurs when source depletion decreases aquifer contaminant concentrations such that the diffusive flux in the z direction becomes positive back diffusion therefore represents the release of contaminants back into the aquifer aquitard degradation reactions and transverse diffusion are not considered in this study 2 1 exponential source depletion the contaminant mass discharge from a source can change over time due to mass depletion and is strongly linked to plume evolution this source dynamic is defined as a ssf a power law model can be used to describe the relative concentration of contaminant leaving the source zone in this case the source mass and source strength is linked

classified into three cases of ssf corresponding to γ 0 source concentration step change 0 5 linear source depletion and 1 exponential source depletion note that the analytical solution for γ 0 is widely used while those for γ 1 and 0 5 are not well known for solute transport this source depletion model can generally be applied to decaying sources that follow a power law behavior in order to reflect real field conditions for source strength behavior at contaminated sites this study focused on exponential source depletion γ 1 brown et al 2012 chen and jawitz 2008 chen and jawitz 2009 zhu

injected at z 0 and a no flux boundary located at a distance l in the z direction there are an infinite number of hypothetical image sources along the z axis from both upper and lower boundaries which are characterized by no flux and c c 0 exp βt respectively these image sources account for the model prediction of lost mass beyond the finite domain yang et al 2015 yang et al 2017b the analytical

high values if substantial solute diffusion has occurred compared to the thickness l 3 experimental methods 3 1 laboratory flow chamber tests in order to validate the analytical solutions eqs 5 and 8 presented in this study three diffusion experiments were conducted in a well controlled two dimensional flow chamber with exponentially decreasing sources of sorbing and non sorbing solutes new coccine r 5 with β 0 13 d 1 in experiment 1 and bromide r 1 with β 0 13 and 0 07 d 1 in experiments 2 and experiment 3 the flow chamber akin to the one described in yang et al 2016 was assembled from aluminum and glass with dimensions of 28 12 1 2 cm fig 2 the flow chamber was filled with porous media to create a 4 cm aquifer 20 30 mesh accusand uminin corp overlain by an aquitard 3 cm of kaolinite fluka for experiment 1 fig 2a and 7 cm of kaolinite for experiments 2 and 3 fig 2b and saturated with water displacement experiments were conducted with inflow controlled by a piston pump fluid metering corp q pump and a constant head outlet boundary exponentially depleting sources were generated by a continuously stirred tank reactor cstr which maintained a specified volume v 230 ml for experiments 1 and 2 and 460 ml for experiment 3 the cstr effluent concentration c t is defined by schmidt 1998 which is similar to eq 2 with β q v parameters specific to a cstr the initial concentration of bromide and new coccine c 0 was equal to 10 g l and 200 mg l and exponentially decreased toward 0 g l over a period of 40 days a steady flow rate q 0 02 ml min was imposed on all three experiments with pore volume pv 40 3 ml and an estimated mean travel time of 1 4 days from the flow chamber inlet to the outlet 3 2 in situ measurement of aquitard and aquifer concentration for experiment 1 spatio temporal changes in red dye tracer concentration in the 3 cm clay layer were assessed by lrv to provide optimal lighting conditions for proper imaging a light source fancierstudio 1000 w 5500 k was checked with a luxmeter in a dark room and photographed once per pv with a canon eos 350d with an aperture of 13 exposure time of 1 s and iso of 100 to allow for the assessment of concentrations and their respective color intensities the collected images were split into red blue and green channels color intensity changes were determined using the green channel which is sensitive to red hue variations through the color processing software imagej details on this process can be found elsewhere yang et al 2014 for experiments 2 and 3 the bromide concentration profile in the 7 cm kaolinite layer was non destructively determined by in situ ecm steel electrodes were fixed into one side of the flow chamber in two columns and seven rows 1 cm apart pore water electrical

electrical conductivity at time t without and with tracer at the initial concentration c 0 yang et al 2016 provides details of this technique for all experiments the influent and effluent concentrations of new coccine and bromide were determined by in situ ecm continuously for effluent new coccine concentrations below the ecm detection limit of 1 mg l were measured by absorbance using a microplate reader biotek synergy h1 hybrid reader the goodness of fit between the measured and simulated values was determined using the coefficient of efficiency e legates and mccabe 1999 nash and sutcliffe 1970 which has a range of negative infinity to 1 values closest to 1 indicate the highest agreement level between the measured and simulated data 13 e 1 0 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where p is the simulated data o represents the measured data and o describes the measured mean 4 results and discussion 4 1 exponential source depletion concentrations of dye and bromide measured at the flow chamber inlet are shown in fig 3 these cstr generated influent trends are consistent with exponential source depletion eq 2 with β 0 13 d 1 for experiments 1 and 2 and 0 07 d 1 for experiment 3 the measured and simulated influent concentrations for the three experiments showed excellent correspondence with e 0 99 4 2 concentration profile in the low permeability zone dye concentration profiles measured by lrv in the 0 03 m kaolinite layer are shown in fig 4a at seven time steps 3 7 13 20 27 33 and 40 pvs after the initial source release after 13 pvs the dye diffusive penetration distance at c c 0 0 01 was only approximately 0 02 m because of a relatively high retardation factor r 5 the measured dye concentration at the sand kaolinite interface z 0 decreased throughout the duration of the experiment this reduction was due to the decreasing influent concentration in the sand layer while the concentration at z 0 025 m increased during the same period the simulated concentration profile using both the semi infinite analytical solution eq 3 and the finite thickness analytical solution eq 5 showed good fits to the measured data at pvs 3 7 and 13 with e 0 98 that is during the first 13 pvs of experiment 1 there was no difference in the simulated concentrations using eqs 3 and 5 fig 4a left panel however the difference in the effect of a finite versus semi infinite low permeability layer began to manifest after 20 pvs at z 0 025 m fig 4a as the experiment continued the two model solutions diverged and only the finite domain model matched the experimental data when the semi infinite domain solution was used e decreased to 0 90 after 27 pvs and further decreased to 0 36 after 40 pvs better fits with the measured profiles were obtained when the finite domain solution was employed with e 0 90 for the last two profiles fig 4a the bromide concentration profiles measured from the ecm in the 0 07 m kaolinite layer for experiments 2 and 3 are shown in fig 4b and c at four time steps 13 20 27 and 33 pvs the bromide penetration distance at 13 pvs was about three times greater than for new coccine due to both the lower retardation factor r 1 and a higher molecular diffusion coefficient d 1 7 10 4 m2 d such that the bromide effective diffusion coefficient d is 23 times larger than that of new coccine table 1 the simulated concentrations from eqs 3 and 5 showed an observable difference at z 0 06 m after 13 pvs and this difference gradually increased through the 33 pvs of exponential source depletion the measured bromide concentrations at z 0 for experiment 2 sharply decreased to c c 0 0 by 33 pvs due to a higher rate of exponential source depletion β 0 13 d 1 in the sand layer while the reduction of bromide concentration at z 0 for experiment 3 β 0 07 d 1 was noticeably and expectedly slower than that of experiment 2 agreement between the measured data and eq 3 weakened over time with e 0 02 at 33 pvs for experiment 2 and 1 38 for experiment 3 in contrast the simulated profiles using eq 5 showed overall better fits with the measured concentration profiles at all times with mean e 0 78 for experiment 2 and 0 40 for experiment 3 4 3 plume tailing behavior and mass balance the measured and simulated effluent concentrations for experiments 1 2 and 3 fig 5a illustrate three different btc tailing behaviors as shown by yang et al 2016 the btcs can be classified based on a three stage framework stage 1 is aquifer source depletion coupled with forward diffusion into aquitards stage 2 is continued source depletion but with back diffusion from the aquitard and stage 3 is a fully depleted source and only back diffusion for the current experiments stage 1 comprised exponential source depletion eq 2 and stage 2 involved superposition of source depletion eq 2 and back diffusion eqs 7 and 8 the back diffusion initiation time 5 pvs for experiments 1 and 2 and 10 pvs for experiment 3 which indicates when stage 2 starts was determined by assessing a change in the amount of solute mass remaining in the kaolinite based on a mass balance calculation from the inlet and outlet fig 5b c and d note that the mass calculations in fig 5b c and d were corrected for the mean travel time 1 pv from the inlet to the outlet of the flow chamber in order to easily compare the results in fig 3 for all experiments after stage 2 initiation the measured concentrations were higher than the simulated values when considering only the source depletion model eq 2 fig 5a mean e 0 82 this discrepancy is due to back diffusion from the kaolinite layer thus enhancing btc tailing when back diffusion was added to the simulated results the finite domain solution eq 8 showed better fits mean e 0 98 with the measured values for all experiments than the semi infinite solution eq 7 which underestimates the influent concentrations mean e 0 96 the magnitude of underestimation can be expected to increase with a longer loading time or a thinner aquitard layer yang et al 2015 yang et al 2016 as discussed below for experiments 1 and 2 the measured concentration for new coccine and bromide effluent during stage 1 showed good agreement with the source depletion simulation using eq 2 fig 5a the source depletion rate was equal in both experiments β 0 13 d 1 however after 6 pvs during stage 2 the two patterns of tailing behavior diverged with higher measured concentrations of both solutes than simulated from source depletion eq 2 during stage 1 the new coccine and bromide mass stored in the kaolinite layer increased from forward diffusion but back diffusion initiation during stage 2 resulted in slow mass reduction in the kaolinite layer in both experiments 1 and 2 fig 5b and c the maximum ratios of mass remaining in the kaolinite to the total mass injected into the aquifer at the end of stage 1 were approximately 8 3 6 mg to total 46 mg for new coccine and 12 278 2 mg to total 2300 mg for bromide the relatively smaller percentage 8 of new coccine mass storage is due to the smaller effective diffusion coefficient than that of bromide resulting from higher retardation and a smaller molecular diffusion coefficient table 1 these two factors have a great impact on mass storage as well as mass release the solute mass in the kaolinite layer decreased to 1 of its maximum value which occurred at the beginning of stage 2 after 74 pvs in experiment 1 compared to only 11 pvs in experiment 2 despite the same source depletion rate in the sand layer the difference in the portion of total accumulated mass and mass release rate from the kaolinite layer between experiments 1 and 2 during stage 1 resulted in a marked divergence between new coccine and bromide btc tails in stage 2 fig 5a for experiment 3 where the source depletion rate β 0 07 d 1 was approximately half that of experiment 2 the measured effluent concentration decline was correspondingly slower fig 5a with later back diffusion initiation at approximately 10 pvs fig 5d because stage 1 in experiment 3 was twice as long as that of experiment 2 the solute mass stored in the clay was 1 4 times larger than that of experiment 2 in addition after initiation of stage 2 a further 17 pvs were required for the solute mass in the clay to be reduced to 1 of the maximum value this result is 1 5 times slower than that of experiment 2 because of the slower source depletion in the sand layer relative to that of experiment 2 4 4 error analysis with relative diffusion length scale the measured data for all experiments conducted with different diffusion length clay thickness and timescales can be synthesized with the dimensionless relative diffusion length z d eq 11 the values of z d for all experiments presented here ranged from 0 4 to 1 5 the correspondence between the finite domain solutions for the concentration profile and btc eqs 5 and 8 and the semi infinite solutions eqs 3 and 7 is shown in fig 6 as a function of z d for β 0 07 0 13 and 0 26 d 1 note that the finite and semi infinite solutions are considered as the measured and simulated results when computing coefficient of efficiency e in fig 6 for z d 0 7 the simulated data using both solutions are nearly identical e 1 for all β values considered indicating that semi infinite solutions can be used despite the presence of finite domains when z d 0 7 the calculated e values between both solutions dramatically decrease with a decrease in β suggesting the use of semi infinite solutions is not recommended for z d 0 7 these results are consistent with those for concentration profiles fig 4 and btcs fig 5 for example for experiments 2 and 3 at 13 pvs z d 0 87 0 7 which is consistent with the observation that the finite eq 5 solution matched the measured data better than the semi infinite solution eq 3 fig 4b and c as the experiment time increased and z d grew increasingly larger than the threshold of 0 7 the errors from the semi infinite solutions increased for the simulated btcs the error patterns between eqs 7 and 8 are similar to the simulated concentration profiles in which e decreases sharply when z d 0 7 however the threshold of 0 7 may increase as the value of β increases when β 0 26 d 1 the simulated data using both solutions are still identical until z d 0 8 5 insight on contaminant persistence field scale factors that affect contaminant tailing and plume persistence include complex heterogeneity solute chemical and physical characteristics and source depletion dynamics once aquifer contaminants have been in contact with low permeability zones for a certain period of time stage 1 regardless of source strength it is difficult to avoid the occurrence of back diffusion stage 2 importantly contaminant properties are a dominating factor in the occurrence of long plume tailing contaminants with a small diffusion coefficient and high retardation result in small mass accumulation low diffusion length in the aquitard and a relatively small back diffusion flux to the aquifer albeit with a relatively long tail yang et al 2015 it should also be noted that the source depletion rate β also influences plume tailing under the common scenario of exponentially depleting aquifer contaminant sources back diffusion can be expected to initiate at c c 0 0 43 yang et al 2017a this is the transition from stage 1 to stage 2 and the time to which this condition corresponds is determined by β as β decreases the duration of stage 1 becomes longer with increased the relative mass of contaminant accumulated in the aquitard however back diffusion flux from the aquitard in stage 2 also decreases with β because the aquifer aquitard concentration gradient decreases with β therefore lower β is associated with increased solute mass in the aquitard from longer duration stage 1 and decreased diffusive flux from the aquitard during stage 2 resulting in an extended back diffusion period note that aquifer source depletion dynamics may change due to remedial activities which have not been considered in this study 6 conclusions we have shown that one dimensional analytical solutions are able to describe the forward and back diffusion processes and transitions real aquitards are finite and may occur in alternating layers that generate no flux boundaries and the solutions we provide in this work matched measured data and confirmed with mass balance much better than approaches that use semi infinite approximations especially when zd 0 7 the finite analytical solutions provided here enable accurate mass balance estimation including storage and release of mass from low permeability layers and back diffusion initiation time throughout the duration of all dissolution and diffusion stages the results of this study fill an important gap in understanding natural attenuation processes emphasizing source zone architecture with potential broad applicability to other areas of subsurface environmental concern such as contaminated sites landfill clay liners and nuclear waste storage facilities the results of this study can be applied to field settings that are characterized by a layered system of sand and clay leading to symmetrical boundary conditions with a diffusion domain and a no flux boundary yang et al 2017a yang et al 2017b specifically a clay layer bound by two sand layers will exemplify this condition which matches the solutions for a finite diffusion domain used in this study in these cases one half of the aquitard thickness may be considered additionally the finite domain solution can be representative of natural no flux conditions such as when overlying nonporous bedrock the analytical solutions presented in this study enable relatively straightforward assessment of storage and release of finite solute sources from finite aquitards and the dimensionless formulations enable transferability to any geological time or length scale acknowledgements this

1608,two important factors that affect groundwater contaminant persistence are the temporal pattern of contaminant source depletion and solute diffusion into and out of aquitards this study provides a framework to evaluate the relative importance of these effects on contaminant persistence with emphasis on the importance of thin aquitards we developed one dimensional 1d analytical solutions for forward and back diffusion in a finite domain with a no flux boundary using the method of images and demonstrated their applicability to measured data from three well controlled laboratory diffusion experiments with exponentially depleting sources we used both in situ aquitard solute concentrations and aquifer breakthrough curves for sorbing and non sorbing solutes the finite domain no flux boundary solutions showed better agreement with measured data than was available with semi infinite approaches with increasing discrepancy for dimensionless relative diffusion length scale beyond a critical threshold value z d 0 7 we also used a mass balance to demonstrate that the temporal pattern of contaminant source depletion controls the duration of solute mass accumulation in the aquitard as well as the total solute mass release back into the aquifer lower rates of source depletion result in a longer period of mass accumulation in the aquitard and later back diffusion initiation time the amount of solute mass stored in the aquitard increases with longer loading duration thereby contributing to overall longer contaminant persistence in aquifers this study entails widespread implications for anthropogenic waste and contamination sites which are all dependent on efficient and cost effective contaminant management strategies keywords diffusion back diffusion aquitard groundwater plume persistence 1 introduction diffusion is a fundamental element of solute transport that has recently gained considerable interest among groundwater researchers because of its role in long term persistence of contaminants ranging from industrial solvents radionuclides and landfill leachate chapman and parker 2005 xie et al 2013 zachara et al 2013 storage of contaminants that have diffused into low permeability zones such as aquitards or fractured rock matrix forward diffusion can attenuate concentrations in aquifers kumar 2008 lipson et al 2005 newell et al 2006 sudicky and frind 1982 while contaminant release from these low permeability zones back diffusion can greatly extend the period of water quality concern chapman et al 2012 seyedabbasi et al 2012 yang et al 2015 yang et al 2016 yang et al 2017a yang et al 2017b these processes are surprisingly well described by one dimensional 1d analytical models of solute diffusion and transport which have been shown to be consistent with laboratory and field observations over a very wide range of length 10 2 to 102 m and time scales 10 2 to 108 yrs yang et al 2017b many groundwater contaminant sources are of finite duration and the dynamics of the depletion of these sources has been shown to control the timing of the transition of aquitards from sinks to sources yang et al 2016 yang et al 2017a these works compared laboratory and field data to 1d diffusion models with both linear and exponential source depletion to assess contaminant persistence caused by the combined effects of gradual source depletion in the aquifer and subsequent back diffusion from the aquitard for mathematical simplicity those models treated the finite thickness of the diffusion domain as semi infinite however while those models were able to capture the general behavior the mass balance begins to fail for longer diffusion times as diffusing solutes reach the finite no flux boundary of the aquitard in other related studies yang et al 2015 2017b provide both measured and simulated data using a 1d diffusion model with a finite aquitard domain bounded by no flux in order to model advective transport in the aquifer as well as diffusion profiles in the aquitard in their study a step change concentration temporal boundary condition was employed this study seeks to fill a crucial gap in clear understanding of long term aquifer contaminant persistence from temporally finite depleting sources that diffuse into and out of aquitards of finite thickness bounded by no flux the combination of analytical and measurement based methods as presented here is essential for accurately evaluating environmental risks at contaminated sites carslaw and jaeger 1959 provided analytical solutions for diffusion in semi infinite and finite domains subject to an exponentially depleting source in this study we improved on previously described forward and back diffusion models yang et al 2015 yang et al 2016 yang et al 2017a yang et al 2017b by applying the method of images bear 2013 for finite thickness diffusion domains together with source strength functions ssfs falta et al 2005a falta et al 2005b that describe the depletion of finite solute sources moreover the solutions are validated by the results of three laboratory diffusion experiments using solute tracer tests based on in situ electrical conductivity measurement ecm for bromide and light reflection visualization lrv for new coccine red dye these solutes enable evaluation of both non sorbing and sorbing solute diffusion in a finite thickness kaolinite domain the analytical solutions are also validated by comparison with measured flux average concentration breakthrough curves btcs the specific objectives of this work were 1 to provide insights on the effects of exponentially decreasing sources and back diffusion on long tails in solute breakthrough 2 to develop a 1d analytical solution with exponential source depletion for a finite thickness clay domain with a no flux boundary using the method of images 3 to offer appropriate and reliable in situ measured data on solute diffusion including spatial profiles and btcs and 4 to validate the analytical solutions using measured data furthermore we used a transferable approach to assess the back diffusion initiation time and plume evolution during three stages based on relative contributions of source depletion and back diffusion from the aquitard we also provide guidance for the application of analytical solutions to determine when semi infinite and finite solutions can be used without errors based on a relative diffusion length scale 2 analytical modeling fig 1 features a conceptual diagram that illustrates the aquifer aquitard systems studied here both layers are homogenous and isotropic and are separated by a horizontal interface the aquifer groundwater flows at a constant rate in the x direction and the finite aquitard thickness l is characterized by the z direction the initial contaminant concentration is zero in both the aquifer and aquitard a contaminant source is introduced and then exponentially depleted by groundwater flow concentration gradients in the z direction may result in forward diffusion from the aquifer to the aquitard back diffusion then occurs when source depletion decreases aquifer contaminant concentrations such that the diffusive flux in the z direction becomes positive back diffusion therefore represents the release of contaminants back into the aquifer aquitard degradation reactions and transverse diffusion are not considered in this study 2 1 exponential source depletion the contaminant mass discharge from a source can change over time due to mass depletion and is strongly linked to plume evolution this source dynamic is defined as a ssf a power law model can be used to describe the relative concentration of contaminant leaving the source zone in this case the source mass and source strength is linked

widely used while those for γ 1 and 0 5 are not well known for solute transport this source depletion model can generally be applied to decaying sources that follow a power law behavior in order to reflect real field conditions for source strength behavior at contaminated sites this study focused on exponential source depletion γ 1 brown et al 2012 chen and jawitz 2008 chen and jawitz 2009 zhu

injected at z 0 and a no flux boundary located at a distance l in the z direction there are an infinite number of hypothetical image sources along the z axis from both upper and lower boundaries which are characterized by no flux and c c 0 exp βt respectively these image sources account for the model prediction of lost mass beyond the finite domain yang et al 2015 yang et al 2017b the analytical

presented in this study three diffusion experiments were conducted in a well controlled two dimensional flow chamber with exponentially decreasing sources of sorbing and non sorbing solutes new coccine r 5 with β 0 13 d 1 in experiment 1 and bromide r 1 with β 0 13 and 0 07 d 1 in experiments 2 and experiment 3 the flow chamber akin to the one described in yang et al 2016 was assembled from aluminum and glass with dimensions of 28 12 1 2 cm fig 2 the flow chamber was filled with porous media to create a 4 cm aquifer 20 30 mesh accusand uminin corp overlain by an aquitard 3 cm of kaolinite fluka for experiment 1 fig 2a and 7 cm of kaolinite for experiments 2 and 3 fig 2b and saturated with water displacement experiments were conducted with inflow controlled by a piston pump fluid metering corp q pump and a constant head outlet boundary exponentially depleting sources were generated by a continuously stirred tank reactor cstr which maintained a specified volume v 230 ml for experiments 1 and 2 and 460 ml for experiment 3 the cstr effluent concentration c t is defined by schmidt 1998 which is similar to eq 2 with β q v parameters specific to a cstr the initial concentration of bromide and new coccine c 0 was equal to 10 g l and 200 mg l and exponentially decreased toward 0 g l over a period of 40 days a steady flow rate q 0 02 ml min was imposed on all three experiments with pore volume pv 40 3 ml and an estimated mean travel time of 1 4 days from the flow chamber inlet to the outlet 3 2 in situ measurement of aquitard and aquifer concentration for experiment 1 spatio temporal changes in red dye tracer concentration in the 3 cm clay layer were assessed by lrv to provide optimal lighting conditions for proper imaging a light source fancierstudio 1000 w 5500 k was checked with a luxmeter in a dark room and photographed once per pv with a canon eos 350d with an aperture of 13 exposure time of 1 s and iso of 100 to allow for the assessment of concentrations and their respective color intensities the collected images were split into red blue and green channels color intensity changes were determined using the green channel which is sensitive to red hue variations through the color processing software imagej details on this process can be found elsewhere yang et al 2014 for experiments 2 and 3 the bromide concentration profile in the 7 cm kaolinite layer was non destructively determined by in situ ecm steel electrodes were fixed into one side of the flow chamber in two columns and seven rows 1 cm apart pore water electrical

electrical conductivity at time t without and with tracer at the initial concentration c 0 yang et al 2016 provides details of this technique for all experiments the influent and effluent concentrations of new coccine and bromide were determined by in situ ecm continuously for effluent new coccine concentrations below the ecm detection limit of 1 mg l were measured by absorbance using a microplate reader biotek synergy h1 hybrid reader the goodness of fit between the measured and simulated values was determined using the coefficient of efficiency e legates and mccabe 1999 nash and sutcliffe 1970 which has a range of negative infinity to 1 values closest to 1 indicate the highest agreement level between the measured and simulated data 13 e 1 0 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where p is the simulated data o represents the measured data and o describes the measured mean 4 results and discussion 4 1 exponential source depletion concentrations of dye and bromide measured at the flow chamber inlet are shown in fig 3 these cstr generated influent trends are consistent with exponential source depletion eq 2 with β 0 13 d 1 for experiments 1 and 2 and 0 07 d 1 for experiment 3 the measured and simulated influent concentrations for the three experiments showed excellent correspondence with e 0 99 4 2 concentration profile in the low permeability zone dye concentration profiles measured by lrv in the 0 03 m kaolinite layer are shown in fig 4a at seven time steps 3 7 13 20 27 33 and 40 pvs after the initial source release after 13 pvs the dye diffusive penetration distance at c c 0 0 01 was only approximately 0 02 m because of a relatively high retardation factor r 5 the measured dye concentration at the sand kaolinite interface z 0 decreased throughout the duration of the experiment this reduction was due to the decreasing influent concentration in the sand layer while the concentration at z 0 025 m increased during the same period the simulated concentration profile using both the semi infinite analytical solution eq 3 and the finite thickness analytical solution eq 5 showed good fits to the measured data at pvs 3 7 and 13 with e 0 98 that is during the first 13 pvs of experiment 1 there was no difference in the simulated concentrations using eqs 3 and 5 fig 4a left panel however the difference in the effect of a finite versus semi infinite low permeability layer began to manifest after 20 pvs at z 0 025 m fig 4a as the experiment continued the two model solutions diverged and only the finite domain model matched the experimental data when the semi infinite domain solution was used e decreased to 0 90 after 27 pvs and further decreased to 0 36 after 40 pvs better fits with the measured profiles were obtained when the finite domain solution was employed with e 0 90 for the last two profiles fig 4a the bromide concentration profiles measured from the ecm in the 0 07 m kaolinite layer for experiments 2 and 3 are shown in fig 4b and c at four time steps 13 20 27 and 33 pvs the bromide penetration distance at 13 pvs was about three times greater than for new coccine due to both the lower retardation factor r 1 and a higher molecular diffusion coefficient d 1 7 10 4 m2 d such that the bromide effective diffusion coefficient d is 23 times larger than that of new coccine table 1 the simulated concentrations from eqs 3 and 5 showed an observable difference at z 0 06 m after 13 pvs and this difference gradually increased through the 33 pvs of exponential source depletion the measured bromide concentrations at z 0 for experiment 2 sharply decreased to c c 0 0 by 33 pvs due to a higher rate of exponential source depletion β 0 13 d 1 in the sand layer while the reduction of bromide concentration at z 0 for experiment 3 β 0 07 d 1 was noticeably and expectedly slower than that of experiment 2 agreement between the measured data and eq 3 weakened over time with e 0 02 at 33 pvs for experiment 2 and 1 38 for experiment 3 in contrast the simulated profiles using eq 5 showed overall better fits with the measured concentration profiles at all times with mean e 0 78 for experiment 2 and 0 40 for experiment 3 4 3 plume tailing behavior and mass balance the measured and simulated effluent concentrations for experiments 1 2 and 3 fig 5a illustrate three different btc tailing behaviors as shown by yang et al 2016 the btcs can be classified based on a three stage framework stage 1 is aquifer source depletion coupled with forward diffusion into aquitards stage 2 is continued source depletion but with back diffusion from the aquitard and stage 3 is a fully depleted source and only back diffusion for the current experiments stage 1 comprised exponential source depletion eq 2 and stage 2 involved superposition of source depletion eq 2 and back diffusion eqs 7 and 8 the back diffusion initiation time 5 pvs for experiments 1 and 2 and 10 pvs for experiment 3 which indicates when stage 2 starts was determined by assessing a change in the amount of solute mass remaining in the kaolinite based on a mass balance calculation from the inlet and outlet fig 5b c and d note that the mass calculations in fig 5b c and d were corrected for the mean travel time 1 pv from the inlet to the outlet of the flow chamber in order to easily compare the results in fig 3 for all experiments after stage 2 initiation the measured concentrations were higher than the simulated values when considering only the source depletion model eq 2 fig 5a mean e 0 82 this discrepancy is due to back diffusion from the kaolinite layer thus enhancing btc tailing when back diffusion was added to the simulated results the finite domain solution eq 8 showed better fits mean e 0 98 with the measured values for all experiments than the semi infinite solution eq 7 which underestimates the influent concentrations mean e 0 96 the magnitude of underestimation can be expected to increase with a longer loading time or a thinner aquitard layer yang et al 2015 yang et al 2016 as discussed below for experiments 1 and 2 the measured concentration for new coccine and bromide effluent during stage 1 showed good agreement with the source depletion simulation using eq 2 fig 5a the source depletion rate was equal in both experiments β 0 13 d 1 however after 6 pvs during stage 2 the two patterns of tailing behavior diverged with higher measured concentrations of both solutes than simulated from source depletion eq 2 during stage 1 the new coccine and bromide mass stored in the kaolinite layer increased from forward diffusion but back diffusion initiation during stage 2 resulted in slow mass reduction in the kaolinite layer in both experiments 1 and 2 fig 5b and c the maximum ratios of mass remaining in the kaolinite to the total mass injected into the aquifer at the end of stage 1 were approximately 8 3 6 mg to total 46 mg for new coccine and 12 278 2 mg to total 2300 mg for bromide the relatively smaller percentage 8 of new coccine mass storage is due to the smaller effective diffusion coefficient than that of bromide resulting from higher retardation and a smaller molecular diffusion coefficient table 1 these two factors have a great impact on mass storage as well as mass release the solute mass in the kaolinite layer decreased to 1 of its maximum value which occurred at the beginning of stage 2 after 74 pvs in experiment 1 compared to only 11 pvs in experiment 2 despite the same source depletion rate in the sand layer the difference in the portion of total accumulated mass and mass release rate from the kaolinite layer between experiments 1 and 2 during stage 1 resulted in a marked divergence between new coccine and bromide btc tails in stage 2 fig 5a for experiment 3 where the source depletion rate β 0 07 d 1 was approximately half that of experiment 2 the measured effluent concentration decline was correspondingly slower fig 5a with later back diffusion initiation at approximately 10 pvs fig 5d because stage 1 in experiment 3 was twice as long as that of experiment 2 the solute mass stored in the clay was 1 4 times larger than that of experiment 2 in addition after initiation of stage 2 a further 17 pvs were required for the solute mass in the clay to be reduced to 1 of the maximum value this result is 1 5 times slower than that of experiment 2 because of the slower source depletion in the sand layer relative to that of experiment 2 4 4 error analysis with relative diffusion length scale the measured data for all experiments conducted with different diffusion length clay thickness and timescales can be synthesized with the dimensionless relative diffusion length z d eq 11 the values of z d for all experiments presented here ranged from 0 4 to 1 5 the correspondence between the finite domain solutions for the concentration profile and btc eqs 5 and 8 and the semi infinite solutions eqs 3 and 7 is shown in fig 6 as a function of z d for β 0 07 0 13 and 0 26 d 1 note that the finite and semi infinite solutions are considered as the measured and simulated results when computing coefficient of efficiency e in fig 6 for z d 0 7 the simulated data using both solutions are nearly identical e 1 for all β values considered indicating that semi infinite solutions can be used despite the presence of finite domains when z d 0 7 the calculated e values between both solutions dramatically decrease with a decrease in β suggesting the use of semi infinite solutions is not recommended for z d 0 7 these results are consistent with those for concentration profiles fig 4 and btcs fig 5 for example for experiments 2 and 3 at 13 pvs z d 0 87 0 7 which is consistent with the observation that the finite eq 5 solution matched the measured data better than the semi infinite solution eq 3 fig 4b and c as the experiment time increased and z d grew increasingly larger than the threshold of 0 7 the errors from the semi infinite solutions increased for the simulated btcs the error patterns between eqs 7 and 8 are similar to the simulated concentration profiles in which e decreases sharply when z d 0 7 however the threshold of 0 7 may increase as the value of β increases when β 0 26 d 1 the simulated data using both solutions are still identical until z d 0 8 5 insight on contaminant persistence field scale factors that affect contaminant tailing and plume persistence include complex heterogeneity solute chemical and physical characteristics and source depletion dynamics once aquifer contaminants have been in contact with low permeability zones for a certain period of time stage 1 regardless of source strength it is difficult to avoid the occurrence of back diffusion stage 2 importantly contaminant properties are a dominating factor in the occurrence of long plume tailing contaminants with a small diffusion coefficient and high retardation result in small mass accumulation low diffusion length in the aquitard and a relatively small back diffusion flux to the aquifer albeit with a relatively long tail yang et al 2015 it should also be noted that the source depletion rate β also influences plume tailing under the common scenario of exponentially depleting aquifer contaminant sources back diffusion can be expected to initiate at c c 0 0 43 yang et al 2017a this is the transition from stage 1 to stage 2 and the time to which this condition corresponds is determined by β as β decreases the duration of stage 1 becomes longer with increased the relative mass of contaminant accumulated in the aquitard however back diffusion flux from the aquitard in stage 2 also decreases with β because the aquifer aquitard concentration gradient decreases with β therefore lower β is associated with increased solute mass in the aquitard from longer duration stage 1 and decreased diffusive flux from the aquitard during stage 2 resulting in an extended back diffusion period note that aquifer source depletion dynamics may change due to remedial activities which have not been considered in this study 6 conclusions we have shown that one dimensional analytical solutions are able to describe the forward and back diffusion processes and transitions real aquitards are finite and may occur in alternating layers that generate no flux boundaries and the solutions we provide in this work matched measured data and confirmed with mass balance much better than approaches that use semi infinite approximations especially when zd 0 7 the finite analytical solutions provided here enable accurate mass balance estimation including storage and release of mass from low permeability layers and back diffusion initiation time throughout the duration of all dissolution and diffusion stages the

sodium ds an anionic contaminant in water by il modified mt the experiment shows absorption of ds increased by increasing il dosage in modifying mt as a result to modified mt with a concentration of

most important clay minerals is layered silica tetrahedral and alumina octahedral sheets with negatively charged layers compensated by cations such as na ca2 the cations can be exchanged by another inorganic cations or organic cations il is an environment friendly organic modifier with special features such as minimal vapor pressure some ionic liquid has a strong adsorption or intercalation to clay minerals with negative layer charge which can be used as modifier to clay minerals montmorillonite to enhance removal of anionic contaminants in water the removal capacity increases with increasing addition of il stepnorski et al 2007 therefore modifying mt with long chain length il can enhance basal spacing of clay due to interaction force of organic molecules and reaches adsorption equilibrium srivastava et al 2009 intercalating il molecules into mt through cationic ion exchange which process changes surface charge of clay to prepare composite material applying in adsorb anionic

after metabolism waste through this way would accumulate in soil and ground water boxall et al 2004 jjemba 2006 ahmed et al 2015 ds cannot be completely decomposed or removed even by urban wastewater

and mechanism of il mt to anionic contaminants through computer simulation program the research configurates state and conformation of il in mt interlayer as well as its interaction style with ds furthermore with overall consideration of static and dynamic experiment the research studies on feasibility of il mt application as prb materials 2 experiments and methods 2 1 materials the montmorillonite mt used was obtained from the clay mineral repositories in purdue university west lafayette in without further purification the basic information of the mt was detailed described in our previous work wu et al 2014 the 1 hexadecy1 3 methylimidazolium chloride monohydrate c16mimcl cas 404001 62 3 was obtained from shanghai darui fine chemical co ltd shanghai china the diclofenac

the flow rate was 4 15 ml min resulting in a linear velocity of 7 m d and a resident time of 10 h the samples were taken total of 43 h the ds concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically 2 4 materials characterization the equilibrium ds concentrations were analyzed by a uv vis spectrophotometer model t6 new century 1650 made by general instrument inc llt beijing china at the wavelength of

as the difference between the initial and final concentrations powder xrd analyses were performed on a rigaku d max iii adiffractometer tokyo japan with a ni filtered cukα radiation at 30 kv and 20 ma orientated samples were scanned from 3 to 70 with a scanning step of 0 01 ftir spectra of samples were collected on a nicolet 560 spectrometer thermal nicolet co usa from 400 to 4000 cm 1 with a nominal resolution of 4 cm 1 molecular simulation was performed under the module castep of materials studio 6 1 software to investigate the sorption sites of il and ds on mt the resulting primitive unit cell was characterized by the parameters a 15 540 å b 17 940 å c 23 36 å and α γ 90 β 99 based on the primitive unit cell a series of 3 2 1 supercells were built with the spacing of layers set to16 and 20 å respectively 3 results and discussions 3 1 il uptake on mt and ds removal by il modified mt il mt is prepared by c16mincl intercalated mt and 50 cec il mt 100 cec il mt and 200 cec il mt are prepared by modifying mt with different concentrations of c16mincl 50 cec 100 cec and 200 cec respectively it is shown in fig 2 that mt adsorption capacity for ds has been increased a great deal after modification the adsorption capacity of unmodified mt to ds is 1 5 mmol kg while c16mincl modified mt to ds is higher and increasing continuously as modifying agent c16mimcl concentration increased 200 cec il mt has the highest adsorption capacity and reaches balance at equilibrium concentration of 2 5 mmol l which adsorption capacity is 310 mmol kg in the experiment adsorption capacity of rawmt 50 cec il mt 100 cec il mt and 200 cec il mt are 1 5 mmol kg 136 mmol kg 173 mmol kg and 310 mmol kg respectively in sum modification of c16mimcl to highly increased its adsorption to ds where 200 cec il mt has a remarkable 200 times of adsorption capacity of unmodified raw mt in summary c16mimcl modification has equipped mt with adsorption to anionic organic contaminants adsorption of surfactant modified zeolite smz to chromate is mainly due to anion exchange of chromate and br or cl absorbed on smz surface li et al 2014 li and bowman 1997 therefore il mt adsorption to ds has similar mechanism part of ds intercalates into mt interlayer and interacts with il and part of ds is absorbed on mt surface based on the results of 200 cec il mt adsorbing ds the adsorption rate of composite materials has been studied fig 3 with an initial concentration of 3 mmol l ds has been adsorbed by 200 cec il mt very rapidly which adsorption amount reaches 174 mmol kg in 5 min and reaches equilibrium at 20 min dynamic experiment exhibits il mt adsorbing ds is an instantaneous process it can be inferred that physical adsorption is dominant in process of il modified mt adsorbing ds wu et al 2014 3 2 mechanism of il uptake on mt and ds removal by il modified mt with the ion exchange of the sodium ion for the c16mim expansion of the namt layers occurred this expansion was readily measured by xrd the interlayer spacing of the modified mt by the c16mimcl was expanded as compared with that of the raw mt the basal and interlayer spacing were observed for the different clays as shown in fig 4a the trend for the basal spacing d0 0 1 is the same as that in the interlayer spacing the differences between the different organic mt are due to the different incorporation and arrangement of the surfactants heinz et al 2003 heinz et al 2007 wu et al 2014 c16mimcl exchanges na ion in namt interlayers leading to obvious increase in d001 of mt basal spacing values of mt intercalated by 200 cec c16mimcl are 20 01 å whereas after 200 cec c16mim mt adsorbing ds basal spacing value has been extended to 23 36 å the result is not only related to the c16mimcl intercalation capacity but also to the alkyl chain length of c16mimcl in that both amount and forming pattern of c16mimcl and ds between mt layers determine the increase of the basal spacing li et al 2014 ftir pattern of c16mimcl intercalated mt indicates formation and break of chemical bond before and after intercalation fig 4b scanning the range of 450 4000 cm 1 to identify difference in ftir absorption peaks comparing with original mt only peaks at 2850 3000 cm 1 show changes among all peaks of 200 cec c16mim mt where represents ch2 vibration peak and indicates c16mimcl has intercalated into mt interlayer absorption peaks at 2850 3000 cm 1 are attributed to ch2 stretching υs ch2 and ant symmetric υas ch2 modes frost et al 2008 venkataraman and vasudevan 2001 ha and char 2005 suga and rusling 1993 no further new absorption peak appears in ftir pattern which demonstrates c16mimcl has only intercalated or adsorbed on surface without form new chemical bond maintaining composite material a similar property as original mt ha and char 2005 li and ishida 2003 xi et al 2005 he et al 2004 vaia et al 1994 c16mim exists as cation in solution and interacts with mt organic cations have higher affinities with surface and interlayer of mt than inorganic cations liu et al 2008 the instantaneous adsorption of ds supported surface adsorption and interlayer adsorption computer simulation was used to calculate the arrangement c16mimcl and ds in the interlayer of mt and interaction between mt sheets and interlayer organic molecule dynamics simulation plays an important role in study of molecular interaction mechanism silicon si is used to represent mt sheet and n positive charged group in c16mimcl and feature atom in ds to represent c16mim and ds position in mt interlayer the results of simulation are shown in fig 5 mt sheet si located in position of 0 6 6 å and interlayer c16mimcl and ds in 100 cec il mt and 200 cec il mt in 9 5 13 8 å and 9 18 å it can be observed that with increasing amount of interlayer distance of c16mimcl and ds to silicon oxygen tetrahedron in mt gradually increased it proves amount of intercalated organic molecule in mt interlayer affects basal spacing of mt wu et al 2017 through exchange of cation c16mimcl modified mt and entered mt interlayer the study uses molecule dynamics simulation program to calculate arrangement and interaction of layer sheet of c16mim and ds in mt space fig 5 with experiment results from 100 cec il mt and 200 cec il mt adsorbing ds the simulation shows there are two c16min ions and one ds molecule in interlayer space of 100 cec il mt where three molecules overlap and form a stable layer paralleling to mt sheet the two kind of molecular interlaced with each other and to form stable monolayer paralleled in the mt interlayer fig 5a ds is more than 98 anionic type organic which cannot enter mt interlayer nevertheless after c16mincl intercalation into mt the interaction force of intercalated molecule with layer has been changed and makes it possible for ds to enter mt space in a stable way from fig 5b it can be seen that four c16min ions and two ds molecules in the space of mt these four c16mim ions are configured by strong interaction force into two groups in mt interlayer while ds form a stable molecular layer with interaction from c16min it can be clearly seen that 200 cec il mt space has two more c16mim and one more ds molecule which yield different configuration of ion molecule in the interlayer c16mim shows stronger modification than 200 cec il mt rendering 137 mmol kg more adsorption amount of ds than 100 cec il mt 3 3 dynamic column experiment adsorption capacity of il mt to ds is high in batch experiment conditions especially 200 cec il mt reaching 320 mmol kg in removal therefore 200 cec il mt is used to investigate removal of il mt to ds and its application outside laboratory mt as well as quartz sand is put into glass column where quartz sand is used to ensure fluidity of liquid ds solution flows into glass column from top and out from bottom going through mt and quartz sand and being adsorbed in fig 6a the unmodified mt reaches its adsorption equilibrium at 2 h so unmodified mt could adsorb certain amount of ds for only 2 h however il modified mt column fig 6b adsorbs ds and get equilibrated at 24 h in sum of this comparison modified mt increases adsorption capacity of column and elongated time to reach equilibrium lu et al 2011 lv et al 2014 when the flow rate is set at 4 15 ml min the water comes out of the column reaches 2490 ml at 10 h with a ds concentration below 2 5 mmol l as the time goes above 10 h the concentration of ds increases gradually after 24 h corresponding to 5976 ml the concentration of contaminant of the water from the outlet is almost the same as that from the inlet 5 mmol l which indicates that il mt in the column has totally lost its ability for the removal of contaminants this equilibrium goes on until distilled water is added into the system at 300 ml then the concentration of contaminant from the outlet starts to decrease and becomes lower 0 5 mmol l after 35 h it takes 43 h for the whole process the volume of water passes the column during this time is 10 707 ml and the overall removal capacity is 2 49 mmol g in batch experiment both the solvent and solid are static in a batch experimental part il modified mt have saturated surface adsorption which hinders ds enter into mt interlayer and maximum adsorption amount is only 320 mmol kg while in column test part surface of il mt interacts with ds ions with solution flow ds enters il mt interlayer and exchange anions with mt surface li et al 2014 reaching highest adsorption amount various research of application of clay minerals has been carried out in environment field due to negative charge on outer surface of clay minerals cationic surfactants are used to modify clay with bilayer surface coverage to enhance its adsorption of anionic contaminants li and bowman 1998 krishna et al 2000 atia 2008 hu and luo 2010 brum et al 2010 sarkar et al 2010 highlight of this research is that modifier in preparation of mt composite material is environmentally friendly solvent and supposed to eliminate environmental pollution of commonly used anionic organic 4 conclusions in this study il modified mt il mt has been prepared which is considered as an environmentally friendly composite material through modification il changes layer charge of mt and significantly increases il mt adsorption to ds in this experiment a batch adsorption amount of 200 cec il mt to ds is 320 mmol kg and reach equilibrium in a remarkably short time of 5 min in dynamic column experiment its adsorption to ds saturates after 24 h which amount is 2490 mmol kg greatly increased from unmodified material the results show a possible application of il mt in prb materials in adsorbing anionic type contaminants this study extended the application of mt and explored new applications of ils for the removal of anionic contaminants from water conflicts of interest there are no conflicts of interest to declare acknowledgments this

experimental part il modified mt have saturated surface adsorption which hinders ds enter into mt interlayer and maximum adsorption amount is only 320 mmol kg while in column test part surface of il mt interacts with ds ions with solution flow ds enters il mt interlayer and exchange anions with mt surface li et al 2014 reaching highest adsorption amount various research of application of clay minerals has been carried out in environment field due to negative charge on outer surface of clay minerals cationic surfactants are used to modify clay with bilayer surface coverage to enhance its adsorption of anionic contaminants li and bowman 1998 krishna et al 2000 atia 2008 hu and luo 2010 brum et al 2010 sarkar et al 2010 highlight of this research is that modifier in preparation of mt composite material is environmentally friendly solvent and supposed to eliminate environmental pollution of commonly used anionic organic 4 conclusions in this study il modified mt il mt has been prepared which is considered as an environmentally friendly composite material through modification il changes layer charge of mt and significantly increases il mt adsorption to ds in this experiment a batch adsorption amount of 200 cec il mt to ds is 320 mmol kg and reach equilibrium in a remarkably short time of 5 min in dynamic column experiment its adsorption to ds saturates after 24 h which amount is 2490 mmol kg greatly increased from unmodified material the results show a possible application of il mt in prb materials in adsorbing anionic type contaminants this study extended the application of mt and explored new applications of ils for the removal of anionic contaminants from water conflicts of interest there are no conflicts of interest to declare acknowledgments this
