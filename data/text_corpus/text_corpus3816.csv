19080,currently the effects of high antibiotic concentrations on the performance of microbiota and antibiotic resistance genes args in activated sludge as process are not well characterized lab scale batch reactors were performed to evaluate the dynamics of microbial community and args in response to six antibiotics at different concentrations using high throughput sequencing based 16s rrna gene and metagenomic analyses the presence of antibiotics remarkably decreased the microbial diversity caused a great change of the microbiota structure and exerted a selective pressure on the enrichment of potential antibiotic resistant bacteria arb such as arthrobacter thauera geothrix rudaea aridibacter conexibacter terrimonas etc high antibiotic selective pressures increased arg abundance but simultaneously reduced arg number in total 491 arg subtypes belonging to 20 arg types were detected and kanamycin treatment showed the highest arg abundances a core set of 54 arg subtypes that accounted for 66 7 99 6 of the total arg abundances were shared by all samples the increase of the abundances of both corresponding and non corresponding args under a specific antibiotic treatment revealed the collateral effects of antibiotic selective pressure microbial community may play an important role in the composition of args network analysis indicated that both internal type and external type of args exhibited higher non random co occurrence incidences and 18 genera were speculated as the possible hosts for multiple args this study deciphered the profiles and relationships between microbial community and args in as process treating wastewater with high antibiotic concentrations and could provide helpful guidance for controlling the development and dissemination of arb and args graphical abstract image 1 keywords antibiotics selective pressure microbial community antibiotic resistance genes activated sludge metagenomic analysis 1 introduction antibiotics have been extensively used in veterinary and human medicine as well as in aquaculture because of their significant role in treating microbial infections and in promoting growth sarmah et al 2006 kümmerer 2009 global antibiotic consumption increased by 65 between 2000 and 2015 and the increase was primarily driven by increased consumption in low and middle income countries klein et al 2018 according to a survey of antibiotic uses in china in 2013 the total antibiotic production was 248 000 tons and the total usage was approximately 162 000 tons of which 48 was used in humans and 52 in animals zhang et al 2015 however the inappropriate use of antibiotics worldwide in recent years has not only resulted in the chemical pollution in the environment but also inevitably increased the development and subsequent dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes args and antibiotic resistant bacteria arb see table s1 list of abbreviations used in the text andremont and walsh 2015 various classes of antibiotics via un metabolized forms can enter sewage systems and water environments principally through human waste animal waste and pharmaceutical manufacturing waste marshall and levy 2011 qiao et al 2018 in aquatic environments some antibiotics are easily degraded whereas others are considerably more persistent thus prevailing for longer times in the environment and accumulating to higher concentrations larsson 2014a multiple studies have found high concentrations of antibiotics at mg l 1 level in different environments such as pharmaceutical industrial effluents hospital effluents livestock wastewater and sewage treatment plants sim et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 larsson 2014b for example extremely high levels of tetracycline 11 9 mg l 1 oxytetracycline 41 8 mg l 1 trimethoprim 92 2 mg l 1 lincosamides 201 mg l 1 and cephalosporins 80 0 mg l 1 residues were detected in raw influents of different pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants in china wang et al 2015 guo et al 2018 the presence of high concentrations of antibiotics can trigger conspicuous variations of wastewater treatment microbial communities and affect the stable operation of treatment system meng et al 2017 strikingly the selective pressure exerted by the antibiotics can also increase the frequency of horizontal transfer of args from arb to human pathogens in the antibiotic wastewater treatment plants and their receiving environments directly posing a serious threat to human and animal health allen et al 2010 sharma et al 2016 currently the effects of high concentrations of antibiotics on the compositions of microbial communities and the dissemination of args have been explored in lab scale aydin et al 2015a zhang et al 2016 pilot scale nõlvak et al 2013 liu et al 2014 and full scale wang et al 2015 tang et al 2017 studies for treating antibiotic production wastewater however previous studies generally used culture dependent and polymerase chain reaction pcr based methods to explore the occurrence of corresponding args of a certain antibiotic owing to limited availability of primers only several antibiotics and their corresponding args such as args to sulfonamides tetracyclines fluoroquinolones and macrolides were covered in previous studies because of the collateral selective effects of antibiotics and the possibility of args transferring to human pathogens looft et al 2012 it is important to comprehensively comprehend the occurrence and abundance of both corresponding and non corresponding args under the selective pressure of a specific antibiotic the comprehensive effects of a certain antibiotic on the occurrence of non corresponding args in antibiotic wastewater treatment systems have been rarely reported consequently the high throughput sequencing hts based metagenomic approach was utilized in the present research to fully investigate the args occurrence under high antibiotic concentrations the metagenomic approach would avoid underestimating of the antibiotic resistome profiles and supply more comprehensive datasets for evaluating the ecological risks of args in the environments containing high levels of antibiotics zhao et al 2018 in addition given that different antibiotics have different selective capabilities turnidge and christiansen 2005 it is essential to compare and evaluate the dynamics of microbiome and resistome in response to different classes of antibiotics in this study six antibiotics with high production and consumption i e sulfamethazine smz erythromycin ery lincomycin lin tetracycline tet kanamycin kan and trimethoprim tmp were selected as the target selective pressure lab scale batch reactors of activated sludge as process were established by adding these antibiotics with high concentrations to simulate the raw antibiotic production wastewater the objectives were 1 to compare and evaluate the effects of high concentrations of antibiotics on the microbial community compositions and to identify the potential arb 2 to comprehensively characterize the arg profiles including corresponding and non corresponding types under high selective pressure of antibiotics using the hts based metagenomic analysis and 3 to decipher the relations of microbiota with resistome and the co occurrence patterns among microbial taxa and args via network analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 target antibiotics based on a recent report on the national consumption discharges and environmental fate of 36 antibiotics commonly detected in china zhang et al 2015 six antibiotics belonging to six classes were selected as the targets in this study information of these antibiotics was provided in detail in table s2 all antibiotics were purchased from sigma aldrich 2 2 batch experiments design and operation seed activated sludge sas and wastewater were collected from a local municipal wastewater treatment plant in south china to start up batch reactors 50 ml as were initially used as the inoculum in each reactor to simulate as process for treating wastewater with high antibiotic concentrations the mixed liquor suspended solids concentrations in the reactors were approximately 1000 mg l 1 before operation the raw wastewater was firstly filtered with 0 22 μm glass fiber membrane diameter 47 mm millipore usa to exclude the influence of microorganisms and provided nutrients and trace elements for microbial growth in the reactors synthetic antibiotic wastewater prepared from the filtered raw wastewater had an initial antibiotic concentration of 20 mg l 1 total organic carbon concentration of approximately 50 mg l 1 and ph of around 7 40 details of chemical analysis of these water quality parameters were described in supplementary information si 2 2 1 the aerobic as reactors were set up in parallel for each antibiotic treatment with a working volume of 500 ml in 1 l brown reagent bottles to prevent possible photo degradation of antibiotics and algal growth to evaluate the effects of antibiotics on the microbial community and args a control treatment ck without antibiotic addition was set up simultaneously totally 14 lab scale batch reactors for seven treatments were operated in this study they were maintained at room temperature 25 2 c and continuously stirred at 200 rpm during the whole experiment for aeration and mixing the concentrations of each antibiotic were step wise increased from 20 mg l 1 to a final level according to their removal behaviors through successive stages as shown in table 1 it should be pointed out that the high concentrations of antibiotics were set according to their concentrations present in the influents of pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants rather than the municipal wastewater or natural environment the start up period of reactors were operated at 20 mg l 1 for two months as a stable stage i e stage 1 during each stage table s3 homogenized mixed liquor was taken from each reactor and immediately processed for antibiotic concentration determination si 2 2 1 the detailed sampling information and the replacement procedures of synthetic antibiotic wastewater were described in si 2 2 2 another mixed liquor sample was taken before moving into the next stage the collected samples were mixed with 100 ethanol at a volume ratio of 1 1 immediately for biomass fixation and were stored at 20 c before dna extraction 2 3 dna extraction the as samples of 10 ml fixed by ethanol were firstly centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 15 min and then the pellets were collected for subsequent dna extraction fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals usa was used to extract dna following the manufacturer s manuals dna quality was assessed via 1 agarose gel electrophoresis and dna concentrations were quantified by nanodrop one spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific usa the obtained dna samples were kept in a refrigerator at 80 c for further application 2 4 16s rrna gene sequencing and microbial community analysis the 16s rrna gene v4 region was amplified using the primer pair f515 and r806 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 5 ggactacvsgggtatctaat 3 respectively caporaso et al 2012 the standard pcr assays were performed as described previously kozich et al 2013 the amplicons were purified quantified and pooled at an equimolar ratio sequencing was performed on the illumina miseq platform pe250 strategy at novogene tianjin china the raw sequences were processed using mothur software v 1 36 following the standard pipeline schloss et al 2009 the post quality filtering reads after chimera and singletons removal were then normalized to 18224 clean sequences for each sample the average length of obtained reads was 273 bp the uparse pipeline was used to pick up operational taxonomic units otus at 97 similarity edgar 2013 for each otu the representative sequence was assigned taxonomic annotation according to the ribosomal database project rdp classifier v 2 11 with a confidence threshold of 80 wang et al 2007 2 5 metagenomic sequencing and args analysis before metagenomic sequencing 16s rrna gene was sequenced and the microbial community composition of all samples was analyzed the results indicated that the antibiotic concentrations had a significant effect on the microbial composition at phylum and genus levels and the differences of microbial community compositions at stage 2 stage 4 and stage 7 were more significant and representative see the results section in addition the concentrations of added antibiotics at stage 2 stage 4 and stage 7 represented the low medium and high levels respectively therefore samples from stage 2 stage 4 and stage 7 table s4 were selected for metagenomic sequencing and args analysis for each sample about 5 μg of dna was used for library construction with an insert size of 350 bp and then sequenced on the illumina hiseq 4000 platform pe150 strategy at novogene tianjin china the detailed library construction procedures were described in si 2 5 approximately 15 gb raw reads were generated for each sample the related information of metagenomic datasets for each sample was summarized in table s5 all the raw metagenomic reads were filtered and normalized to 44361843 clean reads before downstream analysis si 2 5 the online analysis pipeline for args i e args oap http smile hku hk sargs was used to identify and annotate arg like reads yang et al 2016 the structured arg sarg database consisting of 24 arg types and 1209 subtypes was used in args oap yang et al 2016 arg types and subtypes were identified automatically using a package of customized scripts as proposed by yang et al 2016 resistance types represent the class of antibiotics to which args confer resistance such as type tetracycline resistance genes resistance subtypes represent individual kinds of args such as subtype teta of tetracycline resistance genes arg abundances were finally quantified by the normalization of 16s rrna gene copy numbers and expressed as copy of arg per copy of 16s rrna gene named the ratio thereafter according to our previous study li et al 2015 2 6 data analysis and network analysis the various alpha diversity indices were calculated using past software v 3 20 a p value 0 05 was considered to be significant for all statistical tests the difference between the means of two independent groups was analyzed with the student s t test via spss software v 17 0 ibm corp usa non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis adonis analysis and procrustes analysis were performed in r v 3 5

with vegan igraph and hmisc packages and network graphs were visualized using gephi v 0 9 2 li et al 2015 in the network the random r and observed o incidences of internal type and external type co occurrence connections were statistically checked and calculated according to ju et al 2016 the details of network analysis and some topological properties of the network were described in si 2 6 3 results 3 1 antibiotics removal characteristics as shown in fig s1 the six antibiotics showed different removal characteristics in the as reactors our results revealed that smz ery and lin were mainly removed by biodegradation while kan and tet were mainly removed by adsorption however when kan and tet reached a saturated adsorption status desorption which increased the liquid antibiotic concentrations occurred in the as process tmp was adsorbed negligibly and no biodegradation occurred in the as process detailed results analysis and discussion were summarized in si 3 1 3 2 characterization of microbial communities 3 2 1 diversity of microbial communities after filtering trimming and chimera checking there were a total of 3209941 effective reads for all the 100 samples the number of high quality reads per sample ranged from 18224 to 46539 table s6 which were normalized to 18224 sequences for each sample and were clustered into 4545 otus mean 383 table s6 at 97 similarity cutoff based on the diversity indices table s6 the sas had the richest diversity the shannon simpson evenness and chao 1 indices of samples under antibiotic pressure were significantly lower than those of sas samples for each antibiotic treatment further increase of antibiotic concentrations had no significant effect on these indices table s6 good s coverage ranging from 98 4 to 99 6 table s6 suggested the otus of each sample were well captured and the sequencing depth was sufficient 3 2 2 compositions of microbial communities at the phylum level altogether 21 bacterial phyla and two archaeal phyla were detected from all of the as samples fig 1 the most dominant phylum in terms of average abundance in all samples was proteobacteria 46 0 followed by bacteroidetes 17 7 acidobacteria 8 5 actinobacteria 3 2 verrucomicrobia 2 1 planctomycetes 2 0 and candidatus saccharibacteria 1 5 the other phyla were rare and accounted for less than 1 0 fig 1 notably the unclassified microbial community at phylum level was found to be more abundant than most identified phyla with an average abundance of 16 4 0 6 52 5 fig 1 the microbial community dynamics showed that the addition of antibiotics caused a great change in the main phyla average abundance 1 in the reactors fig 1 and table s7 proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in different treatments compared with ck the addition of kan and tet significantly increased the abundance of proteobacteria and the percentage reached 95 0 after exposure to 50 mg l 1 tet however the antibiotic concentrations had no obvious influence on the abundance of proteobacteria for most treatments within proteobacteria betaproteobacteria was the most dominant class in all treatments fig s2 and the average abundances were 25 3 16 6 11 2 10 6 41 8 23 7 and 54 4 for ck smz ery lin kan tmp and tet treatment respectively for bacteroidetes the average abundance in each antibiotic treatment was lower than that in ck 30 0 especially for tet in which the average abundance was 3 0 the effects of different antibiotics on the abundance of acidobacteria were distinct and its average abundance in ck 18 4 was higher than that in antibiotic treatments at the lowest concentration of 20 mg l 1 acidobacteria had the highest abundances in the treatments of tmp 23 1 and tet 27 0 and the abundances decreased with increasing concentrations of these antibiotics nevertheless the increasing concentrations of ery and lin increased the abundance of acidobacteria the addition of smz ery and lin led to a great increase in the abundance of actinobacteria especially for smz in which the percentage of actinobacteria accounted for 27 6 at 150 mg l 1 other major phyla including verrucomicrobia planctomycetes and candidatus saccharibacteria were also affected by the presence of antibiotics moreover the addition of some antibiotics also affected the composition of other rare phyla average abundance 1 for example chlamydiae which was not detected in sas at the current sequencing depth was detected in all antibiotic treatments with the average abundances of 0 14 1 8 members of the phyla deinococcus thermus gemmatimonadetes parcubacteria latescibacteria and ignavibacteriae were not able to grow under the selective pressure of antibiotics 3 2 3 compositions of microbial communities at the genus level among the 216 assigned genera in the 100 samples no genus was shared by all samples and a total of 39 genera were generally shared by over half of all samples accounting for average 75 2 of all classified sequences it is worth noting that the unclassified genera in the samples accounted for a very high percentage 33 7 91 0 the genera with an abundance over 0 5 in each sample were selected totally 108 genera for all samples and compared fig s3 meanwhile the dominant genera with an average abundance more than 1 in each treatment were summarized in table s8 and the effects of antibiotic concentrations on these genera were evaluated fig 2 and fig s3 the dominant genera 1 in different treatments varied greatly there were eight genera with an abundance over 1 in sas and the running of reactors caused a great change in the microbial composition at the genus level table s8 for example the dominant genera in smz were aridibacter 7 0 arthrobacter 5 0 geothrix 4 2 ferruginibacter 2 4 plasticicumulans 2 2 and terrimonas 2 1 in other treatments thauera was the most abundant under the selective pressure of kan 21 0 and ery 5 0 the genera rudaea 6 8 plasticicumulans 5 3 geothrix 8 6 accounted for the highest percentages after the addition of lin tmp and tet respectively table s8 there were some genera dominant in more than one treatment such as thauera geothrix and plasticicumulans table s8 moreover the antibiotic concentrations had a remarkable influence on the microbial composition at the genus level fig 2 and fig s3 as the concentration increased some genera became more abundant for example with increasing the concentrations of smz lin kan tmp and tet the abundances of arthrobacter rudaea terrimonas nitrosomonas labrys increased and reached the maximum at the highest antibiotic concentrations respectively however the abundance of some genera first increased and then decreased as the concentration increased for example the abundance of aridibacter increased to the maximum 15 0 at a smz concentration of 120 mg l 1 and noticeably declined to 1 1 at the highest smz concentration 150 mg l 1 3 2 4 identification of potential arb in the present study the bacteria with significant increase of relative abundance after antibiotic treatment could be considered to be potential arb at the phylum level the potential arb were mainly affiliated to proteobacteria bacteroidetes acidobacteria actinobacteria verrucomicrobia and candidatus saccharibacteria fig 1 at the genus level the most noteworthy was those dominant genera in each treatment fig 2 and table s8 adding antibiotics significantly increased the relative abundance of potential arb under different concentrations the selective concentrations for different microbial communities varied greatly for example under smz selective pressure aridibacter was the most abundant at 120 mg l 1 while arthrobacter had the highest abundance at 150 mg l 1 fig 2 in addition some genera such as thauera geothrix and rudaea were found to be resistant to more than one antibiotic fig 2 some new detected genera after exposure to antibiotics with an average abundance below 0 5 should also be paid attention to because these bacterial genera may be arb and play an important role in antibiotic resistance there may be some pathogenic bacteria among the identified arb such as the genus pseudonocardia in ery 3 2 5 similarity analysis of microbial community structures under different antibiotic selective pressures the similarity of the microbial community compositions among different samples was evaluated using nmds analysis bray curtis distance based on the relative abundance of otus fig s4 in general the samples from the same treatment closely clustered with a few exceptions fig s4 for example the samples from kan and tet treatments were not clearly separated nmds analysis revealed a clear separation in the microbial community structure between sas and other treatments the samples from different treatments generally clustered separately and had a significant difference in microbial community compositions adonis r2 0 404 p 0 001 in addition the changes in antibiotic concentrations also resulted in the separation of samples with a significant difference for some treatments including lin adonis r2 0 545 p 0 022 kan adonis r2 0 313 p 0 045 tet adonis r2 0 489 p 0 001 and tmp adonis r2 0 381 p 0 001 3 3 occurrence and abundance of the arg types as shown in fig 3 a the total arg abundances in all selected samples fluctuated greatly in a range from 0 24 sas to 4 73 ratio kan30 2 all treatments had significantly higher abundance of args than sas the addition of kan resulted in the most abundant average 3 28 ratio args in reactors followed by smz 1 85 ratio tet 1 84 ratio tmp 0 93 ratio ery 0 66 ratio and lin 0 43 ratio fig s5a the differences in the arg abundances between ck and antibiotic treatments were investigated by student s t test fig s5a compared with ck adding kan smz tet and tmp significantly increased the arg abundances p 0 05 however the concentrations had no significant effect on the changes in arg abundances for a subset of antibiotics lin ery and tmp fig s5b on the contrary antibiotic concentrations resulted in significant changes in the enrichment of args when exposed to tet smz and kan totally as shown in fig 3a 20 arg types were identified in the 44 selected samples and 14 types were shared by these samples fig 3a the genes conferring resistance to sulfonamide 2 60 10 2 1 10 100 ratio aminoglycoside 1 25 10 2 1 15 100 ratio chloramphenicol 2 75 10 3 1 92 100 ratio tetracycline 2 49 10 2 6 08 10 1 ratio multidrug 4 70 10 2 4 44 10 1 ratio and beta lactam 2 79 10 3 7 82 10 1 ratio were most abundant in all samples having an average abundance of over 0 1 ratio fig 3b accounting for 47 3 97 0 of the total abundances of args as illustrated in fig s6 and fig s7 the antibiotic addition caused significant alterations in the compositions and abundances of dominant arg types for example chloramphenicol and sulfonamide were the two most dominant types in smz treatment fig s6 when the corresponding args enriched after a specific antibiotic treatment e g aminoglycoside resistance genes enriched following kan treatment collateral enrichment of a wide range of non corresponding args was also observed fig s6 and fig s7 in most cases the non corresponding args showed a greater increase and had a higher abundance than the corresponding args it is worth mentioning that ery tmp tet and lin treatments were associated with more abundant sulfonamide resistance genes than their corresponding arg types while chloramphenicol and multidrug resistance genes were the most abundant in smz and lin treatments respectively fig s6 and fig s7 3 4 occurrence and abundance of the arg subtypes in total 491 arg subtypes were detected ranging from 106 to 305 subtypes for each sample fig s8 the abundances of the 491 arg subtypes were at a range of 3 20 10 6 1 92 100 ratio among the 491 arg subtypes a group of 54 arg subtypes that belonged to 13 types were shared by all samples fig 4 and the abundance of the core resistome accounted for 66 7 99 6 of the total arg abundances the args of sul1 chloramphenicol exporter baca aada and tetc were the five most dominant subtypes that were greater than 5 10 2 ratio in average abundance similar to arg types the composition and abundance of dominant arg subtypes between different treatments also varied greatly as shown in fig s8 the arg number after antibiotic treatment was generally lower than that in sas however compared to sas and ck a set of 93 args affiliated to 11 types were newly detected under antibiotic selective pressures and these genes were generally showed a relatively low abundance the number and names of the args occurred in each treatment were illustrated in fig s9 and table s9 it can be seen that the number of beta lactam resistance genes occupied a large proportion from 46 7 to 82 4 3 5 similarity analysis of arg profiles in samples from different treatments in accordance with the abundance of arg subtypes nmds analysis bray curtis distance was used to evaluate the similarity of arg compositions in different samples fig 5 the clustering pattern was mainly affected by the addition of antibiotics there was an obvious discrepancy of the arg profiles between sas and other samples the arg profiles of different treatments clustered separately with a significant difference adonis r2 0 523 p 0 001 the adonis analysis also indicated that antibiotic types significantly affected the arg composition samples from the same treatment were more likely to cluster together fig 5 for example ck kan lin tmp tet and ery formed distinct clusters respectively in addition within the same treatment samples from the same operation stage or the same reactor usually clustered closely with a few exceptions fig 5 3 6 co occurrence associations between microbial community and args as shown in fig s10 on the basis of the nmds analysis of both otus abundances and the arg subtype abundances the result of procrustes analysis indicated that there was a significant correlation between the microbial community and resistome in different samples m2 0 805 p 0 001 meanwhile network analysis was used to explore the patterns of co occurrence between the microbial community and args based on significant positive correlations spearman s ρ 0 6 p 0 01 fig 6 the co occurrence network included 151 nodes 27 genera and 124 arg subtypes and 820 edges the detailed co occurrence associations between genera and args were listed in table s10 according to the hypothesis proposed by li et al 2015 if the args and the co occurred microbial communities exhibited the significantly similar abundance tendencies among different samples ρ 0 6 p 0 01 the microbial taxa could be speculated to be the potential arg hosts as presented in fig 6 and table s10 18 bacterial genera affiliated to six phyla were speculated as the possible hosts of 38 args belonging to 10 types among the 18 genera phenylobacterium was the potential host of the most args including aminoglycoside aada aadb ant 2 i aph 6 i beta lactam carb 6 multidrug mexd and tetracycline teta tetc and tetg resistance genes some genera thiobacillus labrys roseomonas thauera nitrosomonas geothrix vampirovibrio were also found carrying more than or equal to three args other bacterial genera were associated with only one or two args for example dfra14 was correlated with opitutus while tet36 and mext were correlated with zoogloea 3 7 co occurrence patterns among arg subtypes network analysis structurally and statistically demonstrated that args within or across arg types exhibited evident non random co occurrence patterns fig 6 and table s11 on the one hand arg subtypes from the same type including beta lactam and other six types tended to co occur much more 33 4 than expected under random association 14 1 table s11 despite of their different degrees of internal type co occurrence as revealed by the o r ratio particularly args for beta lactam multidrug aminoglycoside and trimethoprim exhibited higher likelihood of non random co occurrence o 16 8 10 4 2 3 and 2 2 respectively compared to that of random positive connections r 7 6 5 6 0 4 and 0 2 respectively on the other hand the arg subtypes that belonged to different types also showed obvious non random co occurrence associations fig 6 and table s11 for instance higher observed co occurrence incidences than random were detected between arg subtypes of trimethoprim and aminoglycoside o 3 7 r 0 6 beta lactam o 10 0 r 2 6 chloramphenicol o 1 7 r 0 4 as well as tetracycline o 1 6 r 0 5 similar patterns of co occurrence were also found between aminoglycoside resistance genes and the genes encoding beta lactam o 6 3 r 3 7 chloramphenicol o 3 1 r 0 5 and tetracycline o 2 8 r 0 7 resistance other significant external type co occurrence included chloramphenicol with beta lactam chloramphenicol with tetracycline and multidrug with bacitracin resistance genes 4 discussion 4 1 microbiota characteristics and occurrence of arb in the present study the diversity indices revealed that the diversity of microbiota obviously declined after adding antibiotics in the reactors and this confirmed the fact that the selected antibiotics would be expected to disturb multiple members of the original microbiota in the sas similar results have been reported in other lab scale experiments treating antibiotic wastewater zhu et al 2017 liu et al 2018 in which significant reduction of the microbiota diversity in response to antibiotic exposure was observed although the addition of antibiotics caused a great change in the composition of main microbial communities in the reactors proteobacteria was the most dominant phylum in different samples and betaproteobacteria was generally the leading class betaproteobacteria was considered as the original source of class 1 integrons which can capture and express various args and is the central player in the worldwide spread of antibiotic resistance gillings et al 2008 for a specific antibiotic it should be noted that some phyla became the dominant communities in comparison to the control groups for instance an increase in the relative abundance of actinobacteria in smz ery and lin treatments was observed known for their ability to synthesize diverse secondary metabolites and for harbouring args actinobacteria could therefore rapidly adapt the environments with high level of antibiotics d costa et al 2011 zhu et al 2018 this is further supported by our results that the genus arthrobacter affiliating to actinobacteria increased significantly at the highest concentration of smz in previous studies the increase of actinobacteria was also reported after continuous exposure to sulfamethoxazole ery or some other antibiotics pala ozkok et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 zhu et al 2018 in addition the presence of antibiotics inhibited the growth of some communities such as bacteroidetes in tet treatment which was also observed in bioreactors operated under tet selective pressure in other studies zhang et al 2016 zhu et al 2017 it should also be noted that antibiotic treatment increased the proportion of unclassified microbial community at different taxonomic levels indicating that these microbiota may play an important role in adapting the antibiotic pressure antibiotics may speed the development or maturation of the unclassified microbiome which could result in higher abundance of unclassified microbial communities in the reactors with antibiotics than those in sas and ck these high proportions of unclassified sequences may belong to as yet uncultured unrecognized or novel bacteria or archaea species sutton et al 2013 therefore further study should be conducted by recovering genome sequences from multiple metagenomes albertsen et al 2013 to explore the taxonomic compositions of these unclassified populations and their responses to antibiotics the concentrations of antibiotics in some environments may be high enough to exert a selective pressure on arb that could lead to an increase in the proliferation of resistance tello et al 2012 it is well known that antibiotic concentrations below the minimal inhibitory concentrations mics can select for arb andersson and hughes 2014 according to the study of bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 the concentrations of antibiotics in our study were much higher than the values of mics and upper boundaries for selective concentrations of certain antibiotics therefore based on the concentrations of different antibiotics that could exert selective pressure on arb in previous studies li et al 2013 bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 le et al 2016 zhu et al 2017 the microbiota which could survive after antibiotic treatment in the reactors can be considered as arb especially for those bacteria with significant increase of relative abundances after antibiotic treatment at the highest concentrations such as arthrobacter following smz subdivision3 genera incertae sedis following ery rudaea following lin terrimonas following kan nitrosomonas following tmp and labrys following tet in fact when some bacterial communities exhibited resistance to antibiotics they may also be involved in the biodegradation of antibiotics vila costa et al 2017 and play a vital role in keeping the stable operation of reactors meng et al 2017 two species affiliated with the genus arthrobacter has been proven to effectively degrade sulfadiazine deng et al 2016 which also belongs to the class of sulfonamides accordingly the genus arthrobacter may contain bacteria capable of degrading smz in this study previous studies have reported that ammonium oxidizing nitrosomonas was the important players in the nitrogen cycle and participated in the biological removal of tmp and other antibiotics rodriguez sanchez et al 2017 gonzalez martinez et al 2018 in the present study smz ery and lin were identified to undergo biodegradation in the corresponding as reactors thus antibiotic degrading species can co exist together with sensitive species when an antibiotic is externally supplied dugatkin et al 2005 kelsic et al 2015 antibiotic degrading species can eliminate antibiotics from nearby locations thereby protecting not only themselves but also the neighbouring species kelsic et al 2015 besides antibiotics including kan tet and tmp were hardly biodegraded in the reactors and may persist for a long time thus exerting a long term selective pressure on microbial communities and promoting the resistance development bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 at the genus level there were some noteworthy genera with high abundance under antibiotic stress such as thauera geothrix rudaea aridibacter conexibacter terrimonas etc some may be resistant to multiple antibiotics for example thauera belonging to betaproteobacteria was the dominant genus in almost all antibiotic treatments in particular kan thauera has been reported in other studies because of its adaptation to antibiotic pressure and capability for antibiotic degradation zhu et al 2017 miran et al 2018 high abundance of rudaea was detected in wastewater treatment systems contaminated with aromatic compounds and rudaea had the potential for the degradation of these pollutants qu et al 2015 2016 however whether rudaea can degrade antibiotics such as lin needs to be further explored besides in depth study should be carried out to demonstrate the roles of these dominant genera in the systems with high concentration of antibiotics moreover the major genera in a specific antibiotic treatment in our study were considerably different with those in other studies with the same antibiotic addition take tet as an example because of its extensive use in veterinary and high detection frequency in environments zhang et al 2015 it was the most commonly chosen target to investigate its effect on the characteristics of microbial community and args li et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 liu et al 2018 li et al 2013 found that haliea microbacterium and paracoccus were the dominant genera in saline as under the selective pressure of tet 5 mg l 1 and 20 mg l 1 zhang et al 2016 reported that the genus nakamurella affiliating to actinobacteria phylum accounted for a larger proportion 55 2 in as samples with the addition of tet from 5 μg l 1 to 10 mg l 1 in addition the clear differences in the compositions of dominant genera with previous studies were also observed under the selective pressure of smz yergeau et al 2012 ery pala ozkok et al 2014 lin li et al 2016 and tmp kong et al 2017 it can be inferred that the behavior of microbiota under the selective pressure of antibiotics was associated with the added concentrations of antibiotics operating conditions of reactors seed sludge characteristics and wastewater compositions etc 4 2 args occurrence under the selective pressure of antibiotics hts based metagenomics approach was used in this study to provide a comprehensive insight into the occurrence of args under the selective pressure of antibiotics as many as 491 arg subtypes that belonged to 20 arg types were detected and sulfonamide aminoglycoside chloramphenicol tetracycline multidrug and beta lactam resistance genes were generally the most dominant in each treatment compared with the seed sludge the addition of antibiotics exerted a direct selection pressure for the enrichment of args thus remarkably increased the total arg abundances in the as consistent results were observed in previous studies when antibiotics were added in lab scale reactors for treating wastewater containing high level of antibiotics aydin et al 2015a zhang et al 2016 guo et al 2017 numerous studies also showed that high concentration of antibiotics in pharmaceutical wastewater hospital wastewater and livestock farms promoted the occurrence and proliferation of args cheng et al 2013 wang et al 2015 szekeres et al 2017 antibiotic treatment is expected to selectively increase the abundance of resistant microorganisms this will lead to increased prevalence of their args and hence enhance the chance of their dissemination via horizontal gene transfer hgt sommer and dantas 2011 meanwhile the presence of antibiotics may affect the mutation and recombination rates of bacteria thi et al 2011 and promote biofilm formation balcázar et al 2015 in the reactors to some extent these processes are involved in antibiotic resistance development although the arg abundances were increased the presence of antibiotics decreased the diversity of resistance genes within an individual sample and this may be caused by the decrease of species richness that is high antibiotic concentrations could inhibit the growth of some microbes or kill some microbes which carrying args and thus decreased the detected arg number our results demonstrated that the abundance of args varied greatly among the antibiotic treatments indicating that different antibiotics had very different selective capabilities kan treatment leaded to the highest arg abundances while ery and lin treatments resulted in relatively lower arg abundances ery and lin are corresponding to the resistance type of macrolide lincosamide streptogramin mls while some unknown args belonging to mls may not be included by the current used arg database causing the underestimation of arg profiles of mls although smz was obviously biodegraded in the reactors it resulted in a higher arg abundance lin et al 2017 noted that most sulfonamide degrading bacteria could be sulfonamide resistant and may carry sulfonamide resistance genes including sul1 and sul2 vila costa et al 2017 reported that microbial degradation of sulfonamides was an efficient resistance mechanism coupled with the presence of args consequently the differences in the arg abundances among these treatments may be directly linked to the types of antibiotics it is worth noting that the abundance of args increased even in the absence of antibiotic and the most dominant arg type was bacitracin which was clearly different with those in antibiotic treatments bacitracin resistance gene baca may be intrinsic in bacteria as its homologues can be found in 153 genera hu et al 2013 during the operation of the ck reactors there was no additional carbon sources except those provided by wastewater the poor nutrition status may exert considerable influence on the microbiota structure and the development of args in terms of a specific antibiotic treatment the abundance of corresponding args were generally increased and the results were similar to other studies zhang et al 2016 he et al 2017 tang et al 2017 in which the antibiotic classes were consistent with our study moreover collateral enrichment of a wide range of non corresponding args was also observed after a specific antibiotic treatment indicating potential for co selection of other args on the one hand the progressive accumulation of spontaneous mutations under a given antibiotic selection simultaneously can change the bacteria s sensitivity to many other antibiotics causing the acceleration of resistance acquisition suzuki et al 2017 on the other hand the collateral effects are frequently delivered by hgt lázár et al 2014 both mutations and hgt have crucial contribution to the evolution of multiple resistance patterns in a broad range of bacterial species lázár et al 2013 our results indicated that sulfonamide resistance genes were more easily to be developed than other types of args this collateral resistome change following a specific antibiotic was also reported by other researchers who investigated effects of antibiotics on the development of gut resistome looft et al 2012 gibson et al 2016 wang et al 2017 gibson et al 2016 hold that the collateral effects of added antibiotics probably resulted from a single microorganism encoding diverse args in other words indirect selection of resistance to antibiotics not added could occur when two or more genes are present on the same chromosome plasmid transposon or integron looft et al 2012 sommer et al 2017 this congregation of args on mobile genetic elements mges could be beneficial to the fitness of a bacterium living in the constant presence of antibiotics looft et al 2012 sommer et al 2017 therefore metagenomic assembly should be conducted to reveal the prevalent multiple resistance clusters encoded by the microbiota and to identify the associations of args with mges in the environments containing high level of antibiotics gibson et al 2016 wang et al 2017 additionally it should be noted that antibiotics do not exist separately in the influents of pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants and their transformed compounds might also change the diversity and abundance of arb and args in this environment consequently the effects of co existence of various antibiotics and their transformed compounds on the occurrence of arb and args should be investigated in the future in the present study the influence of antibiotic concentrations on the occurrence of args was investigated with increasing antibiotic concentrations the change tendency of arg composition and abundance in different treatments exhibited an obvious discrepancy among the target antibiotic types in our study sulfonamides and tetracyclines were most often reported with respect to the effects of their concentrations on the change of arg abundances guo et al 2017 observed a significant positive correlation between the abundance of sul1 and the added concentrations of sulfonamides from 0 001 mg l 1 to 10 mg l 1 along the wastewater treatment process their results were in agreement with our findings for smz treatment he et al 2017 found that the occurrence of tetracycline resistance genes in fish tanks was related to the increase in tet concentration and the relative abundance reached the maximum when the added tet concentration was highest 3 mg l 1 zhang et al 2013 also reported that the tetracycline resistance genes in sequencing batch reactors increased as the tet concentration increased on the contrary fan and he 2011 highlighted that lower concentration of ery or ery h2o in the environment encouraged the proliferation of args and found that the biodegradation products of ery may be linked with the development of antibiotic resistance in this study the six selected antibiotics were added in reactors with different concentrations which were much higher than those previously reported although the added concentrations of kan tet and tmp were lower than smz ery and lin the arg abundances were relatively higher than others except for smz this may be because these antibiotics were absorbed or stable during the treatment process and exerted a long term selective pressure on the development of args aydin et al 2015b it can be concluded that the effects of antibiotic concentrations on the occurrence of args may depend on the fate of antibiotics in the environments and the microbiota structures the results also showed that the responses of different arg types to the concentrations of a specific associated antibiotic varied obviously meaning that the inducement and development of args could be related to the concentration effects of antibiotics on the bacterial groups harboring these genes this observation is consistent with previous studies in fish tanks stimulating fish farming process he et al 2017 and anaerobic reactors for treating pharmaceutical wastewater aydin et al 2015a among the core resistome in the present study the abundant genes such as sul1 aada and tetc were also frequently detected args in antibiotic wastewater treatment systems sun et al 2014 aydin et al 2015a he et al 2017 or in other environments rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 szekeres et al 2017 the high occurrence and proliferation of these genes may be attributed to their association with class 1 integrons which are often embedded into mges such as plasmids and transposons allowing them to become one of the major players in the horizontal transfer of args gillings et al 2015 gillings 2017 indeed previous studies suggested that the environments with high level of antibiotics were potential sources of class 1 integrons associated with antibiotic resistance betteridge et al 2011 le et al 2016 he et al 2017 therefore further study is needed to explore the occurrence of mges and the roles they played in the dissemination of args under the selective pressure of high antibiotic concentrations furthermore nearly half of the 491 detected arg subtypes conferred resistance to beta lactam indicating that beta lactam resistance genes could be prevailing and persistent even though beta lactams were not added despite the abundance of these genes was lower than that of some other subtypes it should not be ignored that these beta lactam resistance genes and other args with low abundance might expand gradually and pose the potential risk to human health 4 3 correlations and co occurrence patterns between microbial taxa and args as illustrated by procrustes analysis the microbial community could be the driving factor of the resistome profiles under the selective pressure of antibiotics however procrustes analysis cannot demonstrate the detailed relationships between the specific microbial taxa and args based on the hypothesis proposed previously li et al 2015 the result of network analysis revealed that 18 bacterial genera were considered as the potential hosts of 38 args in these samples several hosts of args have been confirmed by previous investigations for instance mext the regulator of multidrug efflux system was carried by pseudomonas maseda et al 2004 fetar et al 2011 mycobacterium harbored a plasmid carrying the tetv gene de rossi et al 1998 therefore network analysis provided us new insights into the understanding of the potential hosts of args in different environmental samples li et al 2015 however the co occurrence connections between microbial community and args deciphered by network analysis require further verification via other methods such as culture dependent method munir et al 2011 and metagenomics assembly and binning approach ma et al 2016 the co occurrence patterns among arg subtypes revealed the evident non random co occurrence connections of internal type e g beta lactam and beta lactam and external type e g sulfonamide and aminoglycoside of args in the selected as samples this was well supported by other studies using qpcr approach sun et al 2014 johnson et al 2016 and metagenomic approach ju et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 direct selective pressure exerted by high concentrations of antibiotics may generally cause higher non random co occurrence incidences than random associations between args sun et al 2014 ju et al 2016 moreover the same arg resistance mechanism could be more likely to drive the co occurrence associations ju et al 2016 for example aada catb aac 6 i and carb 6 encoding antibiotic inactivating proteins were found to co occur significantly in the present study besides various co existence mechanisms of diverse args have also been identified in previous studies such as i the resistance genes of aminoglycoside aada1 aac 3 ii and aph 6 i tetracycline teta and tetg sulfonamide sul1 and sul2 and chloramphenicol cata and catb carried by the same genome martins et al 2017 ii plasmid ptre 131 containing a unique accessory region encoding sul1 cat bla oxa 1 and aac 6 ib botts et al 2017 iii a complete class 1 integron carrying aada5 and dfra17 identified on an assembled contig of chicken feces ma et al 2016 and iv mobile gene cassettes conferring co resistance to trimethoprim dfra and aminoglycosides aada poey and laviña 2018 etc 5 conclusions antibiotic selective pressures significantly decreased the microbial diversity altered the composition and structure of the microbial community and especially increased the abundance of unclassified microbial taxa in the as reactors simultaneously antibiotics promoted the occurrence of potential arb metagenomic approach comprehensively deciphered the occurrence of args in the as reactors high antibiotic selective pressures significantly increased the abundance of args but obviously reduced the diversity of args the composition and abundance of args varied greatly among different antibiotic treatments and at different antibiotic concentrations the direct selective pressure of a given antibiotic resulted in the enrichment of both corresponding and non corresponding types of args revealing the collateral effects of antibiotics on the resistance development the results also demonstrated that the arg compositions were significantly related to microbial community and the significant non random co occurrence associations between microbiota and args presented a possible method to track the potential hosts of multiple args acknowledgements the authors thank the national natural science foundation of china no 51508302 shenzhen knowledge

19080,currently the effects of high antibiotic concentrations on the performance of microbiota and antibiotic resistance genes args in activated sludge as process are not well characterized lab scale batch reactors were performed to evaluate the dynamics of microbial community and args in response to six antibiotics at different concentrations using high throughput sequencing based 16s rrna gene and metagenomic analyses the presence of antibiotics remarkably decreased the microbial diversity caused a great change of the microbiota structure and exerted a selective pressure on the enrichment of potential antibiotic resistant bacteria arb such as arthrobacter thauera geothrix rudaea aridibacter conexibacter terrimonas etc high antibiotic selective pressures increased arg abundance but simultaneously reduced arg number in total 491 arg subtypes belonging to 20 arg types were detected and kanamycin treatment showed the highest arg abundances a core set of 54 arg subtypes that accounted for 66 7 99 6 of the total arg abundances were shared by all samples the increase of the abundances of both corresponding and non corresponding args under a specific antibiotic treatment revealed the collateral effects of antibiotic selective pressure microbial community may play an important role in the composition of args network analysis indicated that both internal type and external type of args exhibited higher non random co occurrence incidences and 18 genera were speculated as the possible hosts for multiple args this study deciphered the profiles and relationships between microbial community and args in as process treating wastewater with high antibiotic concentrations and could provide helpful guidance for controlling the development and dissemination of arb and args graphical abstract image 1 keywords antibiotics selective pressure microbial community antibiotic resistance genes activated sludge metagenomic analysis 1 introduction antibiotics have been extensively used in veterinary and human medicine as well as in aquaculture because of their significant role in treating microbial infections and in promoting growth sarmah et al 2006 kümmerer 2009 global antibiotic consumption increased by 65 between 2000 and 2015 and the increase was primarily driven by increased consumption in low and middle income countries klein et al 2018 according to a survey of antibiotic uses in china in 2013 the total antibiotic production was 248 000 tons and the total usage was approximately 162 000 tons of which 48 was used in humans and 52 in animals zhang et al 2015 however the inappropriate use of antibiotics worldwide in recent years has not only resulted in the chemical pollution in the environment but also inevitably increased the development and subsequent dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes args and antibiotic resistant bacteria arb see table s1 list of abbreviations used in the text andremont and walsh 2015 various classes of antibiotics via un metabolized forms can enter sewage systems and water environments principally through human waste animal waste and pharmaceutical manufacturing waste marshall and levy 2011 qiao et al 2018 in aquatic environments some antibiotics are easily degraded whereas others are considerably more persistent thus prevailing for longer times in the environment and accumulating to higher concentrations larsson 2014a multiple studies have found high concentrations of antibiotics at mg l 1 level in different environments such as pharmaceutical industrial effluents hospital effluents livestock wastewater and sewage treatment plants sim et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 larsson 2014b for example extremely high levels of tetracycline 11 9 mg l 1 oxytetracycline 41 8 mg l 1 trimethoprim 92 2 mg l 1 lincosamides 201 mg l 1 and cephalosporins 80 0 mg l 1 residues were detected in raw influents of different pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants in china wang et al 2015 guo et al 2018 the presence of high concentrations of antibiotics can trigger conspicuous variations of wastewater treatment microbial communities and affect the stable operation of treatment system meng et al 2017 strikingly the selective pressure exerted by the antibiotics can also increase the frequency of horizontal transfer of args from arb to human pathogens in the antibiotic wastewater treatment plants and their receiving environments directly posing a serious threat to human and animal health allen et al 2010 sharma et al 2016 currently the effects of high concentrations of antibiotics on the compositions of microbial communities and the dissemination of args have been explored in lab scale aydin et al 2015a zhang et al 2016 pilot scale nõlvak et al 2013 liu et al 2014 and full scale wang et al 2015 tang et al 2017 studies for treating antibiotic production wastewater however previous studies generally used culture dependent and polymerase chain reaction pcr based methods to explore the occurrence of corresponding args of a certain antibiotic owing to limited availability of primers only several antibiotics and their corresponding args such as args to sulfonamides tetracyclines fluoroquinolones and macrolides were covered in previous studies because of the collateral selective effects of antibiotics and the possibility of args transferring to human pathogens looft et al 2012 it is important to comprehensively comprehend the occurrence and abundance of both corresponding and non corresponding args under the selective pressure of a specific antibiotic the comprehensive effects of a certain antibiotic on the occurrence of non corresponding args in antibiotic wastewater treatment systems have been rarely reported consequently the high throughput sequencing hts based metagenomic approach was utilized in the present research to fully investigate the args occurrence under high antibiotic concentrations the metagenomic approach would avoid underestimating of the antibiotic resistome profiles and supply more comprehensive datasets for evaluating the ecological risks of args in the environments containing high levels of antibiotics zhao et al 2018 in addition given that different antibiotics have different selective capabilities turnidge and christiansen 2005 it is essential to compare and evaluate the dynamics of microbiome and resistome in response to different classes of antibiotics in this study six antibiotics with high production and consumption i e sulfamethazine smz erythromycin ery lincomycin lin tetracycline tet kanamycin kan and trimethoprim tmp were selected as the target selective pressure lab scale batch reactors of activated sludge as process were established by adding these antibiotics with high concentrations to simulate the raw antibiotic production wastewater the objectives were 1 to compare and evaluate the effects of high concentrations of antibiotics on the microbial community compositions and to identify the potential arb 2 to comprehensively characterize the arg profiles including corresponding and non corresponding types under high selective pressure of antibiotics using the hts based metagenomic analysis and 3 to decipher the relations of microbiota with resistome and the co occurrence patterns among microbial taxa and args via network analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 target antibiotics based on a recent report on the national consumption discharges and environmental fate of 36 antibiotics commonly detected in china zhang et al 2015 six antibiotics belonging to six classes were selected as the targets in this study information of these antibiotics was provided in detail in table s2 all antibiotics were purchased from sigma aldrich 2 2 batch experiments design and operation seed activated sludge sas and wastewater were collected from a local municipal wastewater treatment plant in south china to start up batch reactors 50 ml as were initially used as the inoculum in each reactor to simulate as process for treating wastewater with high antibiotic concentrations the mixed liquor suspended solids concentrations in the reactors were approximately 1000 mg l 1 before operation the raw wastewater was firstly filtered with 0 22 μm glass fiber membrane diameter 47 mm millipore usa to exclude the influence of microorganisms and provided nutrients and trace elements for microbial growth in the reactors synthetic antibiotic wastewater prepared from the filtered raw wastewater had an initial antibiotic concentration of 20 mg l 1 total organic carbon concentration of approximately 50 mg l 1 and ph of around 7 40 details of chemical analysis of these water quality parameters were described in supplementary information si 2 2 1 the aerobic as reactors were set up in parallel for each antibiotic treatment with a working volume of 500 ml in 1 l brown reagent bottles to prevent possible photo degradation of antibiotics and algal growth to evaluate the effects of antibiotics on the microbial community and args a control treatment ck without antibiotic addition was set up simultaneously totally 14 lab scale batch reactors for seven treatments were operated in this study they were maintained at room temperature 25 2 c and continuously stirred at 200 rpm during the whole experiment for aeration and mixing the concentrations of each antibiotic were step wise increased from 20 mg l 1 to a final level according to their removal behaviors through successive stages as shown in table 1 it should be pointed out that the high concentrations of antibiotics were set according to their concentrations present in the influents of pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants rather than the municipal wastewater or natural environment the start up period of reactors were operated at 20 mg l 1 for two months as a stable stage i e stage 1 during each stage table s3 homogenized mixed liquor was taken from each reactor and immediately processed for antibiotic concentration determination si 2 2 1 the detailed sampling information and the replacement procedures of synthetic antibiotic wastewater were described in si 2 2 2 another mixed liquor sample was taken before moving into the next stage the collected samples were mixed with 100 ethanol at a volume ratio of 1 1 immediately for biomass fixation and were stored at 20 c before dna extraction 2 3 dna extraction the as samples of 10 ml fixed by ethanol were firstly centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 15 min and then the pellets were collected for subsequent dna extraction fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals usa was used to extract dna following the manufacturer s manuals dna quality was assessed via 1 agarose gel electrophoresis and dna concentrations were quantified by nanodrop one spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific usa the obtained dna samples were kept in a refrigerator at 80 c for further application 2 4 16s rrna gene sequencing and microbial community analysis the 16s rrna gene v4 region was amplified using the primer pair f515 and r806 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 5 ggactacvsgggtatctaat 3 respectively caporaso et al 2012 the standard pcr assays were performed as described previously kozich et al 2013 the amplicons were purified quantified and pooled at an equimolar ratio sequencing was performed on the illumina miseq platform pe250 strategy at novogene tianjin china the raw sequences were processed using mothur software v 1 36 following the standard pipeline schloss et al 2009 the post quality filtering reads after chimera and singletons removal were then normalized to 18224 clean sequences for each sample the average length of obtained reads was 273 bp the uparse pipeline was used to pick up operational taxonomic units otus at 97 similarity edgar 2013 for each otu the representative sequence was assigned taxonomic annotation according to the ribosomal database project rdp classifier v 2 11 with a confidence threshold of 80 wang et al 2007 2 5 metagenomic sequencing and args analysis before metagenomic sequencing 16s rrna gene was sequenced and the microbial community composition of all samples was analyzed the results indicated that the antibiotic concentrations had a significant effect on the microbial composition at phylum and genus levels and the differences of microbial community compositions at stage 2 stage 4 and stage 7 were more significant and representative see the results section in addition the concentrations of added antibiotics at stage 2 stage 4 and stage 7 represented the low medium and high levels respectively therefore samples from stage 2 stage 4 and stage 7 table s4 were selected for metagenomic sequencing and args analysis for each sample about 5 μg of dna was used for library construction with an insert size of 350 bp and then sequenced on the illumina hiseq 4000 platform pe150 strategy at novogene tianjin china the detailed library construction procedures were described in si 2 5 approximately 15 gb raw reads were generated for each sample the related information of metagenomic datasets for each sample was summarized in table s5 all the raw metagenomic reads were filtered and normalized to 44361843 clean reads before downstream analysis si 2 5 the online analysis pipeline for args i e args oap http smile hku hk sargs was used to identify and annotate arg like reads yang et al 2016 the structured arg sarg database consisting of 24 arg types and 1209 subtypes was used in args oap yang et al 2016 arg types and subtypes were identified automatically using a package of customized scripts as proposed by yang et al 2016 resistance types represent the class of antibiotics to which args confer resistance such as type tetracycline resistance genes resistance subtypes represent individual kinds of args such as subtype teta of tetracycline resistance genes arg abundances were finally quantified by the normalization of 16s rrna gene copy numbers and expressed as copy of arg per copy of 16s rrna gene named the ratio thereafter according to our previous study li et al 2015 2 6 data analysis and network analysis the various alpha diversity indices were calculated using past software v 3 20 a p value 0 05 was considered to be significant for all statistical tests the difference between the means of two independent groups was analyzed with the student s t test via spss software v 17 0 ibm corp usa non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis adonis analysis and procrustes analysis were performed in r v 3 5

with vegan igraph and hmisc packages and network graphs were visualized using gephi v 0 9 2 li et al 2015 in the network the random r and observed o incidences of internal type and external type co occurrence connections were statistically checked and calculated according to ju et al 2016 the details of network analysis and some topological properties of the network were described in si 2 6 3 results 3 1 antibiotics removal characteristics as shown in fig s1 the six antibiotics showed different removal characteristics in the as reactors our results revealed that smz ery and lin were mainly removed by biodegradation while kan and tet were mainly removed by adsorption however when kan and tet reached a saturated adsorption status desorption which increased the liquid antibiotic concentrations occurred in the as process tmp was adsorbed negligibly and no biodegradation occurred in the as process detailed results analysis and discussion were summarized in si 3 1 3 2 characterization of microbial communities 3 2 1 diversity of microbial communities after filtering trimming and chimera checking there were a total of 3209941 effective reads for all the 100 samples the number of high quality reads per sample ranged from 18224 to 46539 table s6 which were normalized to 18224 sequences for each sample and were clustered into 4545 otus mean 383 table s6 at 97 similarity cutoff based on the diversity indices table s6 the sas had the richest diversity the shannon simpson evenness and chao 1 indices of samples under antibiotic pressure were significantly lower than those of sas samples for each antibiotic treatment further increase of antibiotic concentrations had no significant effect on these indices table s6 good s coverage ranging from 98 4 to 99 6 table s6 suggested the otus of each sample were well captured and the sequencing depth was sufficient 3 2 2 compositions of microbial communities at the phylum level altogether 21 bacterial phyla and two archaeal phyla were detected from all of the as samples fig 1 the most dominant phylum in terms of average abundance in all samples was proteobacteria 46 0 followed by bacteroidetes 17 7 acidobacteria 8 5 actinobacteria 3 2 verrucomicrobia 2 1 planctomycetes 2 0 and candidatus saccharibacteria 1 5 the other phyla were rare and accounted for less than 1 0 fig 1 notably the unclassified microbial community at phylum level was found to be more abundant than most identified phyla with an average abundance of 16 4 0 6 52 5 fig 1 the microbial community dynamics showed that the addition of antibiotics caused a great change in the main phyla average abundance 1 in the reactors fig 1 and table s7 proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in different treatments compared with ck the addition of kan and tet significantly increased the abundance of proteobacteria and the percentage reached 95 0 after exposure to 50 mg l 1 tet however the antibiotic concentrations had no obvious influence on the abundance of proteobacteria for most treatments within proteobacteria betaproteobacteria was the most dominant class in all treatments fig s2 and the average abundances were 25 3 16 6 11 2 10 6 41 8 23 7 and 54 4 for ck smz ery lin kan tmp and tet treatment respectively for bacteroidetes the average abundance in each antibiotic treatment was lower than that in ck 30 0 especially for tet in which the average abundance was 3 0 the effects of different antibiotics on the abundance of acidobacteria were distinct and its average abundance in ck 18 4 was higher than that in antibiotic treatments at the lowest concentration of 20 mg l 1 acidobacteria had the highest abundances in the treatments of tmp 23 1 and tet 27 0 and the abundances decreased with increasing concentrations of these antibiotics nevertheless the increasing concentrations of ery and lin increased the abundance of acidobacteria the addition of smz ery and lin led to a great increase in the abundance of actinobacteria especially for smz in which the percentage of actinobacteria accounted for 27 6 at 150 mg l 1 other major phyla including verrucomicrobia planctomycetes and candidatus saccharibacteria were also affected by the presence of antibiotics moreover the addition of some antibiotics also affected the composition of other rare phyla average abundance 1 for example chlamydiae which was not detected in sas at the current sequencing depth was detected in all antibiotic treatments with the average abundances of 0 14 1 8 members of the phyla deinococcus thermus gemmatimonadetes parcubacteria latescibacteria and ignavibacteriae were not able to grow under the selective pressure of antibiotics 3 2 3 compositions of microbial communities at the genus level among the 216 assigned genera in the 100 samples no genus was shared by all samples and a total of 39 genera were generally shared by over half of all samples accounting for average 75 2 of all classified sequences it is worth noting that the unclassified genera in the samples accounted for a very high percentage 33 7 91 0 the genera with an abundance over 0 5 in each sample were selected totally 108 genera for all samples and compared fig s3 meanwhile the dominant genera with an average abundance more than 1 in each treatment were summarized in table s8 and the effects of antibiotic concentrations on these genera were evaluated fig 2 and fig s3 the dominant genera 1 in different treatments varied greatly there were eight genera with an abundance over 1 in sas and the running of reactors caused a great change in the microbial composition at the genus level table s8 for example the dominant genera in smz were aridibacter 7 0 arthrobacter 5 0 geothrix 4 2 ferruginibacter 2 4 plasticicumulans 2 2 and terrimonas 2 1 in other treatments thauera was the most abundant under the selective pressure of kan 21 0 and ery 5 0 the genera rudaea 6 8 plasticicumulans 5 3 geothrix 8 6 accounted for the highest percentages after the addition of lin tmp and tet respectively table s8 there were some genera dominant in more than one treatment such as thauera geothrix and plasticicumulans table s8 moreover the antibiotic concentrations had a remarkable influence on the microbial composition at the genus level fig 2 and fig s3 as the concentration increased some genera became more abundant for example with increasing the concentrations of smz lin kan tmp and tet the abundances of arthrobacter rudaea terrimonas nitrosomonas labrys increased and reached the maximum at the highest antibiotic concentrations respectively however the abundance of some genera first increased and then decreased as the concentration increased for example the abundance of aridibacter increased to the maximum 15 0 at a smz concentration of 120 mg l 1 and noticeably declined to 1 1 at the highest smz concentration 150 mg l 1 3 2 4 identification of potential arb in the present study the bacteria with significant increase of relative abundance after antibiotic treatment could be considered to be potential arb at the phylum level the potential arb were mainly affiliated to proteobacteria bacteroidetes acidobacteria actinobacteria verrucomicrobia and candidatus saccharibacteria fig 1 at the genus level the most noteworthy was those dominant genera in each treatment fig 2 and table s8 adding antibiotics significantly increased the relative abundance of potential arb under different concentrations the selective concentrations for different microbial communities varied greatly for example under smz selective pressure aridibacter was the most abundant at 120 mg l 1 while arthrobacter had the highest abundance at 150 mg l 1 fig 2 in addition some genera such as thauera geothrix and rudaea were found to be resistant to more than one antibiotic fig 2 some new detected genera after exposure to antibiotics with an average abundance below 0 5 should also be paid attention to because these bacterial genera may be arb and play an important role in antibiotic resistance there may be some pathogenic bacteria among the identified arb such as the genus pseudonocardia in ery 3 2 5 similarity analysis of microbial community structures under different antibiotic selective pressures the similarity of the microbial community compositions among different samples was evaluated using nmds analysis bray curtis distance based on the relative abundance of otus fig s4 in general the samples from the same treatment closely clustered with a few exceptions fig s4 for example the samples from kan and tet treatments were not clearly separated nmds analysis revealed a clear separation in the microbial community structure between sas and other treatments the samples from different treatments generally clustered separately and had a significant difference in microbial community compositions adonis r2 0 404 p 0 001 in addition the changes in antibiotic concentrations also resulted in the separation of samples with a significant difference for some treatments including lin adonis r2 0 545 p 0 022 kan adonis r2 0 313 p 0 045 tet adonis r2 0 489 p 0 001 and tmp adonis r2 0 381 p 0 001 3 3 occurrence and abundance of the arg types as shown in fig 3 a the total arg abundances in all selected samples fluctuated greatly in a range from 0 24 sas to 4 73 ratio kan30 2 all treatments had significantly higher abundance of args than sas the addition of kan resulted in the most abundant average 3 28 ratio args in reactors followed by smz 1 85 ratio tet 1 84 ratio tmp 0 93 ratio ery 0 66 ratio and lin 0 43 ratio fig s5a the differences in the arg abundances between ck and antibiotic treatments were investigated by student s t test fig s5a compared with ck adding kan smz tet and tmp significantly increased the arg abundances p 0 05 however the concentrations had no significant effect on the changes in arg abundances for a subset of antibiotics lin ery and tmp fig s5b on the contrary antibiotic concentrations resulted in significant changes in the enrichment of args when exposed to tet smz and kan totally as shown in fig 3a 20 arg types were identified in the 44 selected samples and 14 types were shared by these samples fig 3a the genes conferring resistance to sulfonamide 2 60 10 2 1 10 100 ratio aminoglycoside 1 25 10 2 1 15 100 ratio chloramphenicol 2 75 10 3 1 92 100 ratio tetracycline 2 49 10 2 6 08 10 1 ratio multidrug 4 70 10 2 4 44 10 1 ratio and beta lactam 2 79 10 3 7 82 10 1 ratio were most abundant in all samples having an average abundance of over 0 1 ratio fig 3b accounting for 47 3 97 0 of the total abundances of args as illustrated in fig s6 and fig s7 the antibiotic addition caused significant alterations in the compositions and abundances of dominant arg types for example chloramphenicol and sulfonamide were the two most dominant types in smz treatment fig s6 when the corresponding args enriched after a specific antibiotic treatment e g aminoglycoside resistance genes enriched following kan treatment collateral enrichment of a wide range of non corresponding args was also observed fig s6 and fig s7 in most cases the non corresponding args showed a greater increase and had a higher abundance than the corresponding args it is worth mentioning that ery tmp tet and lin treatments were associated with more abundant sulfonamide resistance genes than their corresponding arg types while chloramphenicol and multidrug resistance genes were the most abundant in smz and lin treatments respectively fig s6 and fig s7 3 4 occurrence and abundance of the arg subtypes in total 491 arg subtypes were detected ranging from 106 to 305 subtypes for each sample fig s8 the abundances of the 491 arg subtypes were at a range of 3 20 10 6 1 92 100 ratio among the 491 arg subtypes a group of 54 arg subtypes that belonged to 13 types were shared by all samples fig 4 and the abundance of the core resistome accounted for 66 7 99 6 of the total arg abundances the args of sul1 chloramphenicol exporter baca aada and tetc were the five most dominant subtypes that were greater than 5 10 2 ratio in average abundance similar to arg types the composition and abundance of dominant arg subtypes between different treatments also varied greatly as shown in fig s8 the arg number after antibiotic treatment was generally lower than that in sas however compared to sas and ck a set of 93 args affiliated to 11 types were newly detected under antibiotic selective pressures and these genes were generally showed a relatively low abundance the number and names of the args occurred in each treatment were illustrated in fig s9 and table s9 it can be seen that the number of beta lactam resistance genes occupied a large proportion from 46 7 to 82 4 3 5 similarity analysis of arg profiles in samples from different treatments in accordance with the abundance of arg subtypes nmds analysis bray curtis distance was used to evaluate the similarity of arg compositions in different samples fig 5 the clustering pattern was mainly affected by the addition of antibiotics there was an obvious discrepancy of the arg profiles between sas and other samples the arg profiles of different treatments clustered separately with a significant difference adonis r2 0 523 p 0 001 the adonis analysis also indicated that antibiotic types significantly affected the arg composition samples from the same treatment were more likely to cluster together fig 5 for example ck kan lin tmp tet and ery formed distinct clusters respectively in addition within the same treatment samples from the same operation stage or the same reactor usually clustered closely with a few exceptions fig 5 3 6 co occurrence associations between microbial community and args as shown in fig s10 on the basis of the nmds analysis of both otus abundances and the arg subtype abundances the result of procrustes analysis indicated that there was a significant correlation between the microbial community and resistome in different samples m2 0 805 p 0 001 meanwhile network analysis was used to explore the patterns of co occurrence between the microbial community and args based on significant positive correlations spearman s ρ 0 6 p 0 01 fig 6 the co occurrence network included 151 nodes 27 genera and 124 arg subtypes and 820 edges the detailed co occurrence associations between genera and args were listed in table s10 according to the hypothesis proposed by li et al 2015 if the args and the co occurred microbial communities exhibited the significantly similar abundance tendencies among different samples ρ 0 6 p 0 01 the microbial taxa could be speculated to be the potential arg hosts as presented in fig 6 and table s10 18 bacterial genera affiliated to six phyla were speculated as the possible hosts of 38 args belonging to 10 types among the 18 genera phenylobacterium was the potential host of the most args including aminoglycoside aada aadb ant 2 i aph 6 i beta lactam carb 6 multidrug mexd and tetracycline teta tetc and tetg resistance genes some genera thiobacillus labrys roseomonas thauera nitrosomonas geothrix vampirovibrio were also found carrying more than or equal to three args other bacterial genera were associated with only one or two args for example dfra14 was correlated with opitutus while tet36 and mext were correlated with zoogloea 3 7 co occurrence patterns among arg subtypes network analysis structurally and statistically demonstrated that args within or across arg types exhibited evident non random co occurrence patterns fig 6 and table s11 on the one hand arg subtypes from the same type including beta lactam and other six types tended to co occur much more 33 4 than expected under random association 14 1 table s11 despite of their different degrees of internal type co occurrence as revealed by the o r ratio particularly args for beta lactam multidrug aminoglycoside and trimethoprim exhibited higher likelihood of non random co occurrence o 16 8 10 4 2 3 and 2 2 respectively compared to that of random positive connections r 7 6 5 6 0 4 and 0 2 respectively on the other hand the arg subtypes that belonged to different types also showed obvious non random co occurrence associations fig 6 and table s11 for instance higher observed co occurrence incidences than random were detected between arg subtypes of trimethoprim and aminoglycoside o 3 7 r 0 6 beta lactam o 10 0 r 2 6 chloramphenicol o 1 7 r 0 4 as well as tetracycline o 1 6 r 0 5 similar patterns of co occurrence were also found between aminoglycoside resistance genes and the genes encoding beta lactam o 6 3 r 3 7 chloramphenicol o 3 1 r 0 5 and tetracycline o 2 8 r 0 7 resistance other significant external type co occurrence included chloramphenicol with beta lactam chloramphenicol with tetracycline and multidrug with bacitracin resistance genes 4 discussion 4 1 microbiota characteristics and occurrence of arb in the present study the diversity indices revealed that the diversity of microbiota obviously declined after adding antibiotics in the reactors and this confirmed the fact that the selected antibiotics would be expected to disturb multiple members of the original microbiota in the sas similar results have been reported in other lab scale experiments treating antibiotic wastewater zhu et al 2017 liu et al 2018 in which significant reduction of the microbiota diversity in response to antibiotic exposure was observed although the addition of antibiotics caused a great change in the composition of main microbial communities in the reactors proteobacteria was the most dominant phylum in different samples and betaproteobacteria was generally the leading class betaproteobacteria was considered as the original source of class 1 integrons which can capture and express various args and is the central player in the worldwide spread of antibiotic resistance gillings et al 2008 for a specific antibiotic it should be noted that some phyla became the dominant communities in comparison to the control groups for instance an increase in the relative abundance of actinobacteria in smz ery and lin treatments was observed known for their ability to synthesize diverse secondary metabolites and for harbouring args actinobacteria could therefore rapidly adapt the environments with high level of antibiotics d costa et al 2011 zhu et al 2018 this is further supported by our results that the genus arthrobacter affiliating to actinobacteria increased significantly at the highest concentration of smz in previous studies the increase of actinobacteria was also reported after continuous exposure to sulfamethoxazole ery or some other antibiotics pala ozkok et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 zhu et al 2018 in addition the presence of antibiotics inhibited the growth of some communities such as bacteroidetes in tet treatment which was also observed in bioreactors operated under tet selective pressure in other studies zhang et al 2016 zhu et al 2017 it should also be noted that antibiotic treatment increased the proportion of unclassified microbial community at different taxonomic levels indicating that these microbiota may play an important role in adapting the antibiotic pressure antibiotics may speed the development or maturation of the unclassified microbiome which could result in higher abundance of unclassified microbial communities in the reactors with antibiotics than those in sas and ck these high proportions of unclassified sequences may belong to as yet uncultured unrecognized or novel bacteria or archaea species sutton et al 2013 therefore further study should be conducted by recovering genome sequences from multiple metagenomes albertsen et al 2013 to explore the taxonomic compositions of these unclassified populations and their responses to antibiotics the concentrations of antibiotics in some environments may be high enough to exert a selective pressure on arb that could lead to an increase in the proliferation of resistance tello et al 2012 it is well known that antibiotic concentrations below the minimal inhibitory concentrations mics can select for arb andersson and hughes 2014 according to the study of bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 the concentrations of antibiotics in our study were much higher than the values of mics and upper boundaries for selective concentrations of certain antibiotics therefore based on the concentrations of different antibiotics that could exert selective pressure on arb in previous studies li et al 2013 bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 le et al 2016 zhu et al 2017 the microbiota which could survive after antibiotic treatment in the reactors can be considered as arb especially for those bacteria with significant increase of relative abundances after antibiotic treatment at the highest concentrations such as arthrobacter following smz subdivision3 genera incertae sedis following ery rudaea following lin terrimonas following kan nitrosomonas following tmp and labrys following tet in fact when some bacterial communities exhibited resistance to antibiotics they may also be involved in the biodegradation of antibiotics vila costa et al 2017 and play a vital role in keeping the stable operation of reactors meng et al 2017 two species affiliated with the genus arthrobacter has been proven to effectively degrade sulfadiazine deng et al 2016 which also belongs to the class of sulfonamides accordingly the genus arthrobacter may contain bacteria capable of degrading smz in this study previous studies have reported that ammonium oxidizing nitrosomonas was the important players in the nitrogen cycle and participated in the biological removal of tmp and other antibiotics rodriguez sanchez et al 2017 gonzalez martinez et al 2018 in the present study smz ery and lin were identified to undergo biodegradation in the corresponding as reactors thus antibiotic degrading species can co exist together with sensitive species when an antibiotic is externally supplied dugatkin et al 2005 kelsic et al 2015 antibiotic degrading species can eliminate antibiotics from nearby locations thereby protecting not only themselves but also the neighbouring species kelsic et al 2015 besides antibiotics including kan tet and tmp were hardly biodegraded in the reactors and may persist for a long time thus exerting a long term selective pressure on microbial communities and promoting the resistance development bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 at the genus level there were some noteworthy genera with high abundance under antibiotic stress such as thauera geothrix rudaea aridibacter conexibacter terrimonas etc some may be resistant to multiple antibiotics for example thauera belonging to betaproteobacteria was the dominant genus in almost all antibiotic treatments in particular kan thauera has been reported in other studies because of its adaptation to antibiotic pressure and capability for antibiotic degradation zhu et al 2017 miran et al 2018 high abundance of rudaea was detected in wastewater treatment systems contaminated with aromatic compounds and rudaea had the potential for the degradation of these pollutants qu et al 2015 2016 however whether rudaea can degrade antibiotics such as lin needs to be further explored besides in depth study should be carried out to demonstrate the roles of these dominant genera in the systems with high concentration of antibiotics moreover the major genera in a specific antibiotic treatment in our study were considerably different with those in other studies with the same antibiotic addition take tet as an example because of its extensive use in veterinary and high detection frequency in environments zhang et al 2015 it was the most commonly chosen target to investigate its effect on the characteristics of microbial community and args li et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 liu et al 2018 li et al 2013 found that haliea microbacterium and paracoccus were the dominant genera in saline as under the selective pressure of tet 5 mg l 1 and 20 mg l 1 zhang et al 2016 reported that the genus nakamurella affiliating to actinobacteria phylum accounted for a larger proportion 55 2 in as samples with the addition of tet from 5 μg l 1 to 10 mg l 1 in addition the clear differences in the compositions of dominant genera with previous studies were also observed under the selective pressure of smz yergeau et al 2012 ery pala ozkok et al 2014 lin li et al 2016 and tmp kong et al 2017 it can be inferred that the behavior of microbiota under the selective pressure of antibiotics was associated with the added concentrations of antibiotics operating conditions of reactors seed sludge characteristics and wastewater compositions etc 4 2 args occurrence under the selective pressure of antibiotics hts based metagenomics approach was used in this study to provide a comprehensive insight into the occurrence of args under the selective pressure of antibiotics as many as 491 arg subtypes that belonged to 20 arg types were detected and sulfonamide aminoglycoside chloramphenicol tetracycline multidrug and beta lactam resistance genes were generally the most dominant in each treatment compared with the seed sludge the addition of antibiotics exerted a direct selection pressure for the enrichment of args thus remarkably increased the total arg abundances in the as consistent results were observed in previous studies when antibiotics were added in lab scale reactors for treating wastewater containing high level of antibiotics aydin et al 2015a zhang et al 2016 guo et al 2017 numerous studies also showed that high concentration of antibiotics in pharmaceutical wastewater hospital wastewater and livestock farms promoted the occurrence and proliferation of args cheng et al 2013 wang et al 2015 szekeres et al 2017 antibiotic treatment is expected to selectively increase the abundance of resistant microorganisms this will lead to increased prevalence of their args and hence enhance the chance of their dissemination via horizontal gene transfer hgt sommer and dantas 2011 meanwhile the presence of antibiotics may affect the mutation and recombination rates of bacteria thi et al 2011 and promote biofilm formation balcázar et al 2015 in the reactors to some extent these processes are involved in antibiotic resistance development although the arg abundances were increased the presence of antibiotics decreased the diversity of resistance genes within an individual sample and this may be caused by the decrease of species richness that is high antibiotic concentrations could inhibit the growth of some microbes or kill some microbes which carrying args and thus decreased the detected arg number our results demonstrated that the abundance of args varied greatly among the antibiotic treatments indicating that different antibiotics had very different selective capabilities kan treatment leaded to the highest arg abundances while ery and lin treatments resulted in relatively lower arg abundances ery and lin are corresponding to the resistance type of macrolide lincosamide streptogramin mls while some unknown args belonging to mls may not be included by the current used arg database causing the underestimation of arg profiles of mls although smz was obviously biodegraded in the reactors it resulted in a higher arg abundance lin et al 2017 noted that most sulfonamide degrading bacteria could be sulfonamide resistant and may carry sulfonamide resistance genes including sul1 and sul2 vila costa et al 2017 reported that microbial degradation of sulfonamides was an efficient resistance mechanism coupled with the presence of args consequently the differences in the arg abundances among these treatments may be directly linked to the types of antibiotics it is worth noting that the abundance of args increased even in the absence of antibiotic and the most dominant arg type was bacitracin which was clearly different with those in antibiotic treatments bacitracin resistance gene baca may be intrinsic in bacteria as its homologues can be found in 153 genera hu et al 2013 during the operation of the ck reactors there was no additional carbon sources except those provided by wastewater the poor nutrition status may exert considerable influence on the microbiota structure and the development of args in terms of a specific antibiotic treatment the abundance of corresponding args were generally increased and the results were similar to other studies zhang et al 2016 he et al 2017 tang et al 2017 in which the antibiotic classes were consistent with our study moreover collateral enrichment of a wide range of non corresponding args was also observed after a specific antibiotic treatment indicating potential for co selection of other args on the one hand the progressive accumulation of spontaneous mutations under a given antibiotic selection simultaneously can change the bacteria s sensitivity to many other antibiotics causing the acceleration of resistance acquisition suzuki et al 2017 on the other hand the collateral effects are frequently delivered by hgt lázár et al 2014 both mutations and hgt have crucial contribution to the evolution of multiple resistance patterns in a broad range of bacterial species lázár et al 2013 our results indicated that sulfonamide resistance genes were more easily to be developed than other types of args this collateral resistome change following a specific antibiotic was also reported by other researchers who investigated effects of antibiotics on the development of gut resistome looft et al 2012 gibson et al 2016 wang et al 2017 gibson et al 2016 hold that the collateral effects of added antibiotics probably resulted from a single microorganism encoding diverse args in other words indirect selection of resistance to antibiotics not added could occur when two or more genes are present on the same chromosome plasmid transposon or integron looft et al 2012 sommer et al 2017 this congregation of args on mobile genetic elements mges could be beneficial to the fitness of a bacterium living in the constant presence of antibiotics looft et al 2012 sommer et al 2017 therefore metagenomic assembly should be conducted to reveal the prevalent multiple resistance clusters encoded by the microbiota and to identify the associations of args with mges in the environments containing high level of antibiotics gibson et al 2016 wang et al 2017 additionally it should be noted that antibiotics do not exist separately in the influents of pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants and their transformed compounds might also change the diversity and abundance of arb and args in this environment consequently the effects of co existence of various antibiotics and their transformed compounds on the occurrence of arb and args should be investigated in the future in the present study the influence of antibiotic concentrations on the occurrence of args was investigated with increasing antibiotic concentrations the change tendency of arg composition and abundance in different treatments exhibited an obvious discrepancy among the target antibiotic types in our study sulfonamides and tetracyclines were most often reported with respect to the effects of their concentrations on the change of arg abundances guo et al 2017 observed a significant positive correlation between the abundance of sul1 and the added concentrations of sulfonamides from 0 001 mg l 1 to 10 mg l 1 along the wastewater treatment process their results were in agreement with our findings for smz treatment he et al 2017 found that the occurrence of tetracycline resistance genes in fish tanks was related to the increase in tet concentration and the relative abundance reached the maximum when the added tet concentration was highest 3 mg l 1 zhang et al 2013 also reported that the tetracycline resistance genes in sequencing batch reactors increased as the tet concentration increased on the contrary fan and he 2011 highlighted that lower concentration of ery or ery h2o in the environment encouraged the proliferation of args and found that the biodegradation products of ery may be linked with the development of antibiotic resistance in this study the six selected antibiotics were added in reactors with different concentrations which were much higher than those previously reported although the added concentrations of kan tet and tmp were lower than smz ery and lin the arg abundances were relatively higher than others except for smz this may be because these antibiotics were absorbed or stable during the treatment process and exerted a long term selective pressure on the development of args aydin et al 2015b it can be concluded that the effects of antibiotic concentrations on the occurrence of args may depend on the fate of antibiotics in the environments and the microbiota structures the results also showed that the responses of different arg types to the concentrations of a specific associated antibiotic varied obviously meaning that the inducement and development of args could be related to the concentration effects of antibiotics on the bacterial groups harboring these genes this observation is consistent with previous studies in fish tanks stimulating fish farming process he et al 2017 and anaerobic reactors for treating pharmaceutical wastewater aydin et al 2015a among the core resistome in the present study the abundant genes such as sul1 aada and tetc were also frequently detected args in antibiotic wastewater treatment systems sun et al 2014 aydin et al 2015a he et al 2017 or in other environments rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 szekeres et al 2017 the high occurrence and proliferation of these genes may be attributed to their association with class 1 integrons which are often embedded into mges such as plasmids and transposons allowing them to become one of the major players in the horizontal transfer of args gillings et al 2015 gillings 2017 indeed previous studies suggested that the environments with high level of antibiotics were potential sources of class 1 integrons associated with antibiotic resistance betteridge et al 2011 le et al 2016 he et al 2017 therefore further study is needed to explore the occurrence of mges and the roles they played in the dissemination of args under the selective pressure of high antibiotic concentrations furthermore nearly half of the 491 detected arg subtypes conferred resistance to beta lactam indicating that beta lactam resistance genes could be prevailing and persistent even though beta lactams were not added despite the abundance of these genes was lower than that of some other subtypes it should not be ignored that these beta lactam resistance genes and other args with low abundance might expand gradually and pose the potential risk to human health 4 3 correlations and co occurrence patterns between microbial taxa and args as illustrated by procrustes analysis the microbial community could be the driving factor of the resistome profiles under the selective pressure of antibiotics however procrustes analysis cannot demonstrate the detailed relationships between the specific microbial taxa and args based on the hypothesis proposed previously li et al 2015 the result of network analysis revealed that 18 bacterial genera were considered as the potential hosts of 38 args in these samples several hosts of args have been confirmed by previous investigations for instance mext the regulator of multidrug efflux system was carried by pseudomonas maseda et al 2004 fetar et al 2011 mycobacterium harbored a plasmid carrying the tetv gene de rossi et al 1998 therefore network analysis provided us new insights into the understanding of the potential hosts of args in different environmental samples li et al 2015 however the co occurrence connections between microbial community and args deciphered by network analysis require further verification via other methods such as culture dependent method munir et al 2011 and metagenomics assembly and binning approach ma et al 2016 the co occurrence patterns among arg subtypes revealed the evident non random co occurrence connections of internal type e g beta lactam and beta lactam and external type e g sulfonamide and aminoglycoside of args in the selected as samples this was well supported by other studies using qpcr approach sun et al 2014 johnson et al 2016 and metagenomic approach ju et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 direct selective pressure exerted by high concentrations of antibiotics may generally cause higher non random co occurrence incidences than random associations between args sun et al 2014 ju et al 2016 moreover the same arg resistance mechanism could be more likely to drive the co occurrence associations ju et al 2016 for example aada catb aac 6 i and carb 6 encoding antibiotic inactivating proteins were found to co occur significantly in the present study besides various co existence mechanisms of diverse args have also been identified in previous studies such as i the resistance genes of aminoglycoside aada1 aac 3 ii and aph 6 i tetracycline teta and tetg sulfonamide sul1 and sul2 and chloramphenicol cata and catb carried by the same genome martins et al 2017 ii plasmid ptre 131 containing a unique accessory region encoding sul1 cat bla oxa 1 and aac 6 ib botts et al 2017 iii a complete class 1 integron carrying aada5 and dfra17 identified on an assembled contig of chicken feces ma et al 2016 and iv mobile gene cassettes conferring co resistance to trimethoprim dfra and aminoglycosides aada poey and laviña 2018 etc 5 conclusions antibiotic selective pressures significantly decreased the microbial diversity altered the composition and structure of the microbial community and especially increased the abundance of unclassified microbial taxa in the as reactors simultaneously antibiotics promoted the occurrence of potential arb metagenomic approach comprehensively deciphered the occurrence of args in the as reactors high antibiotic selective pressures significantly increased the abundance of args but obviously reduced the diversity of args the composition and abundance of args varied greatly among different antibiotic treatments and at different antibiotic concentrations the direct selective pressure of a given antibiotic resulted in the enrichment of both corresponding and non corresponding types of args revealing the collateral effects of antibiotics on the resistance development the results also demonstrated that the arg compositions were significantly related to microbial community and the significant non random co occurrence associations between microbiota and args presented a possible method to track the potential hosts of multiple args acknowledgements the authors thank the national natural science foundation of china no 51508302 shenzhen knowledge

19081,permanganate has been used traditionally in drinking water treatment for its oxidation properties and ease of use the concentration of permanganate in treatment conditions is low and difficult to detect a colorimetric method using diethylphenylene diamine dpd oxidation to measure low levels i e less than 6 μm of permanganate in water was developed and applied to quantify permanganate scavenging by dissolved organic matter dom manganese dioxide mno2 particles were shown to interfere with dpd oxidation however particles were removed effectively using 0 1 μm pvdf filters prior to reaction with dpd dom and complexed mn iii were concluded to not interfere with the dpd reaction the dpd method was validated by obtaining the second order rate constant for permanganate reaction with phenol 1 7 0 2 m 1 s 1 and comparing to the rate constant obtained independently by monitoring phenol degradation i e uplc uv 1 6 0 2 m 1 s 1 permanganate reaction with dom isolate samples did not follow pseudo first order kinetics faster reaction rates were observed with higher ionic strength 1 mm versus 5 mm carbonate no change in reaction rates with ph was observed at lower ionic strength 1 mm while at higher ionic strength the reaction rate was faster at ph 7 than at ph 10 in contrast linear kinetics were observed for permanganate reaction with dom in filtered whole water samples these samples showed similar trends with ph and ionic strength as for dom isolates the presented method is valid to quantify permanganate reaction rates with organic contaminants or with natural scavengers graphical abstract image 1 keywords permanganate oxidation kinetics diethylphenylene diamine dpd colorimetry manganese dioxide dissolved organic matter dom 1 introduction permanganate is a versatile oxidant used in synthesis groundwater remediation and drinking water treatment permanganate oxidation has been utilized in organic synthesis and is still investigated actively for nanoparticle synthesis dash et al 2009 ibarra galván et al 2017 wang et al 2015 permanganate is also increasingly being applied during in situ groundwater remediation with over 80 out of 182 in situ oxidation projects employing permanganate oxidation based on the database constructed by krembs et al 2010 huling et al 2017 o connor et al 2018 additionally permanganate oxidation has been applied in drinking water treatment operations for multiple reasons including iron and manganese removal disinfection byproduct reduction taste and odor compound removal zebra mussel growth inhibition and disinfection cherry 1962 colthurst and singer 1982 hamilton 1974 klerks and fraleigh 1991 singer et al 1980 welch 1963 permanganate oxidation research has focused recently on its potential to remove cyanotoxins from drinking water he et al 2016 rodriguez et al 2007 stanford et al 2016 permanganate addition is a particularly attractive oxidative treatment strategy in municipal water production because it is cheap easy to implement and operate and safe to handle for this and other environmental applications it is beneficial to know the rate of reaction between permanganate and the contaminant of interest as well as the rate of reaction between permanganate and natural scavengers including dissolved organic matter dom benjamin and lawler 2013 siegrist et al 2011 there are a few challenges that need to be addressed when measuring permanganate reaction rates in drinking water treatment operations 6 μm permanganate 1 mg l 1 as the potassium salt is typically dosed epa 2015 however the absorbance of the permanganate ion is relatively weak with molar extinction coefficients of only 2440 m 1 cm 1 and 2343 m 1 cm 1 respectively at 526 nm and 546 nm den boef et al 1958 in a standard 1 cm cuvette the corresponding limit of quantitation is 4 μm and the limit of detection is 1 μm by direct absorbance measurements longer cuvettes 5 and 10 cm can be used however they are significantly more costly cuvettes double in cost and cuvette holders 500 and require large sample volumes 17 ml additionally in environmental samples there will likely be interference from other components such as dissolved organic matter dom that absorbs light in the same wavelength range or components that scatter light such as manganese dioxide mno2 particles freeman and john 1985 perez benito 1992 although mno2 particles can be removed by filtration permanganate oxidation reactions are not quenched by filtering alone so mno2 particles will be formed continuously and therefore a direct spectroscopic measurement will have inherent inaccuracies due to mno2 formation an alternative strategy to measure permanganate kinetics is to track the manganese products mn ii and mn iv in the form of mno2 unfortunately permanganate redox mechanisms are not well understood and therefore expected product distributions are unknown which limits our ability to use reaction products as a means to quantify permanganate loss kinetics dash et al 2009 because it is difficult to directly quantify permanganate and its reduction products it is advantageous to have a sensitive indirect method to measure permanganate concentrations the oxidation of diethylphenylene diamine dpd can be used to track permanganate concentrations over time thus allowing permanganate kinetics at low concentrations to be measured accurately colorimetric detection of dpd oxidation is currently used for measuring chlorine residuals in drinking water callaway et al 1995 the dpd method measures oxidant concentration through a redox reaction that results in the formation of a colored radical intermediate fig 1 this radical intermediate has a distinct absorption maximum at 550 nm with a molar extinction coefficient that is much greater than the permanganate ion palin 1975 these characteristics allow for lower limits of quantitation and detection the dpd method is also relatively simple and would allow for the rapid determination of permanganate reaction rate constants for organic contaminants and scavenging potential by environmental constituents herein we present a method for measuring permanganate using dpd oxidation we validate that potential environmental interferents namely mno2 particles dom and complexed mn iii are either removed or nonexistent we show an application of the method to quantify permanganate scavenging by a dom isolate and dom in filtered whole water samples we comment on the effects of ionic strength and ph on the oxidation of dom by permanganate more broadly the dpd method presented can be used to estimate scavenging by natural constituents in environmental systems and quantify permanganate reaction rate constants with contaminants 2 experimental 2 1 materials potassium

coefficients details in si text s1 den boef et al 1958 stock solutions of glsm 250 mgc l 1 and srfa 400 mgc l 1 isolates were prepared and stored in the dark at 4 c whole water samples were filtered

vis spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 2401 pc was set to measure absorbance at 550 nm a strict timing sequence for each sample was employed to control for continued permanganate reaction and for dpd radical color development at time zero 0 25 ml of dpd stock solution was added to a beaker containing 0 25 ml phosphate buffer 0 1 ml of 0 25 m sodium chloride solution was drawn into a syringe followed by 5 ml of the sample with unknown permanganate concentration addition of nacl solution was used to aid particle removal in the subsequent filtration step thirty seconds after mixing in the syringe the subsample was filtered 0 1 μm pvdf filter into the beaker containing the dpd reagent and phosphate buffer color developed to a bright magenta when permanganate was present in the subsample this solution was then stirred and transferred into a 1 cm quartz cuvette sixty seconds after mixing the subsample with the dpd reagent the absorbance at 550 nm was recorded to determine the equivalent permanganate concentration 2 4 kinetic rate constant measurements kinetic rate constants were calculated for permanganate reactions with dom and phenol using typical approaches details in si text s2 observed pseudo first order rate constants kobs s 1 for permanganate reaction with phenol or dom were calculated by fitting data to equation 1 1 l n a t l n a 0 k o b s t where a t m is the analyte concentration at some time t s and a 0 m is the initial analyte concentration for phenol reaction with permanganate a second order bimolecular rate constant was calculated by fitting pseudo first order rate constants according to 2 k o b s k x where k m 1 s 1 is the second order rate constant and x m is the concentration of the reagent present in excess equation 2 was also used to calculate organic carbon normalized rate constants for inter comparison of field samples by dividing the obtained pseudo first order rate constant for reaction with permanganate by the sample total organic carbon measurement mgc l 1 x 2 5 analytical techniques 2 5 1 mno2 particle size analysis dynamic light scattering malvern mastersizer westborough ma usa was used to characterize the size distribution of the mno2 particles formed upon permanganate reaction with dom samples were prepared by allowing permanganate to react with dom in filtered whole water samples for at least 1 h and no longer than three and a half hours prior to analysis approximately 200 ml of the sample were loaded into a small volume dispersion unit for the analysis a polydisperse model was used the mno2 refractive index was assumed to be 2 4 and the density was assumed to be 5 026 g cm 3 ilo and who 2003 malvern 2007 2 5 2 mn iii quantitation to quantify mn iii formed during permanganate reactions with dom the method of madison et al 2011 that measures both mn ii and mn iii was employed briefly α β γ δ tetrakis 4 carboxyphenyl porphine t 4 cp p was synthesized by refluxing 4 carboxybenzaldehyde 0 24 m and freshly distilled pyrrole 0 24 m for 4 h the t 4 cp p crystals were recrystallized using warm methanol and filtered a stock solution of t 4 cp p at a concentration of 200 μm with 1 mm sodium hydroxide was prepared a borate buffer solution that contained 12 5 mm sodium tetraborate 0 02 m hydrochloric acid and 0 15 m imidazole was prepared a cadmium chloride solution was prepared at a concentration of 1 2 mm mn ii standards were prepared over a range of 1 20 μm 60 660 nm effective concentration in cuvette using mncl2 the procedure to quantify combined mn ii and mn iii concentrations was as follows 360 μl stock t 4 cp p 120 μl borate buffer 60 μl cadmium chloride solution and 2 36 ml high purity water were combined in a 1 cm quartz cuvette and mixed an initial absorbance reading was taken prior to initiating the cadmium manganese substitution reaction the reaction was initiated by adding 100 μl of the manganese containing sample into the cuvette and mixing absorbance readings were recorded once per minute for 15 min over the course of the reaction a mn t 4 cp p peak with a maximum at 468 nm develops the absorbance at 468 nm is used to quantify the combined concentration of mn ii and mn iii present in solution permanganate was found to interfere with the t 4 cp p method thus prior to analysis permanganate was quenched with sodium thiosulfate after quenching the amount of mn iv and potentially mn iii was quantified using the dpd method without filtration the filtration step removes mno2 particles so that permanganate may be quantified by the dpd method by removing the filtration step here we were able to measure the total permanaganate remaining plus mno2 formed the difference between the known amount of permanganate added to the solution and the amount of mn iii and mn iv measured with dpd gave an initial estimate of the mn ii present and was compared to the combined mn ii and mn iii concentration found by the t 4 cp p method 2 5 3 phenol kinetic experiments an ultrahigh pressure liquid chromatography uplc waters acquity h class method was used to quantify phenol concentrations details in si text s3 with time to calculate the phenol permanganate kinetic rate constant independently of permanganate concentration changes samples 2 ml were withdrawn at each time point using a glass syringe and permanganate reaction was quenched with excess sodium thiosulfate 10 μl 0 08 m the quenched solution was filtered through a 0 22 μm nylon filter to remove mno2 particles before analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 method validation 3 1 1 linear response it was important to first validate in a high purity water system that permanganate concentrations were linearly related to the dpd radical intermediate absorbance at 550 nm fig 3 for every fresh stock of dpd reagent a new calibration curve was prepared good linearity was observed in all calibration curves r2 0 99 except 1 r2 0 97 si table s1 the calibration curves were also observed to be consistent regardless of slight differences in the reagent stock solution concentration the average slope n 20 was found to be 0 042 0 002 μm 1 the average intercept was found to be 0 002 0 004 au si table s1 on the basis of signal to noise ratio a limit of quantitation for permanganate of 0 15 μm and a limit of detection of 0 06 μm were obtained calculation details in si text s4 use of this indirect method improves the permanganate limit of quantitation and detection by an order of magnitude allowing permanganate to be measured at treatment relevant concentrations 6 μm or 1 1 mg kmno4 l 1 the dpd method was observed to have good precision with relative standard deviations less than 4 most samples had a relative standard deviation of 1 which is the same as the relative standard deviation for our direct spectroscopic measurements of permanganate stock solutions si table s2 3 1 2 timing sequence it was observed in preliminary experiments that the dpd radical signal was dependent on when the dpd reagent and the phosphate buffer were mixed as well as when the absorbance at 550 nm was measured subsequently specifically the radical signal is greatest when the dpd reagent and phosphate buffer were mixed immediately before the permanganate sample was added increasing elapsed time between reagent buffer mixing and permanganate addition resulted in lowered radical signal absorbance si fig s1 accordingly an elapsed time of 30 s was set between mixing of the dpd reagent with the phosphate buffer and addition of the permanganate containing sample to obtain the greatest signal enhancement and to provide consistency across sample measurements that required filtration fig 2 similarly the dpd radical was observed to be unstable with its absorbance intensity decreasing by up to 5 over 20 min depending on the permanganate concentration si fig s2 the time that the absorbance at 550 nm would be measured was fixed at 60 s after the permanganate was mixed with the dpd reagent and phosphate buffer again to balance signal intensity against sample handling consistency it should be noted that this timing scheme is different than the standard dpd method for measuring chlorine residuals which only provides minimal timing recommendations for dichloramine and total chlorine callaway et al 1995 3 1 3 manganese dioxide interference 3 1 3 1 manganese dioxide removal in high purity samples one major interferent in dpd radical absorbance readings is mno2 particles which can be formed during permanganate oxidation reactions and are a known spectrophotometric and electrochemical interferent vanysek 2011 waldemer and tratnyek 2006 mno2 particles absorb light at 525 nm which could overlap with the dpd radical at 550 nm although this interference is expected to be minor at 550 nm waldemer and tratnyek 2006 more significantly based on a thermodynamic framework using standard reduction potentials mno2 is capable of reacting with dpd which would lead to an overestimation of permanganate concentrations if reaction kinetics of mno2 and dpd are fast with respect to the timescale of permanganate reaction with the dpd reagent reactions 1 2 seymour et al 2003 vanysek 2011 reaction 1 m n o 2 4 h 2 e m n 2 2 h 2 o e 0 1 224 v v s s h e reaction 2 d p d h e d p d e 0 0 764 v v s s h e to avoid these potential interferences by mno2 particles a filtration step was implemented and optimized to remove formed particles prior to mixing the permanganate sample with the dpd reagent several filter materials were tested to determine first if permanganate was removed during the filtration step nylon 0 22 μm teflon 0 1 μm and pvdf 0 1 μm the nylon filters removed permanganate so the resultant dpd radical intermediate absorbance in the filtrate was reduced by 20 compared to unfiltered samples si table s3 teflon and pvdf filters also removed permanganate but to a much smaller extent than nylon such that the filtrate dpd radical intermediate absorbance was reduced by only about 3 compared to unfiltered samples si tables s3 and s4 it was determined that a 0 1 μm cutoff filter was able to remove laboratory generated mno2 particles based on direct mno2 absorbance measurements and reaction with the dpd reagent si table s5 0 1 μm pvdf filters were chosen ultimately due to their ease of use potential electrochemical interferences of mno2 particles were further assessed in an experiment with sequential reduction of permanganate by mn ii to form known amounts of mno2 particles reaction 4 incremental additions of 100 μl of 4 mm manganese chloride were made to 500 ml of a 6 μm solution of potassium permanganate kmno4 adams 1960 knocke et al 1987 1992 to form mno2 particles reaction 3 2 h 2 o 3 m n 2 2 m n o 4 5 m n o 2 4 h after a fixed time interval of 10 min following each mn ii addition the absorbance of the solution at 550 nm was recorded to quantify scattering by the formed mno2 particles two subsamples were analyzed by the dpd method an unfiltered sample was used to give the total absorbance from the dpd reaction with permanganate and mno2 and a filtered sample was used to give the absorbance of dpd reactions without mno2 present fig 4 shows the change in manganese species over each interval of permanganate reduction direct absorbance of the sample alone was very low and therefore did not interfere with the dpd radical measurements a gradual increase in sample background absorbance indicates a greater amount of mno2 particles in suspension following sequential mn ii addition aliquots of the sample that were reacted with dpd without filtration effectively gave permanganate concentrations that were unchanged with mn ii additions which suggests that mno2 is reacting with dpd to produce the colored dpd intermediate intended to quantify permanganate the filtered sample measured with the dpd reagent reaction did show a decrease in equivalent permanganate concentration comparison of these measured permanganate concentrations on filtered aliquots to the theoretical permanganate concentrations that were calculated from the mn ii mno4 stoichiometry reaction 4 showed consistency these trends further confirmed that pvdf filters are effective in removing mno2 particles which can interfere with permanganate measurement by reaction with dpd thus the proposed dpd method is an effective means to track permanganate in systems where it undergoes reaction 3 1 3 2 manganese dioxide interference removal in environmental samples to validate that mno2 particles were removed efficiently during kinetic experiments with environmental samples the amount of sodium chloride added to the syringe prior to filtration was varied sodium chloride is added prior to filtration in our dpd method to enhance aggregation of mno2 particles that could be stabilized in colloidal form by complexation with other species in natural water such as dom hunter 1986 lyklema 1991 ionic strength enhanced coagulation of fine mno2 should limit interferences in dpd measurements of permanganate that would result in overestimation of permanganate concentration underestimation of reaction rates in our example application we examined different water quality parameters by examining one filtered whole water sample from an oligotrophic terrestrial lake and one filtered whole water sample from an algae impacted reservoir over a range of 0 23 mm sodium chloride we observe no statistically significant trend in observed rate constants for the two filtered whole water samples tested table 1 kinetic plots si fig s3 thus we concluded that mno2 particles do not interfere with dpd oxidation in environmental samples filter pore size effectiveness was further confirmed by direct observation of mno2 particle size following permanganate reduction in natural samples particle size analysis was conducted on four filtered whole water samples that reacted with 6 μm permanganate for at least 1 h to produce mno2 particles these solutions were then analyzed using dynamic light scattering on a particle size analyzer from these experiments the particle size distribution was determined table 2 it should be noted that because these samples were dilute and a large size distribution was observed the algorithm might be biased towards larger particle diameters hassan et al 2015 hogg 2008 the smallest observed particle size was 0 05 μm while this is below our filter size these particles accounted for less than 0 1 of the total number of particles present in solution thus even if fine particles are present in this solution they would not contribute substantially to dpd radical formation the next smallest observed particle size was 0 2 μm which is larger than the filter cutoff from this we concluded that mno2 particles are being removed upon filtration prior to reaction with the dpd reagent and therefore cannot contribute substantially to the measured dpd radical signal even in environmental samples 3 1 4 method accuracy phenol permanganate kinetic rate constant measurements we measured kinetic rate constants of the bimolecular reaction between permanganate and phenol to validate that permanganate concentrations measured by the dpd method were accurate experimental details can be found in the si text s2 the second order rate constant for the phenol permanganate reaction was determined to be 1 7 0 2 m 1 s 1 when the dpd method was used fig 5 a independent of permanganate concentration measurements a rate constant of 1 6 0 2 m 1 s 1 was obtained by following phenol loss from solution fig 5b these measurements demonstrate that the dpd method can be applied to accurately measure rate constants for permanganate reactions with organic contaminants 3 1 5 environmental interferents another potential interferent in the dpd method in natural water samples is dom dom absorption spectra extend into the visible region and dom is known to be electrochemically active aeschbacher et al 2012 nurmi and tratnyek 2002 sharpless and blough 2014 the extent to which these dom interferences may occur is unknown and therefore must be quantified dom absorption above 400 nm is the same for most samples and thus this mode of interference is likely universal electrochemical interferences however are probably sample specific due to the variability in dom electron donating capacity and would need to be quantified for each sample the reactivity of dom with dpd was investigated in the absence of permanganate addition srfa isolate was suspended 2 5 10 mgc l 1 in a carbonate buffered system and carried through the steps of the dpd procedure the greatest absorbance observed at 550 nm when the srfa isolate was reacted with dpd was 0 005 au the absorbance of the srfa isolate alone was 0 003 au however this difference 0 002 au is typically observed for a blank high purity water that has been carried through the dpd method furthermore the observed sample absorbance spectrum 480 550 nm fig s4 following dpd reagent addition was characteristic of dom with gradual tailing at longer wavelengths and lacked the two discrete peaks characteristic of the dpd radical species filtered whole water samples without permanganate addition were also analyzed directly by the dpd method again the greatest observed absorbance at 550 nm from a whole water sample was 0 002 au and attributed to the dom naturally present in the whole water sample this set of experiments confirms that dom does not interfere with the dpd reagent and therefore permanganate kinetics in the presence of dom can be measured reliably using the dpd method another potential interferent to the dpd method is mn iii it is known that manganese cycles between oxidation states in the environment recently mn iii has been found to be abundant in oxygenated waters through complexation to humic ligands luther et al 2015 oldham et al 2015 2017 if manganese complexation to dom occurs following permanganate oxidation it will be necessary to quantify this interferent as well the standard reduction potential of mn iii is greater than that of mno2 and so it could cause dpd radical absorbance that is enhanced over solely permanganate concentrations reaction 3 vanysek 2011 reaction 4 m n 3 e m n 2 e 0 1 5415 v v s s h e mn iii was generated in solution by mixing permanganate with bisulfite and stabilizing the product species with pyrophosphate to confirm that complexed mn iii is able to react with dpd sun et al 2015 the resultant solution was analyzed with the dpd method the absorbance signal at 550 nm was consistent with the amount of mn iii generated in solution showing that complexed mn iii is able to react with dpd to generate the oxidized dpd radical as expected based on reduction potentials reactions 2 4 si table s6 vanysek 2011 in environmental systems it is believed that dom helps to facilitate cycling between soluble mn ii and insoluble mn iv in the form of mno2 and thus we believe it could be possible to generate complexed mn iii in this way to further investigate this potential source of interference mno2 was generated by mixing mncl2 with permanganate and then dosing the formed mno2 into an srfa solution subsamples of this mixture were analyzed over time using the dpd method a slight increase in signal was observed at 3 min but was below the limit of detection si table s7 this suggests the mn iii may be formed in these reactions but is quickly cycled to dissolved mn ii thus any mn iii complexes that could be formed with dom during permanganate oxidation are relatively unstable and do not interfere with the dpd method total mn ii and mn iii concentrations were measured in our samples to further validate that mn iii is not stable in our systems the dpd method was used without filtration to quantify the amount of manganese present as mno2 after permanganate was quenched with sodium thiosulfate the amount of mn ii present was estimated by taking the difference between the amount of manganese added as permanganate and the amount of manganese present as mno2 as measured by the dpd method we used srfa and a filtered whole water sample from grand lake st mary s to estimate the amount of mn iii being formed table 3 in both cases the concentration of combined mn ii and mn iii is less than the predicted value this suggests that no mn iii is being formed in our systems it was concluded that mn iii is not complexing with dom during permanganate reactions and therefore is not present as an interferent to the dpd method 3 2 method application 3 2 1 permanganate reaction with a dom isolate the dpd method was applied to measure permanganate reaction rates with the algal glsm isolate using this isolate in a carbonate buffer the change in permanganate concentration as a function of time was monitored fig 6 it was observed that permanganate concentrations decrease rapidly at first and then the rate of permanganate consumption by glsm appears to slow this is not unexpected because dom is a complex heterogeneous mixture with many unknown substructures nebbioso and piccolo 2013 sutton and sposito 2005 thorn et al 1989 yan et al 2012 it is possible that permanganate reacts initially with substructures that have large second order permanganate reaction rate constants such as phenols and alkenes waldemer and tratnyek 2006 as those substructures are altered permanganate is only able to react with substructures that have smaller permanganate reaction rate constants such as substituted aromatics ethers and alcohols waldemer and tratnyek 2006 this is speculative because no previous work has attempted to elucidate the components of dom that permanganate reacts with however this series of events would result in the appearance of the permanganate kinetics we present here fig 6 we note that more work is in progress to characterize dom changes induced by permanganate oxidation that will be the subject of a future report the effect of ionic strength on the rate of reaction between the glsm isolate and permanganate was investigated experiments were conducted in a carbonate buffered solution at two concentrations 1 mm and 5 mm and at two ph values 7 and 10 carbonate concentrations were varied to investigate ionic strength effects ionic strength can impact the rate of reaction by stabilizing charged intermediates muller 1994 from fig 6 it is observed that permanganate reacts faster with glsm under higher ionic strength solution conditions here 5 mm carbonate buffer this holds regardless of ph and suggests that charged intermediates are important in the oxidation of glsm components by permanganate the effect of ph on the rate of reaction between the glsm isolate and permanganate was similarly investigated ph is known to change permanganate reaction mechanisms particularly between acidic and basic conditions dash et al 2009 it has also been observed that the charge state of compounds can change reactivity with permanganate as documented for phenols in particular du et al 2012 dom is rich in phenols which are known to have pka values as low as 7 2 when substituted with other functionalities liptak et al 2002 thus it was anticipated that the reactivity of permanganate with the glsm isolate could vary with ph at low ionic strength 1 mm carbonate there is no difference in permanganate concentrations over time between ph 7 and 10 fig 6 at higher ionic strengths 5 mm carbonate it is observed that the permanganate is consumed faster at ph 7 compared to ph 10 fig 6 these trends suggest stabilization of reaction intermediates is more important at neutral ph compared to basic ph five millimolar carbonate is relatively high compared to carbonate concentrations observed in most natural systems however on the basis of ionic strength this concentration is within the range of natural samples 3 2 2 application to filtered whole water samples the permanganate and dom reaction rate constant was obtained by quantifying the change in permanganate concentration over time in filtered whole water samples from the lake erie basin and its tributaries interestingly the permanganate kinetics in whole waters fit pseudo first order kinetic equations well r2 0 95 fig 7 a b all linearized kinetic plots can be found in the si fig s5 this difference in dom reaction kinetics in whole waters compared to dom isolates may be related to the accessibility of dom substructures in the whole water samples namely compounds with slower permanganate reaction rate constants may be more available or uniformly distributed where as compounds with faster permanganate reaction rate constants may not be accessible to the permanganate ion the result appears to be a more uniform distribution of individual rate constants thus yielding more linear apparent permanganate degradation kinetics again this is speculative due to limited prior work to understand permanganate reactions with dom substructures the reactivity trends with ionic strength captured by conductivity and ph are consistent with our observations using the glsm isolate all observed rate constants were normalized to total organic carbon to take into consideration the varying amounts of organic material present between samples increases in conductivity are strongly correlated with increases in permanganate reactivity r2 0 96 which implies the involvement of charged intermediates fig 7 c no trend in permanganate reactivity with dom was observed with ph r2 0 12 fig 7 d it should be noted that only a narrow ph range ph 8 4 9 was investigated it is expected that permanganate reactivity with dom may change more substantially in acidic conditions dash et al 2009 these observations are particularly useful for predicting contaminant oxidation by permanganate in an environmental sample as some permanganate will be scavenged by naturally present dom 3 2 3 relation to known permanganate organic matter reactions this is one of the first reports of permanganate scavenging by dom originating from surface waters kim et al 2018 however permanganate reactions with aquifer organic matter have been studied to optimize in situ chemical oxidation isco remediation strategies petri et al 2011 aquifer organic matter dominates the natural oxidant demand in most aquifer systems petri et al 2011 xu and thomson 2008 2009 aquifer organic matter is thought to be composed of two reactive organic matter pools one that reacts quickly and one that reacts slowly which leads to permanganate consumption being kinetically controlled heiderscheidt et al 2008 hood and thomson 2002 mumford et al 2005 petri et al 2011 xu and thomson 2009 our kinetic results for the algal organic matter isolate at low ionic strengths are strikingly similar to these observations where permanganate is initially rapidly consumed and subsequently the reaction appears to slow fig 6 at higher ionic strengths however the trends appear to be opposite with an initial slow reaction rate followed by an increase in reaction rate around 25 min at high ionic strength dom is known to take on a more compact coiled configuration ghosh and schnitzer 1980 our results are consistent with an interpretation that the dom groups initially accessible at higher ionic strength react slowly with permanganate oxidation of these groups may lead to the creation of more negatively charged functional groups namely carboxylic acids griffith and schnitzer 1975 thereby increasing electrostatic repulsion within the organic matter aggregate under these conditions at later time points the dom may be more opened up so that permanganate can then react with functionalities that previously were inaccessible in the coiled state the dom permanganate kinetics in whole water samples appear to be first order which is in stark contrast to the permanganate reaction rates with aquifer organic matter and the algal organic matter isolate these results imply that the organic matter isolated by ppl spe may not be fully representative of all the organic matter present in the water sample in particular previous studies have noted that ppl spe tends to bias towards smaller polar molecules chambers et al 2016 goss et al 2017 additionally microbial sourced organic matter has been observed in our lab to have lower extraction efficiencies compared to organic matter from terrestrial sources and thus may not be representative of the dom present in the whole water samples when compared with the kinetics for permanganate reactions with aquifer organic matter our results suggest that dom in surface waters is markedly different in composition leading to more uniform reaction rates similar to the kinetic models developed for isco to quantify permanganate scavenging hood and thomson 2002 xu and thomson 2009 our results allow for competition in drinking water treatment plant operations to be incorporated into permanganate dosing 4 conclusions an indirect method using dpd was developed to measure low level permanganate concentrations 0 1 10 μm in water systems the mno2 particles that formed during reaction of permanganate were removed by using pvdf filters this was validated using a known permanganate reduction reaction with mncl2 the dpd method was verified for application to contaminant kinetics measurements by comparison of permanganate phenol rate constants obtained by monitoring permanganate concentrations using the dpd method and by monitoring phenol concentration changes independently the kinetics of a dom isolate reaction with permanganate can be measured and changes in rates of reaction were observed when varying ph at high ionic strengths 5 mm carbonate at lower ionic strengths 1 mm carbonate no rate

19081,permanganate has been used traditionally in drinking water treatment for its oxidation properties and ease of use the concentration of permanganate in treatment conditions is low and difficult to detect a colorimetric method using diethylphenylene diamine dpd oxidation to measure low levels i e less than 6 μm of permanganate in water was developed and applied to quantify permanganate scavenging by dissolved organic matter dom manganese dioxide mno2 particles were shown to interfere with dpd oxidation however particles were removed effectively using 0 1 μm pvdf filters prior to reaction with dpd dom and complexed mn iii were concluded to not interfere with the dpd reaction the dpd method was validated by obtaining the second order rate constant for permanganate reaction with

samples showed similar trends with ph and ionic strength as for dom isolates the presented method is valid to quantify permanganate reaction rates with organic contaminants or with natural scavengers

synthesis dash et al 2009 ibarra galván et al 2017 wang et al 2015 permanganate is also increasingly being applied during in situ groundwater remediation with over 80 out of 182 in situ oxidation projects employing permanganate oxidation based on the database constructed by krembs et al 2010 huling et al 2017 o connor et al 2018 additionally permanganate oxidation has been applied in drinking water treatment operations for multiple reasons including iron and manganese removal disinfection byproduct reduction taste and odor compound removal zebra mussel growth inhibition and disinfection cherry 1962 colthurst and singer 1982 hamilton 1974 klerks and fraleigh 1991 singer et al 1980 welch 1963 permanganate oxidation research has focused recently on its potential to remove cyanotoxins from drinking water he et al 2016 rodriguez et al 2007 stanford et al 2016 permanganate addition is a particularly attractive oxidative treatment strategy in municipal water production because it is cheap easy to implement and operate and safe to handle for this and other environmental applications it is beneficial to know the rate of reaction between permanganate and the contaminant of interest as well as the rate of reaction between permanganate and natural scavengers including dissolved organic matter dom benjamin and lawler 2013 siegrist et al 2011 there are a few challenges that need to be addressed when measuring permanganate reaction rates in drinking water treatment operations 6 μm permanganate 1 mg l 1 as the potassium salt is typically dosed epa 2015 however the absorbance of the permanganate ion is relatively weak with molar extinction coefficients of only 2440 m 1 cm 1 and 2343 m 1 cm 1 respectively at 526 nm and 546 nm den boef et al 1958 in a standard 1 cm cuvette the corresponding limit of quantitation is 4 μm and the limit of detection is 1 μm by direct absorbance measurements longer cuvettes 5 and 10 cm can be used however they are significantly more costly cuvettes double in cost and cuvette holders 500 and require large sample volumes 17 ml additionally in environmental samples there will likely be interference from other components such as dissolved organic matter dom that absorbs light in the same wavelength range or components that scatter light such as manganese dioxide mno2 particles freeman and john 1985 perez benito 1992 although mno2 particles can be removed by filtration permanganate oxidation reactions are not quenched by filtering alone so mno2 particles will be formed continuously and therefore a direct spectroscopic measurement will have inherent inaccuracies due to mno2 formation an alternative strategy to measure permanganate kinetics is to track the manganese products mn ii and mn iv in the form of mno2 unfortunately permanganate redox mechanisms are not well understood and therefore expected product distributions are unknown which limits our ability to use reaction products as a means to quantify permanganate loss kinetics dash et al 2009 because it is difficult to directly quantify permanganate and its reduction products it is advantageous to have a sensitive indirect method to measure permanganate concentrations the oxidation of diethylphenylene diamine dpd can be used to track permanganate concentrations over time thus allowing permanganate kinetics at low concentrations to be measured accurately colorimetric detection of dpd oxidation is currently used for measuring chlorine residuals in drinking water callaway et al 1995 the dpd method measures oxidant concentration through a redox reaction that results in the formation of a colored radical intermediate fig 1 this radical intermediate has a distinct absorption maximum at 550 nm with a molar extinction coefficient that is much greater than the permanganate ion palin 1975 these characteristics allow for lower limits of quantitation and detection the dpd method is also relatively simple and would allow for the rapid determination of permanganate reaction rate constants for organic contaminants and scavenging potential by environmental constituents herein we present a method for measuring permanganate using dpd oxidation we validate that potential environmental interferents namely mno2 particles dom and complexed mn iii are either removed or nonexistent we show an application of the method to quantify permanganate scavenging by a dom isolate and dom in filtered whole water samples we comment on the effects of ionic strength and ph on the oxidation of dom by permanganate more broadly the dpd method presented can be used to estimate scavenging by natural constituents in environmental systems and quantify permanganate reaction rate constants with contaminants 2 experimental 2 1 materials potassium

vis spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 2401 pc was set to measure absorbance at 550 nm a strict timing sequence for each sample was employed to control for continued permanganate reaction and for dpd radical color development at time zero 0 25 ml of dpd stock solution was added to a beaker containing 0 25 ml phosphate buffer 0 1 ml of 0 25 m sodium chloride solution was drawn into a syringe followed by 5 ml of the sample with unknown permanganate concentration addition of nacl solution was used to aid particle removal in the subsequent filtration step thirty seconds after mixing in the syringe the subsample was filtered 0 1 μm pvdf filter into the beaker containing the dpd reagent and phosphate buffer color developed to a bright magenta when permanganate was present in the subsample this solution was then stirred and transferred into a 1 cm quartz cuvette sixty seconds after mixing the subsample with the dpd reagent the absorbance at 550 nm was recorded to determine the equivalent permanganate concentration 2 4 kinetic rate constant measurements kinetic rate constants were calculated for permanganate reactions with dom and phenol using typical approaches details in si text s2 observed pseudo first order rate constants kobs s 1 for permanganate reaction with phenol or dom were calculated by fitting data to equation 1 1 l n a t l n a 0 k o b s t where a t m is the analyte concentration at some time t s and a 0 m is the initial analyte concentration for phenol reaction with permanganate a second order bimolecular rate constant was calculated by fitting pseudo first order rate constants according to 2 k o b s k x where k m 1 s 1 is the second order rate constant and x m is the concentration of the reagent present in excess equation 2 was also used to calculate organic carbon normalized rate constants for inter comparison of field samples by dividing the obtained pseudo first order rate constant for reaction with permanganate by the sample total organic carbon measurement mgc l 1 x 2 5 analytical techniques 2 5 1 mno2 particle size analysis dynamic light scattering malvern mastersizer westborough ma usa was used to characterize the size distribution of the mno2 particles formed upon permanganate reaction with dom samples were prepared by allowing permanganate to react with dom in filtered whole water samples for at least 1 h and no longer than three and a half hours prior to analysis approximately 200 ml of the sample were loaded into a small volume dispersion unit for the analysis a polydisperse model was used the mno2 refractive index was assumed to be 2 4 and the density was assumed to be 5 026 g cm 3 ilo and who 2003 malvern 2007 2 5 2 mn iii quantitation to quantify mn iii formed during permanganate reactions with dom the method of madison et al 2011 that measures both mn ii and mn iii was employed briefly α β γ δ tetrakis 4 carboxyphenyl porphine t 4 cp p was synthesized by refluxing 4 carboxybenzaldehyde 0 24 m and freshly distilled pyrrole 0 24 m for 4 h the t 4 cp p crystals were recrystallized using warm methanol and filtered a stock solution of t 4 cp p at a concentration of 200 μm with 1 mm sodium hydroxide was prepared a borate buffer solution that contained 12 5 mm sodium tetraborate 0 02 m hydrochloric acid and 0 15 m imidazole was prepared a cadmium chloride solution was prepared at a concentration of 1 2 mm mn ii standards were prepared over a range of 1 20 μm 60 660 nm effective concentration in cuvette using mncl2 the procedure to quantify combined mn ii and mn iii concentrations was as follows 360 μl stock t 4 cp p 120 μl borate buffer 60 μl cadmium chloride solution and 2 36 ml high purity water were combined in a 1 cm quartz cuvette and mixed an initial absorbance reading was taken prior to initiating the cadmium manganese substitution reaction the reaction was initiated by adding 100 μl of the manganese containing sample into the cuvette and mixing absorbance readings were recorded once per minute for 15 min over the course of the reaction a mn t 4 cp p peak with a maximum at 468 nm develops the absorbance at 468 nm is used to quantify the combined concentration of mn ii and mn iii present in solution permanganate was found to interfere with the t 4 cp p method thus prior to analysis permanganate was quenched with sodium thiosulfate after quenching the amount of mn iv and potentially mn iii was quantified using the dpd method without filtration the filtration step removes mno2 particles so that permanganate may be quantified by the dpd method by removing the filtration step here we were able to measure the total permanaganate remaining plus mno2 formed the difference between the known amount of permanganate added to the solution and the amount of mn iii and mn iv measured with dpd gave an initial estimate of the mn ii present and was compared to the combined mn ii and mn iii concentration found by the t 4 cp p method 2 5 3 phenol kinetic experiments an ultrahigh pressure liquid chromatography uplc waters acquity h class method was used to quantify phenol concentrations details in si text s3 with time to calculate the phenol permanganate kinetic rate constant independently of permanganate concentration changes samples 2 ml were withdrawn at each time point using a glass syringe and permanganate reaction was quenched with excess sodium thiosulfate 10 μl 0 08 m the quenched solution was filtered through a 0 22 μm nylon filter to remove mno2 particles before analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 method validation 3 1 1 linear response it was important to first validate in a high purity water system that permanganate concentrations were linearly related to the dpd radical intermediate absorbance at 550 nm fig 3 for every fresh stock of dpd reagent a new calibration curve was prepared good linearity was observed in all calibration curves r2 0 99 except 1 r2 0 97 si table s1 the calibration curves were also observed to be consistent regardless of slight differences in the reagent stock solution concentration the average slope n 20 was found to be 0 042 0 002 μm 1 the average intercept was found to be 0 002 0 004 au si table s1 on the basis of signal to noise ratio a limit of quantitation for permanganate of 0 15 μm and a limit of detection of 0 06 μm were obtained calculation details in si text s4 use of this indirect method improves the permanganate limit of quantitation and detection by an order of magnitude allowing permanganate to be measured at treatment relevant concentrations 6 μm or 1 1 mg kmno4 l 1 the dpd method was observed to have good precision with relative standard deviations less than 4 most samples had a relative standard deviation of 1 which is the same as the relative standard deviation for our direct spectroscopic measurements of permanganate stock solutions si table s2 3 1 2 timing sequence it was observed in preliminary experiments that the dpd radical signal was dependent on when the dpd reagent and the phosphate buffer were mixed as well as when the absorbance at 550 nm was measured subsequently specifically the radical signal is greatest when the dpd reagent and phosphate buffer were mixed immediately before the permanganate sample was added increasing elapsed time between reagent buffer mixing and permanganate addition resulted in lowered radical signal absorbance si fig s1 accordingly an elapsed time of 30 s was set between mixing of the dpd reagent with the phosphate buffer and addition of the permanganate containing sample to obtain the greatest signal enhancement and to provide consistency across sample measurements that required filtration fig 2 similarly the dpd radical was observed to be unstable with its absorbance intensity decreasing by up to 5 over 20 min depending on the permanganate concentration si fig s2 the time that the absorbance at 550 nm would be measured was fixed at 60 s after the permanganate was mixed with the dpd reagent and phosphate buffer again to balance signal intensity against sample handling consistency it should be noted that this timing scheme is different than the standard dpd method for measuring chlorine residuals which only provides minimal timing recommendations for dichloramine and total chlorine callaway et al 1995 3 1 3 manganese dioxide interference 3 1 3 1 manganese dioxide removal in high purity samples one major interferent in dpd radical absorbance readings is mno2 particles which can be formed during permanganate oxidation reactions and are a known spectrophotometric and electrochemical interferent vanysek 2011 waldemer and tratnyek 2006 mno2 particles absorb light at 525 nm which could overlap with the dpd radical at 550 nm although this interference is expected to be minor at 550 nm waldemer and tratnyek 2006 more significantly based on a thermodynamic framework using standard reduction potentials mno2 is capable of reacting with dpd which would lead to an overestimation of permanganate concentrations if reaction kinetics of mno2 and dpd are fast with respect to the timescale of permanganate reaction with the dpd reagent reactions 1 2 seymour et al 2003 vanysek 2011 reaction 1 m n o 2 4 h 2 e m n 2 2 h 2 o e 0 1 224 v v s s h e reaction 2 d p d h e d p d e 0 0 764 v v s s h e to avoid these potential interferences by mno2 particles a filtration step was implemented and optimized to remove formed particles prior to mixing the permanganate sample with the dpd reagent several filter materials were tested to determine first if permanganate was removed during the filtration step nylon 0 22 μm teflon 0 1 μm and pvdf 0 1 μm the nylon filters removed permanganate so the resultant dpd radical intermediate absorbance in the filtrate was reduced by 20 compared to unfiltered samples si table s3 teflon and pvdf filters also removed permanganate but to a much smaller extent than nylon such that the filtrate dpd radical intermediate absorbance was reduced by only about 3 compared to unfiltered samples si tables s3 and s4 it was determined that a 0 1 μm cutoff filter was able to remove laboratory generated mno2 particles based on direct mno2 absorbance measurements and reaction with the dpd reagent si table s5 0 1 μm pvdf filters were chosen ultimately due to their ease of use potential electrochemical interferences of mno2 particles were further assessed in an experiment with sequential reduction of permanganate by mn ii to form known amounts of mno2 particles reaction 4 incremental additions of 100 μl of 4 mm manganese chloride were made to 500 ml of a 6 μm solution of potassium permanganate kmno4 adams 1960 knocke et al 1987 1992 to form mno2 particles reaction 3 2 h 2 o 3 m n 2 2 m n o 4 5 m n o 2 4 h after a fixed time interval of 10 min following each mn ii addition the absorbance of the solution at 550 nm was recorded to quantify scattering by the formed mno2 particles two subsamples were analyzed by the dpd method an unfiltered sample was used to give the total absorbance from the dpd reaction with permanganate and mno2 and a filtered sample was used to give the absorbance of dpd reactions without mno2 present fig 4 shows the change in manganese species over each interval of permanganate reduction direct absorbance of the sample alone was very low and therefore did not interfere with the dpd radical measurements a gradual increase in sample background absorbance indicates a greater amount of mno2 particles in suspension following sequential mn ii addition aliquots of the sample that were reacted with dpd without filtration effectively gave permanganate concentrations that were unchanged with mn ii additions which suggests that mno2 is reacting with dpd to produce the colored dpd intermediate intended to quantify permanganate the filtered sample measured with the dpd reagent reaction did show a decrease in equivalent permanganate concentration comparison of these measured permanganate concentrations on filtered aliquots to the theoretical permanganate concentrations that were calculated from the mn ii mno4 stoichiometry reaction 4 showed consistency these trends further confirmed that pvdf filters are effective in removing mno2 particles which can interfere with permanganate measurement by reaction with dpd thus the proposed dpd method is an effective means to track permanganate in systems where it undergoes reaction 3 1 3 2 manganese dioxide interference removal in environmental samples to validate that mno2 particles were removed efficiently during kinetic experiments with environmental samples the amount of sodium chloride added to the syringe prior to filtration was varied sodium chloride is added prior to filtration in our dpd method to enhance aggregation of mno2 particles that could be stabilized in colloidal form by complexation with other species in natural water such as dom hunter 1986 lyklema 1991 ionic strength enhanced coagulation of fine mno2 should limit interferences in dpd measurements of permanganate that would result in overestimation of permanganate concentration underestimation of reaction rates in our example application we examined different water quality parameters by examining one filtered whole water sample from an oligotrophic terrestrial lake and one filtered whole water sample from an algae impacted reservoir over a range of 0 23 mm sodium chloride we observe no statistically significant trend in observed rate constants for the two filtered whole water samples tested table 1 kinetic plots si fig s3 thus we concluded that mno2 particles do not interfere with dpd oxidation in environmental samples filter pore size effectiveness was further confirmed by direct observation of mno2 particle size following permanganate reduction in natural samples particle size analysis was conducted on four filtered whole water samples that reacted with 6 μm permanganate for at least 1 h to produce mno2 particles these solutions were then analyzed using dynamic light scattering on a particle size analyzer from these experiments the particle size distribution was determined table 2 it should be noted that because these samples were dilute and a large size distribution was observed the algorithm might be biased towards larger particle diameters hassan et al 2015 hogg 2008 the smallest observed particle size was 0 05 μm while this is below our filter size these particles accounted for less than 0 1 of the total number of particles present in solution thus even if fine particles are present in this solution they would not contribute substantially to dpd radical formation the next smallest observed particle size was 0 2 μm which is larger than the filter cutoff from this we concluded that mno2 particles are being removed upon filtration prior to reaction with the dpd reagent and therefore cannot contribute substantially to the measured dpd radical signal even in environmental samples 3 1 4 method accuracy phenol permanganate kinetic rate constant measurements we measured kinetic rate constants of the bimolecular reaction between permanganate and phenol to validate that permanganate concentrations measured by the dpd method were accurate experimental details can be found in the si text s2 the second order rate constant for the phenol permanganate reaction was determined to be 1 7 0 2 m 1 s 1 when the dpd method was used fig 5 a independent of permanganate concentration measurements a rate constant of 1 6 0 2 m 1 s 1 was obtained by following phenol loss from solution fig 5b these measurements demonstrate that the dpd method can be applied to accurately measure rate constants for permanganate reactions with organic contaminants 3 1 5 environmental interferents another potential interferent in the dpd method in natural water samples is dom dom absorption spectra extend into the visible region and dom is known to be electrochemically active aeschbacher et al 2012 nurmi and tratnyek 2002 sharpless and blough 2014 the extent to which these dom interferences may occur is unknown and therefore must be quantified dom absorption above 400 nm is the same for most samples and thus this mode of interference is likely universal electrochemical interferences however are probably sample specific due to the variability in dom electron donating capacity and would need to be quantified for each sample the reactivity of dom with dpd was investigated in the absence of permanganate addition srfa isolate was suspended 2 5 10 mgc l 1 in a carbonate buffered system and carried through the steps of the dpd procedure the greatest absorbance observed at 550 nm when the srfa isolate was reacted with dpd was 0 005 au the absorbance of the srfa isolate alone was 0 003 au however this difference 0 002 au is typically observed for a blank high purity water that has been carried through the dpd method furthermore the observed sample absorbance spectrum 480 550 nm fig s4 following dpd reagent addition was characteristic of dom with gradual tailing at longer wavelengths and lacked the two discrete peaks characteristic of the dpd radical species filtered whole water samples without permanganate addition were also analyzed directly by the dpd method again the greatest observed absorbance at 550 nm from a whole water sample was 0 002 au and attributed to the dom naturally present in the whole water sample this set of experiments confirms that dom does not interfere with the dpd reagent and therefore permanganate kinetics in the presence of dom can be measured reliably using the dpd method another potential interferent to the dpd method is mn iii it is known that manganese cycles between oxidation states in the environment recently mn iii has been found to be abundant in oxygenated waters through complexation to humic ligands luther et al 2015 oldham et al 2015 2017 if manganese complexation to dom occurs following permanganate oxidation it will be necessary to quantify this interferent as well the standard reduction potential of mn iii is greater than that of mno2 and so it could cause dpd radical absorbance that is enhanced over solely permanganate concentrations reaction 3 vanysek 2011 reaction 4 m n 3 e m n 2 e 0 1 5415 v v s s h e mn iii was generated in solution by mixing permanganate with bisulfite and stabilizing the product species with pyrophosphate to confirm that complexed mn iii is able to react with dpd sun et al 2015 the resultant solution was analyzed with the dpd method the absorbance signal at 550 nm was consistent with the amount of mn iii generated in solution showing that complexed mn iii is able to react with dpd to generate the oxidized dpd radical as expected based on reduction potentials reactions 2 4 si table s6 vanysek 2011 in environmental systems it is believed that dom helps to facilitate cycling between soluble mn ii and insoluble mn iv in the form of mno2 and thus we believe it could be possible to generate complexed mn iii in this way to further investigate this potential source of interference mno2 was generated by mixing mncl2 with permanganate and then dosing the formed mno2 into an srfa solution subsamples of this mixture were analyzed over time using the dpd method a slight increase in signal was observed at 3 min but was below the limit of detection si table s7 this suggests the mn iii may be formed in these reactions but is quickly cycled to dissolved mn ii thus any mn iii complexes that could be formed with dom during permanganate oxidation are relatively unstable and do not interfere with the dpd method total mn ii and mn iii concentrations were measured in our samples to further validate that mn iii is not stable in our systems the dpd method was used without filtration to quantify the amount of manganese present as mno2 after permanganate was quenched with sodium thiosulfate the amount of mn ii present was estimated by taking the difference between the amount of manganese added as permanganate and the amount of manganese present as mno2 as measured by the dpd method we used srfa and a filtered whole water sample from grand lake st mary s to estimate the amount of mn iii being formed table 3 in both cases the concentration of combined mn ii and mn iii is less than the predicted value this suggests that no mn iii is being formed in our systems it was concluded that mn iii is not complexing with dom during permanganate reactions and therefore is not present as an interferent to the dpd method 3 2 method application 3 2 1 permanganate reaction with a dom isolate the dpd method was applied to measure permanganate reaction rates with the algal glsm isolate using this isolate in a carbonate buffer the change in permanganate concentration as a function of time was monitored fig 6 it was observed that permanganate concentrations decrease rapidly at first and then the rate of permanganate consumption by glsm appears to slow this is not unexpected because dom is a complex heterogeneous mixture with many unknown substructures nebbioso and piccolo 2013 sutton and sposito 2005 thorn et al 1989 yan et al 2012 it is possible that permanganate reacts initially with substructures that have large second order permanganate reaction rate constants such as phenols and alkenes waldemer and tratnyek 2006 as those substructures are altered permanganate is only able to react with substructures that have smaller permanganate reaction rate constants such as substituted aromatics ethers and alcohols waldemer and tratnyek 2006 this is speculative because no previous work has attempted to elucidate the components of dom that permanganate reacts with however this series of events would result in the appearance of the permanganate kinetics we present here fig 6 we note that more work is in progress to characterize dom changes induced by permanganate oxidation that will be the subject of a future report the effect of ionic strength on the rate of reaction between the glsm isolate and permanganate was investigated experiments were conducted in a carbonate buffered solution at two concentrations 1 mm and 5 mm and at two ph values 7 and 10 carbonate concentrations were varied to investigate ionic strength effects ionic strength can impact the rate of reaction by stabilizing charged intermediates muller 1994 from fig 6 it is observed that permanganate reacts faster with glsm under higher ionic strength solution conditions here 5 mm carbonate buffer this holds regardless of ph and suggests that charged intermediates are important in the oxidation of glsm components by permanganate the effect of ph on the rate of reaction between the glsm isolate and permanganate was similarly investigated ph is known to change permanganate reaction mechanisms particularly between acidic and basic conditions dash et al 2009 it has also been observed that the charge state of compounds can change reactivity with permanganate as documented for phenols in particular du et al 2012 dom is rich in phenols which are known to have pka values as low as 7 2 when substituted with other functionalities liptak et al 2002 thus it was anticipated that the reactivity of permanganate with the glsm isolate could vary with ph at low ionic strength 1 mm carbonate there is no difference in permanganate concentrations over time between ph 7 and 10 fig 6 at higher ionic strengths 5 mm carbonate it is observed that the permanganate is consumed faster at ph 7 compared to ph 10 fig 6 these trends suggest stabilization of reaction intermediates is more important at neutral ph compared to basic ph five millimolar carbonate is relatively high compared to carbonate concentrations observed in most natural systems however on the basis of ionic strength this concentration is within the range of natural samples 3 2 2 application to filtered whole water samples the permanganate and dom reaction rate constant was obtained by quantifying the change in permanganate concentration over time in filtered whole water samples from the lake erie basin and its tributaries interestingly the permanganate kinetics in whole waters fit pseudo first order kinetic equations well r2 0 95 fig 7 a b all linearized kinetic plots can be found in the si fig s5 this difference in dom reaction kinetics in whole waters compared to dom isolates may be related to the accessibility of dom substructures in the whole water samples namely compounds with slower permanganate reaction rate constants may be more available or uniformly distributed where as compounds with faster permanganate reaction rate constants may not be accessible to the permanganate ion the result appears to be a more uniform distribution of individual rate constants thus yielding more linear apparent permanganate degradation kinetics again this is speculative due to limited prior work to understand permanganate reactions with dom substructures the reactivity trends with ionic strength captured by conductivity and ph are consistent with our observations using the glsm isolate all observed rate constants were normalized to total organic carbon to take into consideration the varying amounts of organic material present between samples increases in conductivity are strongly correlated with increases in permanganate reactivity r2 0 96 which implies the involvement of charged intermediates fig 7 c no trend in permanganate reactivity with dom was observed with ph r2 0 12 fig 7 d it should be noted that only a narrow ph range ph 8 4 9 was investigated it is expected that permanganate reactivity with dom may change more substantially in acidic conditions dash et al 2009 these observations are particularly useful for predicting contaminant oxidation by permanganate in an environmental sample as some permanganate will be scavenged by naturally present dom 3 2 3 relation to known permanganate organic matter reactions this is one of the first reports of permanganate scavenging by dom originating from surface waters kim et al 2018 however permanganate reactions with aquifer organic matter have been studied to optimize in situ chemical oxidation isco remediation strategies petri et al 2011 aquifer organic matter dominates the natural oxidant demand in most aquifer systems petri et al 2011 xu and thomson 2008 2009 aquifer organic matter is thought to be composed of two reactive organic matter pools one that reacts quickly and one that reacts slowly which leads to permanganate consumption being kinetically controlled heiderscheidt et al 2008 hood and thomson 2002 mumford et al 2005 petri et al 2011 xu and thomson 2009 our kinetic results for the algal organic matter isolate at low ionic strengths are strikingly similar to these observations where permanganate is initially rapidly consumed and subsequently the reaction appears to slow fig 6 at higher ionic strengths however the trends appear to be opposite with an initial slow reaction rate followed by an increase in reaction rate around 25 min at high ionic strength dom is known to take on a more compact coiled configuration ghosh and schnitzer 1980 our results are consistent with an interpretation that the dom groups initially accessible at higher ionic strength react slowly with permanganate oxidation of these groups may lead to the creation of more negatively charged functional groups namely carboxylic acids griffith and schnitzer 1975 thereby increasing electrostatic repulsion within the organic matter aggregate under these conditions at later time points the dom may be more opened up so that permanganate can then react with functionalities that previously were inaccessible in the coiled state the dom permanganate kinetics in whole water samples appear to be first order which is in stark contrast to the permanganate reaction rates with aquifer organic matter and the algal organic matter isolate these results imply that the organic matter isolated by ppl spe may not be fully representative of all the organic matter present in the water sample in particular previous studies have noted that ppl spe tends to bias towards smaller polar molecules chambers et al 2016 goss et al 2017 additionally microbial sourced organic matter has been observed in our lab to have lower extraction efficiencies compared to organic matter from terrestrial sources and thus may not be representative of the dom present in the whole water samples when compared with the kinetics for permanganate reactions with aquifer organic matter our results suggest that dom in surface waters is markedly different in composition leading to more uniform reaction rates similar to the kinetic models developed for isco to quantify permanganate scavenging hood and thomson 2002 xu and thomson 2009 our results allow for competition in drinking water treatment plant operations to be incorporated into permanganate dosing 4 conclusions an indirect method using dpd was developed to measure low level permanganate concentrations 0 1 10 μm in water systems the mno2 particles that formed during reaction of permanganate were removed by using pvdf filters this was validated using a known permanganate reduction reaction with mncl2 the dpd method was verified for application to contaminant kinetics measurements by comparison of permanganate phenol rate constants obtained by monitoring permanganate concentrations using the dpd method and by monitoring phenol concentration changes independently the kinetics of a dom isolate reaction with permanganate can be measured and changes in rates of reaction were observed when varying ph at high ionic strengths 5 mm carbonate at lower ionic strengths 1 mm carbonate no rate differences occurred between ph 7 and 10 dpd can quantify permanganate scavenging by natural competitors in environmental samples which could be beneficial for dosing estimates in water treatment

19082,in this study mno2 coated fe3o4 nanocomposite fe3o4 mno2 was utilized to decompose h2o2 to remove dyes via advanced oxidation processes and adsorptive bubble separation advanced abs system the combination of h2o2 and fe3o4 mno2 generated bubbles and formed a stable foam layer in the presence of a surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate sds or cetyltrimethylammonium chloride ctac separating dye from the solution on the basis of radical quenching experiments electron paramagnetic resonance and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses it was confirmed that the mno2 shell of catalyst was reduced to mn2o3 by h2o2 generating radicals and oxygen gas for the removal of dyes in the advanced abs system oh and 1o2 were the main radical species and the o2 concentrations of 0 34 and 0 71 mm were increased in the solution and headspace respectively the advanced abs system demonstrated a high removal efficiency of methylene blue mb 99 0 and the removal rate increased with increasing amounts of components h2o2 catalyst and sds also the advanced abs system maintained high removal efficiency of mb at a wide ph range of 3 9 in addition to the anionic surfactant of sds ctac was applied as a cationic surfactant for the advanced abs of anionic dyes lastly the scale up system was applied to remediate dye contaminated river water and industrial wastewater for possible practical applications graphical abstract image 1 keywords dye fe3o4 mno2 nanocomposite hydrogen peroxide advanced oxidation processes adsorptive bubble separation 1 introduction organic dyes are one of the largest groups of pollutants released into water bodies as textile and other industrial effluents han et al 2009 a dye of even less than 1 ppm concentration can make the transparency of streams reduced along with perishment of aquatic organisms kuo 1992 incomplete removal of dyes and their toxic metabolites from conventional water treatments can impart adverse effects on the animal and human health moawad et al 2003 qu et al 2014 fan et al 2014 cardoso et al 2016 to minimize the negative impact of dyes in the surface water the dyes should be completely removed during the industrial wastewater treatment processes a lot of methods have been developed to treat organic inorganic color reagents including biological treatments kornaros and lyberatos 2006 physical treatments such as adsorption coagulation flocculation and flotation gogate and pandit 2004 and advanced oxidation processes aops using oxidizing agents such as h2o2 s2o8 2 and o3 alaton et al 2002 li et al 2014 however complete removal of dyes and their derivatives in wastewater is not always obtained while each treatment method is effective in decolorization garcía montaño et al 2008 punzi et al 2015 to improve the effluent quality a combination of treatment methods would be necessary for complementation of shortcomings and synergistic effects flotation is one of the practical approaches to separate dyes from solution kabil and ghazy 1994 dafnopatidou and lazaridis 2008 the conventional bubble supply methods produce microbubbles by controlling pressure or using air spargers suzuki and maruyama 2002 the bubbles attach to the particles or soluble ions and float to the surface by buoyancy forces edzwald 2010 which is called the adsorptive bubble separation abs fuerstenau and healy 1972 the abs has been used to separate or to enrich various compounds from solution with distinct advantages low requirements of energy and space and flexible applications to the various pollutants such as minerals surfactants proteins enzymes and microorganisms horng and huang 1993 the abs can selectively separate surface active compounds which tend to move to the air water interface at the air water interface the hydrophobic part of the molecules is organized to expose to the air while the hydrophilic part contacts with the water taylor and triggle 2007 therefore surfactants surface active agents are often used to facilitate the association of contaminants and bubbles non surface active substances become surface active through union with or adsorption on a surfactants eskandarloo et al 2017 also the surfactants play an important role in the accumulation of foam at the top of the solution during foam separation wani et al 2016 basu and malpani 2001 the surfactants of sodium dodecyl sulfate sds sodium lauryl sulfate and cetyltrimethylammonium chloride ctac have been used for the selective dye separation horng and huang 1993 fe3o4 nanoparticles have attracted substantial attention because of their unique magnetic properties and variable surface properties zhao et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 the recoverable bifunctional nanocomposites were developed by modifying the surface of fe3o4 supporter with various metal oxides such as mno2 ceo2 tio2 and wo3 zhao et al 2012 xu and wang 2012 buonsanti et al 2010 xi et al 2011 recently manganese dioxide mno2 has been applied as a peroxide fueled micro motor which derives mechanical force from oxygen generation eskandarloo et al 2017 furthermore it was reported that the decomposition of h2o2 by β mno2 in pyrolusite could generate active radicals such as ho2 and o2 do et al 2009 using these advantages the mno2 particles have been used for aops and abs simultaneously advanced abs system in the presence of h2o2 and surfactant wani et al 2016 he et al 2017 the dual effects of aops and abs demonstrated efficient decolorization of methylene blue mb without external agitation force however previous studies did not attempt to elucidate the mechanism of h2o2 activation on the surface of mno2 the relatively high concentration 5 of h2o2 was used for the abs compared to other studies using h2o2 for oxidative degradation therefore it is necessary to clarify the activation mechanism of h2o2 in the abs through qualitative analysis of the mno2 surface changes as well as the generation of radicals and oxygen while mn is cheaper and more accessible than other noble metals one significant limitation has remained that the added mno2 should be collected by filtration or precipitation for practical applications a number of previous studies have investigated the oxidative reactivity of mno2 towards organic inorganic compounds as well as the release of mn ii ions during the reaction han et al 2011 x wang et al 2017b the released mn ii ions can generate radicals through mn ii mn iii redox cycling in presence of high molecular substances and natural sunlight x wang et al 2018a to overcome this limitation previously we had developed the mno2 coated fe3o4 nanocomposite fe3o4 mno2 via a mild hydrothermal method kim et al 2013 the fe3o4 mno2 had advantages in the large surface area and high magnetic saturation value which could ensure a high probability of contact with other compounds and convenience of separation therefore it has been applied for heavy metal adsorption photocatalytic degradation oxidant activation etc kim et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 liu et al 2015 nevertheless to the best of our knowledge the fe3o4 mno2 has never been used for the advanced abs system even though the fe3o4 mno2 has two distinct advantages that enable h2o2 activation on the mno2 shell and magnetic recovery using the fe3o4 core in the present study the fe3o4 mno2 was tested for the advanced abs system to remove dyes in aqueous solution the detailed mechanism of the advanced abs system was elucidated by monitoring several parameters concentrations of h2o2 mn ions and o2 ph and orp radical quenching experiments electron paramagnetic resonance epr and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analyses to find the optimum condition the effects of h2o2 catalyst surfactant concentrations and ph were evaluated the anionic and cationic surfactants sds and ctac were applied for the advanced abs of cationic dyes mb rhodamine b rb and malachite green oxalate mgo and anionic dyes reactive orange 16 ro16 congo red cr and reactive black 5 rb5 lastly the scaled up repeated efficiencies were confirmed in river water and industrial wastewater samples for the possible practical remediation of dyes 2 materials and methods 2

in water hcl 35 wt hplc grade ethanol hplc grade tertiary butanol tba from merk korea seoul korea ultrapure 18 mω cm deionized di water from a millipore milli q system was used in all the batch experiments 2 2 preparation of fe3o4 mno2 nanocomposite the magnetic nanocomposites were prepared via a simple hydrothermal process kim et al 2013 with a few modifications at first 0 51 g of kmno4 was dissolved in 35 ml of di water and the solution was acidified by adding 0 74 ml of hcl 35 wt dropwise after stirring for 10 min 0 3 g of fe3o4 nanoparticle was added into the solution the mixture was transferred to a teflon lined autoclave 50 ml and sealed to heat at 110 c for 6 h the obtained products were washed with di water and ethanol and then dried under vacuum at 60 c for 24 h the manganese dioxide mno2 was prepared according to the same procedure except for the fe3o4 nanoparticle addition step 2 3 batch experiments to evaluate the removal of dye batch experiments were carried out in a 22 ml bottle containing a reaction volume of 15 ml the dye stock solutions 1000 mg l of mb rb mgo ro16 cr and rb5 and the surfactant stock solutions w v 1 of sds and ctac were prepared in conical tubes wrapped by aluminum foil to block sunlight and used within a week a reaction solution was made by diluting the dye stock solution h2o2 solution v v 30 and surfactant stock solution to make 40 mg l 1 and 0 005 of dye h2o2 and surfactant concentrations respectively unless otherwise noted the 0 0045 g of fe3o4 mno2 0 3 g l was added to the solution which was placed on a magnet to prevent the particles trapped in the foam layer for the mechanistic study synthesized mno2 and commercial fe3o4 nanoparticles were used instead of fe3o4 mno2 most of the experiments were carried out without ph adjustment but the ph was adjusted by the addition of a proper amount of 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh for ph variation experiment a 200 μl portion of the aqueous phase was withdrawn periodically and immediately diluted by 1 8 ml di water for spectrophotometric analysis the river water and industrial wastewater were obtained from the hyeongsan river in april and an industrial wastewater treatment plant in january 2018 pohang south korea they were frozen at 20 c until use the composition of water samples is listed in table s1 the river water and wastewater samples were tested as an above mentioned procedure without any pretreatment all experiments were performed at least in triplicate at ambient temperature 25 1 c and error bars representing standard deviation were depicted in most figures 2 4 scale up experiments the scale up experiments were conducted using 1 l bottle with the diameter of 9 cm and drain holes on the bottom side scheme 1 two magnets with the diameter of 5 cm were installed under the reactor for fixation of the particle the foam generated on the water surface was drawn into a trap bottle by a vacuum pump the mb h2o2 and sds spiked di water river water and wastewater were injected into the reactor repeatedly and the foam was removed spontaneously a 1 ml portion of the aqueous phase was withdrawn at the upper part of the reactor for spectrophotometric analysis 2 5 analytical methods the morphology of nanocomposites was analyzed by the field emission scanning electron microscope sem and energy dispersive spectroscopy eds by using a jeol jsm 7401f instrument jeol ltd tokyo japan magnetic properties of fe3o4 and fe3o4 mno2 were determined using a superconducting quantum interference device squid magnetometer mpms 5 quantum design for crystalline phase identification x ray diffraction xrd patterns were recorded on a panalytical x pert diffractometer x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermal scientific k alpha xps spectrometer was used to investigate the chemical composition of the nanocomposite after the reaction the material was separated from the solution using the magnet and lyophilized at 45 c for one day to observe the surface change using sem eds and xps the oxygen generation was observed and captured by an optical microscope axioskop 40 with 20 objectives the dye concentration was analyzed using a uv vis spectrophotometer at their corresponding maximum wavelength as listed in table s2 the total organic carbon toc content change was detected with a shimadzu toc l cph analyzer changes in the ph oxidation reduction potential orp values and do concentrations were monitored using an orion versa star advanced electrochemistry meter the change of oxygen concentration in the headspace of teflon sealed reactors 57 ml was analyzed using gas chromatography hp6890a hewlett packard co usa equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a molecular sieve 5a column the leached amounts of fe and mn were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes 6300 thermo scientific to characterize the reactive oxygen species generated during the reaction the experiments were conducted in 10 ml of dmpo 10 mm or temp 50 mm solution the 200 μl of the solution was sampled out and analyzed by electron paramagnetic resonance epr a200 bruker under the following conditions microwave power 1 00 mw microwave frequency 9 42 ghz modulation amplitude 2 0 g modulation frequency 100 khz 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of fe3o4 mno2 nanocomposite the morphology of synthesized fe3o4 mno2 nanocomposite measured by sem is shown in figs s1a and b the sem images presented the aggregation of small nanostructured particles and the particle size larger than 2 μm combined with the sem images the element mapping of fe3o4 mno2 showed the existence of o mn and fe elements fig s1c the mn and o were uniformly dispersed on the surface of the particles while fe was presented partially in the core part confirming that the fe3o4 mno2 consisted of fe3o4 core and mno2 shell for the surface characterization xrd patterns of bare fe3o4 synthesized mno2 and fe3o4 mno2 were obtained fig s1d the patterns of fe3o4 mno2 were similar to those of fe3o4 indexed as the fe3o4 face centered cubic phases rather than those of mno2 indexed to the α mno2 phase jcpds card no 44 0141 xu et al 2007 these results could be explained by the amorphous nature of the outer mno2 layers of fe3o4 mno2 according to the large surface area 118 m2 g and mesoporous structure the fe3o4 mno2 would be beneficial for the h2o2 activation on its surface kim et al 2013 the mpms profiles of fe3o4 and fe3o4 mno2 indicated a superparamagnetic behavior fig s1e the saturation magnetization 30 79 emu g 1 of fe3o4 mno2 was less than that of fe3o4 90 24 emu g 1 but the magnetic property of fe3o4 mno2 was strong enough to achieve simple magnetic separation 3 2 removal of mb by the advanced abs system in this study the combination of h2o2 and fe3o4 mno2 was referred to aops and the aops to which the surfactant was added was referred to the advanced abs system regardless of the existence of dye the particles were trapped in the foam layer and descended slowly without magnet while the particles moved quickly down to the bottom in the presence of a magnet increasing the probability of contact between the floating bubbles and the dye sds complex therefore the magnet was set up in all experiments below for high decolorization rates as in fig 1 a the advanced abs system i e a dual effect combining aops and abs showed higher mb removal efficiency 99 0 than the aops 52 3 at the reaction time of 15 min the average mb concentration of accumulated foam was 3 98 1 52 ppm at 15 min indicating that about 10 of the mb was removed by the foam without oxidative degradation the toc values before and after the aops and the advanced abs system were measured to confirm the dye separation fig 1b after the aops 3 90 ppm of toc decreased from the mb control 23 22 ppm however 21 90 ppm of toc was reduced from the mb sds containing solution 29 19 ppm to the advanced abs system treated solution 7 29 ppm indicating that the mb was successfully separated into the foam layer 3 3 mechanistic study 3 3 1 bubble generation the h2o2 can reduce mn iv to mn ii at the mno2 surface and generate oxygen gas as in eq 1 neaman et al 2004 the mno2 has surface chemisorbed oxygen which is highly reactive and mobile because of its loose bonding to the surface kanungo 1979 this type of lattice oxygen o2 can be present in the ionized state and enhance the decomposition of h2o2 as in eq 2 kanungo et al 1981 through these reactions oxygen gas is generated from the reaction between mno2 and h2o2 1 mno2 h2o2 mno h2o o2 2 h2o2 o2 o2 oh oh the bubble generation in the aops and the advanced abs system was confirmed using an optical microscope upon the addition of 1 h2o2 the particles started to produce bubbles abruptly and moved randomly for about 2 h fig 2 a b in the presence of sds the bubbles increased in size and were collected as a combined form fig 2c d because the sds lowered the surface tension between the bubbles and enhanced the stability of bubbles eskandarloo et al 2017 the microbubble is efficient for ion flotation as they rise more slowly with greater contact with chemicals in solution this is due to that the microbubble has a large ratio of surface to volume resulting in higher energy surface to attract target compounds horng and huang 1993 in this study the bubbles generated in the combination of fe3o4 mno2 and h2o2 would be advantageous for the dye sds complex adsorption with their small size 3 3 2 monitoring of reaction parameters to elucidate the reaction mechanism in depth the concentration changes of mb h2o2 and leached mn ions in the advanced abs system were measured for 100 min fig s2a the mb was almost completely eliminated in 20 min but the concentration slightly increased as the foam collapsed over times the generated foam persisted for 60 min with high density indicating that the size of bubbles was fairly uniform in the solution fuerstenau and healy 1972 the 21 1 of h2o2 was decomposed sharply within 4 min follwed by slow decomposition to 12 2 at 100 min it indicated that the reactivity of fe3o4 mno2 was maintained up to 100 min the leached concentration of mn ions peaked at 2 40 ppm at 2 min and rapidly decreased to 1 32 ppm at 4 min and then the concentration was re elevated to 2 27 ppm at 100 min the mn concentration of accumulated foam was 6 41 ppm at the reaction time of 15 min which was higher than that of aqueous phase 1 04 ppm suggesting that the fate of mn ions could be affected by the foam generation and collapse as the foam layer collapsed over time the mn ions adsorbed on the foam could be redissolved to the solution the variations of ph and orp values during the advanced abs reactions are given in fig s2b the ph increased from 5 3 to 7 0 while orp decreased from 311 4 to 212 0 mv within 4 min the reason for the ph increase would be the reactions of eqs 1 and 2 which consume h ions and generate oh ions respectively the orp drop must be ascribed to the consumption of the strong oxidant h2o2 the decrease of orp was alleviated after 4 min from the start of the reaction possibly due to the continuously generated oxygen the concentrations of do and o2 during the advanced abs reactions were measured in solution and headspace respectively fig s3 the do concentration was rapidly saturated to 0 5 mm within 4 min while the o2 concentration of headspace gradually increased from 9 38 mm to 10 09 mm at 40 min the oxygen concentrations of 0 34 and 0 71 mm were increased in the solution and headspace respectively the increased oxygen concentrations clearly indicated that the oxygen bubble was generated from the reaction of fe3o4 mno2 and h2o2 the fe3o4 mno2 consists of the fe3o4 core and the shell of mno2 which is expected to react with most of h2o2 for the possibility of fe3o4 exposure mno2 and fe3o4 were solely tested for the aops and advanced abs of mb the fe3o4 was not reactive for both the aops and the advanced abs system while mno2 showed similar reactivity with those of fe3o4 mno2 fig s4a the mno2 slowly sank onto the bottom forming a layer unlike the fe3o4 mno2 in the advanced abs system fig s4b from the all above results it would be concluded that the h2o2 activation was performed by the mno2 shell of the fe3o4 mno2 nanocomposite 3 3 3 h2o2 activation mechanism the radicals such as hydroxyl radical oh and superoxide radical o2 are generated from the h2o2 activation by mno2 do et al 2009 yu et al 2014 wang et al 2018b the dominant radical species were indirectly confirmed in the aops and advanced abs system by radical quenching experiments in this study tba bq and nan3 were utilized for oh o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 scavengers respectively k tba oh 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 k bq ooh 0 9 1 0 109 m 1s 1 knan3 1o2 4 108 m 1s 1 chong et al 2017 wang et al 2017a schweitzer and schmidt 2003 the mb removal efficiency was improved at a concentration higher than 10 mm for bq while the efficiency decreased as the concentrations of tba and nan3 increased fig s5 therefore 1000 10 and 50 mm of scavenger concentrations were used for tba bq and nan3 respectively the addition of bq decreased the efficiency from 51 3 to 38 6 in the aops indicating that o2 had a contribution to the mb degradation fig s6 on the other hand 1000 and 50 mm of tba and nan3 significantly deactivated the reactions to 10 6 and 9 2 respectively it was reported that nan3 could also possess a quenching effect for oh 3 6 107 s 1 which implied that nan3 quenched oh with 1o2 liang et al 2017 this result demonstrated that oh o2 and 1o2 were generated in the aops in the case of the advanced abs system both tba and nan3 deactivated the mb removal efficiency from 98 8 to 60 3 and 53 6 respectively while bq did not significantly affect the reaction rates this result indicates that the oh and 1o2 act as dominant radicals in the advanced abs system the formation of oh and 1o2 was verified by an epr spin trapping experiment fig 3 a and b the significant dmpo oh signals based on their hyperfine splitting constants ah an 14 9 g in the aops and advanced abs system were confirmed whereas an insignificant signal was found in the dmpo h2o2 solution fig 3a wang et al 2015 chen et al 2017 additionally the specific signals of 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine n oxyl tempo with their hyperfine splitting constant an 1 608 mt were produced from the aops and advanced abs system as in fig 3b wang et al 2016 the intensities of tempo peaks in the aops and advanced abs system were higher than that of the temp h2o2 solution indicating the formation of 1o2 these results demonstrated that oh and 1o2 radicals were generated in the aops and advanced abs system the intensities of dmpo oh and tempo signals in the advanced abs system were slightly lower than that in the aops it might be due that the sds would scavenge oh and 1o2 as reported in previous studies bandala et al 2008 yüksel et al 2009 an xps was also used to characterize the fe3o4 mno2 particles before and after the h2o2 activation the fig 4 a and b presents the mn 2p and o 1s xps spectra before and after the aops the binding energies of mn 2p1 2 and 2p3 2 in the as prepared control sample were centered at 654 1 and 642 3 ev respectively in good agreement with those of α mno2 after the aops for 60 min the binding energies decreased to 653 3 and 642 0 ev for mn 2p1 2 and mn 2p3 2 respectively the decrease of binding energies can be regarded as an indirect indicator of the formal valence changes this result indicated that the mno2 shell was reduced to mn2o3 after the reaction with h2o2 referring to previous literature koleva et al 2013 li et al 2013 the o 1s spectrum of the as prepared sample consisted of two main peaks at 529 8 and 531 2 ev which were attributed to mn o mn and mn o h respectively dai et al 2016 the two peaks showed the relative abundance of lattice oxygen o2 and surface adsorbed oxygen after the aops the intensity of mn o h peak increased while that of mn o mn decreased this trend indirectly demonstrated that the lattice oxygen was consumed for the reaction with h2o2 eq 2 and the mno2 shell was transformed to mn2o3 tang et al 2010 the generation of radicals and oxygen by mn iii or mn iv mediated activation of h2o2 has rarely been dealt with previously based on the above results the reduction of mno2 and radical variation it could be hypothesized that the single electron transfer between surface mn and h2o2 would generate the radicals of oh ho2 and o2 eq 3 7 similar to the iron oxide based fenton like processes pham et al 2012 fang et al 2018 3 mn iv oh h2o2 mn iii ho2 h2o 4 mn iv o h2o2 mn iii oh ho2 5 mn iii h2o2 mn iv oh oh 6 mn iii oh ho2 mn ii h2o o2 7 mn ii h2o2 mn iii oh oh the radical chain reactions could also be proceeded as in eqs 8 12 xu and wang 2012 the generated ooh reacts with h2o2 and decomposes to generate o2 as in eqs 9 and 10 do et al 2009 chong et al 2017 furthermore the reactions between radicals eq 11 and 12 and the electron transfer from o2 to mn iv or mn iii could generate the 1o2 eqs 13 and 14 xu and wang 2012 debnath et al 2016 the overall reactions between h2o2 and mno2 surface are illustrated in scheme 2 8 oh h2o2 ooh h2o 9 ooh h2o2 o2 h2o oh 10 ooh h o2 11 o2 ooh 1o2 ho2 12 o2 oh 1o2 oh 13 mn iv o2 mn iii 1o2 14 mn iii o2 mn ii 1o2 3 4 optimization of experimental conditions to establish an optimum condition for the advanced abs system the effects of the amounts of h2o2 particles and sds were investigated fig 5 a c the individual and combination of two compositions h2o2 particles and sds had negligible ability of the mb removal except for the combination of h2o2 and fe3o4 mno2 aops given that the bubble generation and oxidative degradation were directly related to h2o2 the higher removal efficiency of mb was expected with the increase of initial h2o2 concentration the experimental results showed that the removal of mb increased with increasing h2o2 concentration when the particle concentration was fixed to 0 3 g l fig 5a the mb removal efficiencies were similar at 1 and 1 5 of h2o2 concentrations since the amount of particles reacting to h2o2 was limited as an activator of h2o2 the varied amounts of fe3o4 mno2 were tested in the advanced abs system fig 5b the final removal efficiencies increased from 93 6 to 99 2 at 0 1 and 0 4 g l of the particle amounts respectively the reaction rates increased in the range of 0 1 0 4 g l particle amounts with similar final removal efficiencies without sds 51 3 of mb was degraded by the aops as in fig 5c the mb removal efficiencies increased from 59 3 to 98 3 as the sds dosages increased from 0 001 to 0 005 respectively the reaction rate was lower at a 0 001 surfactant concentration presumably because of the incomplete formation of dye surfactant complex however the removal efficiency decreased to 95 4 at 0 01 of the sds dosage a higher concentration of surfactant can cause the competition of the bubble active sites by the excess surfactant ions with the dye surfactant complex consequently 1 h2o2 0 3 g l fe3o4 mno2 and 0 005 sds were selected as the optimum condition considering the mb removal efficiency and economic effectiveness a previous study of the advanced abs system had used 5 h2o2 and 0 1 sds to remove 32 25 mg l of mb which were much more than those of this study wani et al 2016 the abs method should require the addition of surfactant even though the cost and potential negative impact of surfactant are of great concern however in this study 0 005 of low sds concentration was used the advanced abs system of the optimum condition maintained the high mb removal efficiency 91 8 when the initial mb concentration increased to 70 ppm fig s7 a wide range of ph availability is an essential factor for practical applications to examine the applicability of aops and advanced abs system in real aqueous systems the influence of ph on the removal of mb was investigated fig 5d in the ph range of 4 9 the mb removal efficiencies of the advanced abs system were higher than 98 0 while decreased to 89 2 and 25 2 at ph 3 and 2 respectively the redox potentials of mno2 and h2o2 are given in eqs 15 17 douglas et al 1983 from the eqs 15 and 16 it can be assumed that the redox potential of h2o2 decreases as the ph increases even though the h2o2 can act as both an oxidizer and a reducer of mno2 the main reaction can change depending on the ph as the ph decreases the reduction of mno2 by h2o2 eq 1 might be reduced and result in the decrease of o2 generation this would reduce the efficiency of the advanced abs system considering the role of oxygen to accumulate the mb sds complex into the foam layer also the isoelectric point iep of fe3o mno2 is 3 7 the surface charge becomes positive at the ph lower than iep kim et al 2013 the adsorption of anionic sds to the particle surfaces can inhibit the surface h2o2 reaction when the ph is lower than 3 7 consequently the ph higher than 3 favors the mb removal in the advanced abs system in this regard the advanced abs system showed a remarkable advantage of the wide working ph range for practical applications 15 h2o2 2e 2h 2h2o e0 ph 0 1 776 v 16 ho2 2e h2o 3oh e0 ph 14 0 88 v 17 mno2 s 4h aq 2e mn2 aq 2h2o l e0 1 23 v likewise the efficiency of aops had a decreasing trend as the initial ph decreased from 9 56 9 to 2 16 1 from this result it is likely that the contribution of aops also decreased in the advanced abs system at ph 3 and 4 as the ph decreases the reaction of eq 2 also would be inhibited by protonation of the mno2 surface resulting in the decreased efficiency of aops by reducing the generation of oh and since the radicals are generated as the mno2 is reduced by h2o2 section 3 3 3 the aops should be efficient at high ph where the reducibility of h2o2 is relatively high 3 5 effects of surfactant charge in the abs process contaminants are combined with a surfactant through electrostatic attraction therefore the removable contaminants can be determined by the charge of the surfactant in this study cetyltrimethylammonium chloride ctac a cationic surfactant was used for the comparative study with sds an anionic surfactant the cationic dyes of mb rb and mgo and the anionic dyes of ro16 cr and rb5 were selected for the efficiency test of the advanced abs system the chemical structures of the surfactants and dyes are present in table s2 the removal efficiencies of six dyes by the advanced abs sds system and the advanced abs ctac system are shown in fig 6 the pictures of reactors before and after the reactions are presented in fig s8 the 0 005 of sds concentration was used referring fig 5c for all kinds of dye removal the optimum ctac concentration was 0 01 for the ro16 removal data not shown while 0 005 was the more feasible concentration for the removal of other anionic dyes therefore 0 01 and 0 005 of ctac concentrations were used for ro16 and other anionic dyes respectively the unadjusted initial ph was in the range of 4 1 6 4 as listed in table s3 fig 6a shows that the advanced abs sds system was only reactive toward cationic dyes with the removal efficiencies of 98 8 98 7 and 97 2 for mb rb and mgo respectively on the other hand the advanced abs ctac system was more reactive toward anionic dyes ro16 cr and rb5 but the degree of removal efficiencies was different among three dyes fig 6b 23 6 of rb was removed by the advanced abs ctac system among the cationic dyes it might be because of the amphoteric property of rb osakai et al 2007 when the charges of dye and surfactant were same the anionic dyes ro16 cr and rb5 were not removed in the abs sds system while the cationic dyes mb rb and mgo were removed slightly in the abs ctac system this result indicates that the radical reactions would occur on the negative surface of particles which is more feasible to adsorb cationic dyes without any surfactant the removal efficiency of aops was tested toward the same six dyes fig s9 the order of degradation efficiency was mgo mb rb rb5 cr ro16 showing that the cationic dyes tend to be more degradable than the anionic dyes by the aops the removal efficiencies of cr and rb5 by aops were higher than these of the advanced abs sds system and also same in the advanced abs ctac system for mb and mgo degradation it might be due to that the surfactants act as a scavenger of the radicals additionally the cationic ctac could block the surface of materials competing with the cationic dyes for the surface generated radicals from the results it was concluded that the type of surfactant should be selected beforehand according to the charge of target contaminants 3 6 implementing the advanced abs system for environmental applications the stability and reusability of material are important issues that should be considered before practical applications in this study the spent fe3o4 mno2 was held by a magnet after reactions and freshly prepared solutions replaced the used solutions every 15 min for 7 times the removal efficiencies higher than 98 0 were maintained during five cycles followed by reduction to 97 5 93 8 90 7 from sixth to eighth cycles fig s10a subsequently the high durability of fe3o4 mno2 was confirmed which was consistent with the result of constant h2o2 decomposition for 100 min fig s2a furthermore the leached amounts of mn ions were measured at each final cycle the concentrations were below 0 7 ppm for eight cycles fig s10b these concentrations were less than 2 ppm which is the water quality standard of mn for industrial wastewater discharge in south korea actual surface water and wastewater contain various components that can affect the efficiency of the advanced abs system in this regard the advanced abs system was tested with river water and wastewater samples without any pretreatment obtained from the hyeongsan river and an industrial wastewater treatment plant in pohang south korea respectively the composition of river water and wastewater was listed in table s1 the mb stock solution was subsequently spiked to the water samples without ph adjustment the results showed that the mb removal efficiency of aops significantly decreased in the river water and wastewater compared to the di water fig s11 from the results of fig 5 the initial ph of river water 7 9 and wastewater 6 69 would not inhibit the aops efficiency it could be expected that the dissolved organic substances scavenged the radicals considering that the initial toc values of the river water and wastewater were 4 3 and 1090 ppm respectively also the high levels of cl in the river water 2619 ppm and wastewater 2061 ppm would scavenge the oh radicals as reported in previous studies grebel et al 2010 fang et al 2012 additionally the cations of k na ca and mg could be adsorbed onto the particle surface and inhibit the activation of h2o2 because fe3o4 mno2 has a negative surface charge at the ph higher than 3 7 kim et al 2013 the decreased mb removal efficiencies were presented in the advanced abs system by 97 6 and 69 5 in the river water and the wastewater respectively the anionic surfactants could combine with macromolecules through hydrophobic bonding in aqueous solution lewis 1969 therefore the main inhibitory factors of wastewater might be the unknown organic substances that have a high affinity toward sds also the anion concentrations of hco3 634 ppm and no3 218 ppm were much higher in the wastewater compared to the river water previously horng and huang et al observed an inhibiting effect of nano3 on the flotation of direct blue hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide hta complex horng and huang 1993 karger et al also found that the neutral salts such as nano3 kcl and nah2po4 inhibited the separation of both mb tetradecyl sulfate complex and methyl orange hta complex karger et al 1967 the separation efficiency could decrease by the presence of anions such as cl hco3 no3 and h2po4 because the anions inhibit the formation of dye surfactant complex due to the decreased potential of positive charged dye horng and huang 1993 it has been reported that the efficiencies of many aops and abs systems are reduced in real wastewater gogate and pandit 2004 horng and huang 1993 in this study the advanced abs system also showed decreased mb removal efficiency in the wastewater due to the presence of organic inorganic impurities to investigate the field applicability of the advanced abs system the experiment was scaled up to 1 l and tested in the mb spiked di water river water and wastewater unlike the previous studies basu and malpani 2001 suzuki and maruyama 2002 we used a non columnar bottle and the diameter of the magnet 5 cm was smaller than that of the reactor 9 cm the results showed that the mb sds complex was separated evenly in all the reactors suggesting that there was horizontal movement of bubbles beside the vertical flotation the scale up system achieved removal efficiencies higher than 98 0 at 60 min of each cycle in di water while the efficiency decreased to 83 2 at 60 min of the third cycle in the river water fig 7 in the wastewater however the advanced abs exhibited limited mb removal compared to those in the di water and river water with decreased efficiencies of 59 6 54 1 and 28 7 at 60 min of the cycles after the scale up treatment of the wastewater the particles were collected and lyophilized for one day and analyzed by sem eds when comparing the eds results before and after the reactions the weight of mn decreased from 50 8 to 22 5 while that of fe increased from 2 8 to 12 6 table s4 this result indicated that the mno2 layer became thinner by leaching mn ions to the solution after reaction with h2o2 additionally adsorption of cr and zn was observed from the eds analysis because fe3o4 mno2 has high adsorption capability of cationic metals as reported in the previous study kim et al 2013 the 18 6 of carbon weight was presumably due to the adsorption of organic substances on the surface of nanomaterials in the wastewater overall the results indirectly showed the inhibitory effects of co existing inorganic organic substances as in the batch experiments instead a much higher dye removal efficiency of the advanced abs system will be obtained in other wastewater or pre treated wastewater with low amounts of organic substances 4 conclusions we have demonstrated the novel application of fe3o4 mno2 nanocomposite for the advanced abs of organic dyes in aqueous solutions the underlying mechanisms were elucidated in which the mno2 shell of the composite transformed to mn2o3 by the reaction of h2o2 with the generated radicals and o2 for the oxidation and separation of dyes respectively the advanced abs system i e a dual effect of combining aops and abs resulted in remarkable decolorization of dye contaminated waters by using the low concentrations of h2o2 1 and surfactant 0 005 under a wide ph range ph 3 9 the advanced abs system could selectively separate the dyes depending on the charge of surfactant because the abs was efficient toward the dyes which of their charge was opposite to that of surfactant the scale up advanced abs system was also developed and applied to remediate the dye contaminated river water and wastewater overall the advanced abs system using fe3o4 mno2 is promising to remove organic contaminants from polluted water because of the selective removal of contaminants by surfactant type the excellent separation performance without external agitation force and the reusability of particles having magnetic property declaration of interests wr46340 conflicts of interest the authors declare that they have no

19082,in this study mno2 coated fe3o4 nanocomposite fe3o4 mno2 was utilized to decompose h2o2 to remove dyes via advanced oxidation processes and adsorptive bubble separation advanced abs system the combination of h2o2 and fe3o4 mno2 generated bubbles and formed a stable foam layer in the presence of a surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate sds or cetyltrimethylammonium chloride ctac separating dye from the solution on the basis of radical quenching experiments electron paramagnetic resonance and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses it was confirmed that the mno2 shell of catalyst was reduced to mn2o3 by h2o2 generating radicals and oxygen gas for the removal of dyes in the advanced abs system oh and 1o2 were the main radical species and the o2 concentrations of 0 34 and 0 71 mm were increased in the solution and headspace respectively the advanced abs system demonstrated a high removal efficiency of methylene blue mb 99 0 and the removal rate increased with increasing amounts of components h2o2 catalyst and sds also the advanced abs system maintained high removal efficiency of mb at a wide ph range of 3 9 in addition to the anionic surfactant of sds ctac was applied as a cationic surfactant for the advanced abs of anionic dyes lastly the scale up system was applied to remediate dye contaminated river water and industrial wastewater for possible practical applications graphical abstract image 1 keywords dye fe3o4 mno2 nanocomposite hydrogen peroxide advanced oxidation processes adsorptive bubble separation 1 introduction organic dyes are one of the largest groups of pollutants released into water bodies as textile and other industrial effluents han et al 2009 a dye of even less than 1 ppm concentration can make the transparency of streams reduced along with perishment of aquatic organisms kuo 1992 incomplete removal of dyes and their toxic metabolites from conventional water treatments can impart adverse effects on the animal and human health moawad et al 2003 qu et al 2014 fan et al 2014 cardoso et al 2016 to minimize the negative impact of dyes in the surface water the dyes should be completely removed during the industrial wastewater treatment processes a lot of methods have been developed to treat organic inorganic color reagents including biological treatments kornaros and lyberatos 2006 physical treatments such as adsorption coagulation flocculation and flotation gogate and pandit 2004 and advanced oxidation processes aops using oxidizing agents such as h2o2 s2o8 2 and o3 alaton et al 2002 li et al 2014 however complete removal of dyes and their derivatives in wastewater is not always obtained while each treatment method is effective in decolorization garcía montaño et al 2008 punzi et al 2015 to improve the effluent quality a combination of treatment methods would be necessary for complementation of shortcomings and synergistic effects flotation is one of the practical approaches to separate dyes from solution kabil and ghazy 1994 dafnopatidou and lazaridis 2008 the conventional bubble supply methods produce microbubbles by controlling pressure or using air spargers suzuki and maruyama 2002 the bubbles attach to the particles or soluble ions and float to the surface by buoyancy forces edzwald 2010 which is called the adsorptive bubble separation abs fuerstenau and healy 1972 the abs has been used to separate or to enrich various compounds from solution with distinct advantages low requirements of energy and space and flexible applications to the various pollutants such as minerals surfactants proteins enzymes and microorganisms horng and huang 1993 the abs can selectively separate surface active compounds which tend to move to the air water interface at the air water interface the hydrophobic part of the molecules is organized to expose to the air while the hydrophilic part contacts with the water taylor and triggle 2007 therefore surfactants surface active agents are often used to facilitate the association of contaminants and bubbles non surface active substances become surface active through union with or adsorption on a surfactants eskandarloo et al 2017 also the surfactants play an important role in the accumulation of foam at the top of the solution during foam separation wani et al 2016 basu and malpani 2001 the surfactants of sodium dodecyl sulfate sds sodium lauryl sulfate and cetyltrimethylammonium chloride ctac have been used for the selective dye separation horng and huang 1993 fe3o4 nanoparticles have attracted substantial attention because of their unique magnetic properties and variable surface properties zhao et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 the recoverable bifunctional nanocomposites were developed by modifying the surface of fe3o4 supporter with various metal oxides such as mno2 ceo2 tio2 and wo3 zhao et al 2012 xu and wang 2012 buonsanti et al 2010 xi et al 2011 recently manganese dioxide mno2 has been applied as a peroxide fueled micro motor which derives mechanical force from oxygen generation eskandarloo et al 2017 furthermore it was reported that the decomposition of h2o2 by β mno2 in pyrolusite could generate active radicals such as ho2 and o2 do et al 2009 using these advantages the mno2 particles have been used for aops and abs simultaneously advanced abs system in the presence of h2o2 and surfactant wani et al 2016 he et al 2017 the dual effects of aops and abs demonstrated efficient decolorization of methylene blue mb without external agitation force however previous studies did not attempt to elucidate the mechanism of h2o2 activation on the surface of mno2 the relatively high concentration 5 of h2o2 was used for the abs compared to other studies using h2o2 for oxidative degradation therefore it is necessary to clarify the activation mechanism of h2o2 in the abs through qualitative analysis of the mno2 surface changes as well as the generation of radicals and oxygen while mn is cheaper and more accessible than other noble metals one significant limitation has remained that the added mno2 should be collected by filtration or precipitation for practical applications a number of previous studies have investigated the oxidative reactivity of mno2 towards organic inorganic compounds as well as the release of mn ii ions during the reaction han et al 2011 x wang et al 2017b the released mn ii ions can generate radicals through mn ii mn iii redox cycling in presence of high molecular substances and natural sunlight x wang et al 2018a to overcome this limitation previously we had developed the mno2 coated fe3o4 nanocomposite fe3o4 mno2 via a mild hydrothermal method kim et al 2013 the fe3o4 mno2 had advantages in the large surface area and high magnetic saturation value which could ensure a high probability of contact with other compounds and convenience of separation therefore it has been applied for heavy metal adsorption photocatalytic degradation oxidant activation etc kim et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 liu et al 2015 nevertheless to the best of our knowledge the fe3o4 mno2 has never been used for the advanced abs system even though the fe3o4 mno2 has two distinct advantages that enable h2o2 activation on the mno2 shell and magnetic recovery using the fe3o4 core in the present study the fe3o4 mno2 was tested for the advanced abs system to remove dyes in aqueous solution the detailed mechanism of the advanced abs system was elucidated by monitoring several parameters concentrations of h2o2 mn ions and o2 ph and orp radical quenching experiments electron paramagnetic resonance epr and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analyses to find the optimum condition the effects of h2o2 catalyst surfactant concentrations and ph were evaluated the anionic and cationic surfactants sds and ctac were applied for the advanced abs of cationic dyes mb rhodamine b rb and malachite green oxalate mgo and anionic dyes reactive orange 16 ro16 congo red cr and reactive black 5 rb5 lastly the scaled up repeated efficiencies were confirmed in river water and industrial wastewater samples for the possible practical remediation of dyes 2 materials and methods 2

in water hcl 35 wt hplc grade ethanol hplc grade tertiary butanol tba from merk korea seoul korea ultrapure 18 mω cm deionized di water from a millipore milli q system was used in all the batch experiments 2 2 preparation of fe3o4 mno2 nanocomposite the magnetic nanocomposites were prepared via a simple hydrothermal process kim et al 2013 with a few modifications at first 0 51 g of kmno4 was dissolved in 35 ml of di water and the solution was acidified by adding 0 74 ml of hcl 35 wt dropwise after stirring for 10 min 0 3 g of fe3o4 nanoparticle was added into the solution the mixture was transferred to a teflon lined autoclave 50 ml and sealed to heat at 110 c for 6 h the obtained products were washed with di water and ethanol and then dried under vacuum at 60 c for 24 h the manganese dioxide mno2 was prepared according to the same procedure except for the fe3o4 nanoparticle addition step 2 3 batch experiments to evaluate the removal of dye batch experiments were carried out in a 22 ml bottle containing a reaction volume of 15 ml the dye stock solutions 1000 mg l of mb rb mgo ro16 cr and rb5 and the surfactant stock solutions w v 1 of sds and ctac were prepared in conical tubes wrapped by aluminum foil to block sunlight and used within a week a reaction solution was made by diluting the dye stock solution h2o2 solution v v 30 and surfactant stock solution to make 40 mg l 1 and 0 005 of dye h2o2 and surfactant concentrations respectively unless otherwise noted the 0 0045 g of fe3o4 mno2 0 3 g l was added to the solution which was placed on a magnet to prevent the particles trapped in the foam layer for the mechanistic study synthesized mno2 and commercial fe3o4 nanoparticles were used instead of fe3o4 mno2 most of the experiments were carried out without ph adjustment but the ph was adjusted by the addition of a proper amount of 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh for ph variation experiment a 200 μl portion of the aqueous phase was withdrawn periodically and immediately diluted by 1 8 ml di water for spectrophotometric analysis the river water and industrial wastewater were obtained from the hyeongsan river in april and an industrial wastewater treatment plant in january 2018 pohang south korea they were frozen at 20 c until use the composition of water samples is listed in table s1 the river water and wastewater samples were tested as an above mentioned procedure without any pretreatment all experiments were performed at least in triplicate at ambient temperature 25 1 c and error bars representing standard deviation were depicted in most figures 2 4 scale up experiments the scale up experiments were conducted using 1 l bottle with the diameter of 9 cm and drain holes on the bottom side scheme 1 two magnets with the diameter of 5 cm were installed under the reactor for fixation of the particle the foam generated on the water surface was drawn into a trap bottle by a vacuum pump the mb h2o2 and sds spiked di water river water and wastewater were injected into the reactor repeatedly and the foam was removed spontaneously a 1 ml portion of the aqueous phase was withdrawn at the upper part of the reactor for spectrophotometric analysis 2 5 analytical methods the morphology of nanocomposites was analyzed by the field emission scanning electron microscope sem and energy dispersive spectroscopy eds by using a jeol jsm 7401f instrument jeol ltd tokyo japan magnetic properties of fe3o4 and fe3o4 mno2 were determined using a superconducting quantum interference device squid magnetometer mpms 5 quantum design for crystalline phase identification x ray diffraction xrd patterns were recorded on a panalytical x pert diffractometer x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermal scientific k alpha xps spectrometer was used to investigate the chemical composition of the nanocomposite after the reaction the material was separated from the solution using the magnet and lyophilized at 45 c for one day to observe the surface change using sem eds and xps the oxygen generation was observed and captured by an optical microscope axioskop 40 with 20 objectives the dye concentration was analyzed using a uv vis spectrophotometer at their corresponding maximum wavelength as listed in table s2 the total organic carbon toc content change was detected with a shimadzu toc l cph analyzer changes in the ph oxidation reduction potential orp values and do concentrations were monitored using an orion versa star advanced electrochemistry meter the change of oxygen concentration in the headspace of teflon sealed reactors 57 ml was analyzed using gas chromatography hp6890a hewlett packard co usa equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a molecular sieve 5a column the leached amounts of fe and mn were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes 6300 thermo scientific to characterize the reactive oxygen species generated during the reaction the experiments were conducted in 10 ml of dmpo 10 mm or temp 50 mm solution the 200 μl of the solution was sampled out and analyzed by electron paramagnetic resonance epr a200 bruker under the following conditions microwave power 1 00 mw microwave frequency 9 42 ghz modulation amplitude 2 0 g modulation frequency 100 khz 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of fe3o4 mno2 nanocomposite the morphology of synthesized fe3o4 mno2 nanocomposite measured by sem is shown in figs s1a and b the sem images presented the aggregation of small nanostructured particles and the particle size larger than 2 μm combined with the sem images the element mapping of fe3o4 mno2 showed the existence of o mn and fe elements fig s1c the mn and o were uniformly dispersed on the surface of the particles while fe was presented partially in the core part confirming that the fe3o4 mno2 consisted of fe3o4 core and mno2 shell for the surface characterization xrd patterns of bare fe3o4 synthesized mno2 and fe3o4 mno2 were obtained fig s1d the patterns of fe3o4 mno2 were similar to those of fe3o4 indexed as the fe3o4 face centered cubic phases rather than those of mno2 indexed to the α mno2 phase jcpds card no 44 0141 xu et al 2007 these results could be explained by the amorphous nature of the outer mno2 layers of fe3o4 mno2 according to the large surface area 118 m2 g and mesoporous structure the fe3o4 mno2 would be beneficial for the h2o2 activation on its surface kim et al 2013 the mpms profiles of fe3o4 and fe3o4 mno2 indicated a superparamagnetic behavior fig s1e the saturation magnetization 30 79 emu g 1 of fe3o4 mno2 was less than that of fe3o4 90 24 emu g 1 but the magnetic property of fe3o4 mno2 was strong enough to achieve simple magnetic separation 3 2 removal of mb by the advanced abs system in this study the combination of h2o2 and fe3o4 mno2 was referred to aops and the aops to which the surfactant was added was referred to the advanced abs system regardless of the existence of dye the particles were trapped in the foam layer and descended slowly without magnet while the particles moved quickly down to the bottom in the presence of a magnet increasing the probability of contact between the floating bubbles and the dye sds complex therefore the magnet was set up in all experiments below for high decolorization rates as in fig 1 a the advanced abs system i e a dual effect combining aops and abs showed higher mb removal efficiency 99 0 than the aops 52 3 at the reaction time of 15 min the average mb concentration of accumulated foam was 3 98 1 52 ppm at 15 min indicating that about 10 of the mb was removed by the foam without oxidative degradation the toc values before and after the aops and the advanced abs system were measured to confirm the dye separation fig 1b after the aops 3 90 ppm of toc decreased from the mb control 23 22 ppm however 21 90 ppm of toc was reduced from the mb sds containing solution 29 19 ppm to the advanced abs system treated solution 7 29 ppm indicating that the mb was successfully separated into the foam layer 3 3 mechanistic study 3 3 1 bubble generation the h2o2 can reduce mn iv to mn ii at the mno2 surface and generate oxygen gas as in eq 1 neaman et al 2004 the mno2 has surface chemisorbed oxygen which is highly reactive and mobile because of its loose bonding to the surface kanungo 1979 this type of lattice oxygen o2 can be present in the ionized state and enhance the decomposition of h2o2 as in eq 2 kanungo et al 1981 through these reactions oxygen gas is generated from the reaction between mno2 and h2o2 1 mno2 h2o2 mno h2o o2 2 h2o2 o2 o2 oh oh the bubble generation in the aops and the advanced abs system was confirmed using an optical microscope upon the addition of 1 h2o2 the particles started to produce bubbles abruptly and moved randomly for about 2 h fig 2 a b in the presence of sds the bubbles increased in size and were collected as a combined form fig 2c d because the sds lowered the surface tension between the bubbles and enhanced the stability of bubbles eskandarloo et al 2017 the microbubble is efficient for ion flotation as they rise more slowly with greater contact with chemicals in solution this is due to that the microbubble has a large ratio of surface to volume resulting in higher energy surface to attract target compounds horng and huang 1993 in this study the bubbles generated in the combination of fe3o4 mno2 and h2o2 would be advantageous for the dye sds complex adsorption with their small size 3 3 2 monitoring of reaction parameters to elucidate the reaction mechanism in depth the concentration changes of mb h2o2 and leached mn ions in the advanced abs system were measured for 100 min fig s2a the mb was almost completely eliminated in 20 min but the concentration slightly increased as the foam collapsed over times the generated foam persisted for 60 min with high density indicating that the size of bubbles was fairly uniform in the solution fuerstenau and healy 1972 the 21 1 of h2o2 was decomposed sharply within 4 min follwed by slow decomposition to 12 2 at 100 min it indicated that the reactivity of fe3o4 mno2 was maintained up to 100 min the leached concentration of mn ions peaked at 2 40 ppm at 2 min and rapidly decreased to 1 32 ppm at 4 min and then the concentration was re elevated to 2 27 ppm at 100 min the mn concentration of accumulated foam was 6 41 ppm at the reaction time of 15 min which was higher than that of aqueous phase 1 04 ppm suggesting that the fate of mn ions could be affected by the foam generation and collapse as the foam layer collapsed over time the mn ions adsorbed on the foam could be redissolved to the solution the variations of ph and orp values during the advanced abs reactions are given in fig s2b the ph increased from 5 3 to 7 0 while orp decreased from 311 4 to 212 0 mv within 4 min the reason for the ph increase would be the reactions of eqs 1 and 2 which consume h ions and generate oh ions respectively the orp drop must be ascribed to the consumption of the strong oxidant h2o2 the decrease of orp was alleviated after 4 min from the start of the reaction possibly due to the continuously generated oxygen the concentrations of do and o2 during the advanced abs reactions were measured in solution and headspace respectively fig s3 the do concentration was rapidly saturated to 0 5 mm within 4 min while the o2 concentration of headspace gradually increased from 9 38 mm to 10 09 mm at 40 min the oxygen concentrations of 0 34 and 0 71 mm were increased in the solution and headspace respectively the increased oxygen concentrations clearly indicated that the oxygen bubble was generated from the reaction of fe3o4 mno2 and h2o2 the fe3o4 mno2 consists of the fe3o4 core and the shell of mno2 which is expected to react with most of h2o2 for the possibility of fe3o4 exposure mno2 and fe3o4 were solely tested for the aops and advanced abs of mb the fe3o4 was not reactive for both the aops and the advanced abs system while mno2 showed similar reactivity with those of fe3o4 mno2 fig s4a the mno2 slowly sank onto the bottom forming a layer unlike the fe3o4 mno2 in the advanced abs system fig s4b from the all above results it would be concluded that the h2o2 activation was performed by the mno2 shell of the fe3o4 mno2 nanocomposite 3 3 3 h2o2 activation mechanism the radicals such as hydroxyl radical oh and superoxide radical o2 are generated from the h2o2 activation by mno2 do et al 2009 yu et al 2014 wang et al 2018b the dominant radical species were indirectly confirmed in the aops and advanced abs system by radical quenching experiments in this study tba bq and nan3 were utilized for oh o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 scavengers respectively k tba oh 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 k bq ooh 0 9 1 0 109 m 1s 1 knan3 1o2 4 108 m 1s 1 chong et al 2017 wang et al 2017a schweitzer and schmidt 2003 the mb removal efficiency was improved at a concentration higher than 10 mm for bq while the efficiency decreased as the concentrations of tba and nan3 increased fig s5 therefore 1000 10 and 50 mm of scavenger concentrations were used for tba bq and nan3 respectively the addition of bq decreased the efficiency from 51 3 to 38 6 in the aops indicating that o2 had a contribution to the mb degradation fig s6 on the other hand 1000 and 50 mm of tba and nan3 significantly deactivated the reactions to 10 6 and 9 2 respectively it was reported that nan3 could also possess a quenching effect for oh 3 6 107 s 1 which implied that nan3 quenched oh with 1o2 liang et al 2017 this result demonstrated that oh o2 and 1o2 were generated in the aops in the case of the advanced abs system both tba and nan3 deactivated the mb removal efficiency from 98 8 to 60 3 and 53 6 respectively while bq did not significantly affect the reaction rates this result indicates that the oh and 1o2 act as dominant radicals in the advanced abs system the formation of oh and 1o2 was verified by an epr spin trapping experiment fig 3 a and b the significant dmpo oh signals based on their hyperfine splitting constants ah an 14 9 g in the aops and advanced abs system were confirmed whereas an insignificant signal was found in the dmpo h2o2 solution fig 3a wang et al 2015 chen et al 2017 additionally the specific signals of 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine n oxyl tempo with their hyperfine splitting constant an 1 608 mt were produced from the aops and advanced abs system as in fig 3b wang et al 2016 the intensities of tempo peaks in the aops and advanced abs system were higher than that of the temp h2o2 solution indicating the formation of 1o2 these results demonstrated that oh and 1o2 radicals were generated in the aops and advanced abs system the intensities of dmpo oh and tempo signals in the advanced abs system were slightly lower than that in the aops it might be due that the sds would scavenge oh and 1o2 as reported in previous studies bandala et al 2008 yüksel et al 2009 an xps was also used to characterize the fe3o4 mno2 particles before and after the h2o2 activation the fig 4 a and b presents the mn 2p and o 1s xps spectra before and after the aops the binding energies of mn 2p1 2 and 2p3 2 in the as prepared control sample were centered at 654 1 and 642 3 ev respectively in good agreement with those of α mno2 after the aops for 60 min the binding energies decreased to 653 3 and 642 0 ev for mn 2p1 2 and mn 2p3 2 respectively the decrease of binding energies can be regarded as an indirect indicator of the formal valence changes this result indicated that the mno2 shell was reduced to mn2o3 after the reaction with h2o2 referring to previous literature koleva et al 2013 li et al 2013 the o 1s spectrum of the as prepared sample consisted of two main peaks at 529 8 and 531 2 ev which were attributed to mn o mn and mn o h respectively dai et al 2016 the two peaks showed the relative abundance of lattice oxygen o2 and surface adsorbed oxygen after the aops the intensity of mn o h peak increased while that of mn o mn decreased this trend indirectly demonstrated that the lattice oxygen was consumed for the reaction with h2o2 eq 2 and the mno2 shell was transformed to mn2o3 tang et al 2010 the generation of radicals and oxygen by mn iii or mn iv mediated activation of h2o2 has rarely been dealt with previously based on the above results the reduction of mno2 and radical variation it could be hypothesized that the single electron transfer between surface mn and h2o2 would generate the radicals of oh ho2 and o2 eq 3 7 similar to the iron oxide based fenton like processes pham et al 2012 fang et al 2018 3 mn iv oh h2o2 mn iii ho2 h2o 4 mn iv o h2o2 mn iii oh ho2 5 mn iii h2o2 mn iv oh oh 6 mn iii oh ho2 mn ii h2o o2 7 mn ii h2o2 mn iii oh oh the radical chain reactions could also be proceeded as in eqs 8 12 xu and wang 2012 the generated ooh reacts with h2o2 and decomposes to generate o2 as in eqs 9 and 10 do et al 2009 chong et al 2017 furthermore the reactions between radicals eq 11 and 12 and the electron transfer from o2 to mn iv or mn iii could generate the 1o2 eqs 13 and 14 xu and wang 2012 debnath et al 2016 the overall reactions between h2o2 and mno2 surface are illustrated in scheme 2 8 oh h2o2 ooh h2o 9 ooh h2o2 o2 h2o oh 10 ooh h o2 11 o2 ooh 1o2 ho2 12 o2 oh 1o2 oh 13 mn iv o2 mn iii 1o2 14 mn iii o2 mn ii 1o2 3 4 optimization of experimental conditions to establish an optimum condition for the advanced abs system the effects of the amounts of h2o2 particles and sds were investigated fig 5 a c the individual and combination of two compositions h2o2 particles and sds had negligible ability of the mb removal except for the combination of h2o2 and fe3o4 mno2 aops given that the bubble generation and oxidative degradation were directly related to h2o2 the higher removal efficiency of mb was expected with the increase of initial h2o2 concentration the experimental results showed that the removal of mb increased with increasing h2o2 concentration when the particle concentration was fixed to 0 3 g l fig 5a the mb removal efficiencies were similar at 1 and 1 5 of h2o2 concentrations since the amount of particles reacting to h2o2 was limited as an activator of h2o2 the varied amounts of fe3o4 mno2 were tested in the advanced abs system fig 5b the final removal efficiencies increased from 93 6 to 99 2 at 0 1 and 0 4 g l of the particle amounts respectively the reaction rates increased in the range of 0 1 0 4 g l particle amounts with similar final removal efficiencies without sds 51 3 of mb was degraded by the aops as in fig 5c the mb removal efficiencies increased from 59 3 to 98 3 as the sds dosages increased from 0 001 to 0 005 respectively the reaction rate was lower at a 0 001 surfactant concentration presumably because of the incomplete formation of dye surfactant complex however the removal efficiency decreased to 95 4 at 0 01 of the sds dosage a higher concentration of surfactant can cause the competition of the bubble active sites by the excess surfactant ions with the dye surfactant complex consequently 1 h2o2 0 3 g l fe3o4 mno2 and 0 005 sds were selected as the optimum condition considering the mb removal efficiency and economic effectiveness a previous study of the advanced abs system had used 5 h2o2 and 0 1 sds to remove 32 25 mg l of mb which were much more than those of this study wani et al 2016 the abs method should require the addition of surfactant even though the cost and potential negative impact of surfactant are of great concern however in this study 0 005 of low sds concentration was used the advanced abs system of the optimum condition maintained the high mb removal efficiency 91 8 when the initial mb concentration increased to 70 ppm fig s7 a wide range of ph availability is an essential factor for practical applications to examine the applicability of aops and advanced abs system in real aqueous systems the influence of ph on the removal of mb was investigated fig 5d in the ph range of 4 9 the mb removal efficiencies of the advanced abs system were higher than 98 0 while decreased to 89 2 and 25 2 at ph 3 and 2 respectively the redox potentials of mno2 and h2o2 are given in eqs 15 17 douglas et al 1983 from the eqs 15 and 16 it can be assumed that the redox potential of h2o2 decreases as the ph increases even though the h2o2 can act as both an oxidizer and a reducer of mno2 the main reaction can change depending on the ph as the ph decreases the reduction of mno2 by h2o2 eq 1 might be reduced and result in the decrease of o2 generation this would reduce the efficiency of the advanced abs system considering the role of oxygen to accumulate the mb sds complex into the foam layer also the isoelectric point iep of fe3o mno2 is 3 7 the surface charge becomes positive at the ph lower than iep kim et al 2013 the adsorption of anionic sds to the particle surfaces can inhibit the surface h2o2 reaction when the ph is lower than 3 7 consequently the ph higher than 3 favors the mb removal in the advanced abs system in this regard the advanced abs system showed a remarkable advantage of the wide working ph range for practical applications 15 h2o2 2e 2h 2h2o e0 ph 0 1 776 v 16 ho2 2e h2o 3oh e0 ph 14 0 88 v 17 mno2 s 4h aq 2e mn2 aq 2h2o l e0 1 23 v likewise the efficiency of aops had a decreasing trend as the initial ph decreased from 9 56 9 to 2 16 1 from this result it is likely that the contribution of aops also decreased in the advanced abs system at ph 3 and 4 as the ph decreases the reaction of eq 2 also would be inhibited by protonation of the mno2 surface resulting in the decreased efficiency of aops by reducing the generation of oh and since the radicals are generated as the mno2 is reduced by h2o2 section 3 3 3 the aops should be efficient at high ph where the reducibility of h2o2 is relatively high 3 5 effects of surfactant charge in the abs process contaminants are combined with a surfactant through electrostatic attraction therefore the removable contaminants can be determined by the charge of the surfactant in this study cetyltrimethylammonium chloride ctac a cationic surfactant was used for the comparative study with sds an anionic surfactant the cationic dyes of mb rb and mgo and the anionic dyes of ro16 cr and rb5 were selected for the efficiency test of the advanced abs system the chemical structures of the surfactants and dyes are present in table s2 the removal efficiencies of six dyes by the advanced abs sds system and the advanced abs ctac system are shown in fig 6 the pictures of reactors before and after the reactions are presented in fig s8 the 0 005 of sds concentration was used referring fig 5c for all kinds of dye removal the optimum ctac concentration was 0 01 for the ro16 removal data not shown while 0 005 was the more feasible concentration for the removal of other anionic dyes therefore 0 01 and 0 005 of ctac concentrations were used for ro16 and other anionic dyes respectively the unadjusted initial ph was in the range of 4 1 6 4 as listed in table s3 fig 6a shows that the advanced abs sds system was only reactive toward cationic dyes with the removal efficiencies of 98 8 98 7 and 97 2 for mb rb and mgo respectively on the other hand the advanced abs ctac system was more reactive toward anionic dyes ro16 cr and rb5 but the degree of removal efficiencies was different among three dyes fig 6b 23 6 of rb was removed by the advanced abs ctac system among the cationic dyes it might be because of the amphoteric property of rb osakai et al 2007 when the charges of dye and surfactant were same the anionic dyes ro16 cr and rb5 were not removed in the abs sds system while the cationic dyes mb rb and mgo were removed slightly in the abs ctac system this result indicates that the radical reactions would occur on the negative surface of particles which is more feasible to adsorb cationic dyes without any surfactant the removal efficiency of aops was tested toward the same six dyes fig s9 the order of degradation efficiency was mgo mb rb rb5 cr ro16 showing that the cationic dyes tend to be more degradable than the anionic dyes by the aops the removal efficiencies of cr and rb5 by aops were higher than these of the advanced abs sds system and also same in the advanced abs ctac system for mb and mgo degradation it might be due to that the surfactants act as a scavenger of the radicals additionally the cationic ctac could block the surface of materials competing with the cationic dyes for the surface generated radicals from the results it was concluded that the type of surfactant should be selected beforehand according to the charge of target contaminants 3 6 implementing the advanced abs system for environmental applications the stability and reusability of material are important issues that should be considered before practical applications in this study the spent fe3o4 mno2 was held by a magnet after reactions and freshly prepared solutions replaced the used solutions every 15 min for 7 times the removal efficiencies higher than 98 0 were maintained during five cycles followed by reduction to 97 5 93 8 90 7 from sixth to eighth cycles fig s10a subsequently the high durability of fe3o4 mno2 was confirmed which was consistent with the result of constant h2o2 decomposition for 100 min fig s2a furthermore the leached amounts of mn ions were measured at each final cycle the concentrations were below 0 7 ppm for eight cycles fig s10b these concentrations were less than 2 ppm which is the water quality standard of mn for industrial wastewater discharge in south korea actual surface water and wastewater contain various components that can affect the efficiency of the advanced abs system in this regard the advanced abs system was tested with river water and wastewater samples without any pretreatment obtained from the hyeongsan river and an industrial wastewater treatment plant in pohang south korea respectively the composition of river water and wastewater was listed in table s1 the mb stock solution was subsequently spiked to the water samples without ph adjustment the results showed that the mb removal efficiency of aops significantly decreased in the river water and wastewater compared to the di water fig s11 from the results of fig 5 the initial ph of river water 7 9 and wastewater 6 69 would not inhibit the aops efficiency it could be expected that the dissolved organic substances scavenged the radicals considering that the initial toc values of the river water and wastewater were 4 3 and 1090 ppm respectively also the high levels of cl in the river water 2619 ppm and wastewater 2061 ppm would scavenge the oh radicals as reported in previous studies grebel et al 2010 fang et al 2012 additionally the cations of k na ca and mg could be adsorbed onto the particle surface and inhibit the activation of h2o2 because fe3o4 mno2 has a negative surface charge at the ph higher than 3 7 kim et al 2013 the decreased mb removal efficiencies were presented in the advanced abs system by 97 6 and 69 5 in the river water and the wastewater respectively the anionic surfactants could combine with macromolecules through hydrophobic bonding in aqueous solution lewis 1969 therefore the main inhibitory factors of wastewater might be the unknown organic substances that have a high affinity toward sds also the anion concentrations of hco3 634 ppm and no3 218 ppm were much higher in the wastewater compared to the river water previously horng and huang et al observed an inhibiting effect of nano3 on the flotation of direct blue hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide hta complex horng and huang 1993 karger et al also found that the neutral salts such as nano3 kcl and nah2po4 inhibited the separation of both mb tetradecyl sulfate complex and methyl orange hta complex karger et al 1967 the separation efficiency could decrease by the presence of anions such as cl hco3 no3 and h2po4 because the anions inhibit the formation of dye surfactant complex due to the decreased potential of positive charged dye horng and huang 1993 it has been reported that the efficiencies of many aops and abs systems are reduced in real wastewater gogate and pandit 2004 horng and huang 1993 in this study the advanced abs system also showed decreased mb removal efficiency in the wastewater due to the presence of organic inorganic impurities to investigate the field applicability of the advanced abs system the experiment was scaled up to 1 l and tested in the mb spiked di water river water and wastewater unlike the previous studies basu and malpani 2001 suzuki and maruyama 2002 we used a non columnar bottle and the diameter of the magnet 5 cm was smaller than that of the reactor 9 cm the results showed that the mb sds complex was separated evenly in all the reactors suggesting that there was horizontal movement of bubbles beside the vertical flotation the scale up system achieved removal efficiencies higher than 98 0 at 60 min of each cycle in di water while the efficiency decreased to 83 2 at 60 min of the third cycle in the river water fig 7 in the wastewater however the advanced abs exhibited limited mb removal compared to those in the di water and river water with decreased efficiencies of 59 6 54 1 and 28 7 at 60 min of the cycles after the scale up treatment of the wastewater the particles were collected and lyophilized for one day and analyzed by sem eds when comparing the eds results before and after the reactions the weight of mn decreased from 50 8 to 22 5 while that of fe increased from 2 8 to 12 6 table s4 this result indicated that the mno2 layer became thinner by leaching mn ions to the solution after reaction with h2o2 additionally adsorption of cr and zn was observed from the eds analysis because fe3o4 mno2 has high adsorption capability of cationic metals as reported in the previous study kim et al 2013 the 18 6 of carbon weight was presumably due to the adsorption of organic substances on the surface of nanomaterials in the wastewater overall the results indirectly showed the inhibitory effects of co existing inorganic organic substances as in the batch experiments instead a much higher dye removal efficiency of the advanced abs system will be obtained in other wastewater or pre treated wastewater with low amounts of organic substances 4 conclusions we have demonstrated the novel application of fe3o4 mno2 nanocomposite for the advanced abs of organic dyes in aqueous solutions the underlying mechanisms were elucidated in which the mno2 shell of the composite transformed to mn2o3 by the reaction of h2o2 with the generated radicals and o2 for the oxidation and separation of dyes respectively the advanced abs system i e a dual effect of combining aops and abs resulted in remarkable decolorization of dye contaminated waters by using the low concentrations of h2o2 1 and surfactant 0 005 under a wide ph range ph 3 9 the advanced abs system could selectively separate the dyes depending on the charge of surfactant because the abs was efficient toward the dyes which of their charge was opposite to that of surfactant the scale up advanced abs system was also developed and applied to remediate the dye contaminated river water and wastewater overall the advanced abs system using fe3o4 mno2 is promising to remove organic contaminants from polluted water because of the selective removal of contaminants by surfactant type the excellent separation performance without external agitation force and the reusability of particles having magnetic property declaration of interests wr46340 conflicts of interest the authors declare that they have no

19083,predicting bacterial levels in watersheds in response to agricultural beneficial management practices bmps requires understanding the germane processes at both the watershed and field scale controlling subsurface tile drainage ctd is a highly effective bmp at reducing nutrient losses from fields and watersheds when employed en masse but little work has been conducted on ctd effects on bacterial loads and densities in a watershed context this study compared fecal indicator bacteria fib e coli enterococcus fecal coliform total coliform clostridium perfringens densities and unit area loads ual from a pair of flat tile drained watersheds 250 467 ha catchment areas during the growing season over a 10 year monitoring period using a before after control impact baci design i e test ctd watershed vs reference uncontrolled tile drainage uctd watershed during a pre ctd intervention period and a ctd intervention period where the test ctd watershed had ctd deployed on over 80 of the fields with no tile drainage management upstream tile drainage to ditches comprised 90 of total ditch discharge we also examined fib loads from a subset of tile drained fields to determine field load contributions to the watershed drainage ditches statistical evidence of a ctd effect on fib ual in the surface water systems was not strong however there was statistical evidence of increased fib densities pronounced when e coli 200 most probable number mpn 100 ml 1 in the test ctd watershed during the ctd intervention period this was likely a result of reduced dilution flushing in the test ctd watershed ditch due to ctd significantly decreasing the amount of tile drainage water entering the surface water system tile e coli load contributions to the ditches were low for example during the 6 yr ctd intervention period they amounted to on average only 3 and 9 of the ditch loads for the test ctd and reference uctd watersheds respectively this suggests in stream or off field fib reservoirs and bacteria mobilization drivers dominated ditch e coli loads in the watersheds during the growing season overall this study suggested that decision making regarding deployment of ctd en masse in tile fed watersheds should consider drainage practice effects on bacterial densities and loads as well as ctd s documented capacity to boost crop yields and reduce seasonal nutrient pollution

simulation can help facilitate adoption of bmps by producers dring et al 2017 as well as provide a more realistic spatial temporal framework by which to characterize the on and off farm footprint of

bmp assessment at watershed scales meals 1996 heathwaite et al 2000 cullum et al 2006 this issue could have major implications with respect to how water quality targets and guidelines are met broadly as well as the acceptance and subsequent adoption of germane bmps by producers and environmental stewards fecal indicator bacteria fib such as e coli are used as indicators of recent fecal contamination of water and elevated fib levels in surface water can be indicative of the co occurrence of pathogens ferguson et al 1996 savichtcheva et al 2007 wilkes et al 2009 usepa 2012 lamparelli

inamdar et al 2002 parajuli et al 2008 burt et al 2013 wilkes et al 2014 coffey et al 2015 mallin et al 2016 and this is usually accommodated by rigorous longer term surveillance and monitoring activities frey et al 2013b government of canada 2016 controlled tile drainage ctd is a practice that can be used to regulate tile drainage from a field system gilliam et al 1979 it has been shown to be effective at reducing net losses of n and p and fecal indicator bacteria from fields drury et al 1996 wesström and messing 2007 skaggs et al 2012 sunohara et al 2016 reducing nutrient loads from watersheds sunohara et al 2015 as well as boosting crop yields ghane et al 2012 sunohara et al 2014 thus ctd is a bmp that can address both user e g improved yields and non user or off farm benefits e g improved surface water quality currently only a few studies have examined how this practice impacts bacterial loads and densities in water which can be critical when the practice is viewed with a public health lens some studies have found transient benefits of managing tile drainage for reducing pathogen and fib loading at the field plot scale frey et al 2013a 2015 other studies suggest that there can be significant reductions in the occurrences of several waterborne pathogens and fecal pollution biomarkers potentially of field origin when ctd is employed broadly over a tile dominated watershed wilkes et al 2014 however schmidt et al 2013 indicated via quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra that mean risks per exposure associated with the bacterial pathogen campylobacter spp were somewhat elevated in an experimental watershed where tile drainage was controlled in relation to an adjacent experimental watershed where it was not controlled albeit the source of campylobacter was not determined the exploratory study by schmidt et al 2013 led us to consider potential public health related side effects associated with tile drainage management imposed en masse on fields in watersheds currently it is not practical to examine all relevant waterborne pathogens quantitatively in a timely affordable and logistically manageable manner and fib will continue to be used as indicators of fecal pollution as well as indicators of the potential for pathogen occurrence edge et al 2012 into at least the near future usepa 2012 government of canada 2016 hence in this study we monitored paired agricultural watersheds during the growing season over a 10 year period within a before after control mpact baci design bishop et al 2005 sunohara et al 2015 to examine the implication of ctd imposed en masse on fields in a test watershed on surface water fib densities and loads 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental watersheds in this study two watersheds were monitored for fib during 2005 14 fig 1 total surface catchment areas of the test ctd watershed and the reference uctd watershed are estimated to be 467 and 250 ha respectively being directly adjacent to one another the two experimental watersheds have common weather physiography soils and land uses for 2005 to 2013 mean daily temperatures were greatest in july 22 c and were lowest in january and february 7 c total yearly rainfall between 2005 and 2013 ranged between 509 2012 and 1045 mm 2006 russell ontario http climate weather gc ca the soils are dominated by bainsville silt loams of the gleysolic order wicklund and richards 1962 the stream drainage ditches are ice covered during the majority of the winter season based on yearly remote sensing and ground truth surveys between 2005 and 2014 the test ctd reference uctd experimental watersheds were under 41 36 livestock corn zea mays production 21 18 soybean glycine max and 35 38 forage hay land cover dairy bovine manure is the primary manure based fecal inputs to surface water from agriculture that the authors are aware of in these experimental watersheds as documented via ruminant microbial source tracking markers wilkes et al 2014 usually liquid bovine manure is applied to select fields not all fields in watershed by producers at application rates of around 47 000 to 75 000 l ha 1 land application typically occurs by surface spreading followed by incorporation in the spring prior to planting and in the fall after crops have been harvested periods generally considered before and after the crop growing season however land application of bovine manure has been observed less frequently after first cuts of forage hay which typically occurs in june another potential source of anthropogenically engendered fecal pollution in the watershed occurs upstream of the controlled tile drainage downstream site ctdd fig 1 here there exists a small hobby farm consisting of a low and annually variable number of hobby farm animals wilkes et al 2013a b the farm is set back from the stream and hydrological pathways for fecal pollution are not notably established within the test ctd watershed tile drainage water from fields were controlled by inline water level control structures agri drain corporation adair ia fitted with stop logs also known as stopgates or flashboards fig 2 sunohara et al 2014 2015 tile drain laterals with a spacing between 15 and 17 m for an individual field system figs 1 and 2 collectively drain water into a main header that itself drains into a single outlet to the stream fig 2 the control structure for each field for which it controls flow was located near the drainage outlet tile flow control was practiced from roughly planting time to just before final autumn harvest of each year during the non growing season ctd structures were set to allow for free drainage due to reasons discussed in sunohara et al 2016 after planting stop logs were set to a depth of 0 6 m below the soil surface for fields under ctd management when water levels were less than 0 6 m below the surface tile water would spill over the top stop log and drain into the drainage ditch tile flow ceased when water levels were deeper than 0 6 m from the surface roughly 89 and 90 of the test ctd and reference uctd watershed total catchment areas respectively are tile drained fields sunohara et al 2014 ctd intervention in the test ctd watershed was not appreciable in years 2005 and 2006 occupying 9 of tile drained fields in the watershed therefore 2005 06 is considered the pre ctd intervention or control period ctd was installed more intensely after 2006 on the test ctd watershed 80 of the tile drained fields in the watershed thus we considered 2007 and years beyond it the ctd intervention or test period 2 2 fecal indicator bacteria and hydrological measurements the membrane filtration mf methods for fib follow standard procedures documented in wilkes et al 2009 e coli were also quantified in the laboratory by the method described in eckner 1998 using the colilert idexx laboratories westbrook maine most probable number mpn based enzyme substrate method apha 2005 method 9223 b at agriculture and agri food canada aafc laboratories in ottawa colilert quanti trays were filled with the raw water within 12 h after collection and incubated for 24 h positive wells were counted and entered into idexx software idexx mpn generator v 3 2 2005 idexx laboratories for mpn cell count estimation the upper and lower method detection limits for colilert were 2419 6 1630 4 4716 1 95 c l confidence limit and 1 0 3 7 95 c l viable cell s per 100 ml 1 respectively idexx 2017 1 10 dilution ratios were used as necessary to ensure values were within the detectable range stream water was sampled at downstream and upstream monitoring sites within the two watersheds ctdd ctdu uctdd and uctdu fig 1 water samples of 1 l volume were collected on a bi weekly basis to determine fib using mf methods for mpn water samples were collected during rainfall events and on a weekly 2005 2006 to twice weekly 2007 2012 basis samples were collected from the water sampling sites generally from april until early to mid november or until surface water freeze up membrane filtration samples were collected from all water sampling sites from 2005 to 2010 but only from ctdd and uctdd sites during 2011 2014 all four sampling sites were sampled using mpn methods from 2005 to 2012 water samples were sent on ice overnight to aafc s london research and development centre for mf estimation of fib densities stream discharge was monitored at the four instream monitoring sites using the area velocity method described in grant and dawson 2001 and sunohara et al 2015 fig 1 discharge m3 15 min 1 was measured at fixed circular culverts located at each water sampling site using isco 4150 area velocity flow modules and low profile area velocity sensors sensors teledyne isco inc tile discharge m3 15 min 1 was also determined from seven individual paired ctd and uctd field systems 14 fields in total as per sunohara et al 2016 using v notch weirs in the control structures and bubbler flow modules isco model 730 teledyne isco attached to automatic water samplers isco model 6712 both stream and field tile discharge methods were periodically validated with manual discharge measurements using a water velocity probe model fp201 global water instrumentation for stream measures and timed volume measurement approaches for field tile drainage a vast majority of growing season stream flow is attributed to tile drainage in these watersheds see results section hence we felt we could identify the relative role of tile drainage control on stream e coli loads and densities in order to assess the degree of fib contributions from field tile drainage to ditch e coli mpn samples were collected during the growing seasons of 2005 12 8 years from tile drainage outlets on seven experimental paired ctd and uctd fields within the watersheds sunohara et al 2015 2016 figs 1 and 2 tile drainage water was sampled for e coli mpn once to twice weekly when tiles were flowing with denser sampling occurring during tile discharge events 3 5 samples per flow event for flowing systems initiating at an 0 01 m increase in overflow head in the control structure with sampling intervals increasing in time over the discharge event sunohara et al 2016 linear interpolation was used to estimate e coli mpn densities between data points using the imputets package moritz 2016 and the na interpolation function see sunohara et al 2016 interval drainage volumes were then multiplied by the interpolated interval fib densities to estimate tile e coli loads mpn 15min 1 field area provided a means to estimate unit area loads uals mpn time 1 contributing area 1 for each year of study both watershed and tile drain e coli mpn loads mpn season 1 and uals mpn ha 1season 1 were calculated for common growing season periods when ctd was actively employed on fields generally may to october to estimate total tile e coli mpn contributions to the two watershed ditches for a season we multiplied the average of the monitored tile drain uals by the field areas in the watersheds associated with the tile drainage treatment that the average ual represented simple and descriptive watershed mass balances for each year season of study were calculated as watershed stream e coli mpn load tile drainage e coli mpn load residual where the residual component was assumed to approximate e coli mpn contributions from non tile sources 2 3 statistical analyses the research herein is founded on a before after control impact baci experimental approach bishop et al 2005 sunohara et al 2015 where two years 2005 06 of monitoring the paired watersheds was assessed prior to any significant ctd implementation in the test ctd watershed pre intervention period this period was followed by significant and abrupt ctd intervention in the test watershed 2007 14 as described above ctd intervention period water quality sampling and analysis methods remained identical between the two experimental time periods of study fecal indicator densities determined from the weekly and or twice a week samples were compared statistically on a site by site value by value basis however for days where there were multiple samples collected during a day such as during rainfall events densities were geometrically averaged to provide a daily value to be compared statistically this was done because rainfall event triggering of the water samplers for the different monitoring sites were not harmonized temporally but based on site rainfall inputs and stream or tile drainage rates daily fib uals were determined from the daily density data total daily stream discharge and upstream catchment areas cfu or mpn ha 1 day 1 the density and ual data were challenged to several statistical tests to help identify potential drainage control effects site differences ctd minus uctd for daily fib densities and daily fib ual were determined for the following site combinations i ctdu vs uctdu ii ctdu vs uctdd iii ctdd vs uctdd and iv ctdd vs uctdu these fib differences were categorized and compared on the basis of the pre intervention period and ctd intervention period and t tests statistica 64 bit version 12 statsoft inc tulsa ok were used to determine if there were significant differences in means of the fib differences ctd minus uctd among the two baci time periods significance α was set at the 0 05 level analysis of covariance ancova was used to determine the watershed scale impact of controlled drainage on daily e coli mpn densities and uals by examining changes in one to one relationships associated with the test ctd and reference uctd watershed outputs among the pre intervention and ctd intervention periods sunohara et al 2015 specifically linear regressions were calculated between daily e coli mpn densities and ual values from the test ctd and reference uctd watersheds for both the pre intervention and ctd intervention periods and then differences in slope and y intercept among those regressions were determined with ancova approaches ponce 1980 usepa 1993 usda nrcs 2003 log transformations were made on the data to improve normality with a value of 1 added to the measured values to ensure zeroes were included in the analysis log10 x 1 significance α was set at the 0 05 level these ancova analyses were not conducted on other mf determined fib due to the fact that observations for them were more temporally limited for each watershed monitoring site spearman s rank correlation was used to evaluate the strength and direction of correlation between mean daily stream discharge and e coli mpn densities and 2 day cumulative rainfall prior to e coli mpn sampling time rain mm 2d and e coli mpn densities associations were compared for each sampling site for the pre and ctd intervention periods machine driven data mining was applied to explore associations interactions and context dependent relationships among fib densities or ual dependent variables and a suite of independent variables that included ctd intervention time period test reference watershed designation stream water discharge and rain mm 2d classification and regression tree cart salford predictive modeler v7 0 64 bit san diego california data mining was employed in regression tree mode following approaches outlined in wilkes et al 2011 using least absolute deviation lad methods we imposed a user defined limitation of not creating a terminal data group a terminal node where no further data splitting occurred smaller than 10 data points for cart analyses we only present cross validated tree models 3 results 3 1 fib density and load differences fig 3 shows fib densities over time in the watersheds during the yearly study seasons there were some notable spikes in some fib in 2005 from uctdu and e coli mpn densities were generally higher on average over a given season than the e coli mf which is to be expected to some degree given e coli mpn sampling included rainfall events the mf sampling schedule may not have captured table 1 shows the means of fib densities for each site on the basis of ctd intervention period there were significant differences in e coli mpn densities for uctdu and ctdd where pre intervention means for these sites were respectively higher and lower than respective ctd intervention means c perfringens was also significantly higher during ctd intervention in relation to pre intervention at ctdd and uctdd sites table 2 shows similar comparisons for fib uals where all significant t test comparisons indicated higher values during the ctd intervention period in relation to the pre intervention period notably for uctdu nearly all fib targets were significant in this direction and all sites except ctdu displayed significantly higher mean e coli mpn uals during the ctd intervention period versus the pre intervention period fig 4 shows watershed discharge and cumulative growing season e coli mpn uals notably for the growing season in 2008 watershed loads ctdd and uctdd pulsed earlier in the growing season relative to other years however from the field tile load perspective outside of the uctd field for field pair 5 and 6 2008 was a year that was not particularly unique from other years suggesting other non field controls on fib sources and mobilization were likely important with respect to fib export in the ditches table 3 indicates that four out of the 24 mean fib density differences were significantly different between pre and ctd intervention time periods three were associated with e coli mpn ctdd uctdd ctdd uctdu and ctdu uctdu and one with c perfringens ctdu uctdd for the e coli mpn results differences were potentially indicative of density increases in the test ctd watershed during ctd intervention or critical density decreases in the reference uctd watershed during ctd intervention thus it should be underscored that e coli mpn density difference ctd uctd increases from the pre to ctd intervention where uctdu site data were utilized were amplified by what appeared to be relatively higher densities at uctdu during the pre intervention period in relation to the ctd intervention period fig 3 however the ctdd vs uctdd density difference results were similar in direction as those comparisons using uctdu e coli mpn data suggesting that critical density increases in the test ctd watershed during ctd intervention may have coherently occurred as a result of the tile drain management in contrast to the fib density difference findings none of the fib ual difference results were significant at the 0 05 level table 4 3 2 analysis of covariance on e coli mpn densities and loads table 5 and fig 5 provide the ancova results on log transformed daily e coli mpn densities and uals for densities all regression r 2 were significant at the 0 05 level except for the pre intervention ctdd vs uctdd r 2 significant slope differences occurred for all density comparisons except ctdu vs uctdu significant y intercept differences were observed for ctdu vs uctdu density comparisons and all site comparisons demonstrated pre and ctd intervention regression line intersections within the range of observed data regression slopes for the density comparisons were all greater for the ctd intervention period in relation to the pre intervention period and y intercepts were lower for the ctd intervention relationships with respect to the pre intervention period relationships for densities with values below the value at the regression line intersection point which is roughly around ctd and uctd site mean values table 1 it appears that ctd intervention modestly reduced densities relative to pre intervention trends for values above the intersection point ctd intervention tended to increase densities in relation to the pre intervention reference conditions ancova for fib uals were significant but displayed different relationship forms among the site comparisons table 5 and fig 5 two of the four plots were similar in form to those for densities for the ctdd vs uctdu relationship there was a significant increase in the y intercept in support of higher uals for the ctd intervention trend for ctdd for ctdd vs uctdd the regression relationships were opposite to those for densities 3 3 correlation and cart analyses correlations among rain mm 2d and e coli mpn densities were all significant and modestly positive for sites among the different intervention periods except for uctdu during pre intervention as noted previously there may have been some unknown source of bacteria impacting pre intervention density levels at this site table 6 during the pre intervention period all monitoring sites had negative spearman s rank correlation coefficients among e coli mpn densities and stream discharge m3 s 1 table 6 the sites in the reference uctd watershed had significant associations p 0 05 during the pre intervention period whereas the test ctd watershed sites had insignificant correlations p 0 05 during the ctd intervention period the correlations for sites for the test ctd watershed became positive and significant while the correlations at sites for the reference uctd watershed became positive and insignificant the cart models are presented in fig 6 fig 6a shows that all e coli mpn density observations were initially split into two data groups on the basis of stream loading m3 ha 1 day 1 with 16 6 m3 ha 1 day 1 being the density data split criterian associated with median densities of 968 mpn 100ml 1 16 6 m3 ha 1 day 1 node 4 and 200 mpn 100ml 1 16 6 m3 ha 1 day 1 node 2 subsequent subdivision of density data in nodes 2 and 4 further emphasize water flow as a primary driving variable impacting e coli mpn densities in both watersheds node 2 data split into two nodal groups of e coli mpn density data based on the test ctd and reference uctd watersheds however there was no differentiation on the basis of ctd intervention period for instance 68 and 64 of ctd test terminal node 1 and uctd reference watershed node 3 data were respectively associated with the ctd intervention period all e coli mpn ual data were initially split with criteria similar to that for the densities fig 6b with higher median uals associated with higher discharge groupings overall the e coli mpn ual cart model reinforced generally positive correlations among bacteria loads and water discharge cart analyses were also conducted to evaluate specific relationships among e coli mpn densities and stream discharge and rain mm 2d for the different intervention periods and watersheds univariate models here we initially expected positive associations among the variables as per wang et al 2018 for these specific cart results terminal node e coli mpn density median results were plotted on the basis of respective mean and threshold for instances where split criteria were in form of and stream discharge and rain mm 2d data split criteria fig 7 to generalize base relationships among densities and hydrological drivers cart was used here to effectively group or filter the findings prior to non linear trend fitting analyses for e coli mpn densities vs stream discharge all trends were strong and significant p 0 05 2nd to 3rd order polynomial fits positive relationships existed above on average 6 m3 ha 1 day 1 and negative relationships generally existed below that stream discharge value the pre intervention results did not have median density values above 500 mpn 100 ml 1 except for the uctd reference watershed at very low to no flow conditions during the ctd intervention period for discharges above roughly 6 m3 ha 1 day 1 higher densities were achieved for a given discharge value in the test ctd watershed relative to the reference watershed for e coli mpn density versus rain mm 2d exponential regression models were similar in form for all relationships except the test ctd watershed during the ctd intervention period where the model x coefficient was at least 0 05 higher than those for the other relationships 3 4 watershed mass balances table 7 shows the estimated proportion of stream flow at downstream ctdd and uctdd sites contributed by field tile drainage sunohara et al 2016 for years 2005 06 the pre intervention period on average 98 10 mean std of stream discharge at both ctdd and uctdd sites was attributed to field tile drainage for the ctd intervention years 2007 to 2012 mean contributions from field tile drainage were 43 20 and 83 27 for ctdd and uctdd sites respectively for e coli mpn which was the most temporally dense fib dataset mean e coli mpn field loadings to ditch referenced at watershed monitoring sites ctdd and uctdd were respectively 1 e coli mpn was not measured in 2005 and 48 49 for the test ctd and reference uctd watershed during the pre intervention period and 3 8 and 9 17 for these respective watershed sites during the ctd intervention period however proportional spatial representation of fields that received manure and overall watershed catchment area that received manure applications were considered comparable only during years 2009 12 table 8 during these ctd intervention years mean e coli mpn field loadings to stream were 5 10 and 12 21 for the test ctd and reference uctd watershed respectively with year 2011 having significantly higher estimated field contributions to overall stream loads than the other years which greatly influenced mean values 4 discussion it is becoming increasingly necessary to evaluate the many co benefits trade offs and

information relating to water indicators regional freshwater quality in canadian rivers eccc 2017 controlled tile drainage can be considered a low hanging fruit in terms of mitigating tile drainage pollution from field to stream drury et al 1996 wesström and messing 2007 christianson et al 2013 sunohara et al 2016 the practice from an edge of field perspective is promising with respect to bacteria load abatement as well frey et al 2015 sunohara et al 2016 however at the watershed scale when ctd is imposed en masse on fields in the watershed for purposes of water and nutrient conservation fib loads in the stream may not be appreciably and consistently affected by the practice at least for the smaller order low gradient systems we examined here during the growing season only notwithstanding the insignificant t test results documented in table 4 the ancova results were indeed significant regarding e coli mpn uals but trends were not as consistent in form as they were for densities however three out of the four site ancova comparisons for e coli mpn ual indicated increases in regression slopes or intercepts for the ctd intervention period ctd ual on y axis fig 5 reasons for these relationships could be founded in fib density changes that resulted from ctd intervention and the nature and sources of fib naturalized or not in the water flow pathways in the watersheds it was documented here that relatively higher e coli mpn densities could occur at low to no flow as well as at higher flow conditions this could engender parity among e coli loads under lower and higher stream discharge situations the cart analyses also suggested that stream discharge rescinded ctd intervention effects as a primary driving criteria that discriminated groups of lower and higher e coli mpn uals in the streams generally growing season load reducing effects of ctd on stream phosphorus and nitrogen sunohara et al 2015 that were examined in tandem with the microbiological data associated with this paper tended to be more consistent than those for fib thus for bacteria tmdl style programs harmel et al 2010 may not glean expected reductions in bacteria loads from predominately tile fed and tile drain managed watersheds overall ancova slope increases for the ctd intervention period combined with t test results for e coli mpn ctd uctd differences table 3 suggest a ctd intervention effect on densities notably ancova indicated that we could expect increases in densities derived from ctd intervention above roughly 200 mpn 100 ml 1 a value in cfu terms buckalew et al 2006 associated with recreational water quality guidelines health canada 2012 and pathogen occurrence 82 of 1 enteric pathogen occurring in agricultural watersheds in canada edge et al 2012 in the watersheds examined tile drainage from fields overwhelmingly contribute to total stream discharge table 7 in reference to groundwater discharge and overland sources sunohara et al 2016 as suggested in schmidt et al 2013 bacteria and pathogen density increases could potentially result from ctd effectively reducing drainage inputs into the stream thereby reducing stream flushing intensity and duration and the dilution capacity of the system a freely draining system can move resident and transported bacteria out of surface waters more regularly than a ctd dominated system where flow inputs are significantly reduced by tile drainage control structures this contention is supported to some degree by smaller rainfall and discharge events inducing relatively higher fib densities in the test ctd watershed in relation to the freely draining reference watershed during the ctd intervention period fig 7 during much of the growing season groundwater that weeps into tiles may not necessarily be highly contaminated with bacteria other studies have noted low densities for bacteria in tile drainage smith et al 1972 patni et al 1984 in this study we observed geometric mean densities from tiles around 6 mpn 100 ml 1 for both uctd and ctd fields during the growing season in line with observations from smith et al 1972 some soils especially those that may be less macroporous in context of preferential flow can significantly abate transport of microorganisms to depth in soil mcmurry et al 1998 aislabie et al 2001 vinten et al 2002 artz et al 2005 this is in contrast to fib loading and densities associated with preferential flow of bacteria to tile drains immediately following manure applications to fields where densities can be as high as 104 106 cfu 100 ml 1 e g mclellan et al 1993 cook and baker 2001 samarajeewa et al 2012 frey et al 2013a b hruby et al 2016 lapen et al 2008 showed that fecal indicator bacteria in tile drainage water derived from liquid municipal biosolid applications to land displayed a first order exponential decay net transport and decay over time with concentrations approaching background levels at about 30 days post application nevertheless the timing of manure amendments applied to land is important to consider in terms of mitigating off field transport of bacteria at the study site especially in light that this study was conducted during the crop growing season when dairy manures are not routinely applied to croplands albeit in some cases manures are applied to forage crop fields after first cutting but while field drainage is typically larger during the wetter spring and fall time periods that are typically associated with manure applications field drainage is necessary during these periods to facilitate farming activities on soils otherwise too wet to traffic in climatic regions similar to those studied herein ctd is often practiced only during the crop growing season for purposes of nutrient and water conservation and moreover ball coelho et al 2012 showed that when subsurface field drainage is impeded during the non growing winter season there is elevated potential for significant mass losses of nutrients sediment and presumably fib via overland flow but frey et al 2013a 2015 demonstrated that short term month tile drainage control following a fall manure application can critically reduce field export of fib to streams e coli derived from field tile drainage was estimated to be a very small contributor to stream e coli loads in fact for 10 out of the 15 seasonal estimates contributions from field to stream were effectively negligible table 7 this holds even for observation years 2009 where the percentages of experimental field area recieving manure applications were consistent with the percentages of watershed areas receiving manure table 8 the simple e coli mpn mass balance performed here indicates that in stream processes and off field in stream bacteria reservoirs are important at this site and furthermore it appears greater inputs of tile drainage water associated with freely draining tiles could serve to help dilute and flush fib and pathogens from the surface water systems fecal indicator bacteria in surface water can result from a variety of fecal and naturalized sources and reservoirs ishii and sadowsky 2008 somarelli et al 2007 sapkota et al 2007 balzer et al 2010 garzio hadzick et al 2010 marti et al 2013 chu et al 2014 wilkes et al 2014 found significantly lower occurrences of salmonella spp and arcobacter spp and also lower loads of livestock ruminant and pig bacteroides biomarkers in the test ctd watershed during ctd intervention the combined results from sunohara et al 2016 wilkes et al 2014 and frey et al 2015 indicate that ctd can directly reduce bacteria loading from field to stream but if we hold that increased fib densities can occur in concert with increased pathogen densities occurrences vereen et al 2007 edge et al 2012 at the watershed scale due to reasons noted above controlling drainage could amplify water exposure risks schmidt et al 2013 at least within the immediate impacted watercourse albeit in many cases drainage ditches and other smaller order water courses designed and maintained to receive tile discharge from adjacent fields will not be surface waterbodies where human recreational activity and water extraction for human consumption will readily occur but these kinds of surface water systems can be used as drinking water sources for livestock which could be important from a livestock disease transmission perspective lejeune et al 2001 and depending on the nature and degree of field tile drainage control and other biophysical factors governing hydrology there could be impacts expressed at downstream surface water receptors that may have more direct public health importance e g water recreational areas 5 conclusion for the biologically and agronomically active crop growing season fib densities in drainage ditch surface water could be expected to increase as a result of reduced flushing and dilution imposed by controlling subsurface tile drainage inputs to the ditch fib densities in the test ctd watershed appeared to increase as a result of ctd intervention most notably above roughly e coli mpn of 200 mpn 100 ml 1 in relation to those in the reference uctd watershed that did not have drainage control imposed following documented positive fib density pathogen occurrence and density relationships for many agricultural watershed settings ctd imposed en masse over a tile drained watershed or suite of them could potentially result in elevated pathogen exposure risks as per schmidt et al 2013 in the immediate receiving ditch the extent of such risks and implications with respect to other downstream water receptors like lakes and rivers would depend on many site specific environmental and land use factors beyond scope of study here the impact of tile drainage control on fib loads during the growing season is not well defined fib densities can be expected to be relatively higher during low no flow conditions as well as during relatively larger flow events at this site this bi modal situation can create some parity among fib loads that occur at the relatively lower and relatively higher stream flow conditions making loading effects resulting from ctd less clear there is some indication that when critical hydrological transport events occur in the watersheds rain and ditch flow fib densities in the watercourses will be generally higher in a ctd influenced watershed in relation to a system dominated by freely draining tiles see fig 7 as noted previously this could be related in part to more regular in stream flushing of fib in the uctd system in relation to the ctd influenced system where regular flushing is reduced tile drainage makes up about 90 of ditch flow and restricting it will reduce drainage inputs to surface water see fig 5 plot a growing season water contributions from field tile drainage to stream during the ctd intervention period were on average 43 and 83 for the test ctd and reference uctd watershed respectively however the proportion of ditch fib load contributed by tile was on average very small for all watersheds and intervention time periods 11 11 mean std thus it is suggested that a grand majority of fib loading will likely be a result of the mobilization of fib from non tile drainage sources e g in stream and near stream bacteria reservoirs representing wildlife accumulated off field contributions and naturalized bacteria given that i ctd effects on reducing watershed scale nitrogen and phosphorus loading were significant during the growing season as per sunohara et al 2015 ii a vast majority of fib reservoirs available for downstream transport likely occur in stream near stream where flow control is not directly possible in these systems iii these types of drainage ditch stream networks are not frequently used as drinking water or recreational sites for humans and iv the overall greater densities in the ditches associated with ctd intervention were most notable when e coli mpn was above roughly 200 mpn 100 ml 1 we feel water and nutrient conservation based justifications for using ctd throughout watersheds such as those examined likely outweigh fib based rationales for not deploying the practice declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

19083,predicting bacterial levels in watersheds in response to agricultural beneficial management practices bmps requires understanding the germane processes at both the watershed and field scale controlling subsurface tile drainage ctd is a highly effective bmp at reducing nutrient losses from fields and watersheds when employed en masse but little work has been conducted on ctd effects on bacterial loads and densities in a watershed context this study compared fecal indicator bacteria fib e coli enterococcus fecal coliform total coliform clostridium perfringens densities and unit area

watershed vs reference uncontrolled tile drainage uctd watershed during a pre ctd intervention period and a ctd intervention period where the test ctd watershed had ctd deployed on over 80 of the fields with no tile drainage management upstream tile drainage to ditches comprised 90 of total ditch discharge we also examined fib loads from a subset of tile drained fields to determine field load contributions to the watershed drainage ditches statistical evidence of a ctd effect on fib ual in the surface water systems was not strong however there was statistical evidence of increased fib densities pronounced when e coli 200 most probable number mpn 100 ml 1 in the test ctd watershed during the ctd intervention period this was likely a result of reduced dilution flushing in the test ctd watershed ditch due to ctd significantly decreasing the amount of tile drainage water entering the surface water system tile e coli load contributions to the ditches were low for example during the 6 yr ctd intervention period they amounted to on average only 3 and 9 of the ditch loads for the test ctd and reference uctd watersheds respectively this suggests in stream or off field fib reservoirs and bacteria mobilization drivers dominated ditch e coli loads in the watersheds during the growing season overall this study suggested that decision making regarding deployment of ctd en masse in tile fed watersheds should consider drainage practice effects on bacterial densities and loads as well as ctd s documented capacity to boost crop yields and reduce seasonal nutrient pollution

be effective at reducing net losses of n and p and fecal indicator bacteria from fields drury et al 1996 wesström and messing 2007 skaggs et al 2012 sunohara et al 2016 reducing nutrient loads from watersheds sunohara et al 2015 as well as boosting crop yields ghane et al 2012 sunohara et al 2014 thus ctd is a bmp that can address both user e g improved yields and non user or off farm benefits e g improved surface water quality currently only a few studies have examined how this practice impacts bacterial loads and densities in water which can be critical when the practice is viewed with a public health lens some studies have found transient benefits of managing tile drainage for reducing pathogen and fib loading at the field plot scale frey et al 2013a 2015 other studies suggest that there can be significant reductions in the occurrences of several waterborne pathogens and fecal pollution biomarkers potentially of field origin when ctd is employed broadly over a tile dominated watershed wilkes et al 2014 however schmidt et al 2013 indicated via quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra that mean risks per exposure associated with the bacterial pathogen campylobacter spp were somewhat elevated in an experimental watershed where tile drainage was controlled in relation to an adjacent experimental watershed where it was not controlled albeit the source of campylobacter was not determined the exploratory study by schmidt et al 2013 led us to consider potential public health related side effects associated with tile drainage management imposed en masse on fields in watersheds currently it is not practical to examine all relevant waterborne pathogens quantitatively in a timely affordable and logistically manageable manner and fib will continue to be used as indicators of fecal pollution as well as indicators of the potential for pathogen occurrence edge et al 2012 into at least the near future usepa 2012 government of canada 2016 hence in this study we

implication of ctd imposed en masse on fields in a test watershed on surface water fib densities and loads 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental watersheds in this study two watersheds were monitored for fib during 2005 14 fig 1 total surface catchment areas of the test ctd watershed and the reference uctd watershed are estimated to be 467 and 250 ha respectively being directly adjacent to one another the two experimental watersheds have common weather physiography soils and land uses for 2005 to 2013 mean daily temperatures were greatest in july 22 c and were lowest in january and february 7 c total yearly rainfall between 2005 and 2013 ranged between 509 2012 and 1045 mm 2006 russell ontario http climate weather gc ca the soils are dominated by bainsville silt loams of the gleysolic order wicklund and richards 1962 the stream drainage ditches are ice covered during the majority of the winter season based on yearly remote sensing and ground truth surveys between 2005 and 2014 the test ctd reference uctd experimental watersheds were under 41 36 livestock corn zea mays production 21 18 soybean glycine max and 35 38 forage hay land cover dairy bovine manure is the primary manure based fecal inputs to surface water from agriculture that the authors are aware of in these experimental watersheds as documented via ruminant microbial source tracking markers wilkes et al 2014 usually liquid bovine manure is applied to select fields not all fields in watershed by producers at application rates of around 47 000 to 75 000 l ha 1 land application typically occurs by surface spreading followed by incorporation in the spring prior to planting and in the fall after crops have been harvested periods generally considered before and after the crop growing season however land application of bovine manure has been observed less frequently after first cuts of forage hay which typically occurs in june another potential source of anthropogenically engendered fecal pollution in the watershed occurs upstream of the controlled tile drainage downstream site ctdd fig 1 here there exists a small hobby farm consisting of a low and annually variable number of hobby farm animals wilkes et al 2013a b the farm is set back from the stream and hydrological pathways for fecal pollution are not notably established within the test ctd watershed tile drainage water from fields were controlled by inline water level control structures agri drain corporation adair ia fitted with stop logs also known as stopgates or flashboards fig 2 sunohara et al 2014 2015 tile drain laterals with a spacing between 15 and 17 m for an individual field system figs 1 and 2 collectively drain water into a main header that itself drains into a single outlet to the stream fig 2 the control structure for each field for which it controls flow was located near the drainage outlet tile flow control was practiced from roughly planting time to just before final autumn harvest of each year during the non growing season ctd structures were set to allow for free drainage due to reasons discussed in sunohara et al 2016 after planting stop logs were set to a depth of 0 6 m below the soil surface for fields under ctd management when water levels were less than 0 6 m below the surface tile water would spill over the top stop log and drain into the drainage ditch tile flow ceased when water levels were deeper than 0 6 m from the surface roughly 89 and 90 of the test ctd and reference uctd watershed total catchment areas respectively are tile drained fields sunohara et al 2014 ctd intervention in the test ctd watershed was not appreciable in years 2005 and 2006 occupying 9 of tile drained fields in the watershed therefore 2005 06 is considered the pre ctd intervention or control period ctd was installed more intensely after 2006 on the test ctd watershed 80 of the tile drained fields in the watershed thus we considered 2007 and years beyond it the ctd intervention or test period 2 2 fecal indicator bacteria and hydrological measurements the membrane filtration mf methods for fib follow standard procedures documented in wilkes et al 2009 e coli were also quantified

sampled at downstream and upstream monitoring sites within the two watersheds ctdd ctdu uctdd and uctdu fig 1 water samples of 1 l volume were collected on a bi weekly basis to determine fib using mf methods for mpn water samples were collected during rainfall events and on a weekly 2005 2006 to twice weekly 2007 2012 basis samples were collected from the water sampling sites generally from april until early to mid november or until surface water freeze up membrane filtration samples were collected from all water sampling sites from 2005 to 2010 but only from ctdd and uctdd sites during 2011 2014 all four sampling sites were sampled using mpn methods from 2005 to 2012 water samples were sent on ice overnight to aafc s london research and development centre for mf estimation of fib densities stream discharge was monitored at the four instream monitoring sites using the area velocity method described in grant and dawson 2001 and sunohara et al 2015 fig 1 discharge m3 15 min 1 was measured at fixed circular culverts located at each water sampling site using isco 4150 area velocity flow modules and low profile area velocity sensors sensors teledyne isco inc tile discharge m3 15

isco model 730 teledyne isco attached to automatic water samplers isco model 6712 both stream and field tile discharge methods were periodically validated with manual discharge measurements using a water velocity probe model fp201 global water instrumentation for stream measures and timed volume measurement approaches for field tile drainage a vast majority of growing season stream flow is attributed to tile drainage in these watersheds see results section hence we felt we could identify the relative role of tile drainage control on stream e coli loads and densities in order to assess the degree of fib contributions from field tile drainage to ditch e coli mpn samples were collected during the growing seasons of 2005 12 8 years from tile drainage outlets on seven experimental paired ctd and uctd fields within the watersheds sunohara et al 2015 2016 figs 1 and 2 tile drainage water was sampled for e coli mpn once to twice weekly when tiles were flowing with denser sampling occurring during tile discharge events 3 5 samples per flow event for flowing systems initiating at an 0 01 m increase in overflow head in the control structure with sampling intervals increasing in time over the discharge event sunohara et al 2016 linear interpolation was used to estimate e coli mpn densities between data points using the imputets package moritz 2016 and the na interpolation function see sunohara et al 2016 interval drainage volumes were then multiplied by the interpolated interval fib densities to estimate tile e coli loads mpn 15min 1 field area provided a means to estimate unit area loads uals mpn time 1 contributing area 1 for each year of study both watershed and tile drain e coli mpn loads mpn season 1 and uals mpn ha 1season 1 were calculated for common growing season periods when ctd was actively employed on fields generally may to october to estimate total tile e coli mpn contributions to the two watershed ditches for a season we multiplied the average of the monitored tile drain uals by the field areas in the watersheds associated with the tile drainage treatment that the average ual represented simple and descriptive watershed mass balances for each year season of study were calculated as watershed stream e coli mpn load tile drainage e coli mpn load residual where the residual component was assumed to approximate e coli mpn contributions from non tile sources 2 3 statistical analyses the research herein is founded on a before after control impact baci experimental approach bishop et al 2005 sunohara et al 2015 where two years 2005 06 of monitoring the paired watersheds was assessed prior to any significant ctd implementation in the test ctd watershed pre intervention period this period was followed by significant and abrupt ctd intervention in the test watershed 2007 14 as described above ctd intervention period water quality sampling and analysis methods remained identical between the two experimental time periods of study fecal indicator densities determined from the weekly and or twice a week samples were compared statistically on a site by site value by value basis however for days where there were multiple samples collected during a day such as during rainfall events densities were geometrically averaged to provide a daily value to be compared statistically this was done because rainfall event triggering of the water samplers for the different monitoring sites were not harmonized temporally but based on site rainfall inputs and stream or tile drainage rates daily fib uals were determined from the daily density data total daily stream discharge and upstream catchment areas cfu or mpn ha 1 day 1 the density and ual data were challenged to several statistical tests to help identify potential drainage control effects site differences ctd minus uctd for daily fib densities and daily fib ual were determined for the following site combinations i ctdu vs uctdu ii ctdu vs uctdd iii ctdd vs uctdd and iv ctdd vs uctdu these fib differences were categorized and compared on the basis of the pre intervention period and ctd intervention period and t tests statistica 64 bit version 12 statsoft inc tulsa ok were used to determine if there were significant differences in means of the fib differences ctd minus uctd among the two baci time periods significance α was set at the 0 05 level analysis of covariance ancova was used to determine the watershed scale impact of controlled drainage on daily e coli mpn densities and uals by examining changes in one to one relationships associated with the test ctd and reference uctd watershed outputs among the pre intervention and ctd intervention periods sunohara et al 2015 specifically linear regressions were calculated between daily e coli mpn densities and ual values from the test ctd and reference uctd watersheds for both the pre intervention and ctd intervention periods and then differences in slope and y intercept among those regressions were determined with ancova approaches ponce 1980 usepa 1993 usda nrcs 2003 log transformations were made on the data to improve normality with a value of 1 added to the measured values to ensure zeroes were included in the analysis log10 x 1 significance α was set at the 0 05 level these ancova analyses were not conducted on other mf determined fib due to the fact that observations for them were more temporally limited for each watershed monitoring site spearman s rank correlation was used to evaluate the strength and direction of correlation between mean daily stream discharge and e coli mpn densities and 2 day cumulative rainfall prior to e coli mpn sampling time rain mm 2d and e coli mpn densities associations were compared for each sampling site for the pre and ctd intervention periods machine driven data mining was applied to explore associations interactions and context dependent relationships among fib densities or ual dependent variables and a suite of independent variables that included ctd intervention time period test reference watershed designation stream water discharge and rain mm 2d classification and regression tree cart salford predictive modeler v7 0 64 bit san diego california data mining was employed in regression tree mode following approaches outlined in wilkes et al 2011 using least absolute deviation lad methods we imposed a user defined limitation of not creating a terminal data group a terminal node where no further data splitting occurred smaller than 10 data points for cart analyses we only present cross validated tree models 3 results 3 1 fib density and load differences fig 3 shows fib densities over time in the watersheds during the yearly study seasons there were some notable spikes in some fib in 2005 from uctdu and e coli mpn densities were generally higher on average over a given season than the e coli mf which is to be expected to some degree given e coli mpn sampling included rainfall events the mf sampling schedule may not have captured table 1 shows the means of fib densities for each site on the basis of ctd intervention period there were significant differences in e coli mpn densities for uctdu and ctdd where pre intervention means for these sites were respectively higher and lower than respective ctd intervention means c perfringens was also significantly higher during ctd intervention in relation to pre intervention at ctdd and uctdd sites table 2 shows similar comparisons for fib uals where all significant t test comparisons indicated higher values during the ctd intervention period in relation to the pre intervention period notably for uctdu nearly all fib targets were significant in this direction and all sites except ctdu displayed significantly higher mean e coli mpn uals during the ctd intervention period versus the pre intervention period fig 4 shows watershed discharge and cumulative growing season e coli mpn uals notably for the growing season in 2008 watershed loads ctdd and uctdd pulsed earlier in the growing season relative to other years however from the field tile load perspective outside of the uctd field for field pair 5 and 6 2008 was a year that was not particularly unique from other years suggesting other non field controls on fib sources and mobilization were likely important with respect to fib export in the ditches table 3 indicates that four out of the 24 mean fib density differences were significantly different between pre and ctd intervention time periods three were associated with e coli mpn ctdd uctdd ctdd uctdu and ctdu uctdu and one with c perfringens ctdu uctdd for the e coli mpn results differences were potentially indicative of density increases in the test ctd watershed during ctd intervention or critical density decreases in the reference uctd watershed during ctd intervention thus it should be underscored that e coli mpn density difference ctd uctd increases from the pre to ctd intervention where uctdu site data were utilized were amplified by what appeared to be relatively higher densities at uctdu during the pre intervention period in relation to the ctd intervention period fig 3 however the ctdd vs uctdd density difference results were similar in direction as those comparisons using uctdu e coli mpn data suggesting that critical density increases in the test ctd watershed during ctd intervention may have coherently occurred as a result of the tile drain management in contrast to the fib density difference findings none of the fib ual difference results were significant at the 0 05 level table 4 3 2 analysis of covariance on e coli mpn densities and loads table 5 and fig 5 provide the ancova results on log transformed daily e coli mpn densities and uals for densities all regression r 2 were significant at the 0 05 level except for the pre intervention ctdd vs uctdd r 2 significant slope differences occurred for all density comparisons except ctdu vs uctdu significant y intercept differences were observed for ctdu vs uctdu density comparisons and all site comparisons demonstrated pre and ctd intervention regression line intersections within the range of observed data regression slopes for the density comparisons were all greater for the ctd intervention period in relation to the pre intervention period and y intercepts were lower for the ctd intervention relationships with respect to the pre intervention period relationships for densities with values below the value at the regression line intersection point which is roughly around ctd and uctd site mean values table 1 it appears that ctd intervention modestly reduced densities relative to pre intervention trends for values above the intersection point ctd intervention tended to increase densities in relation to the pre intervention reference conditions ancova for fib uals were significant but displayed different relationship forms among the site comparisons table 5 and fig 5 two of the four plots were similar in form to those for densities for the ctdd vs uctdu relationship there was a significant increase in the y intercept in support of higher uals for the ctd intervention trend for ctdd for ctdd vs uctdd the regression relationships were opposite to those for densities 3 3 correlation and cart analyses correlations among rain mm 2d and e coli mpn densities were all significant and modestly positive for sites among the different intervention periods except for uctdu during pre intervention as noted previously there may have been some unknown source of bacteria impacting pre intervention density levels at this site table 6 during the pre intervention period all monitoring sites had negative spearman s rank correlation coefficients among e coli mpn densities and stream discharge m3 s 1 table 6 the sites in the reference uctd watershed had significant associations p 0 05 during the pre intervention period whereas the test ctd watershed sites had insignificant correlations p 0 05 during the ctd intervention period the correlations for sites for the test ctd watershed became positive and significant while the correlations at sites for the reference uctd watershed became positive and insignificant the cart models are presented in fig 6 fig 6a shows that all e coli mpn density observations were initially split into two data groups on the basis of stream loading m3 ha 1 day 1 with 16 6 m3 ha 1 day 1 being the density data split criterian associated with median densities of 968 mpn 100ml 1 16 6 m3 ha 1 day 1 node 4 and 200 mpn 100ml 1 16 6 m3 ha 1 day 1 node 2 subsequent subdivision of density data in nodes 2 and 4 further emphasize water flow as a primary driving variable impacting e coli mpn densities in both watersheds node 2 data split into two nodal groups of e coli mpn density data based on the test ctd and reference uctd watersheds however there was no differentiation on the basis of ctd intervention period for instance 68 and 64 of ctd test terminal node 1 and uctd reference watershed node 3 data were respectively associated with the ctd intervention period all e coli mpn ual data were initially split with criteria similar to that for the densities fig 6b with higher median uals associated with higher discharge groupings overall the e coli mpn ual cart model reinforced generally positive correlations among bacteria loads and water discharge cart analyses were also conducted to evaluate specific relationships among e coli mpn densities and stream discharge and rain mm 2d for the different intervention periods and watersheds univariate models here we initially expected positive associations among the variables as per wang et al 2018 for these specific cart results terminal node e coli mpn density median results were plotted on the basis of respective mean and threshold for instances where split criteria were in form of and stream discharge and rain mm 2d data split criteria fig 7 to generalize base relationships among densities and hydrological drivers cart was used here to effectively group or filter the findings prior to non linear trend fitting analyses for e coli mpn densities vs stream discharge all trends were strong and significant p 0 05 2nd to 3rd order polynomial fits positive relationships existed above on average 6 m3 ha 1 day 1 and negative relationships generally existed below that stream discharge value the pre intervention results did not have median density values above 500 mpn 100 ml 1 except for the uctd reference watershed at very low to no flow conditions during the ctd intervention period for discharges above roughly 6 m3 ha 1 day 1 higher densities were achieved for a given discharge value in the test ctd watershed relative to the reference watershed for e coli mpn density versus rain mm 2d exponential regression models were similar in form for all relationships except the test ctd watershed during the ctd intervention period where the model x coefficient was at least 0 05 higher than those for the other relationships 3 4 watershed mass balances table 7 shows the estimated proportion of stream flow at downstream ctdd and uctdd sites contributed by field tile drainage sunohara et al 2016 for years 2005 06 the pre intervention period on average 98 10 mean std of stream discharge at both ctdd and uctdd sites was attributed to field tile drainage for the ctd intervention years 2007 to 2012 mean contributions from field tile drainage were 43 20 and 83 27 for ctdd and uctdd sites respectively for e coli mpn which was the most temporally dense fib dataset mean e coli mpn field loadings to ditch referenced at watershed monitoring sites ctdd and uctdd were respectively 1 e coli mpn was not measured in 2005 and 48 49 for the test ctd and reference uctd watershed during the pre intervention period and 3 8 and 9 17 for these respective watershed sites during the ctd intervention period however proportional spatial representation of fields that received manure and overall watershed catchment area that received manure applications were considered comparable only during years 2009 12 table 8 during these ctd intervention years mean e coli mpn field loadings to stream were 5 10 and 12 21 for the test ctd and reference uctd watershed respectively with year 2011 having significantly higher estimated field contributions to overall stream loads than the other years which greatly influenced mean values 4 discussion it is becoming increasingly necessary to evaluate the many co benefits trade offs and

information relating to water indicators regional freshwater quality in canadian rivers eccc 2017 controlled tile drainage can be considered a low hanging fruit in terms of mitigating tile drainage pollution from field to stream drury et al 1996 wesström and messing 2007 christianson et al 2013 sunohara et al 2016 the practice from an edge of field perspective is promising with respect to bacteria load abatement as well frey et al 2015 sunohara et al 2016 however at the watershed scale when ctd is imposed en masse on fields in the watershed for purposes of water and nutrient conservation fib loads in the stream may not be appreciably and consistently affected by the practice at least for the smaller order low gradient systems we examined here during the growing season only notwithstanding the insignificant t test results documented in table 4 the ancova results were indeed significant regarding e coli mpn uals but trends were not as consistent in form as they were for densities however three out of the four site ancova comparisons for e coli mpn ual indicated increases in regression slopes or intercepts for the ctd intervention period ctd ual on y axis fig 5 reasons for these relationships could be founded in fib density changes that resulted from ctd intervention and the nature and sources of fib naturalized or not in the water flow pathways in the watersheds it was documented here that relatively higher e coli mpn densities could occur at low to no flow as well as at higher flow conditions this could engender parity among e coli loads under lower and higher stream discharge situations the cart analyses also suggested that stream discharge rescinded ctd intervention effects as a primary driving criteria that discriminated groups of lower and higher e coli mpn uals in the streams generally growing season load reducing effects of ctd on stream phosphorus and nitrogen sunohara et al 2015 that were examined in tandem with the microbiological data associated with this paper tended to be more consistent than those for fib thus for bacteria tmdl style programs harmel et al 2010 may not glean expected reductions in bacteria loads from predominately tile fed and tile drain managed watersheds overall ancova slope increases for the ctd intervention period combined with t test results for e coli mpn ctd uctd differences table 3 suggest a ctd intervention effect on densities notably ancova indicated that we could expect increases in densities derived from ctd intervention above roughly 200 mpn 100 ml 1 a value in cfu terms buckalew et al 2006 associated with recreational water quality guidelines health canada 2012 and pathogen occurrence 82 of 1 enteric pathogen occurring in agricultural watersheds in canada edge et al 2012 in the watersheds examined tile drainage from fields overwhelmingly contribute to total stream discharge table 7 in reference to groundwater discharge and overland sources sunohara et al 2016 as suggested in schmidt et al 2013 bacteria and pathogen density increases could potentially result from ctd effectively reducing drainage inputs into the stream thereby reducing stream flushing intensity and duration and the dilution capacity of the system a freely draining system can move resident and transported bacteria out of surface waters more regularly than a ctd dominated system where flow inputs are significantly reduced by tile drainage control structures this contention is supported to some degree by smaller rainfall and discharge events inducing relatively higher fib densities in the test ctd watershed in relation to the freely draining reference watershed during the ctd intervention period fig 7 during much of the growing season groundwater that weeps into tiles may not necessarily be highly contaminated with bacteria other studies have noted low densities for bacteria in tile drainage smith et al 1972 patni et al 1984 in this study we observed geometric mean densities from tiles around 6 mpn 100 ml 1 for both uctd and ctd fields during the growing season in line with observations from smith et al 1972 some soils especially those that may be less macroporous in context of preferential flow can significantly abate transport of microorganisms to depth in soil mcmurry et al 1998 aislabie et al 2001 vinten et al 2002 artz et al 2005 this is in contrast to fib loading and densities associated with preferential flow of bacteria to tile drains immediately following manure applications to fields where densities can be as high as 104 106 cfu 100 ml 1 e g mclellan et al 1993 cook and baker 2001 samarajeewa et al 2012 frey et al 2013a b hruby et al 2016 lapen et al 2008 showed that fecal indicator bacteria in tile drainage water derived from liquid municipal biosolid applications to land displayed a first order exponential decay net transport and decay over time with concentrations approaching background levels at about 30 days post application nevertheless the timing of manure amendments applied to land is important to consider in terms of mitigating off field transport of bacteria at the study site especially in light that this study was conducted during the crop growing season when dairy manures are not routinely applied to croplands albeit in some cases manures are applied to forage crop fields after first cutting but while field drainage is typically larger during the wetter spring and fall time periods that are typically associated with manure applications field drainage is necessary during these periods to facilitate farming activities on soils otherwise too wet to traffic in climatic regions similar to those studied herein ctd is often practiced only during the crop growing season for purposes of nutrient and water conservation and moreover ball coelho et al 2012 showed that when subsurface field drainage is impeded during the non growing winter season there is elevated potential for significant mass losses of nutrients sediment and presumably fib via overland flow but frey et al 2013a 2015 demonstrated that short term month tile drainage control following a fall manure application can critically reduce field export of fib to streams e coli derived from field tile drainage was estimated to be a very small contributor to stream e coli loads in fact for 10 out of the 15 seasonal estimates contributions from field to stream were effectively negligible table 7 this holds even for observation years 2009 where the percentages of experimental field area recieving manure applications were consistent with the percentages of watershed areas receiving manure table 8 the simple e coli mpn mass balance performed here indicates that in stream processes and off field in stream bacteria reservoirs are important at this site and furthermore it appears greater inputs of tile drainage water associated with freely draining tiles could serve to help dilute and flush fib and pathogens from the surface water systems fecal indicator bacteria in surface water can result from a variety of fecal and naturalized sources and reservoirs ishii and sadowsky 2008 somarelli et al 2007 sapkota et al 2007 balzer et al 2010 garzio hadzick et al 2010 marti et al 2013 chu et al 2014 wilkes et al 2014 found significantly lower occurrences of salmonella spp and arcobacter spp and also lower loads of livestock ruminant and pig bacteroides biomarkers in the test ctd watershed during ctd intervention the combined results from sunohara et al 2016 wilkes et al 2014 and frey et al 2015 indicate that ctd can directly reduce bacteria loading from field to stream but if we hold that increased fib densities can occur in concert with increased pathogen densities occurrences vereen et al 2007 edge et al 2012 at the watershed scale due to reasons noted above controlling drainage could amplify water exposure risks schmidt et al 2013 at least within the immediate impacted watercourse albeit in many cases drainage ditches and other smaller order water courses designed and maintained to receive tile discharge from adjacent fields will not be surface waterbodies where human recreational activity and water extraction for human consumption will readily occur but these kinds of surface water systems can be used as drinking water sources for livestock which could be important from a livestock disease transmission perspective lejeune et al 2001 and depending on the nature and degree of field tile drainage control and other biophysical factors governing hydrology there could be impacts expressed at downstream surface water receptors that may have more direct public health importance e g water recreational areas 5 conclusion for the biologically and agronomically active crop growing season fib densities in drainage ditch surface water could be expected to increase as a result of reduced flushing and dilution imposed by controlling subsurface tile drainage inputs to the ditch fib densities in the test ctd watershed appeared to increase as a result of ctd intervention most notably above roughly e coli mpn of 200 mpn 100 ml 1 in relation to those in the reference uctd watershed that did not have drainage control imposed following documented positive fib density pathogen occurrence and density relationships for many agricultural watershed settings ctd imposed en masse over a tile drained watershed or suite of them could potentially result in elevated pathogen exposure risks as per schmidt et al 2013 in the immediate receiving ditch the extent of such risks and implications with respect to other downstream water receptors like lakes and rivers would depend on many site specific environmental and land use factors beyond scope of study here the impact of tile drainage control on fib loads during the growing season is not well defined fib densities can be expected to be relatively higher during low no flow conditions as well as during relatively larger flow events at this site this bi modal situation can create some parity among fib loads that occur at the relatively lower and relatively higher stream flow conditions making loading effects resulting from ctd less clear there is some indication that when critical hydrological transport events occur in the watersheds rain and ditch flow fib densities in the watercourses will be generally higher in a ctd influenced watershed in relation to a system dominated by freely draining tiles see fig 7 as noted previously this could be related in part to more regular in stream flushing of fib in the uctd system in relation to the ctd influenced system where regular flushing is reduced tile drainage makes up about 90 of ditch flow and restricting it will reduce drainage inputs to surface water see fig 5 plot a growing season water contributions from field tile drainage to stream during the ctd intervention period were on average 43 and 83 for the test ctd and reference uctd watershed respectively however the proportion of ditch fib load contributed by tile was on average very small for all watersheds and intervention time periods 11 11 mean std thus it is suggested that a grand majority of fib loading will likely be a result of the mobilization of fib from non tile drainage sources e g in stream and near stream bacteria reservoirs representing wildlife accumulated off field contributions and naturalized bacteria given that i ctd effects on reducing watershed scale nitrogen and phosphorus loading were significant during the growing season as per sunohara et al 2015 ii a vast majority of fib reservoirs available for downstream transport likely occur in stream near stream where flow control is not directly possible in these systems iii these types of drainage ditch stream networks are not frequently used as drinking water or recreational sites for humans and iv the overall greater densities in the ditches associated with ctd intervention were most notable when e coli mpn was above roughly 200 mpn 100 ml 1 we feel water and nutrient conservation based justifications for using ctd throughout watersheds such as those examined likely

direct sunlight damage setlow 1974 jagger 1985 lytle and sagripanti 2005 to account for this wavelength dependence efforts have been made to model endogenous sunlight inactivation rates k endo using biological weighting functions also referred to as photoaction spectra which describe the sensitivity to inactivation as a function of wavelength mattle et al 2015 fisher et al 2011 cullen and neale 1996 rundel 1983 previous research by fisher et al 2011 and mattle et al 2015 resulted in the development of biological weighting function based models to predict ms2 k endo these two groups took different approaches to model development fisher et al 2011 conducted ms2 inactivation experiments with a solar simulator and a series of optical filters to vary the incident irradiance spectrum which subsequently influenced inactivation rates seven cutoff filters were used resulting in seven distinct data sets consisting of the measured irradiance spectrum and the inactivation rate these data were input to a constrained nonlinear multivariable optimization function developed in matlab to produce a biological weighting function that described ms2 sensitivity to different wavelengths of light alternatively mattle et al 2015 developed a model framework that was based on direct chemical photolysis theory which takes into account the wavelength specific rate of photon absorption by the virus and the quantum yield of virus inactivation both models are described in detail below an additional model was developed by beck et al 2016 to predicted ms2 inactivation based on spectral irradiance however the focus of the study was on uvc light i e 200 280 nm with only one data point in the sunlight relevant region of the light spectrum in the present study we compared the estimates of ms2 k endo made by four numerical models the fisher et al 2011 model the mattle et al 2015 model a new inactivation rate model developed for this publication and a model derived from mattle et al 2015 but with a modified quantum yield predicted k endo were compared to measured inactivation rates from new and previously published ms2 inactivation experiments conducted with a solar simulator 2 methods 2 1 previously developed ms2 endogenous sunlight inactivation models as noted above two previous studies developed wavelength dependent functions to predict the endogenous sunlight inactivation rate of ms2 the model developed by fisher et al 2011 uses a framework for calculating k endo given by equation 1 where e 0 b λ w m 2 nm 1 is the average irradiance spectrum transmitted through the water column i e the irradiance incident on the water surface e d 0 λ corrected for light attenuation in the water column using the light absorption spectrum α λ and the optical path length b equation 2 which is derived in the supplemental information p λ m2 w 1 h 1 is the wavelength dependent sensitivity coefficient spectrum i e the biological weighting function and δλ is the wavelength interval between p λ values values of p λ are provided in table s1 and δλ for the fisher et al 2011 model is 3 nm 1 k e n d o λ p λ e 0 b λ δ λ 2 e 0 b λ e d 0 λ 1 10 α λ b 2 303 α λ b fisher et al 2011 determined p λ using a constrained nonlinear multivariable optimization function in matlab that did not restrict the shape of the resulting p λ function data input to matlab were measured during ms2 inactivation experiments that the authors conducted using simulated sunlight in combination with a series of long pass cutoff filters that changed the spectral distribution of the incident light seven cutoff filters were used to create seven distinct irradiance spectra i e e 0 b λ that resulted in seven different measured endogenous inactivation rates i e k endo this data is referred to as the calibration data mattle et al 2015 used a different framework for modeling sunlight inactivation of ms2 equations 3 5 which was developed based on direct chemical photolysis theory the change in the concentration of the virus over time d c v i r u s d t was calculated as a function of the rate of photon absorption by the virus p α v i r u s photons s 1 ml 1 and the quantum yield of virus

was determined by measuring the uv visible absorption spectrum of a known concentration of purified ms2 and then normalizing by that concentration mattle et al 2015 provided ε v i r u s λ values between 240 and 400 nm mattle et al 2015 subsequently determined an apparent ϕ v i r u s through controlled experiments using a solar simulator ϕ v i r u s was assumed to be the same across uv wavelengths and was calculated to be equal to 2 9 0 4 10 3 viruses inactivated per photon absorbed mattle et al 2015 kohn et al 2016 2 2 development of a new ms2 p λ spectrum the new k endo model developed and evaluated in this paper uses the same framework as the fisher et al 2011 model equation 1 but differs in its p λ spectrum the new p λ spectrum was determined using a method described by rundel 1983 and cullen and neale 1996 and was used by silverman and nelson 2016 to determine p λ for the escherichia coli and enterococci faecalis the rundel 1983 and cullen and neale 1996 method differs from the methodology used by fisher et al 2011 in that the spectral shape of the biological weighting function was assigned to be that of an exponential decay curve equation 6 where a 0 and a 1 are empiracle constants additionally while fisher et al 2011 provided p λ values between 280 and 386 nm the new p λ spectrum only includes values for wavelengths between 290 and 320 nm given the finding that ms2 is not inactivated by photons with wavelengths greater than 320 nm love et al 2010 silverman et al 2013 kohn and nelson 2007 wavelengths shorter than 290 nm were not included in the new p λ spectrum because minimal sunlight photons with wavelengths shorter than 290 nm reach the earth s surface gueymard 1995 by excluding wavelengths shorter than 290 nm we also reduce the effect of noise in inrradiance measurements made by many spectroradiometer models at wavelengths at the far end of the uvb region which could result in false detection of irradiance in this region tüg and baumann 1994 viruses are very sensitive to these short wavelengths of light as reflected in greater values of p λ and false measurement of uvb light could therefore greatly over predict k endo we chose to determine p λ in 1 nm intervals i e δλ 1 nm given that irradiance and absorbance spectra are often reported in 1 nm increments 6 p λ e a 0 a 1 λ combining equations 1 and 6 the final model used to determine k endo was the following 7 k e n d o λ 290 320 e a 0 a 1 λ e 0 b λ δ λ the two constants a 0 and a 1 were determined using the nedler mead simplex algorithm a widely used multidimensional unconstrained optimization method without derivatives nedler and mead 1965 by minimizing the root mean square error rmse between ms2 inactivation rates k obs measured by fisher et al 2011 and the inactivation rates predicted using equation 7 k endo e 0 b λ input to equation 7 were those measured by fisher et al 2011 during the inactivation experiments when the corresponding k obs were observed fig s1 the rmse minimization function was implemented in both python and matlab and produced identical results python and matlab code are provided in the supplementary information the fisher et al 2011 experiments were conducted with ms2 inoculated into sensitizer free water i e phosphate buffered saline pbs therefore inactivation was assumed to be via the endogenous mechanism alone three replicate k obs values were available for each irradiance spectrum and the average value was used for model development this was the same exact dataset used by fisher et al 2011 to develop their ms2 p λ spectrum 2 3 experimental methods ms2 sunlight inactivation experiments were conducted in the laboratory to provide validation datasets that were used to evaluate the ability of each model to predict k endo one set of experiments was conducted in the nelson laboratory at the university of california berkeley using a 1000 w solar simulator newport 91194 with an ozone free xe bulb newport 6271 a 1 5 g a global airmass filter newport 81388 and an atmospheric attenuation filter newport 81017 irradiance was measured with a stellarnet epp2000c sr 100 spectroradiometer cr2 cosine receptor a second set of experiments was conducted in the silverman laboratory at new york university using a 1600 w solar simulator newport 94081a with an ozone free xe bulb newport 62726 an am0 airmass filter newport 81311 and an atmospheric attenuation filter newport 71si00091 irradiance during the experiments conducted in the silverman laboratory was measured using a stellarnet blk c spectroradiometer cr2 cosine receptor all experiments were conducted as described previously love et al 2010 silverman et al 2013 2015 briefly ms2 was propagated and purified in the laboratory see the supplemental information for details then inoculated in pbs 16 mm na2hpo4 4 mm nah2po4 and 10 mm nacl 62 mm ionic strength and exposed to simulated sunlight experimental reactors consisted of open top glass beakers painted black on the outside reactors were constantly mixed using sterilized magnetic stir bars and located in a water bath cooled by a recirculating chiller to maintain a temperature of 20 c during experiments 0 5 ml subsamples were removed from the reactors every 1 2 h placed on ice and analyzed for ms2 concentrations within 6 h of collection subsamples were enumerated for ms2 in accordance with previously published studies silverman et al 2013 2015 fisher et al 2011 love et al 2010 these methods are described in detail in the supplemental information first order observed inactivation rate constants k obs were calculated as the slope of the linear regression line between time t and ln c t c 0 where c 0 is the virus concentration before sunlight exposure and c t is the concentration at time t equation 8 ln c t c 0 values were calculated for each time point and replicate these values were pooled and used to calculate k obs the standard error of the slope by linear regression 8 ln c t c 0 k o b s t 3 results and discussion 3 1 new ms2 p λ ms2 inactivation data from fisher et al 2011 along with the framework proposed by rundel 1983 and cullen and neale 1996 was used to calibrate a new biological weighting function i e sensitivity coefficient spectrum p λ for ms2 the resulting equation determined using the nedler mead algorithm in matlab and python is presented below equation 9 rmse 0 0091 agreement between k endo and k obs is presented in fig s2 undertaking the analysis using solver ms excel led to results that were almost identical 9 p λ m s 2 e 44 79 0 1536 λ 3 2 comparison between ms2 k endo predicted by each model the three models evaluated in this study the fisher et al 2011 model mattle et al 2015 model and the model developed in the present paper are all composed of a spectrum of values that describe wavelength specific sensitivity of ms2 to sunlight for the fisher et al 2011 model and the model developed in the present study the wavelength specificity is described by the p λ spectra with units of m2 w 1 h 1 the mattle et al 2015 model differs in that the wavelength specific sensitivity to disinfection is described by the product of the quantum yield ϕ v i r u s and the extinction coefficient ε v i r u s λ which has units of ml virus 1 cm 1 to directly compare the three endogenous sunlight inactivation models the sensitivity coefficients in the mattle et al 2015 model were translated to p λ coefficients by converting the photon flux density to irradiance and integrating d c v i r u s d t to eliminate the term c v i r u s this conversion is possible given that the mattle et al 2015 sensitivity coefficients are provided in 1 nm increments see the supplemental information for the derivation of the mattle et al 2015 p λ using this relationship the term ε v i r u s λ ϕ v i r u s λ h c is equivalent to the mattle et al 2015 p λ values when compared to the p λ spectra from fisher et al 2011 and the present study the mattle et al 2015 p λ values were much greater in magnitude fig 1 the performance of the three k endo models in predicting k obs were compared using nine validation datasets these datasets include data collected during six previously published and two unpublished solar simulator experiments conducted in the nelson laboratory at the university of california berkeley between 2010 and 2015 love et al 2010 silverman et al 2013 2015 nguyen et al 2014 fisher et al 2011 and new experiments conducted specifically for this study in the silverman laboratory at new york university see table s4 for a summary of experiments these nine validation datasets are distinct from the datasets used to calibrate a 0 and a 1 all experiments were conducted in photosensitizer free water i e pbs with exposure to a solar simulator sunlight inactivation during these experiments was assumed to be via the endogenous mechanism alone due to the absence of photosensitizers for each dataset the measured irradiance spectrum e d 0 λ was input to each model equations 1 and 2 with each model having a different p λ fisher et al 2011 p λ provided in table s1 mattle et al 2015 p λ provided in table s2 and the new p λ described by equation 9 the resulting predicted k endo were compared to the experimentally measured k obs the fisher et al 2011 model and the model developed in the present study predicted k endo that were very similar to measured ms2 inactivation rates fig 2 the average percent difference between measured and modeled inactivation rates was 23 for the fisher et al 2011 model and 39 for the model developed in this study see table 1 for a summary of percent differences between measured k obs and estimated k endo however the mattle et al 2015 model over predicted inactivation rates by an average of 16 times standard deviation 5 6 fig 2a this over prediction of inactivation rates was attributed to the relatively large magnitude of the mattle et al 2015 p λ spectrum to further evaluate the ability of the mattle et al 2015 model to predict k endo the model was also used to predict k endo of ms2 in a shallow open water wetland in discovery bay california for each month of the year which were compared to previously measured bacteriophage inactivation rates silverman et al 2015 predicted k endo were used to calculate total sunlight inactivation rates k tot which are calculated as the sum of k endo and the exogenous inactivation rate k exo k exo were predicted using equations presented in silverman et al 2015 which account for ms2 inactivation by singlet oxygen 1o2 equation 10 where k ms2 1o2 is the second order reaction rate between 1o2 and ms2 and 1o2 ss is the steady state singlet oxygen concentration measured in bulk solution calculated k tot values were compared with data from silverman et al 2015 including 1 measured inactivation rates for f coliphage i e the family of coliphage of which ms2 is a member and 2 predicted ms2 inactivation rates estimated using the fisher et al 2011 model for k endo and equation 10 for k exo 10 k e x o k m s 2 1 o 2 o 2 1 s s the use of the mattle et al 2015 model over predicted f coliphage k obs in the discovery bay wetland during some months fig 3 but to a lesser extent than the model over predicted k endo for the laboratory based studies fig 2a we hypothesize that this finding stems from the relatively large contribution that the exogenous inactivation mechanism has on ms2 and f coliphage k tot in the wetland which damps the influence of k endo on the total inactivation rate for example silverman et al 2015 predicted that the exogenous inactivation mechanism dominated ms2 and f coliphage inactivation in the discovery bay wetland and was responsible for up to 95 of the total observed inactivation rate kohn et al 2016 also modeled k tot in the discovery bay wetland in the month of march these researchers used the mattle et al 2015 model to predict k endo and found k tot to be 1 95 0 46 d 1 the measured inactivation rate in the month of march was 2 5 0 5 d 1 the kohn et al 2016 finding is an under prediction of the measured k tot whereas as mentioned above our use of the mattle et al 2015 k endo model resulted in an over prediction of k tot this discrepancy can be explained by the use of different strategies for predicting k exo the k exo model used in this paper equation 10 accounts for ms2 inactivation by 1o2 alone alternatively the k exo model equation used by kohn et al 2016 was developed by mattle et al 2015 and also accounts for inactivation by hydroxyl radical carbonate radical and triplet state dissolved organic matter equation 11 where ppri represents each photochemically produced reactive intermediate although mattle et al 2015 found reaction with 1o2 to be most important for exogenous inactivation of ms2 contributing to 72 of ms2 k exo an additional difference is that silverman et al 2015 measured the value of k ms2 1o2 during experiments utilizing water collected from the discovery bay wetland whereas mattle et al 2015 and kohn et al 2016 used values for k ms2 1o2 measured during inactivation experiments conducted using the dye rose bengal to sensitize production of 1o2 in fact k ms2 1o2 measured in discovery bay water equal to 3 1 0 1 109 m 1 s 1 silverman et al 2015 was found to be an order of magnitude greater than k ms2 1o2 reported by mattle et al 2015 equal to 3 5 0 3 108 m 1 s 1 which likely resulted in the lower estimate of ms2 k tot by kohn et al 2016 11 k e x o p p r i k m s 2 p p r i p p r i s s one hypothesis as to why there was a large difference in magnitude between the mattle et al 2015 p λ spectrum and the other two p λ spectra is that the irradiance measurements used as inputs to develop the models were collected with different spectroradiometers fisher et al 2011 used a stellarnet spectroradiometer epp2000c sr 100 with a cr2 cosine receptor to measure downwelling irradiance e d which was subsequently used to calculate e 0 b λ and calibrate p λ for the fisher et al 2011 model and the model developed in the present paper mattle et al 2015 used an international light spectroradiometer ilt 900 r to measure p 0 0 λ which was used to calculate p α v i r u s i e the rate of photon absorption by the virus equations 3 5 p α v i r u s was subsequently used to calculate ϕ v i r u s using equation 12 where r v i r u s 0 is the initial virus inactivation rate measured during experiments to determine whether the two spectroradiometers operate similarly a side by side comparison of the spectroradiometers used by fisher et al 2011 and mattle et al 2015 was made by bringing both radiometers to lausanne switzerland on 24 july 2015 and measuring sunlight irradiance at 2 p m fig 4 the international light spectroradiometer used by mattle et al 2015 measured lower irradiance values than the stellarnet spectroradiometer used by fisher et al 2011 lower irradiance measurements would result in a lower estimation of p α v i r u s and therefore the calculation of a greater value of ϕ v i r u s and subsequently a greater magnitude p λ spectrum 12 ϕ v i r u s r v i r u s 0 p α v i r u s 3 3 updated quantum yield for the mattle et al 2015 model given that the mattle et al 2015 model over predicted inactivation rates for the validation data sets an attempt was made to improve the ability of the mattle et al 2015 model to predict k endo by calculating a new quantum yield of ms2 inactivation ϕ v i r u s this was carried out by using solver ms excel to find the value of ϕ v i r u s that produced the smallest rmse when comparing predicted k endo with measured k obs for the model calibration data from fisher et al 2011 due to noise in the fisher et al 2011 irradiance data at wavelengths less than 290 nm only irradiance data between 290 and 320 nm were included for this calculation the new ϕ v i r u s was found to be 2 56 10 4 viruses inactivated per photon absorbed rmse 0 015 compared with rmse 3 10 calculated with the original ϕ v i r u s proposed by mattle et al 2015 the new ϕ v i r u s was used to calculate a p λ spectrum fig 1 and table s3 and subsequently k endo for the validation datasets utilizing wavelengths greater than 290 nm only which resulted in improved agreement between predicted k endo and measured k obs as compared to the original ϕ v i r u s from mattle et al 2015 fig 2 and table 1 3 4 comparison of p λ spectral shapes the fisher et al 2011 p λ spectrum the new p λ spectrum calculated herein and the p λ spectrum from mattle et al 2015 differ in their spectral shapes fig 5 while the fisher et al 2011 p λ spectrum performed the best in predicting k endo from a mathematical standpoint the model is the least biologically relevant among the group given that the sensitivity coefficients differ dramatically from previously published photoaction spectra describing the sensitivity of viruses to light this finding can be seen in fig 5 which compares each p λ spectrum to a virus photoaction spectrum compiled by lytle and sagripanti 2005 data digitized using webplot digitizer all spectra normalized by p 290 nm the original and updated mattle et al 2015 p λ spectra have the same exact shape when normalized by p 290 nm the lytle and sagripanti 2005 photoaction spectrum is similar in shape to the nucleic acid light absorption spectrum setlow 1974 which reflects the biological mechanism of sunlight inactivation i e direct photon absorption by nucleic acids leading to inactivating damage compared to the lytle and sagripanti 2005 photoaction spectrum the fisher et al 2011 p λ spectrum depicts a large increase in light sensitivity for wavelengths between 280 and 287 nm and for wavelengths greater than 300 nm which places exaggerated influence on light of these wavelengths in estimating endogenous inactivation rates the fisher et al 2011 p λ spectrum also includes sensitivity coefficients at wavelengths between 371 and 386 nm which deviates from findings that wavelengths greater than 320 nm do not contribute to endogenous ms2 inactivation silverman et al 2013 love et al 2010 fisher et al 2011 kohn and nelson 2007 this discrepancy is best illustrated by photodamage spectra which are calculated as the product of the sensitivity coefficient and the irradiance at a chosen wavelength i e p λ e 0 b λ fig 6 analysis of ms2 photodamage spectra by nguyen et al 2014 found that the fisher et al 2011 model predicted sunlight in the range of 371 386 nm to account for between 11 and 30 of the total ms2 endogenous inactivation rate depending on the time of day which is not biologically plausible the shapes of the mattle et al 2015 p λ spectrum and the new p λ spectrum developed herein are closer in form to the lytle and sagripanti 2005 photoaction spectrum the relative magnitude of the mattle et al 2015 p λ spectrum decreases rapidly as λ increases although not as steeply as the lytle and sagripanti 2005 photoaction spectrum the new p λ spectrum does not decrease in magnitude as rapidly as the mattle et al 2015 p λ spectrum because of the decision to fit p λ to an exponential decay function which decreases log linearly with increasing λ this constraint to the form of p λ resulted in photodamage spectra that did not approach zero at 320 nm and may make the new p λ less representative of the biological mechanisms of endogenous sunlight inactivation 3 5 reducing the number of datasets required to calculate p λ the new p λ spectrum developed in this work was determined according to the methodology of rundel 1983 and cullen and neale 1996 where seven datasets consisting of a total of twenty ms2 inactivation time series each with seven data points were used to fit the constants a 0 and a 1 in an exponential decay curve equations 6 and 7 by minimizing the root mean square error rmse between measured k obs and estimated k endo laboratory based data collection requires significant time and effort therefore to assess the possibility of obtaining a p λ function with comparably small rmse using fewer datasets for calibration all possible combinations of the seven original datasets were used in rmse minimization to determine new values of a 0 and a 1 the python code used to carry out this analysis is provided in the supplemental information there were 21 combinations consisting of two data sets 35 combinations consisting of three data sets 35 combinations consisting of four data sets 21 combinations consisting of five data sets and seven combinations consisting of six data sets we chose to not include combinations of two datasets in the analysis given that fitting an exponential curve with only two points can introduce a large amount of error the lowest calculated rmse was found for the values of a 0 and a 1 that were fit using the combination of three calibration datasets that included the atmospheric filter dataset atm the 295 nm cutoff filter dataset wg295 and the 320 nm cutoff filter dataset wg320 fig s5 when using the p λ spectrum with the new values of a 0 and a 1 to predict k endo that correspond to k obs of all seven original calibration datasets the rmse was only 1 14 times greater than the rmse for the p λ spectrum given in equation 9 fig s6 these results illustrate that it may be possible to successfully optimize the p λ function using fewer than seven datasets for calibration 4 conclusions four biological weighting functions i e sensitivity coefficient spectra p λ were compared to determine their ability to predict ms2 endogenous inactivation rates k endo a p λ spectrum calculated as the product of the extinction coefficient spectrum ε v i r u s λ from mattle et al 2015 and a new quantum yield ϕ v i r u s calculated herein table s3 had two advantageous attributes as compared to the other models first the function was able to estimate k endo within an average of 33 standard deviation 31 of measured k obs for a series of nine datasets used for validation second the shape of the p λ function was most similar to a previously determined virus photoaction spectrum thereby reflecting the biological mechanism of endogenous virus inactivation i e photon absorption by nucleic acids and subsequent photodamage the original mattle et al 2015 model greatly over predicted k endo the fisher et al 2011 p λ and the new p λ

19084,sunlight inactivation is important for disinfection of viruses in sunlit waters as such attempts have been made to predict the endogenous photoinactivation rate of bacteriophage ms2 using biological weighting functions which describe microorganism sensitivity to sunlight inactivation as a function of wavelength in this study four biological weighting function models were compared to assess their ability to predict endogenous inactivation rates k endo of ms2 previously published and newly collected datasets consisting of an incident irradiance spectrum used as an input to the model and a measured inactivation rate k obs were used for model validation and comparison k endo values predicted by each model were compared with measured k obs to evaluate the ability of each biological weighting function to predict endogenous sunlight inactivation rates a model previously developed by mattle et al env sci technol 49 334 342 over predicted inactivation rates whereas the other three models a model from fisher et al env sci technol 45 9249 9255 a new model developed in this study and a modification of the model by mattle et al developed as part of this study were

disinfection there is interest in developing numerical models to estimate sunlight disinfection rates mattle et al 2015 kohn et al 2016 silverman et al 2015 nguyen et al 2014 fisher et al 2011 and subsequently predict virus fate in surface waters such models would allow for the prediction and mitigation of health risks in sewage influenced waters and the design of natural treatment systems to ensure they meet health related treatment targets bacteriophage ms2 is often used as a process indicator for virus and bacteriophage disinfection given its relatively slow rates of inactivation for example when exposed to full spectrum simulated sunlight ms2 was more resistant to disinfection than human poliovirus type 3 love et al 2010 silverman et al 2013 2015 human adenovirus type 2 love et

are achieved for ms2 sunlight inactivation occurs through three mechanisms davies colley et al 2000 nelson et al 2018 1 direct endogenous 2 indirect endogenous and 3 exogenous sunlight inactivation the direct and indirect endogenous inactivation mechanisms cannot be observed separately and are therefore considered jointly as endogenous inactivation endogenous inactivation is initiated by photon absorption by viral molecules and subsequent direct or indirect damage including formation of nucleic acid photoproducts e g pyrimidine dimers jagger 1985 the exogenous inactivation mechanism differs in that photons are absorbed by photosensitizer molecules in the water column which subsequently produce photochemically produced reactive intermediates ppri that can cause inactivating damage to the virus nelson et al 2018 the focus of the present work was to compare the performance of various numerical models developed to predict endogenous ms2 inactivation rates previous evaluations of ms2 exogenous inactivation rate models were conducted by mattle et al 2015 and silverman et al 2015 predicted inactivation rates can be used to estimate the reduction in the virus concentration over time the sunlight spectrum includes uvb λ 280 320 nm uva λ 320 400 nm and visible light λ 400 700 nm radiation endogenous inactivation rates of ms2 and other viruses are wavelength dependent within the sunlight spectrum viruses have the greatest sensitivity to short wavelength uvb light lytle and sagripanti 2005 beck et al 2016 and many waterborne viruses have no sensitivity to light with wavelengths greater than 320 nm fisher et al 2011 love et al 2010 silverman et al 2013 this behavior mirrors the absorption spectra of nucleic acids i e dna and rna which are important targets of direct sunlight damage setlow 1974 jagger 1985 lytle and sagripanti 2005 to account for this wavelength dependence efforts have been made to model endogenous sunlight inactivation rates k endo using biological weighting functions also referred to as photoaction spectra which describe the sensitivity to inactivation as a function of wavelength mattle et al 2015 fisher et al 2011 cullen and neale 1996 rundel 1983 previous research by fisher et al 2011 and mattle et al 2015 resulted in the development of biological weighting function based models to predict ms2 k endo these two groups took different approaches to model development fisher et al 2011 conducted ms2 inactivation experiments with a solar simulator and a series of optical filters to vary the incident irradiance spectrum which subsequently influenced inactivation rates seven cutoff filters were used resulting in seven distinct data sets consisting of the measured irradiance spectrum and the inactivation rate these data were input to a constrained nonlinear multivariable optimization function developed in matlab to produce a biological weighting function that described ms2 sensitivity to different wavelengths of light alternatively mattle et al 2015 developed a model framework that was based on direct chemical photolysis theory which takes into account the wavelength specific rate of photon absorption by the virus and the quantum yield of virus inactivation both models are described in detail below an additional model was developed by beck et al 2016 to predicted ms2 inactivation based on spectral irradiance however the focus of the study was on uvc light i e 200 280 nm with only one data point in the sunlight relevant region of the light spectrum in the present study we compared the estimates of ms2 k endo made by four numerical models the fisher et al 2011 model the mattle et al 2015 model a new inactivation rate model developed for this publication and a model derived from mattle et al 2015 but with a modified quantum yield predicted k endo were compared to measured inactivation rates from new and previously published ms2 inactivation experiments conducted with a solar simulator 2 methods 2 1 previously developed ms2 endogenous sunlight inactivation models as noted above two previous studies developed wavelength dependent functions to predict the endogenous sunlight inactivation rate of ms2 the model developed by fisher et al 2011 uses a framework for calculating k endo given by equation 1 where e 0 b λ w m 2 nm 1 is the average irradiance spectrum transmitted through the water column i e the irradiance incident on the water surface e d 0 λ corrected for light attenuation in the water column using the light absorption spectrum α λ and the optical path length b equation 2 which is derived in the supplemental information p λ m2 w 1 h 1 is the wavelength dependent sensitivity coefficient spectrum i e the biological weighting function and δλ is the wavelength interval between p λ values values of p λ are provided in table s1 and δλ for the fisher et al 2011 model is 3 nm 1 k e n d o λ p λ e 0 b λ δ λ 2 e 0 b λ e d 0 λ 1 10 α λ b 2 303 α λ b fisher et al 2011 determined p λ using a constrained nonlinear multivariable optimization function in matlab that did not restrict the shape of the resulting p λ function data input to matlab were measured during ms2 inactivation experiments that the authors conducted using simulated sunlight in combination with a series of long pass cutoff filters that changed the spectral distribution of the incident light seven cutoff filters were used to create seven distinct irradiance spectra i e e 0 b λ that resulted in seven different measured endogenous inactivation rates i e k endo this data is referred to as the calibration data mattle et al 2015 used a different framework for modeling sunlight inactivation of ms2 equations 3 5 which was developed based on direct chemical photolysis theory the change in the concentration of the virus over time d c v i r u s d t was calculated as a function of the rate of photon absorption by the virus p α v i r u s photons s 1 ml 1 and the quantum yield of virus inactivation ϕ v i r u s 3 d c v i r u s d t ϕ v i r u s p α v i r u s 4 p α v i r u s λ p 0 b λ ε v i r u s λ c v i r u s d λ 5 p 0 b λ p 0 0 λ 1 10 α λ b α λ b p α v i r u s was calculated using equation 4 where p 0 b λ photon s 1 cm 2 nm 1 is the average photon flux density transmitted through the water column i e the incident photon flux p 0 0 λ corrected for light attenuation in the water column taking into account α λ and b equation 5 ε v i r u s λ ml virus 1 cm 1 is the virus extinction coefficient and c v i r u s virus ml 1 is the virus concentration ε v i r u s λ for a single virus was determined by measuring the uv visible absorption spectrum of a known concentration of purified ms2 and then normalizing by that concentration mattle et al 2015 provided ε v i r u s λ values between 240 and 400 nm mattle et al 2015 subsequently determined an apparent ϕ v i r u s through controlled experiments using a solar simulator ϕ v i r u s was assumed to be the same across uv wavelengths and was calculated to be equal to 2 9 0 4 10 3 viruses inactivated per photon absorbed mattle et al 2015 kohn et al 2016 2 2 development of a new ms2 p λ spectrum the new k endo model developed and evaluated in this paper uses the same framework as the fisher et al 2011 model equation 1 but differs in its p λ spectrum the new p λ spectrum was determined using a method described by rundel 1983 and cullen and neale 1996 and was used by silverman and nelson 2016 to determine p λ for the escherichia coli and enterococci faecalis the rundel 1983 and cullen and neale 1996 method differs from the methodology used by fisher et al 2011 in that the spectral shape of the biological weighting function was assigned to be that of an exponential decay curve equation 6 where a 0 and a 1 are empiracle constants additionally while fisher et al 2011 provided p λ values between 280 and 386 nm the new p λ spectrum only includes values for wavelengths between 290 and 320 nm given the finding that ms2 is not inactivated by photons with wavelengths greater than 320 nm love et al 2010 silverman et al 2013 kohn and nelson 2007 wavelengths shorter than 290 nm were not included in the new p λ spectrum because minimal sunlight photons with wavelengths shorter than 290 nm reach the earth s surface gueymard 1995 by excluding wavelengths shorter than 290 nm we also reduce the effect of noise in inrradiance measurements made by many spectroradiometer models at wavelengths at the far end of the uvb region which could result in false detection of irradiance in this region tüg and baumann 1994 viruses are very sensitive to these short wavelengths of light as reflected in greater values of p λ and false measurement of uvb light could therefore greatly over predict k endo we chose to determine p λ in 1 nm intervals i e δλ 1 nm given that irradiance and absorbance spectra are often reported in 1 nm increments 6 p λ e a 0 a 1 λ combining equations 1 and 6 the final model used to determine k endo was the following 7 k e n d o λ 290 320 e a 0 a 1 λ e 0 b λ δ λ the two constants a 0 and a 1 were determined using the nedler mead simplex algorithm a widely used multidimensional unconstrained optimization method without derivatives nedler and mead 1965 by minimizing the root mean square error rmse between ms2 inactivation rates k obs measured by fisher et al 2011 and the inactivation rates predicted using equation 7 k endo e 0 b λ input to equation 7 were those measured by fisher et al 2011 during the inactivation experiments when the corresponding k obs were observed fig s1 the rmse minimization function was implemented in both python and matlab and produced identical results python and matlab code are provided in the supplementary information the fisher et al 2011 experiments were conducted with ms2 inoculated into sensitizer free water i e phosphate buffered saline pbs therefore inactivation was assumed to be via the endogenous mechanism alone three replicate k obs values were available for each irradiance spectrum and the average value was used for model development this was the same exact dataset used by fisher et al 2011 to develop their ms2 p λ spectrum 2 3 experimental methods ms2 sunlight inactivation experiments were conducted in the laboratory to provide validation datasets that were used to evaluate the ability of each model to predict k endo one set of experiments was conducted in the nelson laboratory at the university of california berkeley using a 1000 w solar simulator newport 91194 with an ozone free xe bulb newport 6271 a 1 5 g a global airmass filter newport 81388 and an atmospheric attenuation filter newport 81017 irradiance was measured with a stellarnet epp2000c sr 100 spectroradiometer cr2 cosine receptor a second set of experiments was conducted in the silverman laboratory at new york university using a 1600 w solar simulator newport 94081a with an ozone free xe bulb newport 62726 an am0 airmass filter newport 81311 and an atmospheric attenuation filter newport 71si00091 irradiance during the experiments conducted in the silverman laboratory was measured using a stellarnet blk c spectroradiometer cr2 cosine receptor all experiments were conducted as described previously love et al 2010 silverman et al 2013 2015 briefly ms2 was propagated and purified in the laboratory see the supplemental information for details then inoculated in pbs 16 mm na2hpo4 4 mm nah2po4 and 10 mm nacl 62 mm ionic strength and exposed to simulated sunlight experimental reactors consisted of open top glass beakers painted black on the outside reactors were constantly mixed using sterilized magnetic stir bars and located in a water bath cooled by a recirculating chiller to maintain a temperature of 20 c during experiments 0 5 ml subsamples were removed from the reactors every 1 2 h placed on ice and analyzed for ms2 concentrations within 6 h of collection subsamples were enumerated for ms2 in accordance with previously published studies silverman et al 2013 2015 fisher et al 2011 love et al 2010 these methods are described in detail in the supplemental information first order observed inactivation rate constants k obs were calculated as the slope of the linear regression line between time t and ln c t c 0 where c 0 is the virus concentration before sunlight exposure and c t is the concentration at time t equation 8 ln c t c 0 values were calculated for each time point and replicate these values were pooled and used to calculate k obs the standard error of the slope by linear regression 8 ln c t c 0 k o b s t 3 results and discussion 3 1 new ms2 p λ ms2 inactivation data from fisher et al 2011 along with the framework proposed by rundel 1983 and cullen and neale 1996 was used to calibrate a new biological weighting function i e sensitivity coefficient spectrum p λ for ms2 the resulting equation determined using the nedler mead algorithm in matlab and python is presented below equation 9 rmse 0 0091 agreement between k endo and k obs is presented in fig s2 undertaking the analysis using solver ms excel led to results that were almost identical 9 p λ m s 2 e 44 79 0 1536 λ 3 2 comparison between ms2 k endo predicted by each model the three models evaluated in this study the fisher et al 2011 model mattle et al 2015 model and the model developed in the present paper are all composed of a spectrum of values that describe wavelength specific sensitivity of ms2 to sunlight for the fisher et al 2011 model and the model developed in the present study the wavelength specificity is described by the p λ spectra with units of m2 w 1 h 1 the mattle et al 2015 model differs in that the wavelength specific sensitivity to disinfection is described by the product of the quantum yield ϕ v i r u s and the extinction coefficient ε v i r u s λ which has units of ml virus 1 cm 1 to directly compare the three endogenous sunlight inactivation models the sensitivity coefficients in the mattle et al 2015 model were translated to p λ coefficients by converting the photon flux density to irradiance and integrating d c v i r u s d t to eliminate the term c v i r u s this conversion is possible given that the mattle et al 2015 sensitivity coefficients are provided in 1 nm increments see the supplemental information for the derivation of the mattle et al 2015 p λ using this relationship the term ε v i r u s λ ϕ v i r u s λ h c is equivalent to the mattle et al 2015 p λ values when compared to the p λ spectra from fisher et al 2011 and the present study the mattle et al 2015 p λ values were much greater in magnitude fig 1 the performance of the three k endo models in predicting k obs were compared using nine validation datasets these datasets include data collected during six previously published and two unpublished solar simulator experiments conducted in the nelson laboratory at the university of california berkeley between 2010 and 2015 love et al 2010 silverman et al 2013 2015 nguyen et al 2014 fisher et al 2011 and new experiments conducted specifically for this study in the silverman laboratory at new york university see table s4 for a summary of experiments these nine validation datasets are distinct from the datasets used to calibrate a 0 and a 1 all experiments were conducted in photosensitizer free water i e pbs with exposure to a solar simulator sunlight inactivation during these experiments was assumed to be via the endogenous mechanism alone due to the absence of photosensitizers for each dataset the measured irradiance spectrum e d 0 λ was input to each model equations 1 and 2 with each model having a different p λ fisher et al 2011 p λ provided in table s1 mattle et al 2015 p λ provided in table s2 and the new p λ described by equation 9 the resulting predicted k endo were compared to the experimentally measured k obs the fisher et al 2011 model and the model developed in the present study predicted k endo that were very similar to measured ms2 inactivation rates fig 2 the average percent difference between measured and modeled inactivation rates was 23 for the fisher et al 2011 model and 39 for the model developed in this study see table 1 for a summary of percent differences between measured k obs and estimated k endo however the mattle et al 2015 model over predicted inactivation rates by an average of 16 times standard deviation 5 6 fig 2a this over prediction of inactivation rates was attributed to the relatively large magnitude of the mattle et al 2015 p λ spectrum to further evaluate the ability of the mattle et al 2015 model to predict k endo the model was also used to predict k endo of ms2 in a shallow open water wetland in discovery bay california for each month of the year which were compared to previously measured bacteriophage inactivation rates silverman et al 2015 predicted k endo were used to calculate total sunlight inactivation rates k tot which are calculated as the sum of k endo and the exogenous inactivation rate k exo k exo were predicted using equations presented in silverman et al 2015 which account for ms2 inactivation by singlet oxygen 1o2 equation 10 where k ms2 1o2 is the second order reaction rate between 1o2 and ms2 and 1o2 ss is the steady state singlet oxygen concentration measured in bulk solution calculated k tot values were compared with data from silverman et al 2015 including 1 measured inactivation rates for f coliphage i e the family of coliphage of which ms2 is a member and 2 predicted ms2 inactivation rates estimated using the fisher et al 2011 model for k endo and equation 10 for k exo 10 k e x o k m s 2 1 o 2 o 2 1 s s the use of the mattle et al 2015 model over predicted f coliphage k obs in the discovery bay wetland during some months fig 3 but to a lesser extent than the model over predicted k endo for the laboratory based studies fig 2a we hypothesize that this finding stems from the relatively large contribution that the exogenous inactivation mechanism has on ms2 and f coliphage k tot in the wetland which damps the influence of k endo on the total inactivation rate for example silverman et al 2015 predicted that the exogenous inactivation mechanism dominated ms2 and f coliphage inactivation in the discovery bay wetland and was responsible for up to 95 of the total observed inactivation rate kohn et al 2016 also modeled k tot in the discovery bay wetland in the month of march these researchers used the mattle et al 2015 model to predict k endo and found k tot to be 1 95 0 46 d 1 the measured inactivation rate in the month of march was 2 5 0 5 d 1 the kohn et al 2016 finding is an under prediction of the measured k tot whereas as mentioned above our use of the mattle et al 2015 k endo model resulted in an over prediction of k tot this discrepancy can be explained by the use of different strategies for predicting k exo the k exo model used in this paper equation 10 accounts for ms2 inactivation by 1o2 alone alternatively the k exo model equation used by kohn et al 2016 was developed by mattle et al 2015 and also accounts for inactivation by hydroxyl radical carbonate radical and triplet state dissolved organic matter equation 11 where ppri represents each photochemically produced reactive intermediate although mattle et al 2015 found reaction with 1o2 to be most important for exogenous inactivation of ms2 contributing to 72 of ms2 k exo an additional difference is that silverman et al 2015 measured the value of k ms2 1o2 during experiments utilizing water collected from the discovery bay wetland whereas mattle et al 2015 and kohn et al 2016 used values for k ms2 1o2 measured during inactivation experiments conducted using the dye rose bengal to sensitize production of 1o2 in fact k ms2 1o2 measured in discovery bay water equal to 3 1 0 1 109 m 1 s 1 silverman et al 2015 was found to be an order of magnitude greater than k ms2 1o2 reported by mattle et al 2015 equal to 3 5 0 3 108 m 1 s 1 which likely resulted in the lower estimate of ms2 k tot by kohn et al 2016 11 k e x o p p r i k m s 2 p p r i p p r i s s one hypothesis as to why there was a large difference in magnitude between the mattle et al 2015 p λ spectrum and the other two p λ spectra is that the irradiance measurements used as inputs to develop the models were collected with different spectroradiometers fisher et al 2011 used a stellarnet spectroradiometer epp2000c sr 100 with a cr2 cosine receptor to measure downwelling irradiance e d which was subsequently used to calculate e 0 b λ and calibrate p λ for the fisher et al 2011 model and the model developed in the present paper mattle et al 2015 used an international light spectroradiometer ilt 900 r to measure p 0 0 λ which was used to calculate p α v i r u s i e the rate of photon absorption by the virus equations 3 5 p α v i r u s was subsequently used to calculate ϕ v i r u s using equation 12 where r v i r u s 0 is the initial virus inactivation rate measured during experiments to determine whether the two spectroradiometers operate similarly a side by side comparison of the spectroradiometers used by fisher et al 2011 and mattle et al 2015 was made by bringing both radiometers to lausanne switzerland on 24 july 2015 and measuring sunlight irradiance at 2 p m fig 4 the international light spectroradiometer used by mattle et al 2015 measured lower irradiance values than the stellarnet spectroradiometer used by fisher et al 2011 lower irradiance measurements would result in a lower estimation of p α v i r u s and therefore the calculation of a greater value of ϕ v i r u s and subsequently a greater magnitude p λ spectrum 12 ϕ v i r u s r v i r u s 0 p α v i r u s 3 3 updated quantum yield for the mattle et al 2015 model given that the mattle et al 2015 model over predicted inactivation rates for the validation data sets an attempt was made to improve the ability of the mattle et al 2015 model to predict k endo by calculating a new quantum yield of ms2 inactivation ϕ v i r u s this was carried out by using solver ms excel to find the value of ϕ v i r u s that produced the smallest rmse when comparing predicted k endo with measured k obs for the model calibration data from fisher et al 2011 due to noise in the fisher et al 2011 irradiance data at wavelengths less than 290 nm only irradiance data between 290 and 320 nm were included for this calculation the new ϕ v i r u s was found to be 2 56 10 4 viruses inactivated per photon absorbed rmse 0 015 compared with rmse 3 10 calculated with the original ϕ v i r u s proposed by mattle et al 2015 the new ϕ v i r u s was used to calculate a p λ spectrum fig 1 and table s3 and subsequently k endo for the validation datasets utilizing wavelengths greater than 290 nm only which resulted in improved agreement between predicted k endo and measured k obs as compared to the original ϕ v i r u s from mattle et al 2015 fig 2 and table 1 3 4 comparison of p λ spectral shapes the fisher et al 2011 p λ spectrum the new p λ spectrum calculated herein and the p λ spectrum from mattle et al 2015 differ in their spectral shapes fig 5 while the fisher et al 2011 p λ spectrum performed the best in predicting k endo from a mathematical standpoint the model is the least biologically relevant among the group given that the sensitivity coefficients differ dramatically from previously published photoaction spectra describing the sensitivity of viruses to light this finding can be seen in fig 5 which compares each p λ spectrum to a virus photoaction spectrum compiled by lytle and sagripanti 2005 data digitized using webplot digitizer all spectra normalized by p 290 nm the original and updated mattle et al 2015 p λ spectra have the same exact shape when normalized by p 290 nm the lytle and sagripanti 2005 photoaction spectrum is similar in shape to the nucleic acid light absorption spectrum setlow 1974 which reflects the biological mechanism of sunlight inactivation i e direct photon absorption by nucleic acids leading to inactivating damage compared to the lytle and sagripanti 2005 photoaction spectrum the fisher et al 2011 p λ spectrum depicts a large increase in light sensitivity for wavelengths between 280 and 287 nm and for wavelengths greater than 300 nm which places exaggerated influence on light of these wavelengths in estimating endogenous inactivation rates the fisher et al 2011 p λ spectrum also includes sensitivity coefficients at wavelengths between 371 and 386 nm which deviates from findings that wavelengths greater than 320 nm do not contribute to endogenous ms2 inactivation silverman et al 2013 love et al 2010 fisher et al 2011 kohn and nelson 2007 this discrepancy is best illustrated by photodamage spectra which are calculated as the product of the sensitivity coefficient and the irradiance at a chosen wavelength i e p λ e 0 b λ fig 6 analysis of ms2 photodamage spectra by nguyen et al 2014 found that the fisher et al 2011 model predicted sunlight in the range of 371 386 nm to account for between 11 and 30 of the total ms2 endogenous inactivation rate depending on the time of day which is not biologically plausible the shapes of the mattle et al 2015 p λ spectrum and the new p λ spectrum developed herein are closer in form to the lytle and sagripanti 2005 photoaction spectrum the relative magnitude of the mattle et al 2015 p λ spectrum decreases rapidly as λ increases although not as steeply as the lytle and sagripanti 2005 photoaction spectrum the new p λ spectrum does not decrease in magnitude as rapidly as the mattle et al 2015 p λ spectrum because of the decision to fit p λ to an exponential decay function which decreases log linearly with increasing λ this constraint to the form of p λ resulted in photodamage spectra that did not approach zero at 320 nm and may make the new p λ less representative of the biological mechanisms of endogenous sunlight inactivation 3 5 reducing the number of datasets required to calculate p λ the new p λ spectrum developed in this work was determined according to the methodology of rundel 1983 and cullen and neale 1996 where seven datasets consisting of a total of twenty ms2 inactivation time series each with seven data points were used to fit the constants a 0 and a 1 in an exponential decay curve equations 6 and 7 by minimizing the root mean square error rmse between measured k obs and estimated k endo laboratory based data collection requires significant time and effort therefore to assess the possibility of obtaining a p λ function with comparably small rmse using fewer datasets for calibration all possible combinations of the seven original datasets were used in rmse minimization to determine new values of a 0 and a 1 the python code used to carry out this analysis is provided in the supplemental information there were 21 combinations consisting of two data sets 35 combinations consisting of three data sets 35 combinations consisting of four data sets 21 combinations consisting of five data sets and seven combinations consisting of six data sets we chose to not include combinations of two datasets in the analysis given that fitting an exponential curve with only two points can introduce a large amount of error the lowest calculated rmse was found for the values of a 0 and a 1 that were fit using the combination of three calibration datasets that included the atmospheric filter dataset atm the 295 nm cutoff filter dataset wg295 and the 320 nm cutoff filter dataset wg320 fig s5 when using the p λ spectrum with the new values of a 0 and a 1 to predict k endo that correspond to k obs of all seven original calibration datasets the rmse was only 1 14 times greater than the rmse for the p λ spectrum given in equation 9 fig s6 these results illustrate that it may be possible to successfully optimize the p λ function using fewer than seven datasets for calibration 4 conclusions four biological weighting functions i e sensitivity coefficient spectra p λ were compared to determine their ability to predict ms2 endogenous inactivation rates k endo a p λ spectrum calculated as the product of the extinction coefficient spectrum ε v i r u s λ from mattle et al 2015 and a new quantum yield ϕ v i r u s calculated herein table s3 had two advantageous attributes as compared to the other models first the function was able to estimate k endo within an average of 33 standard deviation 31 of measured k obs for a series of nine datasets used for validation second the shape of the p λ function was most similar to a previously determined virus photoaction spectrum thereby reflecting the biological mechanism of endogenous virus inactivation i e photon absorption by nucleic acids and subsequent photodamage the original mattle et al 2015 model greatly over predicted k endo the fisher et al 2011 p λ and the new p λ
