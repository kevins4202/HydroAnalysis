20025,progress towards a more circular phosphorus economy necessitates development of innovative water treatment systems which can reversibly remove inorganic phosphate pi to ultra low levels 100 μg l 1 and subsequently recover the pi for reuse in this study a novel approach using the high affinity e coli phosphate binding protein pbp as a reusable pi bio adsorbent was investigated pbp was expressed extracted purified and immobilized on nhs activated sepharose beads the resultant pbp beads were saturated with pi and exposed to varying ph ph 4 7 to 12 5 and temperatures 25 45 c to induce pi release increase in temperature from 25 to 45 c and ph conditions between 4 7 and 8 5 released less than 20 of adsorbed pi however 62 and 86 of the adsorbed pi was released at ph 11 4 and 12 5 respectively kinetic experiments showed that pi desorption occurred nearly instantaneously 5 min regardless of ph conditions which is advantageous for pi recovery additionally no loss in pi adsorption or desorption capacity was observed when the pbp beads were exposed to 10 repeated cycles of adsorption desorption using neutral and high ph 12 5 washes respectively the highest average pi adsorption using the pbp beads was 83 5 with 89 4 1 average desorption using ph 12 5 washes over 10 wash cycles at room temperature thermal shift assay of the pbp showed that the protein was structurally stable after 10 cycles with statistically similar melting temperatures between ph 4 and 12 5 these results indicate that immobilized high affinity pbp has the potential to be an effective and reversible bio adsorbent suitable for pi recovery from water wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords adsorbent phosphorus nutrient reuse psts water wastewater 1 introduction the economic and ecological losses associated with eutrophication caused by excess inorganic phosphate pi have inspired increasingly lower effluent phosphorus water quality guidelines for many municipal and industrial wastewater treatment facilities around the world amery and schoumans 2014 usepa 1995 1986 apart from limiting pi loadings in wastewater effluents there is also strong impetus to secure renewable pi resources for use as agricultural fertilizer i e via pi recovery from wastewater this approach stimulates the circular phosphorus economy which is vital since in addition to being a pollutant pi is a geographically limited nonrenewable resource that is essential to sustain global food production cordell et al 2009 cordell and white 2014 mayer et al 2016 rittmann et al 2011 this removal recovery paradigm drives development of innovative water treatment systems which can effectively remove pi to ultra low levels 100 μg l and release pi under controlled conditions suitable for subsequent pi reuse mayer et al 2013 rittmann et al 2011 a novel strategy utilizing high affinity phosphate binding proteins pbp as a reusable bio adsorbent to reversibly capture pi was investigated in this study the phosphate specific transporter pst system in bacteria is specifically evolved to import pi when pi is present at low levels which demands efficient selective and high affinity binding and transport of pi to meet the cell s metabolic demands blank 2012 luecke and quiocho 1990 santos beneit et al 2008 the pst protein complex comprises four subunits an atp binding protein pstb two transmembrane proteins psta and pstc and a periplasmic pbp psts luecke and quiocho 1990 santos beneit et al 2008 the periplasmic psts pbp has recently attracted interest as a potential high affinity phosphate specific pi adsorbent kuroda et al 2000 li et al 2009 yang et al 2016 2017 removal of pi to ultra low concentrations has been demonstrated using pbp expressed in bacterial cells periplasmic space expressed on the cells surface or immobilized on sepharose beads choi et al 2013 kuroda et al 2000 li et al 2009 yang et al 2016 for example choi et al 2013 showed that recombinant e coli expressing pbp in the periplasmic space can remove 97 pi from water within 6 h initial concentration of 0 2 0 5 mg pi l kuroda et al 2000 demonstrated pi removal to below the detection limit 9 5 ng pi l using pbp immobilized on sepharose beads to treat an influent concentration of 15 μg pi l to better support the circular phosphorus economy via the waste to resource paradigm recovery of the captured pi is essential to assess pi recovery yang et al 2016 investigated the effect of varying temperature ph and ionic strength on pi release from pbp over expressed in the periplasmic space of e coli cells however a maximum of only 1 4 2 of the adsorbed pi was recovered after exposing the recombinant e coli cells to low ph ph 3 8 high temperature 35 c or high ionic strength 100 mm kcl for 3 h yang et al 2016 on the other hand kuroda et al 2000 reported 90 recovery of the adsorbed pi from pbp immobilized on sepharose beads at ph 3 although the data was not shown kuroda et al 2000 stated that the immobilized pbp could be reused after neutralizing the ph thus additional investigation of the removal and controlled release of pi from immobilized pbp at varying ph and temperature and the performance of pbp over multiple cycles of pi removal and recovery is needed effective reusability of the pbp is a crucial aspect of the viability of this bio adsorbent for pi removal and recovery from water the objective of this study was to investigate the adsorption and desorption of pi using pbp immobilized on an inert surface as a function of ph and temperature in comparison to periplasmic pbp extracellular immobilized pbp may be more effective as a reversible bio adsorbent as it may be more conducive to both removal and controlled recovery through regulation of environmental parameters such ph and temperature reusability of the pbp was also investigated to assess the impact of the recovery conditions on pbp structure and pi recovery potential over multiple cycles of pi adsorption desorption 2 materials and methods 2 1 expression and purification of pbp the psts pbp used in this study was a single cysteine mutant variant a197c of the mature e coli pbp developed by solscheid et al 2015 for use as a phosphate biosensor the psts gene a197c overexpression plasmid plasmid 78198 addgene cambridge ma usa was transformed into bl21 de3 e coli competent cells and cultured for protein expression and purification as previously described solscheid et al 2015 briefly a 5 ml overnight culture of the transformed bl21 de3 cells was grown in lb media supplemented with 100 μg ml ampicillin at 37 c this culture was diluted by transferring 2 ml of the overnight culture into 1 l fresh lb growth media in baffled glass flasks the flasks were incubated at 37 c with vigorous shaking and the culture was allowed to grow to an od 600 of approximately 0 8 before inducing protein expression using 500 μm isopropyl β d thiogalactopytanoside iptg after 4 h induction at 37 c cells were centrifuged for 15 min at 4000 g and 4 c all further protein purification steps were carried out at 4 c to purify the proteins the pellets were re suspended in 100 ml of resuspension buffer 10 mm tris hcl 1 mm mgcl2 ph 8 0 and sonicated 4 times for 30 s at 200 w with a 5 s on off pulse cycle the lysate supernatant was collected following centrifugation at 6000 g for 45 min the lysate was passed through a 100 mlbv settled and drained bead volume where bv bed volume q sepharose column ge healthcare bio sciences pittsburg pa usa equilibrated with resuspension buffer the protein was eluted in a 100 ml gradient of 0 200 mm nacl in the resuspension buffer the presence of the protein was verified in the eluted fractions using sds page fractions containing psts were pooled and concentrated using a 10 kda cutoff spin concentrator vivaspin 20 ge healthcare bio sciences in cases when higher protein concentrations were required the concentration of the purified pbp was 221 0 6 μm average standard deviation as quantified at 280 nm using a spectrophotometer agilent technologies santa clara ca usa assuming an extinction coefficient of 17 8 cm 1 brune et al 1994 2 2 immobilization of pbp the purified psts pbp was dialyzed using a spectra por 2 dialysis membrane mwco 12 14 kda spectrum laboratories inc rancho dominguez ca usa dialysis was conducted for 16 h at 4 c and included 6 exchanges of 0 2 m nahco3 0 5 m nacl ph 8 3 buffer the dialyzed pbp was immobilized on nhs activated sepharose 4 fast flow beads in accordance with the manufacturer s instructions ge healthcare bio sciences since nhs activated sepharose interferes with the signal from the spectrophotometer at 280 nm we used the quick start bradford protein assay bio rad laboratories inc hercules ca usa to determine the concentration of pbp for further experiments the concentration of the dialyzed pbp was measured as 202 2 μm using the bradford assay fresh nhs beads stored in 100 isopropanol were transferred into a 100 ml econo column bio rad laboratories inc and washed with 10 bed volumes of 1 mm hcl solution at 4 c for the coupling reaction 20 ml of dialyzed pbp 202 μm was added to 20 ml of washed nhs beads drained volume and mixed at 30 rpm on a roto torque variable speed end over end rotator cole parmer il usa for 16 h at 4 c the supernatant was collected and the concentration of the unbound pbp was quantified using the bradford assay of the initial pbp loaded onto the column 20 ml of 202 2 μm 98 0 6 was immobilized onto the nhs beads providing a coupling density of 197 0 2 nmol pbp mlbv nhs beads mlbv drained nhs bead volume this non optimized coupling density was much lower than the theoretical maximum of 16 23 μmol mlbv for nhs beads reported by ge healthcare bio sciences however 197 0 2 nmol pbp mlbv was sufficient for the adsorption desorption assessments in this study based on 1 mol of pbp adsorbing 1 mol of pi brune et al 1998 1994 solscheid et al 2015 the theoretical pi adsorption capacity of the nhs beads was 197 0 2 nmol mlbv the nhs beads conjugated with pbp hereon referred to as pbp beads were sequentially washed with 1bv of 0 1 m tris hcl ph 8 5 followed by washing with 1bv of buffer containing 0 1 m sodium acetate 0 5 m nacl ph 4 5 this cycle was repeated three times followed by five washes with 1bv of buffer containing 10 mm tris hcl 1 mm mgcl2 ph 7 1 to remove the legacy pi already adsorbed on the pbp during the expression purification and immobilization process the pbp beads were mopped using 0 1 unit ml purine nucleoside phosphorylase pnpase and 300 μm 7 methylguanosine 7 meg brune et al 1998 1994 to facilitate mixing 20 ml of 10 mm tris hcl 1 mm mgcl2 ph 7 1 buffer was added to 20 mlbv pbp beads next 0 1 unit ml pnpase enzyme and 300 μm 7 meg was added to the 40 ml pbp bead solution 50 suspension the mopping reaction was performed overnight at 4 c at 30 rpm using a rotary shaker after 16 h the pbp beads were washed with 5 x 1bv 10 mm tris hcl 1 mm mgcl2 ph 7 1 buffer to remove the pi mop upon completion of this pbp immobilization procedure the beads were either used immediately or stored at 4 c for up to 48 h prior to use a control set of beads was prepared using 20 mlbv of fresh nhs beads following the same procedure used for the pbp beads except without pbp addition 2 3 adsorption of pi by immobilized pbp triplicate pi adsorption experiments were conducted in batch tests in 2 ml centrifuge tubes containing 0 25 mlbv pbp beads in all tests 1 ml reaction buffer 10 mm tris hcl 1 mm mgcl2 ph 7 1 25 c containing excess pi 60 μm was initially added 60 nmol pi versus the theoretical capacity of the pbp beads 49 nmol 0 25 mlbv to ensure pi saturation of the pbp beads after gentle mixing by hand and 10 min for bead settling the supernatant was collected and analyzed for pi previous studies showed that pi binding is nearly instantaneous brune et al 1998 1994 solscheid et al 2015 such that 10 min was sufficient to achieve equilibrium the ph in the centrifuge tubes was measured using a micro ph probe orion 9810bn thermo scientific waltham ma usa no change in ph was observed over the course of the 10 min adsorption period 2 4 recovery of pi from immobilized pbp as a function of temperature and ph following adsorption desorption experiments were initiated by washing the beads 3 times using 1 ml reaction buffer ph 7 1 to remove unbound pi each tube was then loaded with 1 ml of reaction buffer solution in separate experiments the influence of temperature was evaluated by adjusting the reaction buffer temperature to 25 c 35 c or 45 c before addition to the tubes ph 7 1 the tubes were maintained at the target temperature for the duration of the desorption experiment using an incubator vwr 1524 digital incubator additional tests were performed to evaluate the influence of ph by adjusting the ph of reaction buffer to final values of 4 7 6 5 7 1 8 5 9 2 11 4 and 12 5 using 1 m hcl or naoh while maintaining a constant temperature of 25 c the ph in the microfuge tubes was measured using a micro ph probe orion 9810bn thermo scientific waltham ma usa and did not change over the duration of the experiment in both temperature and ph tests gentle mixing was applied initially by inverting the microfuge tubes three times by hand the beads were then allowed to settle for 10 min and a 1 ml aliquot of the settled supernatant was analyzed for pi using the ascorbic acid method apha 2012 for each condition tested nhs beads with no pbp control beads were tested in parallel to isolate the impact of the nhs beads on pi adsorption desorption 2 5 kinetics of pi recovery from immobilized pbp the extent of pi release from pbp beads was assessed as a function of time for four different ph conditions following previous experiments showing efficient release using elevated ph triplicate experiments were conducted for both pbp beads and control beads as described in sections 2 3 and 2 4 an initial pi adsorption cycle was performed by adding 1 ml of 60 μm pi solution in 25 c reaction buffer at ph 7 1 to 0 25 mlbv pbp beads after gentle mixing by hand and 10 min bead settling the supernatant was collected and analyzed for pi for subsequent desorption the pbp beads were washed 3 times with 1 ml reaction buffer at ph 7 1 to remove unattached pi from solution next the pbp beads were washed with 1 5 ml of reaction buffer yielding final ph values in the tubes of 7 1 10 8 11 9 and 12 5 aliquots of 0 1 ml were collected for pi analysis after 5 10 20 30 40 and 50 min of reaction 2 6 reusability of immobilized pbp the ability of the pbp beads to adsorb and desorb pi over 10 cycles of sequential high and neutral ph conditions promoting desorption and adsorption respectively was investigated tests were conducted in batch mode using 10 ml disposable poly prep reactors bio rad laboratories inc hercules ca usa with 0 25 mlbv beads based on results of previous ph tests 3 different high ph conditions 11 5 12 and 12 5 were tested in independent triplicate experiments using pbp beads or control beads fig 1 illustrates the experimental approach the first step in these experiments was to release pi adsorbed on pi saturated pbp beads by washing them with 1 75 ml of reaction buffer at ph 11 5 12 or 12 5 25 c for 10 min before decanting the supernatant immediately following 1 75 ml reaction buffer at ph 7 1 25 c was added to adjust the beads to near neutral ph for 10 min before decanting the supernatant in preparation for the subsequent pi adsorption cycle the ph in the tubes was verified using a micro ph probe orion 9810bn thermo scientific waltham ma usa the buffer solution decanted after each step was analyzed for pi desorbed during the initial cycle 0 following the initial pi release cycle 10 sequential cycles of pi adsorption desorption were performed the first pi adsorption step in each cycle consisted of adding 1 ml reaction buffer at ph 7 1 25 c containing 60 μm pi after gentle mixing and 10 min bead settling the supernatant was decanted and analyzed for pi in the second pi desorption step pi was desorbed using 1 75 ml of reaction buffer at 25 c and ph 11 5 12 or 12 5 for 10 min followed by decanting the supernatant in the third rinse step 1 75 ml reaction buffer at ph 7 1 and 25 c was added for 10 min to wash away any remaining high ph buffer the buffer solutions decanted after the second and third steps were analyzed for pi desorbed in each cycle 2 7 thermal shift assay stability of the pbp structure was analyzed in triplicate at varying ph and temperature using the thermal shift assay as described previously huynh and partch 2015 purified suspended pbp non immobilized was diluted to 7 5 μm in 10 mm tris 1 mm mgcl2 buffer with a final ph of 4 0 6 6 7 5 9 2 10 9 11 9 or 12 3 similar to the ph range investigated in the pi recovery experiment a 20 μl aliquot of each pbp solution 7 5 μm was mixed with 10 μl of 15x sypro orange invitrogen for the analysis with a resultant protein concentration of 5 μm the mixture was dispensed into a 96 well pcr plate sealed with an optical seal and gently shaken to remove air bubbles a thermal scan from 25 c to 95 c at an incremental rate of 1 c min was performed on the plate using a real time pcr instrument stratagene mx3005p the protein denaturation curve fluorescence vs temperature was truncated to 2 c past the maximum fluorescence and then fitted to a non linear boltzmann sigmoidal curve r statistical package minpack lm nlslm all raw data analysis data truncation non linear curve fitting and melting temperature calculation was conducted in rstudio version 0 98 1091 using custom scripts 2 8 data analysis all pbp bead pi concentration data was normalized to the corresponding control bead test the normalized data was also compared to the theoretical pi adsorption capacity 49 nmol 0 25 mlbv of the pbp beads to obtain percent pi adsorbed and desorbed data normal data distribution was assessed using the shapiro wilk test α 0 05 the statistical differences in pi concentrations between different conditions were performed using one way anova α 0 05 with tukey post hoc analysis α 0 05 they were conducted using excel 2010 version 14 3 2 microsoft usa with an added statistical software package xlstat pro 2014 addinsoft usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 pi removal from immobilized pbp an initial adsorption test was performed to assess pi removal by exposing the pbp beads to excess pi higher levels of pi than the theoretical capacity of the pbp beads 49 nmoles of pi for 0 25 ml of pbp beads were mixed with the beads for 10 min however the pbp beads only adsorbed 11 8 4 nmoles pi n 39 or 24 8 of the theoretical capacity the low degree of initial pi adsorption suggested that not all of the pbp was available for pi removal possibly due to the presence of legacy pi that bound to the pbps active sites during protein preparation to address the pre adsorption presence of pi in the system an initial pi desorption wash step with a reaction buffer ph 12 5 was adopted in this study to remove legacy pi bound to the pbp the initial high ph wash step substantially increased the pi adsorption capacity of the pbp beads to 41 2 nmoles mlbv or 83 2 1 of the theoretical capacity 3 2 recovery of pi as a function of temperature and ph the results from the pi recovery experiments using varying buffer ph and temperature conditions are summarized in fig 2 increases in temperature from 25 to 45 c and ph conditions between 4 7 and 8 5 released less than 20 of adsorbed pi all pi desorbed calculations were performed using data normalized to the theoretical pi capacity 49 nmoles 0 25 mlbv only at higher buffer ph conditions was a substantial proportion of the bound pi released from the pbp beads at ph 11 4 and 12 5 the total pi recovered from the pbp beads was 30 2 3 9 nmoles pi 62 and 42 2 5 5 nmoles pi 86 respectively these results demonstrated that ph 11 4 25 c 10 min reaction time provided the best conditions for recovery higher pi recovery was achieved using the immobilized pbp in this study 86 pi recovery at ph 12 5 in comparison to that observed using pbp over expressed in the periplasmic space of recombinant e coli 2 1 pi recovery at ph 3 8 yang et al 2016 alternately the recovery achieved in this study was similar to kuroda et al s 2000 report using immobilized pbp from p aeruginosa 90 pi recovery at ph 3 accordingly the immobilized pbp with direct exposure to the water matrix demonstrated greater ph dependency compared to intracellular proteins of note however kuroda et al 2000 observed no pi desorption above ph 5 but did not investigate ph 10 whereas the lowest ph investigated in this study was ph 4 7 which provided the lowest extent of pi desorption thus greater understanding of the response to a wide range of ph conditions is needed in future studies of immobilized pbp 3 3 kinetics of pi recovery from immobilized pbp desorption of pi occurred nearly instantaneously 5 min regardless of ph conditions which is advantageous for operation of a phosphorus recovery process this is illustrated in fig 3 which shows that the amount of pi released did not change between 5 and 50 min p value 0 05 n 6 however as described in section 3 1 ph significantly influenced pi desorption average pi desorption within 5 min of reaction time was 2 9 6 ph 7 1 35 4 4 ph 10 8 79 13 ph 11 9 and 97 9 4 ph 12 5 this indicates that high ph condition not exposure time was the critical factor determining pi release 3 4 reusability of immobilized pbp the viability of the immobilized pbp system for pi removal and recovery hinges on pbp s adsorption desorption efficiency over repeated cycles in this study performance over 10 cycles plus an initial desorption wash to remove legacy pi was evaluated in the initial pi desorption wash cycle 0 the average percent pi desorbed at ph 11 5 12 and 12 5 was 46 0 6 59 1 2 and 77 1 2 respectively fig 4 this agrees with our earlier observations wherein pi desorption increases with increased ph poor initial pi desorption can also explain the lower 10 cycle average pi adsorption observed compared to desorption for ph 11 5 and 12 63 8 8 and 64 6 6 2 respectively compared to ph 12 5 83 5 incomplete removal of pi negatively affects subsequent pi adsorption due to fewer available pbp pi binding sites in subsequent adsorption cycles as ph 12 5 buffer yielded the most complete desorption it also demonstrated the most consistent and effective function during reuse of the immobilized pbp over 10 cycles specifically ph 12 5 provided the highest 10 cycle average desorption 89 4 1 compared to 71 6 8 using ph 11 5 and 70 7 5 0 using ph 12 additionally this level of desorption was achieved consistently over all 10 cycles p value 0 05 n 60 whereas when desorption was conducted at 11 5 or 12 lower sorption was observed in the initial cycles followed by improvements in successive cycles for example percent pi adsorption and desorption during cycles 1 through 4 remained relatively low when desorbing with ph 11 5 average of 58 7 10 3 and 66 5 8 1 respectively and 12 average of 60 3 1 3 and 66 7 3 4 respectively fig 4 as shown desorption at ph 11 5 was significantly greater than adsorption p 0 05 in cycles 1 4 whereas adsorption was generally equivalent to desorption in cycles 5 10 indicating that incomplete desorption initially hampered adsorption improvements in sorption owing to incrementally more complete desorption are evident in the consistently higher p value 0 05 n 18 average percent pi adsorption and desorption observed in cycles 5 10 for both ph 11 5 66 1 6 2 adsorption and 72 6 5 1 desorption and 12 67 5 6 5 adsorption and 73 4 3 9 desorption these results demonstrate that ph 12 5 buffer provided the highest average pi adsorption and desorption using pbp beads at room temperature additionally the extent of adsorption and desorption observed was consistent over 10 cycles which is crucial for the pbp bead s viability as a reusable adsorbent as the average pi desorbed was either statistically higher or similar to pi adsorbed it is reasonable to conclude that all adsorbed pi including some pi not desorbed during cycle 0 was recovered accordingly these results demonstrate that extracellular immobilized pbp can successfully remove and recover pi for at least 10 sequential cycles 3 5 influence of ph and temperature on pbp structural stability and pbp pi interaction to further assess the system s potential the mechanisms of pi adsorption and desorption were explored the release of adsorbed pi triggered by elevated ph may derive from changes in overall conformation of pbp local changes in the coordination of pi in the active site or a combination of these phenomena since the activity of pbp was retained over multiple cycles we probed potential changes in pbp structure under the varying conditions using a fluorescent thermal shift assay in this experiment pbp is unfolded as a function of temperature in the presence of a non specific hydrophobic protein binding sypro orange fluorophore upon protein unfolding the dye binds and generates a change in fluorescence which was quantified by the q pcr instrument structural changes under a particular condition e g changes in ph would result in a shift in the thermal stability i e melting temperature as shown in fig 5 the thermal shift analysis showed that buffer ph conditions did not influence the melting temperature tm of the pbp p value 0 05 n 21 this indicates that there were no conformational changes to the structure of pbp thus desorption of pi from pbp at high ph conditions 10 was not caused by changes in the structure of the protein since there were no observable global changes in the structure of pbp as a function of the ph range tested changes in the coordination of pi in the active site likely accounted for pi dissociation to test this hypothesis we analyzed the coordination of pi in the high resolution crystal structure of pbp pdb id 1ixh www rcsb org on the molecular visualization software pymol version 2 0 schrödinger llc usa the structure of pbp bound to pi reveals that the 7 different amino acid residues form 12 strong hydrogen bonds with pi fig 6 the pi interacts with the peptide backbone of thr10 phe11 ser38 thr141 and gly140 side chain interactions with the amino group of arg135 and the hydroxyl groups of ser38 ser139 thr10 and thr141 were observed finally the carboxylate group of the asp56 side chain also stabilizes pi fig 6 luecke and quiocho 1990 the pka values of the 7 different amino acid acid residues that interact with pi in the active site range from ph 9 04 to 9 6 at ph 10 these amino acid residues are primarily deprotonated thereby inhibiting the formation of hydrogen bonds between pi and the pbp active site we propose that the deprotonation at elevated ph explains pi desorption at high ph and subsequent pi re adsorption as the residues are protonated during the wash with the neutral ph buffer in summary the results from the thermal shift analysis and the pbp bead reusability experiment indicated that the pi adsorption desorption capacity of the extracellular immobilized pbp will not be impacted by repetitive cycles of neutral and high ph to promote adsorption and desorption respectively thus reuse of the immobilized pbp is possible lending credence to its application in water wastewater treatment settings 3 6 pi removal and recovery evaluation of pbp in comparison to other adsorbents the global importance of pi removal and recovery has encouraged the development and implementation of a variety of different adsorbent materials characterized by a range of capacities selectivities reversibility and affinities some of which are summarized in reviews such as de bashan and bashan 2004 mayer et al 2013 mehta et al 2015 and rittmann et al 2011 accordingly evaluation of pbp s potential for pi removal and recovery applications relative to other systems is prudent one existing pi recovery approach that has attracted considerable interest is ion exchange using synthetic iron based resins mayer et al 2013 commercially available hybrid anion ion exchange haix resins with hydrated ferric oxides e g arsenx solmetex phosx etc have demonstrated effectiveness as a reversible pi adsorbents that can remove pi to ultra low levels 100 μg l blaney et al 2007 mayer et al 2013 pan et al 2009 sarkar et al 2007 sengupta and cumbal 2007 approximately 95 of the pi adsorbed by haix can be released using a naoh nacl regenerant solution blaney et al 2007 in this study we observed similar levels of controlled pi desorption from immobilized pbp approximately 86 97 using a basic solution with similar desorption performance pbp may offer a viable alternative for pi recovery however the advantages and disadvantages of alternative adsorbents must be weighed in each application and future optimization and evaluation of the pbp system are needed to facilitate direct comparisons the pi adsorption selectivity of immobilized pbp may match or even surpass existing iron based adsorbents e g haix the mutant variant of e coli pbp a197c used in this study was originally developed as a pi sensor and was extensively characterized for its pi affinity and selectivity brune et al 1998 1994 solscheid et al 2015 brune et al 1994 demonstrated rapid pi adsorption using e coli pbp a197c kon 1 36 108 m 1 s 1 with adsorption limited only by diffusion zhou et al 1983 moreover e coli pbp can adsorb pi to ultra low levels 100 μg l brune et al 1994 a similar result was reported by kuroda et al 2000 using immobilized pbp from p aeruginosa with respect to competition e coli pbp does not adsorb anions such as sulfate vanadate chloride and fluoride brune et al 1994 luecke and quiocho 1990 similarly haix resins are unaffected by the presence of competing ions such as sulfate carbonate fluoride and chloride acelas et al 2015 blaney et al 2007 martin et al 2009 pan et al 2009 sarkar et al 2007 you et al 2016 the only significant competitor for pi adsorption using haix or other iron based adsorbents is arsenate although pbp can adsorb arsenate e coli pbp a197c offers 50 to 100 times higher pi binding affinity than arsenate dissociation constant kd 0 03 0 07 μm for pi and 3 μm for arsenate brune et al 1994 the pbps from other microorganisms such as p fluorescens halmonas sp gfaj 1 and k variicola are also able to discriminate pi from arsenate even when arsenate is present at concentrations in excess of 3000 4000 fold higher than pi elias et al 2012 therefore pbp has the potential to provide a distinct pi adsorption advantage over existing iron based ion exchange resins with respect to selectivity of pi over arsenate although previous studies show promising results for pbp s selectivity affinity and kinetics of adsorption pbp systems are still in the very early stages of development and future advances are needed to overcome significant limitations in order for pbp to be a cost effective alternative to existing adsorbents such as haix improving the adsorption capacity and reusability of immobilized pbp is critical for improving the technical and economic feasibility of pi removal and recovery commercially available haix resins are robust high reusability with high adsorption capacities ranging from 20 to 40 mg pi g resin in real wastewater conditions acelas et al 2015 blaney et al 2007 pan et al 2009 you et al 2016 in comparison the nhs activated sepharose beads used in this study have the potential to immobilize 16 23 μm pbp ml of bead ge healthcare bio sciences providing a potential pi adsorption capacity of approximately 1 5 2 mg pi ml bead which is roughly an order of magnitude lower than haix resins additionally the effects of real water wastewater constituents on pbp pi adsorption desorption and long term reusability of the immobilized pbp system is yet to be investigated in comparison to inorganic haix resins pbp is biodegradable and may be negatively affected by the presence of natural organic matter microorganisms and enzymes e g protease which can severely hamper adsorption capacity and reusability in real water wastewater conditions therefore in order to further develop pbp as a highly selective alternative to current iron based pi adsorbents future studies should focus on optimizing pi adsorption capacity e g optimized protein coupling density and investigating the reusability of immobilized pbp in actual water wastewater matrices 4 conclusions harnessing the selective sensitive pi adsorption abilities of the high affinity pbp offers an opportunity to engineer an innovative water treatment system which can effectively remove pi to ultra low levels 100 μg l and release pi under controlled conditions suitable for subsequent pi reuse previous studies have established pbp s capability as an effective pi adsorbent however conditions for controlled pi release have not yet been conclusively established this study investigated the ideal ph and temperature conditions for pi release from extracellular pbp immobilized on an inert surface the results showed that pi adsorbed using immobilized pbp can be recovered nearly instantaneously using a high ph 12 5 wash the immobilized pbp maintained consistent pi adsorption capacity after 10 high ph wash cycles supporting its reusability as pbp structure is highly stable from ph 4 to 12 5 the pi release at high ph is most likely due to reversible deprotonation of amino acid residues at the active binding site the structural stability of pbp and consistent pi adsorption capacity after 10 high ph wash cycles also suggest that extracellular immobilized pbp could endure more than 10 repetitive cycles of neutral and high ph to promote adsorption and desorption respectively accordingly immobilized pbp appears to provide a strong foundation for an effective and reusable pi removal recovery adsorption system providing high affinity ultra low and ultra fast pi binding future investigations targeting optimization of the immobilized pbp system e g improvements in capacity linked to higher protein bead coupling efficiency and protein stability in actual water matrices are needed to further improve reusability and capacity and establish pbp as a viable pi recovery alternative additionally the application of immobilized pbp for pi recovery from real water

20025,progress towards a more circular phosphorus economy necessitates development of innovative water treatment systems which can reversibly remove inorganic phosphate pi to ultra low levels 100 μg l 1 and subsequently recover the pi for reuse in this study a novel approach using the high affinity e coli phosphate binding protein pbp as a reusable pi bio adsorbent was investigated pbp was expressed extracted purified and immobilized on nhs activated sepharose beads the resultant pbp beads were saturated with pi and exposed to varying ph ph 4 7 to 12 5 and temperatures 25 45 c to induce pi release increase in temperature from 25 to 45 c and ph conditions between 4 7 and 8 5 released less than 20 of adsorbed pi however 62 and 86 of the adsorbed pi was released at ph 11 4 and 12 5 respectively kinetic experiments showed that pi desorption occurred nearly instantaneously 5 min regardless of ph conditions which is advantageous for pi recovery additionally no loss in pi adsorption or desorption capacity was observed when the pbp beads were exposed to 10 repeated cycles of adsorption desorption using neutral and high ph 12 5 washes respectively the highest average pi adsorption using the pbp beads was 83 5 with 89 4 1 average desorption using ph 12 5 washes over 10 wash cycles at room temperature thermal shift assay of the pbp showed that the protein was structurally stable after 10 cycles with statistically similar melting temperatures between ph 4 and 12 5 these results indicate that immobilized high affinity pbp has the potential to be an effective and reversible bio adsorbent suitable for pi recovery from water wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords adsorbent phosphorus nutrient reuse psts water wastewater 1 introduction the economic and ecological losses associated with eutrophication caused by excess inorganic phosphate pi have inspired increasingly lower effluent phosphorus water quality guidelines for many municipal and industrial wastewater treatment facilities around the world amery and schoumans 2014 usepa 1995 1986 apart from limiting pi loadings in wastewater effluents there is also strong impetus to secure renewable pi resources for use as agricultural fertilizer i e via pi recovery from wastewater this approach stimulates the circular phosphorus economy which is vital since in addition to being a pollutant pi is a geographically limited nonrenewable resource that is essential to sustain global food production cordell et al 2009 cordell and white 2014 mayer et al 2016 rittmann et al 2011 this removal recovery paradigm drives development of innovative water treatment systems which can effectively remove pi to ultra low levels 100 μg l and release pi under controlled conditions suitable for subsequent pi reuse mayer et al 2013 rittmann et al 2011 a novel strategy utilizing high affinity phosphate binding proteins pbp as a reusable bio adsorbent to reversibly capture pi was investigated in this study the phosphate specific transporter pst system in bacteria is specifically evolved to import pi when pi is present at low levels which demands efficient selective and high affinity binding and transport of pi to meet the cell s metabolic demands blank 2012 luecke and quiocho 1990 santos beneit et al 2008 the pst protein complex comprises four subunits an atp binding protein pstb two transmembrane proteins psta and pstc and a periplasmic pbp psts luecke and quiocho 1990 santos beneit et al 2008 the periplasmic psts pbp has recently attracted interest as a potential high affinity phosphate specific pi adsorbent kuroda et al 2000 li et al 2009 yang et al 2016 2017 removal of pi to ultra low concentrations has been demonstrated using pbp expressed in bacterial cells periplasmic space expressed on the cells surface or immobilized on sepharose beads choi et al 2013 kuroda et al 2000 li et al 2009 yang et al 2016 for example choi et al 2013 showed that recombinant e coli expressing pbp in the periplasmic space can remove 97 pi from water within 6 h initial concentration of 0 2 0 5 mg pi l kuroda et al 2000 demonstrated pi removal to below the detection limit 9 5 ng pi l using pbp immobilized on sepharose beads to treat an influent concentration of 15 μg pi l to better support the circular phosphorus economy via the waste to resource paradigm recovery of the captured pi is essential to assess pi recovery yang et al 2016 investigated the effect of varying temperature ph and ionic strength on pi release from pbp over expressed in the periplasmic space of e coli cells however a maximum of only 1 4 2 of the adsorbed pi was recovered after exposing the recombinant e coli cells to low ph ph 3 8 high temperature 35 c or high ionic strength 100 mm kcl for 3 h yang et al 2016 on the other hand kuroda et al 2000 reported 90 recovery of the adsorbed pi from pbp immobilized on sepharose beads at ph 3 although the data was not shown kuroda et al 2000 stated that the immobilized pbp could be reused after neutralizing the ph thus additional investigation of the removal and controlled release of pi from immobilized pbp at varying ph and temperature and the performance of pbp over multiple cycles of pi removal and recovery is needed effective reusability of the pbp is a crucial aspect of the viability of this bio adsorbent for pi removal and recovery from water the objective of this study was to investigate the adsorption and desorption of pi using pbp immobilized on an inert surface as a function of ph and temperature in comparison to periplasmic pbp extracellular immobilized pbp may be more effective as a reversible bio adsorbent as it may be more conducive to both removal and controlled recovery through regulation of environmental parameters such ph and temperature reusability of the pbp was also investigated to assess the impact of the recovery conditions on pbp structure and pi recovery potential over multiple cycles of pi adsorption desorption 2 materials and methods 2 1 expression and purification of pbp the psts pbp used in this study was a single cysteine mutant variant a197c of the mature e coli pbp developed by solscheid et al 2015 for use as a phosphate biosensor the psts gene a197c overexpression plasmid plasmid 78198 addgene cambridge ma usa was transformed into bl21 de3 e coli competent cells and cultured for protein expression and purification as previously described solscheid et al 2015 briefly a 5 ml overnight culture of the transformed bl21 de3 cells was grown in lb media supplemented with 100 μg ml ampicillin at 37 c this culture was diluted by transferring 2 ml of the overnight culture into 1 l fresh lb growth media in baffled glass flasks the flasks were incubated at 37 c with vigorous shaking and the culture was allowed to grow to an od 600 of approximately 0 8 before inducing protein expression using 500 μm isopropyl β d thiogalactopytanoside iptg after 4 h induction at 37 c cells were centrifuged for 15 min at 4000 g and 4 c all further protein purification steps were carried out at 4 c to purify the proteins the pellets were re suspended in 100 ml of resuspension buffer 10 mm tris hcl 1 mm mgcl2 ph 8 0 and sonicated 4 times for 30 s at 200 w with a 5 s on off pulse cycle the lysate supernatant was collected following centrifugation at 6000 g for 45 min the lysate was passed through a 100 mlbv settled and drained bead volume where bv bed volume q sepharose column ge healthcare bio sciences pittsburg pa usa equilibrated with resuspension buffer the protein was eluted in a 100 ml gradient of 0 200 mm nacl in the resuspension buffer the presence of the protein was verified in the eluted fractions using sds page fractions containing psts were pooled and concentrated using a 10 kda cutoff spin concentrator vivaspin 20 ge healthcare bio sciences in cases when higher protein concentrations were required the concentration of the purified pbp was 221 0 6 μm average standard deviation as quantified at 280 nm using a spectrophotometer agilent technologies santa clara ca usa assuming an extinction coefficient of 17 8 cm 1 brune et al 1994 2 2 immobilization of pbp the purified psts pbp was dialyzed using a spectra por 2 dialysis membrane mwco 12 14 kda spectrum laboratories inc rancho dominguez ca usa dialysis was conducted for 16 h at 4 c and included 6 exchanges of 0 2 m nahco3 0 5 m nacl ph 8 3 buffer the dialyzed pbp was immobilized on nhs activated sepharose 4 fast flow beads in accordance with the manufacturer s instructions ge healthcare bio sciences since nhs activated sepharose interferes with the signal from the spectrophotometer at 280 nm we used the quick start bradford protein assay bio rad laboratories inc hercules ca usa to determine the concentration of pbp for further experiments the concentration of the dialyzed pbp was measured as 202 2 μm using the bradford assay fresh nhs beads stored in 100 isopropanol were transferred into a 100 ml econo column bio rad laboratories inc and washed with 10 bed volumes of 1 mm hcl solution at 4 c for the coupling reaction 20 ml of dialyzed pbp 202 μm was added to 20 ml of washed nhs beads drained volume and mixed at 30 rpm on a roto torque variable speed end over end rotator cole parmer il usa for 16 h at 4 c the supernatant was collected and the concentration of the unbound pbp was quantified using the bradford assay of the initial pbp loaded onto the column 20 ml of 202 2 μm 98 0 6 was immobilized onto the nhs beads providing a coupling density of 197 0 2 nmol pbp mlbv nhs beads mlbv drained nhs bead volume this non optimized coupling density was much lower than the theoretical maximum of 16 23 μmol mlbv for nhs beads reported by ge healthcare bio sciences however 197 0 2 nmol pbp mlbv was sufficient for the adsorption desorption assessments in this study based on 1 mol of pbp adsorbing 1 mol of pi brune et al 1998 1994 solscheid et al 2015 the theoretical pi adsorption capacity of the nhs beads was 197 0 2 nmol mlbv the nhs beads conjugated with pbp hereon referred to as pbp beads were sequentially washed with 1bv of 0 1 m tris hcl ph 8 5 followed by washing with 1bv of buffer containing 0 1 m sodium acetate 0 5 m nacl ph 4 5 this cycle was repeated three times followed by five washes with 1bv of buffer containing 10 mm tris hcl 1 mm mgcl2 ph 7 1 to remove the legacy pi already adsorbed on the pbp during the expression purification and immobilization process the pbp beads were mopped using 0 1 unit ml purine nucleoside phosphorylase pnpase and 300 μm 7 methylguanosine 7 meg brune et al 1998 1994 to facilitate mixing 20 ml of 10 mm tris hcl 1 mm mgcl2 ph 7 1 buffer was added to 20 mlbv pbp beads next 0 1 unit ml pnpase enzyme and 300 μm 7 meg was added to the 40 ml pbp bead solution 50 suspension the mopping reaction was performed overnight at 4 c at 30 rpm using a rotary shaker after 16 h the pbp beads were washed with 5 x 1bv 10 mm tris hcl 1 mm mgcl2 ph 7 1 buffer to remove the pi mop upon completion of this pbp immobilization procedure the beads were either used immediately or stored at 4 c for up to 48 h prior to use a control set of beads was prepared using 20 mlbv of fresh nhs beads following the same procedure used for the pbp beads except without pbp addition 2 3 adsorption of pi by immobilized pbp triplicate pi adsorption experiments were conducted in batch tests in 2 ml centrifuge tubes containing 0 25 mlbv pbp beads in all tests 1 ml reaction buffer 10 mm tris hcl 1 mm mgcl2 ph 7 1 25 c containing excess pi 60 μm was initially added 60 nmol pi versus the theoretical capacity of the pbp beads 49 nmol 0 25 mlbv to ensure pi saturation of the pbp beads after gentle mixing by hand and 10 min for bead settling the supernatant was collected and analyzed for pi previous studies showed that pi binding is nearly instantaneous brune et al 1998 1994 solscheid et al 2015 such that 10 min was sufficient to achieve equilibrium the ph in the centrifuge tubes was measured using a micro ph probe orion 9810bn thermo scientific waltham ma usa no change in ph was observed over the course of the 10 min adsorption period 2 4 recovery of pi from immobilized pbp as a function of temperature and ph following adsorption desorption experiments were initiated by washing the beads 3 times using 1 ml reaction buffer ph 7 1 to remove unbound pi each tube was then loaded with 1 ml of reaction buffer solution in separate experiments the influence of temperature was evaluated by adjusting the reaction buffer temperature to 25 c 35 c or 45 c before addition to the tubes ph 7 1 the tubes were maintained at the target temperature for the duration of the desorption experiment using an incubator vwr 1524 digital incubator additional tests were performed to evaluate the influence of ph by adjusting the ph of reaction buffer to final values of 4 7 6 5 7 1 8 5 9 2 11 4 and 12 5 using 1 m hcl or naoh while maintaining a constant temperature of 25 c the ph in the microfuge tubes was measured using a micro ph probe orion 9810bn thermo scientific waltham ma usa and did not change over the duration of the experiment in both temperature and ph tests gentle mixing was applied initially by inverting the microfuge tubes three times by hand the beads were then allowed to settle for 10 min and a 1 ml aliquot of the settled supernatant was analyzed for pi using the ascorbic acid method apha 2012 for each condition tested nhs beads with no pbp control beads were tested in parallel to isolate the impact of the nhs beads on pi adsorption desorption 2 5 kinetics of pi recovery from immobilized pbp the extent of pi release from pbp beads was assessed as a function of time for four different ph conditions following previous experiments showing efficient release using elevated ph triplicate experiments were conducted for both pbp beads and control beads as described in sections 2 3 and 2 4 an initial pi adsorption cycle was performed by adding 1 ml of 60 μm pi solution in 25 c reaction buffer at ph 7 1 to 0 25 mlbv pbp beads after gentle mixing by hand and 10 min bead settling the supernatant was collected and analyzed for pi for subsequent desorption the pbp beads were washed 3 times with 1 ml reaction buffer at ph 7 1 to remove unattached pi from solution next the pbp beads were washed with 1 5 ml of reaction buffer yielding final ph values in the tubes of 7 1 10 8 11 9 and 12 5 aliquots of 0 1 ml were collected for pi analysis after 5 10 20 30 40 and 50 min of reaction 2 6 reusability of immobilized pbp the ability of the pbp beads to adsorb and desorb pi over 10 cycles of sequential high and neutral ph conditions promoting desorption and adsorption respectively was investigated tests were conducted in batch mode using 10 ml disposable poly prep reactors bio rad laboratories inc hercules ca usa with 0 25 mlbv beads based on results of previous ph tests 3 different high ph conditions 11 5 12 and 12 5 were tested in independent triplicate experiments using pbp beads or control beads fig 1 illustrates the experimental approach the first step in these experiments was to release pi adsorbed on pi saturated pbp beads by washing them with 1 75 ml of reaction buffer at ph 11 5 12 or 12 5 25 c for 10 min before decanting the supernatant immediately following 1 75 ml reaction buffer at ph 7 1 25 c was added to adjust the beads to near neutral ph for 10 min before decanting the supernatant in preparation for the subsequent pi adsorption cycle the ph in the tubes was verified using a micro ph probe orion 9810bn thermo scientific waltham ma usa the buffer solution decanted after each step was analyzed for pi desorbed during the initial cycle 0 following the initial pi release cycle 10 sequential cycles of pi adsorption desorption were performed the first pi adsorption step in each cycle consisted of adding 1 ml reaction buffer at ph 7 1 25 c containing 60 μm pi after gentle mixing and 10 min bead settling the supernatant was decanted and analyzed for pi in the second pi desorption step pi was desorbed using 1 75 ml of reaction buffer at 25 c and ph 11 5 12 or 12 5 for 10 min followed by decanting the supernatant in the third rinse step 1 75 ml reaction buffer at ph 7 1 and 25 c was added for 10 min to wash away any remaining high ph buffer the buffer solutions decanted after the second and third steps were analyzed for pi desorbed in each cycle 2 7 thermal shift assay stability of the pbp structure was analyzed in triplicate at varying ph and temperature using the thermal shift assay as described previously huynh and partch 2015 purified suspended pbp non immobilized was diluted to 7 5 μm in 10 mm tris 1 mm mgcl2 buffer with a final ph of 4 0 6 6 7 5 9 2 10 9 11 9 or 12 3 similar to the ph range investigated in the pi recovery experiment a 20 μl aliquot of each pbp solution 7 5 μm was mixed with 10 μl of 15x sypro orange invitrogen for the analysis with a resultant protein concentration of 5 μm the mixture was dispensed into a 96 well pcr plate sealed with an optical seal and gently shaken to remove air bubbles a thermal scan from 25 c to 95 c at an incremental rate of 1 c min was performed on the plate using a real time pcr instrument stratagene mx3005p the protein denaturation curve fluorescence vs temperature was truncated to 2 c past the maximum fluorescence and then fitted to a non linear boltzmann sigmoidal curve r statistical package minpack lm nlslm all raw data analysis data truncation non linear curve fitting and melting temperature calculation was conducted in rstudio version 0 98 1091 using custom scripts 2 8 data analysis all pbp bead pi concentration data was normalized to the corresponding control bead test the normalized data was also compared to the theoretical pi adsorption capacity 49 nmol 0 25 mlbv of the pbp beads to obtain percent pi adsorbed and desorbed data normal data distribution was assessed using the shapiro wilk test α 0 05 the statistical differences in pi concentrations between different conditions were performed using one way anova α 0 05 with tukey post hoc analysis α 0 05 they were conducted using excel 2010 version 14 3 2 microsoft usa with an added statistical software package xlstat pro 2014 addinsoft usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 pi removal from immobilized pbp an initial adsorption test was performed to assess pi removal by exposing the pbp beads to excess pi higher levels of pi than the theoretical capacity of the pbp beads 49 nmoles of pi for 0 25 ml of pbp beads were mixed with the beads for 10 min however the pbp beads only adsorbed 11 8 4 nmoles pi n 39 or 24 8 of the theoretical capacity the low degree of initial pi adsorption suggested that not all of the pbp was available for pi removal possibly due to the presence of legacy pi that bound to the pbps active sites during protein preparation to address the pre adsorption presence of pi in the system an initial pi desorption wash step with a reaction buffer ph 12 5 was adopted in this study to remove legacy pi bound to the pbp the initial high ph wash step substantially increased the pi adsorption capacity of the pbp beads to 41 2 nmoles mlbv or 83 2 1 of the theoretical capacity 3 2 recovery of pi as a function of temperature and ph the results from the pi recovery experiments using varying buffer ph and temperature conditions are summarized in fig 2 increases in temperature from 25 to 45 c and ph conditions between 4 7 and 8 5 released less than 20 of adsorbed pi all pi desorbed calculations were performed using data normalized to the theoretical pi capacity 49 nmoles 0 25 mlbv only at higher buffer ph conditions was a substantial proportion of the bound pi released from the pbp beads at ph 11 4 and 12 5 the total pi recovered from the pbp beads was 30 2 3 9 nmoles pi 62 and 42 2 5 5 nmoles pi 86 respectively these results demonstrated that ph 11 4 25 c 10 min reaction time provided the best conditions for recovery higher pi recovery was achieved using the immobilized pbp in this study 86 pi recovery at ph 12 5 in comparison to that observed using pbp over expressed in the periplasmic space of recombinant e coli 2 1 pi recovery at ph 3 8 yang et al 2016 alternately the recovery achieved in this study was similar to kuroda et al s 2000 report using immobilized pbp from p aeruginosa 90 pi recovery at ph 3 accordingly the immobilized pbp with direct exposure to the water matrix demonstrated greater ph dependency compared to intracellular proteins of note however kuroda et al 2000 observed no pi desorption above ph 5 but did not investigate ph 10 whereas the lowest ph investigated in this study was ph 4 7 which provided the lowest extent of pi desorption thus greater understanding of the response to a wide range of ph conditions is needed in future studies of immobilized pbp 3 3 kinetics of pi recovery from immobilized pbp desorption of pi occurred nearly instantaneously 5 min regardless of ph conditions which is advantageous for operation of a phosphorus recovery process this is illustrated in fig 3 which shows that the amount of pi released did not change between 5 and 50 min p value 0 05 n 6 however as described in section 3 1 ph significantly influenced pi desorption average pi desorption within 5 min of reaction time was 2 9 6 ph 7 1 35 4 4 ph 10 8 79 13 ph 11 9 and 97 9 4 ph 12 5 this indicates that high ph condition not exposure time was the critical factor determining pi release 3 4 reusability of immobilized pbp the viability of the immobilized pbp system for pi removal and recovery hinges on pbp s adsorption desorption efficiency over repeated cycles in this study performance over 10 cycles plus an initial desorption wash to remove legacy pi was evaluated in the initial pi desorption wash cycle 0 the average percent pi desorbed at ph 11 5 12 and 12 5 was 46 0 6 59 1 2 and 77 1 2 respectively fig 4 this agrees with our earlier observations wherein pi desorption increases with increased ph poor initial pi desorption can also explain the lower 10 cycle average pi adsorption observed compared to desorption for ph 11 5 and 12 63 8 8 and 64 6 6 2 respectively compared to ph 12 5 83 5 incomplete removal of pi negatively affects subsequent pi adsorption due to fewer available pbp pi binding sites in subsequent adsorption cycles as ph 12 5 buffer yielded the most complete desorption it also demonstrated the most consistent and effective function during reuse of the immobilized pbp over 10 cycles specifically ph 12 5 provided the highest 10 cycle average desorption 89 4 1 compared to 71 6 8 using ph 11 5 and 70 7 5 0 using ph 12 additionally this level of desorption was achieved consistently over all 10 cycles p value 0 05 n 60 whereas when desorption was conducted at 11 5 or 12 lower sorption was observed in the initial cycles followed by improvements in successive cycles for example percent pi adsorption and desorption during cycles 1 through 4 remained relatively low when desorbing with ph 11 5 average of 58 7 10 3 and 66 5 8 1 respectively and 12 average of 60 3 1 3 and 66 7 3 4 respectively fig 4 as shown desorption at ph 11 5 was significantly greater than adsorption p 0 05 in cycles 1 4 whereas adsorption was generally equivalent to desorption in cycles 5 10 indicating that incomplete desorption initially hampered adsorption improvements in sorption owing to incrementally more complete desorption are evident in the consistently higher p value 0 05 n 18 average percent pi adsorption and desorption observed in cycles 5 10 for both ph 11 5 66 1 6 2 adsorption and 72 6 5 1 desorption and 12 67 5 6 5 adsorption and 73 4 3 9 desorption these results demonstrate that ph 12 5 buffer provided the highest average pi adsorption and desorption using pbp beads at room temperature additionally the extent of adsorption and desorption observed was consistent over 10 cycles which is crucial for the pbp bead s viability as a reusable adsorbent as the average pi desorbed was either statistically higher or similar to pi adsorbed it is reasonable to conclude that all adsorbed pi including some pi not desorbed during cycle 0 was recovered accordingly these results demonstrate that extracellular immobilized pbp can successfully remove and recover pi for at least 10 sequential cycles 3 5 influence of ph and temperature on pbp structural stability and pbp pi interaction to further assess the system s potential the mechanisms of pi adsorption and desorption were explored the release of adsorbed pi triggered by elevated ph may derive from changes in overall conformation of pbp local changes in the coordination of pi in the active site or a combination of these phenomena since the activity of pbp was retained over multiple cycles we probed potential changes in pbp structure under the varying conditions using a fluorescent thermal shift assay in this experiment pbp is unfolded as a function of temperature in the presence of a non specific hydrophobic protein binding sypro orange fluorophore upon protein unfolding the dye binds and generates a change in fluorescence which was quantified by the q pcr instrument structural changes under a particular condition e g changes in ph would result in a shift in the thermal stability i e melting temperature as shown in fig 5 the thermal shift analysis showed that buffer ph conditions did not influence the melting temperature tm of the pbp p value 0 05 n 21 this indicates that there were no conformational changes to the structure of pbp thus desorption of pi from pbp at high ph conditions 10 was not caused by changes in the structure of the protein since there were no observable global changes in the structure of pbp as a function of the ph range tested changes in the coordination of pi in the active site likely accounted for pi dissociation to test this hypothesis we analyzed the coordination of pi in the high resolution crystal structure of pbp pdb id 1ixh www rcsb org on the molecular visualization software pymol version 2 0 schrödinger llc usa the structure of pbp bound to pi reveals that the 7 different amino acid residues form 12 strong hydrogen bonds with pi fig 6 the pi interacts with the peptide backbone of thr10 phe11 ser38 thr141 and gly140 side chain interactions with the amino group of arg135 and the hydroxyl groups of ser38 ser139 thr10 and thr141 were observed finally the carboxylate group of the asp56 side chain also stabilizes pi fig 6 luecke and quiocho 1990 the pka values of the 7 different amino acid acid residues that interact with pi in the active site range from ph 9 04 to 9 6 at ph 10 these amino acid residues are primarily deprotonated thereby inhibiting the formation of hydrogen bonds between pi and the pbp active site we propose that the deprotonation at elevated ph explains pi desorption at high ph and subsequent pi re adsorption as the residues are protonated during the wash with the neutral ph buffer in summary the results from the thermal shift analysis and the pbp bead reusability experiment indicated that the pi adsorption desorption capacity of the extracellular immobilized pbp will not be impacted by repetitive cycles of neutral and high ph to promote adsorption and desorption respectively thus reuse of the immobilized pbp is possible lending credence to its application in water wastewater treatment settings 3 6 pi removal and recovery evaluation of pbp in comparison to other adsorbents the global importance of pi removal and recovery has encouraged the development and implementation of a variety of different adsorbent materials characterized by a range of capacities selectivities reversibility and affinities some of which are summarized in reviews such as de bashan and bashan 2004 mayer et al 2013 mehta et al 2015 and rittmann et al 2011 accordingly evaluation of pbp s potential for pi removal and recovery applications relative to other systems is prudent one existing pi recovery approach that has attracted considerable interest is ion exchange using synthetic iron based resins mayer et al 2013 commercially available hybrid anion ion exchange haix resins with hydrated ferric oxides e g arsenx solmetex phosx etc have demonstrated effectiveness as a reversible pi adsorbents that can remove pi to ultra low levels 100 μg l blaney et al 2007 mayer et al 2013 pan et al 2009 sarkar et al 2007 sengupta and cumbal 2007 approximately 95 of the pi adsorbed by haix can be released using a naoh nacl regenerant solution blaney et al 2007 in this study we observed similar levels of controlled pi desorption from immobilized pbp approximately 86 97 using a basic solution with similar desorption performance pbp may offer a viable alternative for pi recovery however the advantages and disadvantages of alternative adsorbents must be weighed in each application and future optimization and evaluation of the pbp system are needed to facilitate direct comparisons the pi adsorption selectivity of immobilized pbp may match or even surpass existing iron based adsorbents e g haix the mutant variant of e coli pbp a197c used in this study was originally developed as a pi sensor and was extensively characterized for its pi affinity and selectivity brune et al 1998 1994 solscheid et al 2015 brune et al 1994 demonstrated rapid pi adsorption using e coli pbp a197c kon 1 36 108 m 1 s 1 with adsorption limited only by diffusion zhou et al 1983 moreover e coli pbp can adsorb pi to ultra low levels 100 μg l brune et al 1994 a similar result was reported by kuroda et al 2000 using immobilized pbp from p aeruginosa with respect to competition e coli pbp does not adsorb anions such as sulfate vanadate chloride and fluoride brune et al 1994 luecke and quiocho 1990 similarly haix resins are unaffected by the presence of competing ions such as sulfate carbonate fluoride and chloride acelas et al 2015 blaney et al 2007 martin et al 2009 pan et al 2009 sarkar et al 2007 you et al 2016 the only significant competitor for pi adsorption using haix or other iron based adsorbents is arsenate although pbp can adsorb arsenate e coli pbp a197c offers 50 to 100 times higher pi binding affinity than arsenate dissociation constant kd 0 03 0 07 μm for pi and 3 μm for arsenate brune et al 1994 the pbps from other microorganisms such as p fluorescens halmonas sp gfaj 1 and k variicola are also able to discriminate pi from arsenate even when arsenate is present at concentrations in excess of 3000 4000 fold higher than pi elias et al 2012 therefore pbp has the potential to provide a distinct pi adsorption advantage over existing iron based ion exchange resins with respect to selectivity of pi over arsenate although previous studies show promising results for pbp s selectivity affinity and kinetics of adsorption pbp systems are still in the very early stages of development and future advances are needed to overcome significant limitations in order for pbp to be a cost effective alternative to existing adsorbents such as haix improving the adsorption capacity and reusability of immobilized pbp is critical for improving the technical and economic feasibility of pi removal and recovery commercially available haix resins are robust high reusability with high adsorption capacities ranging from 20 to 40 mg pi g resin in real wastewater conditions acelas et al 2015 blaney et al 2007 pan et al 2009 you et al 2016 in comparison the nhs activated sepharose beads used in this study have the potential to immobilize 16 23 μm pbp ml of bead ge healthcare bio sciences providing a potential pi adsorption capacity of approximately 1 5 2 mg pi ml bead which is roughly an order of magnitude lower than haix resins additionally the effects of real water wastewater constituents on pbp pi adsorption desorption and long term reusability of the immobilized pbp system is yet to be investigated in comparison to inorganic haix resins pbp is biodegradable and may be negatively affected by the presence of natural organic matter microorganisms and enzymes e g protease which can severely hamper adsorption capacity and reusability in real water wastewater conditions therefore in order to further develop pbp as a highly selective alternative to current iron based pi adsorbents future studies should focus on optimizing pi adsorption capacity e g optimized protein coupling density and investigating the reusability of immobilized pbp in actual water wastewater matrices 4 conclusions harnessing the selective sensitive pi adsorption abilities of the high affinity pbp offers an opportunity to engineer an innovative water treatment system which can effectively remove pi to ultra low levels 100 μg l and release pi under controlled conditions suitable for subsequent pi reuse previous studies have established pbp s capability as an effective pi adsorbent however conditions for controlled pi release have not yet been conclusively established this study investigated the ideal ph and temperature conditions for pi release from extracellular pbp immobilized on an inert surface the results showed that pi adsorbed using immobilized pbp can be recovered nearly instantaneously using a high ph 12 5 wash the immobilized pbp maintained consistent pi adsorption capacity after 10 high ph wash cycles supporting its reusability as pbp structure is highly stable from ph 4 to 12 5 the pi release at high ph is most likely due to reversible deprotonation of amino acid residues at the active binding site the structural stability of pbp and consistent pi adsorption capacity after 10 high ph wash cycles also suggest that extracellular immobilized pbp could endure more than 10 repetitive cycles of neutral and high ph to promote adsorption and desorption respectively accordingly immobilized pbp appears to provide a strong foundation for an effective and reusable pi removal recovery adsorption system providing high affinity ultra low and ultra fast pi binding future investigations targeting optimization of the immobilized pbp system e g improvements in capacity linked to higher protein bead coupling efficiency and protein stability in actual water matrices are needed to further improve reusability and capacity and establish pbp as a viable pi recovery alternative additionally the application of immobilized pbp for pi recovery from real water wastewater and the specific influence of constituents such as natural organic matter microorganisms and enzymes must be directly assessed conflict of interest the authors report no conflict of

20026,peracetic acid paa is a sanitizer with increasing use in food medical and water treatment industries amino acids are important components in targeted foods for paa treatment and ubiquitous in natural waterbodies and wastewater effluents as the primary form of dissolved organic nitrogen to better understand the possible reactions this work investigated the reaction kinetics and transformation pathways of selected amino acids towards paa experimental results demonstrated that most amino acids showed sluggish reactivity to paa except cysteine cys methionine met and histidine his cys showed the highest reactivity with a very rapid reaction rate reactions of met and his with paa followed second order kinetics with rate constants of 4 6 0 2 and 1 8 0 1 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 respectively the reactions were faster at ph 5 and 7 than at ph 9 due to paa speciation low concentrations of h2o2 coexistent with paa contributed little to the oxidation of amino acids the primary oxidation products of amino acids with paa were o addition compounds on the reactive sites at thiol thioether and imidazole groups theoretical calculations were applied to predict the reactivity and regioselectivity of paa electrophilic attacks on amino acids and improved mechanistic understanding as an oxidative disinfectant the reaction of paa with organics to form byproducts is inevitable however this study shows that paa exhibits lower and more selective reactivity towards biomolecules such as amino acids than other common disinfectants causing less concern of toxic disinfection byproducts this attribute may allow greater stability and more targeted actions of paa in various applications graphical abstract image 1 keywords peracetic acid amino acids water treatment food

includes stability low cost and harmless disinfection byproducts dbps dell erba et al 2007 voukkali and zorpas 2015 thus as a disinfectant or sterilant paa has a wide application in various industries including water treatment food processing medical and textile kitis 2004 falsanisi et al 2006 a number of pilot or full scale trials of using paa as an alternative to chlorine for wastewater disinfection have been conducted in europe and north america veschetti et al 2003 koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005 gonzález et al 2012 eckert 2013 in the u s the environmental protection agency has authorized the use of paa in fruits vegetables and meat processing as well as in wastewater and storm water disinfection epa 1998 1999 2012 the traditional chlorine disinfection in water treatment and food production may cause the formation of various chlorinated dbps some of which are potentially carcinogenic fukayama et al 1986 since the increasing use of paa the possible reaction of organic matter with paa and formed byproducts have drawn great attention an earlier study reported that paa failed to degrade several target pharmaceuticals in wastewater at low doses hey et al 2012 on the other hand cai et al 2017 demonstrated that the combination of paa with uv could lead to rapid degradation of pharmaceuticals with investigation of involved reactive species zhang et al 2017 showed that paa alone could degrade several β lactam antibiotics in surface water and wastewater relatively quickly however the reaction rates were much slower in comparison to those with common oxidants such as o3 chlorine and fe vi meanwhile the detected transformation products of β lactams were mostly sulfoxide products instead of mineralized compounds indicating the modest oxidizing ability of paa in general the above studies were consistent with an early research that reported paa solution was virtually unaffected in the presence of organic matter rodgers et al 2004 amino acids are among the primary components of dissolved organic nitrogen in the aquatic environment they are ubiquitous in the environment at concentrations up to 10 g l 1 in surface waters trehy et al 1986 and higher in wastewaters amino acids are also widely found in meats fruits and vegetables in the form of proteins wu 2009 thus amino acids have a great chance to encounter disinfectants during water treatment or food processing the transformation of amino acids in chlorination processes has been well studied with corresponding aldehydes and nitriles as the primary byproducts as well as toxic chlorinated products such as dihaloacetonitriles and chloral hydrate trehy et al 1986 pattison and davies 2001 in contrast the potential reactions between amino acids and paa during water treatment remain unclear and have been scarcely investigated it is important to evaluate the transformation of amino acids and whether harmful byproducts are formed during paa reactions in order to improve the applications of paa in water treatment some previous studies indicated that the amino acid composition in blood meal or organic matter may change after paa treatment schnitzer and hindle 1980 kerkaert et al 2011 hicks et al 2015 schnitzer and hindle 1980 reported that paa treatment may decrease the amino acid n component in humic materials literature also suggested that oxidation by paa may result in increase of hydrophilicity of the proteins through crosslinking destruction whereas hypochlorous acid oxidation commonly results in protein aggregation kerkaert et al 2011 hicks et al 2015 extensive literature search indicates that there has been little information regarding the reaction kinetics and mechanism of the oxidation of amino acids by paa to date thus this study was motivated to address this knowledge gap the specific objectives of this work were to 1 determine the reactivities of a range of amino acids towards paa 2 assess the impact of background h2o2 and solution ph on the oxidation reaction of amino acids with paa and 3 elucidate the transformation products and reaction mechanism via product characterization and theoretical analysis of amino acids reactive sites all the

the h2o2 working solution was prepared at 11 mm all stock and working solutions were stored at 4 5 c before use 2 2 paa oxidation experiments paa oxidation experiments were conducted in 200 ml glass beakers with magnetic stirring at room temperature reaction solutions were maintained at desired ph using phosphate buffer 10 mm reactions were initiated by spiking an appropriate amount of paa or h2o2 working solution into the buffered solution containing 10 μm amino acids aliquots were periodically taken and injected into hplc vials containing an excess amount of sodium thiosulfate or sodium borohydride relative to the paa concentration the quenched samples were analyzed within 12 h after a derivatization process as described below the reactions with h2o2 were conducted similarly by adding an appropriate amount of h2o2 working solution to the buffered reaction solution containing 10 μm selected amino acids 2 3 analytical methods titration methods were applied to determine the concentrations of paa and h2o2 respectively in the paa stock solution as previously described cai et al 2017 iodometric titration was used to determine the combined concentration of paa and h2o2 and potassium permanganate titration under acidic ph was used to determine the h2o2 concentration in the stock the latter method was also used to determine the h2o2 concentration in pure h2o2 stock solution the lower concentrations of paa in the paa working solution and in the oxidation experiments were quantified by the standard n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd titration method apha et al 1998 as described previously cai et al 2017 the concentrations of residual amino acids in the reactions were determined using an agilent 1100 high performance liquid chromatography hplc equipped with a fluorescence detector after derivatization detailed in supporting information si text s1 monobromobimane mbbr was used as a derivatization reagent for cys determination while o phthalaldehyde opa was used for the other amino acids after derivatization 20 μl of sample was separated on an agilent zorbax sb c18 column 2 1 150 mm 5 μm with a flow rate of 0 3 ml min the mobile phase was a mixture of a sodium acetate buffer 5 mm at ph 5 9 and b acetonitrile the eluent composition changed linearly from initially 10 a to 50 at 7 min and then was so maintained for 3 min followed by re equilibration to the starting condition the excitation and emission wavelengths for fluorescence detection were set respectively at 395 and 475 nm for the mbbr derivatization method and 340 and 455 nm for the opa derivatization method the oxidation products of selected amino acids by paa were analyzed using an agilent 1100 series lc msd system equipped with an agilent zorbax sb c18 column 2 1 150

ramped to 90 at 10 min and maintained for 3 min and then re equilibrated to the starting condition the injection volume was 10 μl the mass spectrometer was set at negative electrospray ionization mode esi with a 70 v fragmentation voltage and 4000 v capillary voltage nitrogen was used both as the drying gas at 350 c 6 0 l min and nebulizer gas 25 psi a full scan mode from 50 to 500 m z was applied to examine the transformation products 2 4 computational method all calculations were performed using gaussian 03 software frisch et al 2003 geometry optimization calculations were executed without any constraints using the b3lyp method with 6 31g d p basis set hariharan and pople 1973 lee et al 1988 becke 1993 raghavachari 2000 condensed fukui function cff an important concept in conceptual density functional theory was computed based on natural population analysis npa charge to predict the regioselectivity of the oxidation of amino acids by paa parr and yang 1984 olah et al 2002 all of the above calculations were performed in the gas phase 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of paa reactivity to different amino acids to assess the possible reaction between amino acids and paa a total of nine essential amino acids which were widely detected in vegetables fruits and meats were selected to study their reactivity towards paa oxidation as shown in fig 1 most amino acids are sluggish to paa oxidation except cys met and his cys was completely oxidized by paa in 30 min suggesting its high reactivity towards paa oxidation the high reactivity of cys may be caused by its thiol group which could be easily oxidized to its disulfide form rs sr nakamoto and bardwell 2004 rehder and borges 2010 met and his were also observed with 25 transformation under the same condition this is consistent with an early study that reported the sulfur containing amino acids in meat would greatly decreased after paa treatment while most of the other amino acids showed little changes hicks et al 2015 unlike paa treatment chlorination was found with high reactivity towards all amino acids the presence of amino acids during chlorination processes may greatly reduce the disinfection efficiency and produce dbps such as trihalomethanes and halonitriles which may have adverse effects on human health na and olson 2007 on the basis that the amounts of his cys and met in fruits and vegetables are typically low brückner and westhauser 2003 and the low reactivities of other amino acids to paa paa oxidation probably will not change the organic composition of the treated food or wastewater significantly and much less byproducts would be formed in comparison with other common oxidants such as chlorine 3 2 reaction kinetics of selected amino acids with paa owing to their higher reactivity cys met and his were selected to further study their reaction kinetics with paa notably under the employed reaction conditions cys 0 10 μm paa 0 131 μm i e 10 ppm ph 7 0 cys was completely oxidized by paa within 1 min the reaction was too fast to quantify the rate constant using the batch reactor set up the reactions of met and his with paa were not as rapid and followed first order kinetics with respect to the amino acid concentration fig s2a in addition the pseudo first order rate constant k obs min 1 was found to increase linearly with paa concentration 131 1310 μm fig s2b hence the oxidation of amino acids by paa can be expressed by the second order kinetics see equations 2 and 3 with the apparent second order rate constant k app m 1 s 1 obtained by dividing the k obs value by the paa concentration 2 d amino acid d t k obs amino acid 3 d amino acid d t k app paa amino acid where k obs is the observed first order rate constant k app is the apparent second order rate constant for the overall reaction amino acid and paa are the concentration of amino acid and paa respectively the k app values for met and his with paa were determined to be 4 6 0 2 and 1 8 0 1 m 1 s 1 respectively to be noted the k app value for cys towards paa should be much larger at least greater than 5 8 102 m 1 s 1 which is near the upper limit that could be measured by the batch reaction set up in this study the difference in k app among amino acids towards paa is likely caused by the side chain groups which will be fully discussed later based on the products identification and reactive sites evaluation meanwhile table 1 indicates that the reaction rates of amino acids with other common oxidants are usually several orders of magnitude higher than those with paa this is similar to our earlier study that showed paa has a slower reaction rate towards β lactam antibiotics than other water treatment oxidants zhang et al 2017 as a promising disinfectant paa shows limited ability to degrade organic biomolecules and micropollutants this attribute may be beneficial for the further application of paa in various industries as paa will not be easily consumed by organic matter in water and will not generate chlorinated dbps or other harmful byproducts commonly formed from chlorine disinfection acero et al 2010 3 3 effect of h2o2 on oxidation of amino acids by paa h2o2 is an important component in commercial paa solutions however the role of h2o2 in the oxidation of amino acids by paa solutions is unknown in this work cys met and his were reacted with h2o2 only to study the impact of h2o2 on amino acids oxidation it was found that the concentration of background h2o2 about 33 μm in the paa solution was too low to cause any significant transformation of amino acids at ph 7 thus the concentration of h2o2 was increased to 131 μm the same as the paa concentration as some commercial paa solutions may have a lower paa h2o2 molar ratio shah et al 2015 in order to assess the reaction kinetics fig 2 shows that 131 μm of h2o2 could only oxidize 15 of cys 5 5 of met and 3 4 of his in 30 min meanwhile under the same concentration of paa paa could oxidize 100 65 and 28 of the amino acids respectively the second order rate constants of cys and met with h2o2 at ph 7 were about 5 7 10 1 and 8 9 10 2 m 1 s 1 respectively these kinetic results are comparable to the earlier research that have calculated the second order rate constants of cys and met in the oxidation by h2o2 to be around 2 7 10 1 m 1 s 1 ph 5 7 and 1 6 10 2 ph 5 5 6 0 respectively boonvisut et al 1982 chu et al 2016 evidently the oxidation of amino acids by h2o2 is much slower than that by paa indicating that paa is the primary oxidant in paa solution dominating the transformation of amino acids this finding is consistent with our previous study that it was paa not h2o2 that induced the oxidation reaction of β lactams and there was no obvious synergistic or inhibitory effect between paa and h2o2 zhang et al 2017 earlier literature also has concluded that the antimicrobial effect of paa is far greater than h2o2 lubello et al 2002 kitis 2004 thus in the applications of paa solutions it is mainly paa that is responsible for antibacterial and compound oxidation 3 4 effect of ph on paa oxidation of amino acids paa and amino acids are both ionizable compounds the primary species of paa and amino acids under different ph conditions may vary according to the acid dissociation constants which may cause different reaction behaviors in the oxidation of amino acids by paa as shown in fig 3 the pseudo first order rate constants of met and his by paa oxidation at ph 5 and 7 were comparable but decreased significantly at ph 9 the pka of paa is around 8 2 luukkonen and pehkonen 2017 and the acid base dissociation could result in varied distribution of neutral paah and charged paa species according to the speciation neutral paah is dominant over 94 at ph 5 and 7 while anionic paa becomes dominant over 89 at ph 9 speciation of amino acids may be another factor for met and his the acidity constants of the carboxylic acid group on the α carbon are 2 28 and 1 82 and the acidity constants of the protonated α amino group are 9 21 and 9 17 respectively his has an additional acidity constant for its imidazole ring nh at 6 00 linde 1991 the species distributions of paa met and his at ph 5 7 and 9 are depicted in table s1 and fig s3 from ph 5 to 7 the amount 99 9 92 1 of paah changed little and could explain why the rate constants were comparable at ph 5 and 7 as it was paah having the strong oxidizing ability rather than paa zhang et al 2017 at ph 9 the lower distribution 10 4 of paah could lead to the lower rate constants for oxidation of amino acids for amino acids speciation met had the same neutral zwitterion species dominant at ph 5 and 7 while his s imidazole nh group changed from being protonated to non protonated from ph 5 to 7 fig s3 the very similar rate constants of his at ph 5 and 7 suggest that the impact of his species on his oxidation by paah was negligible thus it can be concluded that the rate constants for paa oxidation are lower at alkaline solution due to the lower distribution of paah species while the speciation of the targeted amino acids have much less influence on the reaction rate 3 5 reaction products and pathways the transformation products of cys met and his by paa oxidation were assessed and the results are presented in table 2 with proposed transformation pathways in fig 4 the ms results showed that disulfide cys dimer sulfinic acid cyso2h and sulfonic acid cyso3h were the three major products of oxidation of cys by paa the formation of cysoh was not detected which was likely due to its high instability penn et al 1978 the above compounds are well known cys oxidation products 2m 1 m 16 m 32 and m 48 where m molecular weight of parent cys under various conditions because of the reactive thiol functional group milne and zika 1993 greer et al 1996 hawkins and davies 2001 mailloux et al 2014 in this study paa likely attacks the highly nucleophilic thiol group which may result in formation of cysoh compounds with the soh group were found to be extremely difficult to detect and quantify due to the much lower pka than that of the sh group enami et al 2009 hugo et al 2009 mcgrath et al 2010 cysoh may couple with another cys to form the cys dimer through intermolecular disulfide bridging cysoh can also undergo further oxidation to generate cyso2h and cyso3h fig 4a ion chromatography was employed to determine whether oxidation of cys by paa could generate small ions the results suggested that cyso3h was the final product as only a new peak of cyso3 emerged at 12 9 min while no so4 2 standard r t 11 2 min or other small organic carboxylic acids were detected fig s4 this is rather different from other chemical oxidants such as o3 or hclo which were able to break bonds and finally form ions including aliphatic acids so4 2 and or no3 mudd et al 1969 wenk et al 2013 the reaction pathway for met oxidation by paa is rather simple that met was expected to be oxidized to generate the m 16 intermediate i e met sulfoxide fig 4b previous research also observed met sulfoxide as the primary product during oxidation of met by h2o2 keck 1996 met sulfoxide is believed to contribute to biological aging as it increases with age in body tissues oxidation of met may cause the accumulation of damaged nonfunctional proteins shringarpure and davies 2002 stadtman et al 2005 the m 32 m z 186 is the predominant intermediate based on peak area of his oxidation by paa while the dimeric product m z 323 may be formed via nucleophilic addition of m z 186 by another his at the c9 site followed by loss of a water fig 4c similar reaction products were also detected in the oxidation of his by 1o2 oh or in other oxidation systems tomita et al 1969 agon et al 2006 amano et al 2014 liu et al 2014 based on the results above it can be concluded that paa is a weak oxidant that the corresponding oxidation products are mostly substrates with one or more o addition which is consistent with previous observations zhang et al 2017 the thiol group of cys was oxidized to sulfinic and sulfonic acids as well as to generate cys dimers the thioether sulfur of met is oxidized to sulfoxide by paa o addition on the imidazole ring was also demonstrated to be the primary reaction pathway for his oxidation by paa moreover paa appears to be only reactive to organics with specific functional groups such as thiol thioether sulfur as well as specific groups with high electron distribution 3 6 theoretical prediction of reactive sites on selected amino acids paa is a well known electrophilic oxidant as the molecular orbitals shown in fig s5 well demonstrates the electron deficient property around the peroxyl group of paa according to the products identified and general oxidation reaction mechanism paa is likely to accept electrons from amino acids and give out an oxygen atom the condensed fukui function cff commonly used in prediction of reactive sites of electrophilic nucleophilic and radical attacks parr and yang 1984 was used to predict the reactive sites on selected amino acids towards paa attacks the detailed description for the cff concept and the calculation method are presented in text s2 as presented in fig 5 the ability of losing electron was quantified and visualized on every site of amino acids by the calculated fukui index f k the f k on sulfur atom in cys and met is much higher than that on the other sites suggesting the strong affinity of sulfur containing organics towards paa oxidation which is in accordance with the fact that most of the known organic compounds that react fast with paa are those with sulfur atom s chipiso et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 moreover the corresponding products are mostly sulfoxides and other following products meanwhile the f k distribution on his molecule is less differential with values of 0 103 0 095 0 116 and 0 148 at c1 c5 c7 and c9 respectively thus the oxygen atom from paa likely prefers addition onto c9 or c7 of his as we proposed in fig 4c then the o addition intermediate coupled with another his molecule and formed a dimer product based on the products identified and theoretical calculations we proposed that the sites with higher cff values are more likely to be attacked by paa forming corresponding o addition products and other derivatives since the paa induced direct oxidation was considered to be electrophilic attacks the reactivity of amino acids towards paa oxidation is likely related to their nucleophilicities thus for the comparison of different amino acids the nucleophilicity index was used which measures the energy stabilization when an optimal electronic charge transfer from the system to the environment occurs de vleeschouwer et al 2007 to describe the nucleophilic character of a reactive site within a molecule a local nucleophilicity index n k can be proposed 4 n k n f k where n is the global nucleophilic index which is calculated based on the electronic chemical potential μ and chemical hardness η see si text s3 and f k displays its maximum value i e at the active site k of the nucleophile note that the local nucleophilicity index contains a global contribution n as a factor of the genuine local nucleophilic index f k table 3 summarizes the values of electrostatic descriptors including the global and local nucleophilicity indexes for 12 amino acids cys shows the s5 sulfur atom as the preferential site for electrophilic attack on the basis of the fukui function f k 0 439 and the local nucleophilicity n k 0 850 ev met presents a local nucleophilicity value of n k 0 768 ev at sulfur atom s6 note that his having multiple reactive sites due to the close fukui function values at c7 and c9 presents a local nucleophilicity value of n k 0 653 ev with the sum of two reactive sites the local nucleophilicity index of cys met and his are much higher than those of the other amino acids suggesting that they are easier to undergo electrophilic attacks on the specific sites this is consistent with our experimental results that cys met and his were oxidized more easily than the other amino acids by paa fig 1 moreover the n k values of three more amino acids leucine leu threonine thr and tryptophan trp with typical alkyl hydroxyl and indole side chains were also calculated and their reactivities towards paa oxidation can thus be predicted the results in table 3 indicate that leu and thr may show less reactivity while trp could be a potential substrate for paa oxidation due to its side chain indole according to our work and published literature compounds containing sulfur atoms or rings with nitrogen atoms are always found to be highly nucleophilic and more likely to undergo paa oxidation chipiso et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 however descriptor n k could only qualitatively predict the reactivities of amino acids and more parameters and factors should be considered to establish a better model 4 conclusions this work demonstrates that paa has low reactivity with amino acids except those with reactive side chains including thiol group cys thioether group met and imidazole ring his the background h2o2 in the paa solution has a negligible effect on the reactions of amino acids with paa paa oxidation of met and his is much slower at ph 9 than at ph 5 and 7 due to the speciation of paa the combined results from experimental measurements and theoretical calculations show that paa is prone to attack amino acids with strong nucleophilicity delivering o to the electron rich sites overall it can be concluded that the widely used paa solution is much less reactive towards organics than other common disinfectants thus resulting in longer stability and fewer byproducts formation moreover paa treatment primarily generates o addition products which are less harmful compared to other dbps of concerns commonly found with disinfection oxidants such as chlorine from the perspective of disinfectant stability and dbps formation the results of this study suggest that paa is a more stable and safer oxidant which could be suitable in food processing wastewater treatment as well as other industries in the future conflict of interest the

including water treatment food processing medical and textile kitis 2004 falsanisi et al 2006 a number of pilot or full scale trials of using paa as an alternative to chlorine for wastewater disinfection have been conducted in europe and north america veschetti et al 2003 koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005 gonzález et al 2012 eckert 2013 in the u s the environmental protection agency has authorized the use of paa in fruits vegetables and meat processing as well as in wastewater and storm water disinfection epa 1998 1999 2012 the traditional chlorine disinfection in water treatment and food production may cause the formation of various chlorinated dbps some of which are potentially carcinogenic fukayama et al 1986 since the increasing use of paa the possible reaction of organic matter with paa and formed byproducts have drawn great attention an earlier study reported that paa failed to degrade several target pharmaceuticals in wastewater at low doses hey et al 2012 on the other hand cai et al 2017 demonstrated that the combination of paa with uv could lead to rapid degradation of pharmaceuticals with investigation of involved reactive species zhang et al 2017 showed that paa alone could degrade several β lactam antibiotics in surface water and wastewater relatively quickly however the reaction rates were much slower in comparison to those with common oxidants such as o3 chlorine and fe vi meanwhile the detected transformation products of β lactams were mostly sulfoxide products instead of mineralized compounds indicating the modest oxidizing ability of paa in general the above studies were consistent with an early research that reported paa solution was virtually unaffected in the presence of organic matter rodgers et al 2004 amino acids are among the primary components of dissolved organic nitrogen in the aquatic environment they are ubiquitous in the environment at concentrations up to 10 g l 1 in surface waters trehy et al 1986 and higher in wastewaters amino acids are also widely found in meats fruits and vegetables in the form of proteins wu 2009 thus amino acids have a great chance to encounter disinfectants during water treatment or food processing the transformation of amino acids in chlorination processes has been well studied with corresponding aldehydes and nitriles as the primary byproducts as well as toxic chlorinated products such as dihaloacetonitriles and chloral hydrate trehy et al 1986 pattison and davies 2001 in contrast the potential reactions between amino acids and paa during water treatment remain unclear and have been scarcely investigated it is important to evaluate the transformation of amino acids and whether harmful byproducts are formed during paa reactions in order to improve the applications of paa in water treatment some previous studies indicated that the amino acid composition in blood meal or organic matter may change after paa treatment schnitzer and hindle 1980 kerkaert et al 2011 hicks et al 2015 schnitzer and hindle 1980 reported that paa treatment may decrease the amino acid n component in humic materials literature also suggested that oxidation by paa may result in increase of hydrophilicity of the proteins through crosslinking destruction whereas hypochlorous acid oxidation commonly results in protein aggregation kerkaert et al 2011 hicks et al 2015 extensive literature search indicates that there has been little information regarding the reaction kinetics and mechanism of the oxidation of amino acids by paa to date thus this study was motivated to address this knowledge gap the specific objectives of this work were to 1 determine the reactivities of a range of amino acids towards paa 2 assess the impact of background h2o2 and solution ph on the oxidation reaction of amino acids with paa and 3 elucidate the transformation products and reaction mechanism via product characterization and theoretical analysis of amino acids reactive sites all the experiments were conducted using paa dosage and ph conditions relevant to those common in wastewater treatment or food processing with paa applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals analytical

dihydrogen phosphate disodium hydrogen phosphate sodium thiosulfate and sodium borohydride were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa hydrogen peroxide solution 30 h2o2 in water w w was purchased from fisher scientific waltham ma usa reagent grade deionized water 18 mω cm was generated from a milli q integral water purification system millipore billerica ma usa and used to prepare working solutions the working solution of each amino acid at 10 mm was freshly prepared and used within 24 h fresh paa working solutions at 100 mm were prepared every week by diluting the paa stock the h2o2 working solution was prepared at 11 mm all stock and working solutions were stored at 4 5 c before use 2 2 paa oxidation experiments paa oxidation experiments were conducted in 200 ml glass beakers with magnetic stirring at room temperature reaction solutions were maintained at desired ph using phosphate buffer 10 mm reactions were initiated by spiking an appropriate amount of paa or h2o2 working solution into the buffered solution containing 10 μm amino acids aliquots were periodically taken and injected into hplc vials containing an excess amount of sodium thiosulfate or sodium borohydride relative to the paa concentration the quenched samples were analyzed within 12 h after a derivatization process as described below the reactions with h2o2 were conducted similarly by adding an appropriate amount of h2o2 working solution to the buffered reaction solution containing 10 μm selected amino acids 2 3 analytical methods titration methods were applied to determine the concentrations of paa and h2o2 respectively in the paa stock solution as previously described cai et al 2017 iodometric titration was used to determine the combined concentration of paa and h2o2 and potassium permanganate titration under acidic ph was used to determine the h2o2 concentration in the stock the latter method was also used to determine the h2o2 concentration in pure h2o2 stock solution the lower concentrations of paa in the paa working solution and in the oxidation experiments were quantified by the standard n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd titration method apha et al 1998 as described previously cai et al 2017 the concentrations of residual amino acids in the reactions were determined using an agilent 1100 high performance liquid chromatography hplc equipped with a fluorescence detector after derivatization detailed in supporting information si text s1 monobromobimane mbbr was used as a derivatization reagent for cys determination while o phthalaldehyde opa was used for the other amino acids after derivatization 20 μl of sample was separated on an agilent zorbax sb c18 column 2 1 150 mm 5 μm with a flow rate of 0 3 ml min the mobile phase was a mixture of a sodium acetate buffer 5 mm at ph 5 9 and b acetonitrile the eluent composition changed linearly from initially 10 a to 50 at 7 min and then was so maintained for 3 min followed by re equilibration to the starting condition the excitation and emission wavelengths for fluorescence detection were set respectively at 395 and 475 nm for the mbbr derivatization method and 340 and 455 nm for the opa derivatization method the oxidation products of selected amino acids by paa were analyzed using an agilent 1100 series lc msd system equipped with an agilent zorbax sb c18 column 2 1 150 mm 5 μm with a flow rate at 0 3 ml min the mobile phase consisted of a deionized water with formic acid 0 1 v v and b methanol the gradient of the mobile phase b was kept at 5 in the first 5 min then ramped to 90 at 10 min and maintained for 3 min and then re equilibrated to the starting condition the injection volume was 10 μl the mass spectrometer was set at negative electrospray ionization mode esi with a 70 v fragmentation voltage and 4000 v capillary voltage nitrogen was used both as the drying gas at 350 c 6 0 l min and nebulizer gas 25 psi a full scan mode from 50 to 500 m z was applied to examine the transformation products 2 4 computational method all calculations were performed using gaussian 03 software frisch et al 2003 geometry optimization calculations were executed without any constraints using the b3lyp method with 6 31g d p basis set hariharan and pople 1973 lee et al 1988 becke 1993 raghavachari 2000 condensed fukui function cff an important concept in conceptual density functional theory was computed based on natural population analysis npa charge to predict the regioselectivity of the oxidation of amino acids by paa parr and yang 1984 olah et al 2002 all of the above calculations were performed in the gas phase 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of paa reactivity to different amino acids to assess the possible reaction between amino acids and paa a total of nine essential amino acids which were widely detected in vegetables fruits and meats were selected to study their reactivity towards paa oxidation as shown in fig 1 most amino acids are sluggish to paa oxidation except cys met and his cys was completely oxidized by paa in 30 min suggesting its high reactivity towards paa oxidation the high reactivity of cys may be caused by its thiol group which could be easily oxidized to its disulfide form rs sr nakamoto and bardwell 2004 rehder and borges 2010 met and his were also observed with 25 transformation under the same condition this is consistent with an early study that reported the sulfur containing amino acids in meat would greatly decreased after paa treatment while most of the other amino acids showed little changes hicks et al 2015 unlike paa treatment chlorination was found with high reactivity towards all amino acids the presence of amino acids during chlorination processes may greatly reduce the disinfection efficiency and produce dbps such as trihalomethanes and halonitriles which may have adverse effects on human health na and olson 2007 on the basis that the amounts of his cys and met in fruits and vegetables are typically low brückner and westhauser 2003 and the low reactivities of other amino acids to paa paa oxidation probably will not change the organic composition of the treated food or wastewater significantly and much less byproducts would be formed in comparison with other common oxidants such as chlorine 3 2 reaction kinetics of selected amino acids with paa owing to their higher reactivity cys met and his were selected to further study their reaction kinetics with paa notably under the employed reaction conditions cys 0 10 μm paa 0 131 μm i e 10 ppm ph 7 0 cys was completely oxidized by paa within 1 min the reaction was too fast to quantify the rate constant using the batch reactor set up the reactions of met and his with paa were not as rapid and followed first order kinetics with respect to the amino acid concentration fig s2a in addition the pseudo first order rate constant k obs min 1 was found to increase linearly with paa concentration 131 1310 μm fig s2b hence the oxidation of amino acids by paa can be expressed by the second order kinetics see equations 2 and 3 with the apparent second order rate constant k app m 1 s 1 obtained by dividing the k obs value by the paa concentration 2 d amino acid d t k obs amino acid 3 d amino acid d t k app paa amino acid where k obs is the observed first order rate constant k app is the apparent second order rate constant for the overall reaction amino acid and paa are the concentration of amino acid and paa respectively the k app values for met and his with paa were determined to be 4 6 0 2 and 1 8 0 1 m 1 s 1 respectively to be noted the k app value for cys towards paa should be much larger at least greater than 5 8 102 m 1 s 1 which is near the upper limit that could be measured by the batch reaction set up in this study the difference in k app among amino acids towards paa is likely caused by the side chain groups which will be fully discussed later based on the products identification and reactive sites evaluation meanwhile table 1 indicates that the reaction rates of amino acids with other common oxidants are usually several orders of magnitude higher than those with paa this is similar to our earlier study that showed paa has a slower reaction rate towards β lactam antibiotics than other water treatment oxidants zhang et al 2017 as a promising disinfectant paa shows limited ability to degrade organic biomolecules and micropollutants this attribute may be beneficial for the further application of paa in various industries as paa will not be easily consumed by organic matter in water and will not generate chlorinated dbps or other harmful byproducts commonly formed from chlorine disinfection acero et al 2010 3 3 effect of h2o2 on oxidation of amino acids by paa h2o2 is an important component in commercial paa solutions however the role of h2o2 in the oxidation of amino acids by paa solutions is unknown in this work cys met and his were reacted with h2o2 only to study the impact of h2o2 on amino acids oxidation it was found that the concentration of background h2o2 about 33 μm in the paa solution was too low to cause any significant transformation of amino acids at ph 7 thus the concentration of h2o2 was increased to 131 μm the same as the paa concentration as some commercial paa solutions may have a lower paa h2o2 molar ratio shah et al 2015 in order to assess the reaction kinetics fig 2 shows that 131 μm of h2o2 could only oxidize 15 of cys 5 5 of met and 3 4 of his in 30 min meanwhile under the same concentration of paa paa could oxidize 100 65 and 28 of the amino acids respectively the second order rate constants of cys and met with h2o2 at ph 7 were about 5 7 10 1 and 8 9 10 2 m 1 s 1 respectively these kinetic results are comparable to the earlier research that have calculated the second order rate constants of cys and met in the oxidation by h2o2 to be around 2 7 10 1 m 1 s 1 ph 5 7 and 1 6 10 2 ph 5 5 6 0 respectively boonvisut et al 1982 chu et al 2016 evidently the oxidation of amino acids by h2o2 is much slower than that by paa indicating that paa is the primary oxidant in paa solution dominating the transformation of amino acids this finding is consistent with our previous study that it was paa not h2o2 that induced the oxidation reaction of β lactams and there was no obvious synergistic or inhibitory effect between paa and h2o2 zhang et al 2017 earlier literature also has concluded that the antimicrobial effect of paa is far greater than h2o2 lubello et al 2002 kitis 2004 thus in the applications of paa solutions it is mainly paa that is responsible for antibacterial and compound oxidation 3 4 effect of ph on paa oxidation of amino acids paa and amino acids are both ionizable compounds the primary species of paa and amino acids under different ph conditions may vary according to the acid dissociation constants which may cause different reaction behaviors in the oxidation of amino acids by paa as shown in fig 3 the pseudo first order rate constants of met and his by paa oxidation at ph 5 and 7 were comparable but decreased significantly at ph 9 the pka of paa is around 8 2 luukkonen and pehkonen 2017 and the acid base dissociation could result in varied distribution of neutral paah and charged paa species according to the speciation neutral paah is dominant over 94 at ph 5 and 7 while anionic paa becomes dominant over 89 at ph 9 speciation of amino acids may be another factor for met and his the acidity constants of the carboxylic acid group on the α carbon are 2 28 and 1 82 and the acidity constants of the protonated α amino group are 9 21 and 9 17 respectively his has an additional acidity constant for its imidazole ring nh at 6 00 linde 1991 the species distributions of paa met and his at ph 5 7 and 9 are depicted in table s1 and fig s3 from ph 5 to 7 the amount 99 9 92 1 of paah changed little and could explain why the rate constants were comparable at ph 5 and 7 as it was paah having the strong oxidizing ability rather than paa zhang et al 2017 at ph 9 the lower distribution 10 4 of paah could lead to the lower rate constants for oxidation of amino acids for amino acids speciation met had the same neutral zwitterion species dominant at ph 5 and 7 while his s imidazole nh group changed from being protonated to non protonated from ph 5 to 7 fig s3 the very similar rate constants of his at ph 5 and 7 suggest that the impact of his species on his oxidation by paah was negligible thus it can be concluded that the rate constants for paa oxidation are lower at alkaline solution due to the lower distribution of paah species while the speciation of the targeted amino acids have much less influence on the reaction rate 3 5 reaction products and pathways the transformation products of cys met and his by paa oxidation were assessed and the results are presented in table 2 with proposed transformation pathways in fig 4 the ms results showed that disulfide cys dimer sulfinic acid cyso2h and sulfonic acid cyso3h were the three major products of oxidation of cys by paa the formation of cysoh was not detected which was likely due to its high instability penn et al 1978 the above compounds are well known cys oxidation products 2m 1 m 16 m 32 and m 48 where m molecular weight of parent cys under various conditions because of the reactive thiol functional group milne and zika 1993 greer et al 1996 hawkins and davies 2001 mailloux et al 2014 in this study paa likely attacks the highly nucleophilic thiol group which may result in formation of cysoh compounds with the soh group were found to be extremely difficult to detect and quantify due to the much lower pka than that of the sh group enami et al 2009 hugo et al 2009 mcgrath et al 2010 cysoh may couple with another cys to form the cys dimer through intermolecular disulfide bridging cysoh can also undergo further oxidation to generate cyso2h and cyso3h fig 4a ion chromatography was employed to determine whether oxidation of cys by paa could generate small ions the results suggested that cyso3h was the final product as only a new peak of cyso3 emerged at 12 9 min while no so4 2 standard r t 11 2 min or other small organic carboxylic acids were detected fig s4 this is rather different from other chemical oxidants such as o3 or hclo which were able to break bonds and finally form ions including aliphatic acids so4 2 and or no3 mudd et al 1969 wenk et al 2013 the reaction pathway for met oxidation by paa is rather simple that met was expected to be oxidized to generate the m 16 intermediate i e met sulfoxide fig 4b previous research also observed met sulfoxide as the primary product during oxidation of met by h2o2 keck 1996 met sulfoxide is believed to contribute to biological aging as it increases with age in body tissues oxidation of met may cause the accumulation of damaged nonfunctional proteins shringarpure and davies 2002 stadtman et al 2005 the m 32 m z 186 is the predominant intermediate based on peak area of his oxidation by paa while the dimeric product m z 323 may be formed via nucleophilic addition of m z 186 by another his at the c9 site followed by loss of a water fig 4c similar reaction products were also detected in the oxidation of his by 1o2 oh or in other oxidation systems tomita et al 1969 agon et al 2006 amano et al 2014 liu et al 2014 based on the results above it can be concluded that paa is a weak oxidant that the corresponding oxidation products are mostly substrates with one or more o addition which is consistent with previous observations zhang et al 2017 the thiol group of cys was oxidized to sulfinic and sulfonic acids as well as to generate cys dimers the thioether sulfur of met is oxidized to sulfoxide by paa o addition on the imidazole ring was also demonstrated to be the primary reaction pathway for his oxidation by paa moreover paa appears to be only reactive to organics with specific functional groups such as thiol thioether sulfur as well as specific groups with high electron distribution 3 6 theoretical prediction of reactive sites on selected amino acids paa is a well known electrophilic oxidant as the molecular orbitals shown in fig s5 well demonstrates the electron deficient property around the peroxyl group of paa according to the products identified and general oxidation reaction mechanism paa is likely to accept electrons from amino acids and give out an oxygen atom the condensed fukui function cff commonly used in prediction of reactive sites of electrophilic nucleophilic and radical attacks parr and yang 1984 was used to predict the reactive sites on selected amino acids towards paa attacks the detailed description for the cff concept and the calculation method are presented in text s2 as presented in fig 5 the ability of losing electron was quantified and visualized on every site of amino acids by the calculated fukui index f k the f k on sulfur atom in cys and met is much higher than that on the other sites suggesting the strong affinity of sulfur containing organics towards paa oxidation which is in accordance with the fact that most of the known organic compounds that react fast with paa are those with sulfur atom s chipiso et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 moreover the corresponding products are mostly sulfoxides and other following products meanwhile the f k distribution on his molecule is less differential with values of 0 103 0 095 0 116 and 0 148 at c1 c5 c7 and c9 respectively thus the oxygen atom from paa likely prefers addition onto c9 or c7 of his as we proposed in fig 4c then the o addition intermediate coupled with another his molecule and formed a dimer product based on the products identified and theoretical calculations we proposed that the sites with higher cff values are more likely to be attacked by paa forming corresponding o addition products and other derivatives since the paa induced direct oxidation was considered to be electrophilic attacks the reactivity of amino acids towards paa oxidation is likely related to their nucleophilicities thus for the comparison of different amino acids the nucleophilicity index was used which measures the energy stabilization when an optimal electronic charge transfer from the system to the environment occurs de vleeschouwer et al 2007 to describe the nucleophilic character of a reactive site within a molecule a local nucleophilicity index n k can be proposed 4 n k n f k where n is the global nucleophilic index which is calculated based on the electronic chemical potential μ and chemical hardness η see si text s3 and f k displays its maximum value i e at the active site k of the nucleophile note that the local nucleophilicity index contains a global contribution n as a factor of the genuine local nucleophilic index f k table 3 summarizes the values of electrostatic descriptors including the global and local nucleophilicity indexes for 12 amino acids cys shows the s5 sulfur atom as the preferential site for electrophilic attack on the basis of the fukui function f k 0 439 and the local nucleophilicity n k 0 850 ev met presents a local nucleophilicity value of n k 0 768 ev at sulfur atom s6 note that his having multiple reactive sites due to the close fukui function values at c7 and c9 presents a local nucleophilicity value of n k 0 653 ev with the sum of two reactive sites the local nucleophilicity index of cys met and his are much higher than those of the other amino acids suggesting that they are easier to undergo electrophilic attacks on the specific sites this is consistent with our experimental results that cys met and his were oxidized more easily than the other amino acids by paa fig 1 moreover the n k values of three more amino acids leucine leu threonine thr and tryptophan trp with typical alkyl hydroxyl and indole side chains were also calculated and their reactivities towards paa oxidation can thus be predicted the results in table 3 indicate that leu and thr may show less reactivity while trp could be a potential substrate for paa oxidation due to its side chain indole according to our work and published literature compounds containing sulfur atoms or rings with nitrogen atoms are always found to be highly nucleophilic and more likely to undergo paa oxidation chipiso et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 however descriptor n k could only qualitatively predict the reactivities of amino acids and more parameters and factors should be considered to establish a better model 4 conclusions this work demonstrates that paa has low reactivity with amino acids except those with reactive side chains including thiol group cys thioether group met and imidazole ring his the background h2o2 in the paa solution has a negligible effect on the reactions of amino acids with paa paa oxidation of met and his is much slower at ph 9 than at ph 5 and 7 due to the speciation of paa the combined results from experimental measurements and theoretical calculations show that paa is prone to attack amino acids with strong nucleophilicity delivering o to the electron rich sites overall it can be concluded that the widely used paa solution is much less reactive towards organics than other common disinfectants thus resulting in longer stability and fewer byproducts formation moreover paa treatment primarily generates o addition products which are less harmful compared to other dbps of concerns commonly found with disinfection oxidants such as chlorine from the perspective of disinfectant stability and dbps formation the results of this study suggest that paa is a more stable and safer oxidant which could be suitable in food processing wastewater treatment as well as other industries in the future conflict of interest the

polysaccharides alkaline solutions such as sodium hydroxide naoh remove organic fouling and biofouling by hydrolysis and solubilization whereas acidic solutions such as hydrochloric acid hcl dissolve

fully restore membrane performance beyer et al 2014 huiting et al 2001 vrouwenvelder et al 1998 a recent study examining chemical cleaning in three full scale ro plants in the netherlands underlined the need for novel cleaning approaches as none of the standard cleaning chemicals resulted in highly effective membrane regeneration beyer et al 2017 moreover rapid biofilm regrowth is observed

spacer and membranes in each mfs was quantified and characterized at the end of operation 2 2 preliminary assessment of urea cleaning studies were carried out to investigate i whether ro polyamide membranes can withstand high urea concentrations and ii the effect of urea concentration and temperature on biofilm solubilization for all preliminary tests membrane and spacer sheets with pre grown biofilm obtained using the mfs set up described above were used first the compatibility of urea with ro polyamide membranes was evaluated using the congo red dye test u s d i 1996 this test can detect membrane damage as the congo red dye does not attach to the intact polyamide layer of the membrane but is absorbed by the porous supporting layer of the membrane resulting in an intense color on the membrane surface where the membrane is damaged fouled membrane coupons were submerged in urea solutions at concentrations ranging from 294 to 756 g lwater for two weeks after urea treatment membrane coupons were rinsed with milliq water and air dried a solution of congo red dye 1 w w was swabbed on the membrane surface and damages were visually assessed the membrane coupons were compared to a damaged membrane positive control and to an intact virgin membrane negative control the damaged membrane was prepared by 24 h of continuous stirring of the membrane coupon with a magnetic stirrer the influence of urea solution concentration and temperature on biofilm solubilization was examined the fouled membranes and spacers were cut into 10 pieces of 8 cm2 each and incubated for 24 h in centrifuge tubes containing 20 ml of urea solution at varying concentrations 294 1147 g lwater and at a constant temperature of 23 c to eliminate the effect of heat similarly membrane and spacer coupons were incubated for 24 h at varying temperatures 23 80 c at a constant urea concentration of 1147 g lwater incubation was performed in a thermostatic bath without stirring as negative controls fouled membrane and spacer coupons were immersed in milliq water after 24 h membrane and spacer coupons were taken out of the solution and rinsed by successive immersions in beakers of milliq water to remove the residual urea the remaining biomass on the membrane and spacer coupons was measured using the chemical oxygen demand cod kits from hach lck314 and lck114 with a lange ht200s thermostat and lange dr3900 spectrophotometer 2 3 mfs chemical cleaning studies laboratory scale studies were carried out in order to evaluate the efficiency of urea as a chemical cleaning agent for biofilm solubilization compared to the conventional acid alkali treatment accelerated biofilm development was carried out in membrane fouling simulators using the experimental set up and operating conditions described in section 2 1 four mfss containing the same brackish water reverse osmosis bwro membrane and feed spacers 34 mil were operated simultaneously until the pressure drop reached a threshold value of 200 mbar in 5 6 days which is the average duration of accelerated biofouling studies with mfss subsequently the flow cells were cleaned according to a predetermined cleaning protocol table 2 the temperature of the cleaning solutions naoh and co nh2 2 was kept at 35 c as this temperature is applied for enhanced flux recovery in practice madaeni and samieirad 2010 the applied concentration of urea 1340 g lwater is the saturated concentration at 30 c to ensure that urea remains in solution at 35 c this concentration of urea also did not damage the polyamide membrane as it was tested on membrane modules in pilot scale and no increase in salt passage was observed the ph of the cleaning solutions was also within the operating range ph 1 12 of polyamide membranes kucera 2011 bioreagent grade 98 urea acs reagent 37 hcl and reagent grade 98 naoh were purchased from sigma aldrich each chemical cleaning agent 1l was recirculated at the feed side of the mfs for 1 h at the same flow rate as the feed water 17 0 l h a membrane filter 10 μm pore size was placed between the outlet of the mfs and the dosing pump to avoid the recirculation of detached biofilm particles back to the mfs in between and after each cleaning the mfss were rinsed with feed water for 5 min to displace the previous cleaning solution feed channel pressure drop development was monitored throughout the duration of the experiment including the chemical cleaning phases membrane autopsies were subsequently carried out on retrieved membrane and feed spacer coupons for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the fouling deposits membrane and spacer coupons were cut from the inlet side of the mfs using sterile scissors and tweezers the coupon dimensions were measured with calipers so that the results can be reported per area of the combined membrane and spacer surface the extent and composition of the fouling layer was assessed using various analytical procedures described below all experiments were run in duplicates and the figures show the average and standard deviation from the two runs 2 4 biomass analysis adenosine triphosphate atp analysis was used for biomass quantification atp is present in all metabolically active microorganisms thus atp analysis can be used to measure the viable biomass content it is a generally accepted parameter for diagnosis of biofouling hijnen et al 2011 vrouwenvelder et al 2008 the biomass detachment and quantification method has been described previously sanawar et al 2017 a well established eps extraction procedure was adapted liu and fang 2002 biomass removed from membrane and feed spacer coupons was suspended in 10 ml of phosphate buffered saline pbs solution the samples were treated with 0 06 ml formaldehyde at 4 c for 1 h and incubated with 4 ml 1m naoh at 4 c for 3 h after centrifuging the samples for 20 min at 20000 g the supernatant was filtered through a 0 2 μm pore size membrane filter and purified using a 3500 da dialysis membrane for 24 h the dialyzed samples were lyophilized 50 c 48 h fluorescence excitation emission matrix feem was used to identify the predominant organics in the extracted eps such as protein like substances humic fulvic like substances and others chen et al 2003b valladares linares et al 2012 feem was measured using a fluoromax 4 spectrofluorometer horiba scientific japan under excitation of 240 450 nm and emission of 290 600 nm at a speed of 1500 nm min 1 a voltage of 700 v and a response time of 2 s carbohydrate and protein components of the extracted eps were quantified carbohydrates were quantified using the standard sulfuric acid phenol method masuko et al 2005 which involves mixing 200 μl of the extracted eps with 600 μl sulfuric acid and 120 μl of 5 phenol in a centrifuge tube the samples were incubated for 5 min at 90 c in a dry block heater and cooled down to room temperature for 5 min an aliquot of 200 μl of the sample was then transferred to a microplate and the absorbance at 490 nm was measured using a spectra a max 340pc microplate reader molecular devices usa proteins were quantified using the bca assay kit thermo scientific usa according to manufacturer s guidelines 2 5 statistical evaluation averages and standard deviations were calculated for each of the duplicate sets of experiment and a two tailed student s t test was used for statistical comparisons the standard deviation between duplicate experiments is represented by error bars in the graphs the variance in the sample means is denoted by a single asterisk if there is a significant difference p 0 05 and by ns if there is no significant difference p 0 05 3 results 3 1 membrane resistance to urea in order to determine whether urea has a damaging effect on ro polyamide membranes congo red dye was applied to membrane coupons which had been submerged in 294 756 g lwater urea solutions for 2 weeks no absorption of the dye was visible on the treated membrane surface contrary to the degraded membrane control confirming that urea did not damage the polyamide layer of the membrane in a separate study no increase in salt passage was observed when full scale ro membrane modules were cleaned with saturated urea solution 1340 g lwater reiterating the compatibility of urea with the membrane 3 2 impact of urea concentration and temperature on biofilm solubilization cod analysis revealed that urea cleaning efficiency was enhanced with increasing urea concentration and temperature more than 80 reduction in cod was achieved with urea treatment at concentrations above 700 g lwater fig 2 a whereas above 30 c urea solutions 1147 g lwater resulted in 90 reduction in cod fig 2b in accordance with industrial cleaning practice 35 c was set as the cleaning temperature for ro membranes and 1340 g lwater urea was the corresponding concentration just below the saturation point at 30 c 3 3 efficiency of chemical cleanings four mfss containing the same bwro membrane and feed spacer 34 mil were operated in parallel with a constant supply of nutrients to the feed water to accelerate biofilm formation biofilm development was monitored by means of feed channel pressure drop increase in the mfss until it reached a threshold value of 200 mbar in each mfs different chemical cleaning protocols consisting of the standard acid alkali treatment and two alternative urea treatments were applied table 2 pressure drop reduction was used as a measure of membrane performance restoration after each of the applied chemical cleanings section 3 3 1 active biomass removal post chemical cleanings was determined by means of atp analysis section 3 3 2 and biofilm solubilization efficiency of the chemical cleaning agents was studied by quantifying the predominant eps components as well as feem analysis section 3 3 3 3 3 1 performance restoration the increase in pressure drop δp was 160 mbar in the control mfs and 180 mbar in all other mfss fig 3 a starting with an average initial pressure drop in all mfss of 20 mbar and increasing to about 200 mbar over the 0 20 m long mfs over a period of 5 6 days membrane performance was restored equally well in the mfs cleaned with the conventional reference r chemicals naoh hcl and the mfs cleaned with co nh2 2 hcl u a more than 70 reduction in pressure drop was achieved with both the chemical treatments fig 3b and a t test revealed no significant difference p 0 05 between the performance of the r and u a cleaning protocols however one stage cleaning with urea only u resulted in a 50 decrease in pressure drop only suggesting that the acid recirculation phase plays an important role in the effectiveness of the cleaning cycles 3 3 2 biomass inactivation and removal the concentration of viable biomass remaining in each mfs after cleaning was quantified using atp analysis fig 4 aside from the uncleaned control mfs which contained 8 85 104 pg atp cm2 the reference r mfs had the highest concentration of active biomass 662 pg atp cm2 after cleaning by protocol u and u a the remaining active biomass content in the mfss was 446 and 318 pg atp cm2 respectively urea based cleaning protocols resulted in significantly higher biomass inactivation p 0 05 than the reference protocol r 3 3 3 biofilm solubilization the two predominant components of eps total proteins and total carbohydrates were quantified fig 5 presents the concentration of proteins fig 5a and carbohydrates fig 5b remaining after the different cleaning strategies compared to the uncleaned control c chemical cleaning resulted in 50 reduction in protein and carbohydrate content solubilization of proteins was slightly enhanced by urea based cleaning protocols however compared to the reference acid alkali treatment the difference was not significant p 0 05 likewise the same applies to the reduction of the carbohydrate content for which all three cleaning protocols produced similar results p 0 05 additionally feem analysis was used to examine the extracted eps fig 6 shows the feem plots divided into four regions i humic like matter ex 320 nm em 425 nm ii protein like matter ex 275 nm em 330 nm iii fulvic acid like substances ex 260 nm em 475 nm and iv tyrosine containing proteins ex 235 nm em 330 nm the feem plot of the uncleaned control membrane shows a distinct peak for protein like substances and a strong peak for tyrosine containing substances which are typically proteinaceous and associated with amino acids fig 6a both peaks ii and iv are present at a much lower intensity on the membranes treated by chemical cleaning after cleaning with r u and u a the average peak intensity for protein like matter was reduced by 19 27 and 40 while the average peak intensity for tyrosine containing proteins was reduced by 24 19 and 52 respectively compared to the uncleaned control in other words urea based cleaning protocols were able to solubilize protein like substances and tyrosine containing proteins more effectively than the reference acid alkali cleaning treatment indicating that urea cleaning has advantages over the acid alkali cleaning 4 discussion 4 1 selection of chemical cleaning protocol periodic membrane cleaning is unavoidable to maintain the performance of membrane based water treatment processes and the selection of a chemical cleaning protocol is usually governed by the fouling types deposited on the membranes jiang et al 2017 in this study the effectiveness of urea chemical cleaning was evaluated by performing short term accelerated biofouling experiments sanawar et al 2017 in which a biofilm was grown in membrane fouling simulators with the supplementation of biodegradable nutrients biofilm accumulation was monitored in real time by measuring the feed channel pressure drop development the choice of cleaning chemicals in this study was based on the predominant nature of the fouling layer i e biological fouling hence cleaning with naoh and co nh2 2 is an appropriate strategy since both cleaning agents initiate chemical reactions involved in the removal of biological fouling beyer et al 2017 mallevialle et al 1996 typically in practice a high ph cleaning solution such as naoh is used first to remove biological matter followed by a low ph cleaning chemical such as hcl to further weaken the bonds between the foulants and the membrane surface and destabilize the chemical bonds within the eps matrix itself hydranautics 2014 this study investigated the effect of substituting the standard alkaline chemical naoh with co nh2 2 which acts as a chaotropic hydrogen bond disrupting agent and enhances the solubility of organic foulants by denaturing proteins 4 2 optimization of the urea cleaning protocol standard ro membranes used in water practice are thin film composite polyamide membranes when selecting a chemical cleaning agent it is important to assess whether or not the chemical can cause damage to the membrane material the compatibility of co nh2 2 with ro polyamide membranes was confirmed during the initial evaluation of urea as a cleaning agent a recent patent also confirms the suitability of urea and its derivatives with ro polyamide membranes kawakatsu and ishii 2017 furthermore the effectiveness of chemical cleaning depends on the type circulation time ph and temperature of the cleaning solutions al amoudi and lovitt 2007 madaeni and samieirad 2010 two of the main chemical aspects of cleaning urea concentration and temperature were investigated to determine the optimal cleaning conditions using cod as an indicator of biomass removal it was shown that the urea cleaning efficiency increases at higher concentration 756 g lwater 294 g lwater and temperature 30 c 23 c urea concentration higher than 756 g lwater and temperatures higher than 30 c did not increase the cleaning efficiency the results are in agreement with literature which have shown that chemical cleaning efficiency increases at higher concentration and at elevated temperatures 50 60 c bartlett et al 1995 madaeni et al 2001 shorrock and bird 1998 sohrabi et al 2011 this is because higher temperatures accelerate the chemical reactions involved in the breakdown of deposits at the membrane surface chen et al 2003a however with repeated exposure to temperatures higher than 45 c the polyester support and polyamide layer of the membrane can be damaged kucera 2011 therefore 35 c was set as the optimal temperature for naoh and co nh2 2 cleaning solutions in accordance with practice and guidelines for polyamide membranes hydranautics 2014 madaeni and samieirad 2010 4 3 efficiency of chemical cleaning 4 3 1 performance restoration after determining the optimal cleaning conditions fouled mfss were subjected to the reference cleaning protocol r naoh hcl and to alternative urea based chemical cleanings u urea only u a urea hcl feed channel pressure drop increase is a result of biomass accumulation on the membrane spacer surface vrouwenvelder et al 2009a 2009c restoration of membrane performance after chemical cleaning was therefore monitored by means of feed channel pressure drop reduction cleaning with r and u a yielded 70 reduction in pressure drop with no significant difference between the efficiency of both chemical cleaning strategies in terms of membrane performance restoration however one stage cleaning with urea only was not as effective indicating the importance of applying a second stage low ph acid cleaning the possible physico chemical interactions between acidic cleaners such as hcl and foulants include hydrolysis and solubilization porcelli and judd 2010 zondervan and roffel 2007 therefore these mechanisms may be responsible for enhanced biofilm solubilization during the secondary acid cleaning stage 4 3 2 biomass parameters the performance of urea based chemical cleanings is superior to that of the reference cleaning in terms of biomass inactivation in order of biomass inactivation efficiency the cleaning protocols can be ranked as u a u r in a recent study urea was shown to cause significant internal stresses within the biofilm within 15 min of exposure likely due to osmotic forces rasmussen et al 2016 the extracellular and intracellular swelling of the biofilm caused by the diffusion of urea molecules into the biofilm space and bacterial cells eventually leads to osmotic lysis bursting of cell membrane due to osmotic imbalance this may be the reason why in this study biomass inactivation was up to two fold greater after treatment with urea based chemical cleanings compared to the conventional acid alkali treatment fig 4 urea as a chemical cleaning agent proved to be more efficient in terms of biofilm protein solubilization feem plots fig 6 illustrate that urea acts as a protein denaturant and results in significantly lower intensities of protein like matter and tyrosine containing proteins when compared with the membrane cleaned with the conventional cleaning chemicals this may be attributed to the ability of urea to i cause unfolding of proteins by interrupting hydrogen bonding between amide and carbonyl groups of proteins and ii inhibit protein aggregation the deposition of proteins on the membrane surface has been shown to accelerate fouling by serving as a nucleation site for the formation of larger protein aggregates kelly et al 1993 kelly and zydney 1994 1995 aggregation of proteins occurs predominantly through intermolecular disulfide bonds kelly and zydney 1994 steinhauer et al 2015 the availability of free sulfhydryl groups is essential to the aggregation reactions huggins et al 1951 urea eliminates the formation of protein aggregates by blocking the free sulfhydryl group kelly and zydney 1994 mo and ng 2010 thereby minimizing the accumulation of the foulant on the membrane surface several studies have demonstrated that by strategically pairing chemical agents that have complementary cleaning mechanisms foulants can be removed from the membrane surface more efficiently ang et al 2011 bartlett et al 1995 madaeni and samieirad 2010 shi et al 2014 pairing of urea and hcl in this study yielded higher cleaning efficiencies it is plausible that i the first stage urea cleaning disrupts the biofilm stability by interfering with the hydrogen bond network of biofilm and ii the second stage acid cleaning minimizes the ligand binding of divalent atoms between negatively charged groups on the eps due to lower ph in other words urea creates a loose fouling layer that allows for deeper penetration of hcl into the biofilm consequently enhancing the solubilization of deposits these results fig 6 are based on the analysis of total eps extracted from the biofilm present on membrane spacer coupons using the formaldehyde naoh method the total eps extract was then subjected to subsequent extraction methods for individual eps components i e proteins and carbohydrates analysis of the individual eps components resulted in similar concentrations of total proteins and carbohydrates after cleaning with r u and u a fig 5 suggesting possible limitations of the extraction methods all three cleaning protocols yielded 50 reduction in total proteins and carbohydrates 4 4 future research the potential of urea as an alternative cleaning agent should also be evaluated in full scale spiral wound ro membrane modules when several fouling types might exist simultaneously the possibility of reclaiming urea from the waste solution post cleaning should be explored all the used urea can potentially be recovered by eutectic freeze crystallization as its eutectic point lies around 12 c and 33 wt which temperature is high enough to allow for energy efficient operation van der ham 1999 this would allow for urea to be reused after the removal of impurities in an effort to reduce the volume of chemical waste and the costs associated with cleaning and treating chemical waste appropriate urea waste disposal methods must be implemented leading to eco friendly and preferential use of urea over the conventional cleaning agents bacterial cells in biofilms are known to develop resistance to antimicrobial agents and cleaning chemicals bridier et al 2011 several studies have reported that repeated cleaning cycles select for microbial groups that strongly attach to the ro membrane surface by producing rigid and adhesive eps al ashhab et al 2017 and that the type and amount of deposits remaining after cleaning will have an effect on the rate and extent of biofilm regrowth bereschenko et al 2011 therefore investigating the changes in biofilm structure and composition after repetitive urea cleaning cycles and the impact of urea on membrane performance restoration during long term membrane operation should be pursued chemical cleaning combined with physical cleaning methods such as increase in shear vrouwenvelder et al 2010 or the use of air bubble scouring cornelissen et al 2007 may enhance biofilm removal since urea weakens the fouling layer furthermore studies have shown that the composition of the eps matrix can influence the hydraulic biofilm resistance desmond et al 2018 dreszer et al 2013 it may be addressed in future studies how urea cleaning affects the hydraulic resistance of biofilms and possibly leads to enhanced permeate flux 5 conclusions the suitability of alternative chemical cleaning strategies employing concentrated urea for biofilm solubilization was studied in comparison with the conventional cleaning protocol as applied in practice to reverse osmosis membranes based on the results of the lab scale membrane fouling simulator studies it can be concluded that urea is a compatible chemical cleaning agent for reverse osmosis polyamide membranes enhanced biomass removal is achieved with increasing urea concentration and temperature until the effect begins to plateau performance of urea as a chemical cleaning agent is superior to conventional cleaning in terms of biomass inactivation and biofilm protein solubilization based on feem analysis of total extracted eps chemical cleaning with urea is as effective as the standard acid alkali cleaning in terms of membrane performance restoration and extracellular polymeric substances reduction alternative urea based cleaning strategy is an inexpensive simple and successful approach to control organic and biological fouling research is underway to recover and reuse urea from the waste solution conflict of interest the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgements the

20027,chemical cleaning is routinely performed in reverse osmosis ro plants for the regeneration of ro membranes that suffer from biofouling problems the potential of urea as a chaotropic agent to enhance the solubilization of biofilm proteins has been reported briefly in the literature in this paper the efficiency of urea cleaning for ro membrane systems has been compared to conventionally applied acid alkali treatment preliminary assessment confirmed that urea did not damage the ro polyamide membranes and that the membrane cleaning efficiency increased with increasing concentrations of urea and temperature accelerated biofilm formation was carried out in membrane fouling simulators which were subsequently cleaned with i 0 01m sodium hydroxide naoh and 0 1m hydrochloric acid hcl typically applied in industry ii urea co nh2 2 and hydrochloric acid or iii urea only 1340 g lwater the pressure drop over the flow channel was used to evaluate the efficiency of the applied chemical cleanings biomass removal was evaluated by measuring chemical oxygen demand cod adenosine triphosphate atp protein and carbohydrate content from the membrane and spacer surfaces after cleaning in addition to protein and carbohydrate quantification of the extracellular polymeric substances eps fluorescence excitation emission matrix feem spectroscopy was used to distinguish the difference in organic matter of the remaining biomass to assess biofilm solubilization efficacy of the different cleaning agents results indicated that two stage co nh2 2 hcl cleaning was as effective as cleaning with naoh hcl in terms of restoring the feed channel pressure drop 70 pressure drop decrease one stage cleaning with urea only was not as effective indicating the importance of the second stage low ph acid cleaning in weakening the biofilm matrix all three chemical cleaning protocols were equally effective in reducing the concentration of predominant eps components protein and carbohydrate 50 reduction in concentrations however urea based cleaning strategies were more effective in solubilizing protein like matter and tyrosine containing proteins furthermore atp measurements showed that biomass inactivation was up to two fold greater after treatment with urea based chemical cleanings compared to the conventional acid alkali treatment the applicability of urea as an alternative economical eco friendly and effective chemical cleaning agent for the control of biological fouling was successfully demonstrated graphical abstract image 1 keywords reverse osmosis biofouling membrane fouling simulator chemical cleaning urea 1 introduction biofouling is an unavoidable problem in ro membrane treatment processes biofilm formation is the result of unwanted growth and adhesion of micro organisms on a membrane and feed spacer surface that excrete extracellular polymeric substances eps flemming 1997 biofouling can be defined as the formation of biofilm that results in operational problems characklis and marshall 1990 such as an increase in the normalized pressure drop by 15 or a decrease in the normalized flux by 10 of the start up values dow 2014 hydranautics 2001

replacement flemming 2011 effective control of biofouling is important to maintain membrane performance extend membrane life span and reduce operating costs the periodic application of chemical cleaning agents is routinely carried out to control biofouling in ro membranes chemical cleaning using combinations of acidic and alkaline chemicals is commonly applied for the regeneration of membranes madaeni and samieirad 2010 yu et al 2017 the cleaning chemicals disrupt the biofilm structure through several mechanisms by denaturing the macromolecules such as polypeptides and polysaccharides alkaline solutions such as sodium hydroxide naoh remove organic fouling and biofouling by hydrolysis and solubilization whereas acidic solutions such as hydrochloric acid hcl dissolve scaling disrupt the bacterial cell wall structure and precipitate proteins beyer et al 2017 jiang et al 2017 cleaning protocols for spiral wound ro membranes consist of several phases of high flow recirculation and soaking lasting anywhere between 6 5 and 24 h in duration at a typically applied temperature of 35 c beyer et al 2017 conventionally applied acid alkali treatments often fail to fully restore membrane performance beyer et al 2014 huiting et al 2001 vrouwenvelder et al 1998 a recent study examining chemical cleaning in three full scale ro plants in the netherlands underlined the need for novel cleaning approaches as none of the standard cleaning chemicals resulted in highly effective membrane regeneration beyer et al 2017 moreover rapid biofilm regrowth is observed inducing more frequent and rigorous cleaning resulting in increased costs and chemical waste vrouwenvelder et al 1998 there is an apparent need for novel chemical cleaning strategies to enhance biofilm solubillization and removal from membrane modules achieve higher recoveries of membrane performance parameters and decrease the required cleaning frequency chaotropic agents such as urea co nh2 2 and guanidine hydrochloride ch6cln3 have been reported in literature as possible chemical cleaning agents whittaker et al 1984 studied a variety of chemical cleaning strategies of which urea 2m in combination with a detergent sds was amongst the most successful treatments in terms of biofilm removal applying 6 8 m urea demonstrated excellent biofilm removal whittaker et al 1984 another study confirmed the effectiveness of 2 m urea in achieving 70 biofilm protein removal chen and stewart 2000 a recent study examined the effect of 5 m urea on oral biofilms derived from clinical isolates and showed that urea was much more efficient at removing biofilm coverage than chlorhexidine a traditionally used antimicrobial agent rasmussen et al 2016 though the exact action mechanism of urea cleaning is not fully understood its ability to disrupt the hydrogen bonds involved in stabilizing the structure of proteins and other biopolymers has been reported mallevialle et al 1996 urea may enhance biofilm solubilization by extracting non covalently bound extracellular matrix and cellular proteins ashraf kharaz et al 2017 urea is also efficient for cell and tissue lysis rasmussen et al 2016 su and dias 2017 resulting in higher biomass inactivation previously urea cleaning has been performed on small strips of membranes whittaker et al 1984 or on biofilm covered slides chen and stewart 2000 the novelty of this study lies in i the use of membrane fouling simulators mfss to mimic the conditions of spiral wound ro membrane elements used in practice vrouwenvelder et al 2006 2007 ii the application of a more concentrated urea solution to disrupt the structure of eps components and iii the detailed analysis of the effect of urea on biomass removal this study aimed to comprehensively investigate the potential to use saturated urea solution as a cleaning agent for fouled membrane systems compared to the conventional acid alkali cleaning protocol commonly applied in practice 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up the laboratory set up consisted of a granular activated carbon filter followed by two cartridge filters in series 10 μm pore size mass flow controllers nutrient dosage pump mfss and back pressure valves fig 1 bucs et al 2016 the mfs flow channel dimensions were 200 mm 40 mm 0 863 mm membrane and feed spacer coupons 200 mm 40 mm were placed inside each mfs to mimic the structure of spiral wound membrane elements the feed spacer consisted of a sheet of 34 mil 0 863 mm thick diamond shaped polypropylene spacer the feed spacer and membrane sheets were taken from virgin spiral wound membrane elements bw30 400 34i dow filmtec usa the carbon filter was installed to remove residual chlorine from the incoming tap feed water to protect ro membrane from chlorine damage and enable microbial growth cartridge filters were used to retain any particles emerging from the carbon filter the mfs was operated in crossflow mode without permeate production at a pressure of 2 bar feed water entered the mfs from the inlet side and exited from the outlet after flowing through the spacer filled channel four mfss were operated in parallel and a flow controller was installed for each mfs a differential pressure transmitter measured the pressure drop over each mfs a back pressure valve was installed at the outflow to avoid degassing by pressurizing the set up nutrients and cleaning solutions were dosed to the mfss using separate flow controllers and dosage pumps feed water was pumped to the mfss at a flow rate of 17 0 l h equivalent to a linear flow velocity of 0 16 m s representative of practice vrouwenvelder et al 2009a feed water used for the experiments was tap water from the kaust desalination treatment plant table 1 the product water from the desalination plant belila et al 2016 is chlorinated ensuring a concentration of 0 5 mg l before entering the distribution network the residence time from the desalination plant to the laboratory set up is between 4 and 6 h the residual chlorine concentration in the tap feed water is 0 3 0 1 mg l biofilm development in the mfss was accelerated by dosing a biodegradable nutrient solution containing acetate nitrate and phosphate in a mass ratio c n p of 100 20 10 to the feed water miller et al 2012 the concentration of acetate carbon added to the mfs feed water was 250 μg l during operation the mfs window was covered with a light tight lid to prevent growth of phototrophic organisms the development of fouling was monitored by measuring the pressure drop increase over the feed spacer channel of the mfs using a pressure difference transmitter endress hauser type deltabar s pmd70 aaa7fkyaaa vrouwenvelder et al 2009b the active biomass accumulated on the feed spacer and membranes in each mfs was quantified and characterized at the end of operation 2 2 preliminary assessment of urea cleaning studies were carried out to investigate i whether ro polyamide membranes can withstand high urea concentrations and ii the effect of urea concentration and temperature on biofilm solubilization for all preliminary tests membrane and spacer sheets with pre grown biofilm obtained using the mfs set up described above were used first the compatibility of urea with ro polyamide membranes was evaluated using the congo red dye test u s d i 1996 this test can detect membrane damage as the congo red dye does not attach to the intact polyamide layer of the membrane but is absorbed by the porous supporting layer of the membrane resulting in an intense color on the membrane surface where the membrane is damaged fouled membrane coupons were submerged in urea solutions at concentrations ranging from 294 to 756 g lwater for two weeks after urea treatment membrane coupons were rinsed with milliq water and air dried a solution of congo red dye 1 w w was swabbed on the membrane surface and damages were visually assessed the membrane coupons were compared to a damaged membrane positive control and to an intact virgin membrane negative control the damaged membrane was prepared by 24 h of continuous stirring of the membrane coupon with a magnetic stirrer the influence of urea solution concentration and temperature on biofilm solubilization was examined the fouled membranes and spacers were cut into 10 pieces of 8 cm2 each and incubated for 24 h in centrifuge tubes containing 20 ml of urea solution at varying concentrations 294 1147 g lwater and at a constant temperature of 23 c to eliminate the effect of heat similarly membrane and spacer coupons were incubated for 24 h at varying temperatures 23 80 c at a constant urea concentration of 1147 g lwater incubation was performed in a thermostatic bath without stirring as negative controls fouled membrane and spacer coupons were immersed in milliq water after 24 h membrane and spacer coupons were taken out of the solution and rinsed by successive immersions in beakers of milliq water to remove the residual urea the remaining biomass on the membrane and spacer coupons was measured using the chemical oxygen demand cod kits from hach lck314 and lck114 with a lange ht200s thermostat and lange dr3900 spectrophotometer 2 3 mfs chemical cleaning studies laboratory scale studies were carried out in order to evaluate the efficiency of urea as a chemical cleaning agent for biofilm

described in section 2 1 four mfss containing the same brackish water reverse osmosis bwro membrane and feed spacers 34 mil were operated simultaneously until the pressure drop reached a threshold value of 200 mbar in 5 6 days which is the average duration of accelerated biofouling studies with mfss subsequently the flow cells were cleaned according to a predetermined cleaning protocol table 2 the temperature of the cleaning solutions naoh and co nh2 2 was kept at 35 c as this temperature is applied for enhanced flux recovery in practice madaeni and samieirad 2010 the applied concentration of urea 1340 g lwater is the saturated concentration at 30 c to ensure that urea remains in solution at 35 c this concentration of urea also did not damage the polyamide membrane as it was tested on membrane modules in pilot scale and no increase in salt passage was observed the ph of the cleaning solutions was also within the operating range ph 1 12 of polyamide membranes kucera 2011 bioreagent grade 98 urea acs reagent 37 hcl and reagent grade 98 naoh were purchased from sigma aldrich each chemical cleaning agent 1l was recirculated at the feed side of the mfs for 1 h at the same flow rate as the feed water 17 0 l h a membrane filter 10 μm pore size was placed between the outlet of the mfs and the dosing pump to avoid the recirculation of detached biofilm particles back to the mfs in between and after each cleaning the mfss were rinsed with feed water for 5 min to displace the previous cleaning solution feed channel pressure drop development was monitored throughout the duration of the experiment including the chemical cleaning phases membrane autopsies were subsequently carried out on retrieved membrane and feed spacer coupons for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the fouling deposits membrane and spacer coupons were cut from the inlet side of the mfs using sterile scissors and tweezers the coupon dimensions were measured with calipers so that the results can be reported per area of the combined membrane and spacer surface the extent and composition of the fouling layer was assessed using various analytical procedures described below all experiments were run in duplicates and the figures show the average and standard deviation from the two runs 2 4 biomass analysis adenosine triphosphate atp analysis was used for biomass quantification atp is present in all metabolically active microorganisms thus atp analysis can be used to measure the viable biomass content it is a generally accepted parameter for diagnosis of biofouling hijnen et al 2011 vrouwenvelder et al 2008 the biomass detachment and quantification method has been described previously sanawar et al 2017 a well established eps extraction procedure was adapted liu and fang 2002 biomass removed from membrane and feed spacer coupons was suspended in 10 ml of phosphate buffered saline pbs solution the samples were treated with 0 06 ml formaldehyde at 4 c for 1 h and incubated with 4 ml 1m naoh at 4 c for 3 h after centrifuging the samples for 20 min at 20000 g the supernatant was filtered through a 0 2 μm pore size membrane filter and purified using a 3500 da dialysis membrane for 24 h the dialyzed samples were lyophilized 50 c 48 h fluorescence excitation emission matrix feem was used to identify the predominant organics in the extracted eps such as protein like substances humic fulvic like substances and others chen et al 2003b valladares linares et al 2012 feem was measured using a fluoromax 4 spectrofluorometer horiba scientific japan under excitation of 240 450 nm and emission of 290 600 nm at a speed of 1500 nm min 1 a voltage of 700 v and a response time of 2 s carbohydrate and protein components of the extracted eps were quantified carbohydrates were quantified using the standard sulfuric acid phenol method masuko et al 2005 which involves mixing 200 μl of the extracted eps with 600 μl sulfuric acid and 120 μl of 5 phenol in a centrifuge tube the samples were incubated for 5 min at 90 c in a dry block heater and cooled down to room temperature for 5 min an aliquot of 200 μl of the sample was then transferred to a microplate and the absorbance at 490 nm was measured using a spectra a max 340pc microplate reader molecular devices usa proteins were quantified using the bca assay kit thermo scientific usa according to manufacturer s guidelines 2 5 statistical evaluation averages and standard deviations were calculated for each of the duplicate sets of experiment and a two tailed student s t test was used for statistical comparisons the standard deviation between duplicate experiments is represented by error bars in the graphs the variance in the sample means is denoted by a single asterisk if there is a significant difference p 0 05 and by ns if there is no significant difference p 0 05 3 results 3 1 membrane resistance to urea in order to determine whether urea has a damaging effect on ro polyamide membranes congo red dye was applied to membrane coupons which had been submerged in 294 756 g lwater urea solutions for 2 weeks no absorption of the dye was visible on the treated membrane surface contrary to the degraded membrane control confirming that urea did not damage the polyamide layer of the membrane in a separate study no increase in salt passage was observed when full scale ro membrane modules were cleaned with saturated urea solution 1340 g lwater reiterating the compatibility of urea with the membrane 3 2 impact of urea concentration and temperature on biofilm solubilization cod analysis revealed that urea cleaning efficiency was enhanced with increasing urea concentration and temperature more than 80 reduction in cod was achieved with urea treatment at concentrations above 700 g lwater fig 2 a whereas above 30 c urea solutions 1147 g lwater resulted in 90 reduction in cod fig 2b in accordance with industrial cleaning practice 35 c was set as the cleaning temperature for ro membranes and 1340 g lwater urea was the corresponding concentration just below the saturation point at 30 c 3 3 efficiency of chemical cleanings four mfss containing the same bwro membrane and feed spacer 34 mil were operated in parallel with a constant supply of nutrients to the feed water to accelerate biofilm formation biofilm development was monitored by means of feed channel pressure drop increase in the mfss until it reached a threshold value of 200 mbar in each mfs different chemical cleaning protocols consisting of the standard acid alkali treatment and two alternative urea treatments were applied table 2 pressure drop reduction was used as a measure of membrane performance restoration after each of the applied chemical cleanings section 3 3 1 active biomass removal post chemical cleanings was determined by means of atp analysis section 3 3 2 and biofilm solubilization efficiency of the chemical cleaning agents was studied by quantifying the predominant eps components as well as feem analysis section 3 3 3 3 3 1 performance restoration the increase in pressure drop δp was 160 mbar in the control mfs and 180 mbar in all other mfss fig 3 a starting with an average initial pressure drop in all mfss of 20 mbar and increasing to about 200 mbar over the 0 20 m long mfs over a period of 5 6 days membrane performance was restored equally well in the mfs cleaned with the conventional reference r chemicals naoh hcl and the mfs cleaned with co nh2 2 hcl u a more than 70 reduction in pressure drop was achieved with both the chemical treatments fig 3b and a t test revealed no significant difference p 0 05 between the performance of the r and u a cleaning protocols however one stage cleaning with urea only u resulted in a 50 decrease in pressure drop only suggesting that the acid recirculation phase plays an important role in the effectiveness of the cleaning cycles 3 3 2 biomass inactivation and removal the concentration of viable biomass remaining in each mfs after cleaning was quantified using atp analysis fig 4 aside from the uncleaned control mfs which contained 8 85 104 pg atp cm2 the reference r mfs had the highest concentration of active biomass 662 pg atp cm2 after cleaning by protocol u and u a the remaining active biomass content in the mfss was 446 and 318 pg atp cm2 respectively urea based cleaning protocols resulted in significantly higher biomass inactivation p 0 05 than the reference protocol r 3 3 3 biofilm solubilization the two predominant components of eps total proteins and total carbohydrates were quantified fig 5 presents the concentration of proteins fig 5a and carbohydrates fig 5b remaining after the different cleaning strategies compared to the uncleaned control c chemical cleaning resulted in 50 reduction in protein and carbohydrate content solubilization of proteins was slightly enhanced by urea based cleaning protocols however compared to the reference acid alkali treatment the difference was not significant p 0 05 likewise the same applies to the reduction of the carbohydrate content for which all three cleaning protocols produced similar results p 0 05 additionally feem analysis was used to examine the extracted eps fig 6 shows the feem plots divided into four regions i humic like matter ex 320 nm em 425 nm ii protein like matter ex 275 nm em 330 nm iii fulvic acid like substances ex 260 nm em 475 nm and iv tyrosine containing proteins ex 235 nm em 330 nm the feem plot of the uncleaned control membrane shows a distinct peak for protein like substances and a strong peak for tyrosine containing substances which are typically proteinaceous and associated with amino acids fig 6a both peaks ii and iv are present at a much lower intensity on the membranes treated by chemical cleaning after cleaning with r u and u a the average peak intensity for protein like matter was reduced by 19 27 and 40 while the average peak intensity for tyrosine containing proteins was reduced by 24 19 and 52 respectively compared to the uncleaned control in other words urea based cleaning protocols were able to solubilize protein like substances and tyrosine containing proteins more effectively than the reference acid alkali cleaning treatment indicating that urea cleaning has advantages over the acid alkali cleaning 4 discussion 4 1 selection of chemical cleaning protocol periodic membrane cleaning is unavoidable to maintain the performance of membrane based water treatment processes and the selection of a chemical cleaning protocol is usually governed by the fouling types deposited on the membranes jiang et al 2017 in this study the effectiveness of urea chemical cleaning was evaluated by performing short term accelerated biofouling experiments sanawar et al 2017 in which a biofilm was grown in membrane fouling simulators with the supplementation of biodegradable nutrients biofilm accumulation was monitored in real time by measuring the feed channel pressure drop development the choice of cleaning chemicals in this study was based on the predominant nature of the fouling layer i e biological fouling hence cleaning with naoh and co nh2 2 is an appropriate strategy since both cleaning agents initiate chemical reactions involved in the removal of biological fouling beyer et al 2017 mallevialle et al 1996 typically in practice a high ph cleaning solution such as naoh is used first to remove biological matter followed by a low ph cleaning chemical such as hcl to further weaken the bonds between the foulants and the membrane surface and destabilize the chemical bonds within the eps matrix itself hydranautics 2014 this study investigated the effect of substituting the standard alkaline chemical naoh with co nh2 2 which acts as a chaotropic hydrogen bond disrupting agent and enhances the solubility of organic foulants by denaturing proteins 4 2 optimization of the urea cleaning protocol standard ro membranes used in water practice are thin film composite polyamide membranes when selecting a chemical cleaning agent it is important to assess whether or not the chemical can cause damage to the membrane material the compatibility of co nh2 2 with ro polyamide membranes was confirmed during the initial evaluation of urea as a cleaning agent a recent patent also confirms the suitability of urea and its derivatives with ro polyamide membranes kawakatsu and ishii 2017 furthermore the effectiveness of chemical cleaning depends on the type circulation time ph and temperature of the cleaning solutions al amoudi and lovitt 2007 madaeni and samieirad 2010 two of the main chemical aspects of cleaning urea concentration and temperature were investigated to determine the optimal cleaning conditions using cod as an indicator of biomass removal it was shown that the urea cleaning efficiency increases at higher concentration 756 g lwater 294 g lwater and temperature 30 c 23 c urea concentration higher than 756 g lwater and temperatures higher than 30 c did not increase the cleaning efficiency the results are in agreement with literature which have shown that chemical cleaning efficiency increases at higher concentration and at elevated temperatures 50 60 c bartlett et al 1995 madaeni et al 2001 shorrock and bird 1998 sohrabi et al 2011 this is because higher temperatures accelerate the chemical reactions involved in the breakdown of deposits at the membrane surface chen et al 2003a however with repeated exposure to temperatures higher than 45 c the polyester support and polyamide layer of the membrane can be damaged kucera 2011 therefore 35 c was set as the optimal temperature for naoh and co nh2 2 cleaning solutions in accordance with practice and guidelines for polyamide membranes hydranautics 2014 madaeni and samieirad 2010 4 3 efficiency of chemical cleaning 4 3 1 performance restoration after determining the optimal cleaning conditions fouled mfss were subjected to the reference cleaning protocol r naoh hcl and to alternative urea based chemical cleanings u urea only u a urea hcl feed channel pressure drop increase is a result of biomass accumulation on the membrane spacer surface vrouwenvelder et al 2009a 2009c restoration of membrane performance after chemical cleaning was therefore monitored by means of feed channel pressure drop reduction cleaning with r and u a yielded 70 reduction in pressure drop with no significant difference between the efficiency of both chemical cleaning strategies in terms of membrane performance restoration however one stage cleaning with urea only was not as effective indicating the importance of applying a second stage low ph acid cleaning the possible physico chemical interactions between acidic cleaners such as hcl and foulants include hydrolysis and solubilization porcelli and judd 2010 zondervan and roffel 2007 therefore these mechanisms may be responsible for enhanced biofilm solubilization during the secondary acid cleaning stage 4 3 2 biomass parameters the performance of urea based chemical cleanings is superior to that of the reference cleaning in terms of biomass inactivation in order of biomass inactivation efficiency the cleaning protocols can be ranked as u a u r in a recent study urea was shown to cause significant internal stresses within the biofilm within 15 min of exposure likely due to osmotic forces rasmussen et al 2016 the extracellular and intracellular swelling of the biofilm caused by the diffusion of urea molecules into the biofilm space and bacterial cells eventually leads to osmotic lysis bursting of cell membrane due to osmotic imbalance this may be the reason why in this study biomass inactivation was up to two fold greater after treatment with urea based chemical cleanings compared to the conventional acid alkali treatment fig 4 urea as a chemical cleaning agent proved to be more efficient in terms of biofilm protein solubilization feem plots fig 6 illustrate that urea acts as a protein denaturant and results in significantly lower intensities of protein like matter and tyrosine containing proteins when compared with the membrane cleaned with the conventional cleaning chemicals this may be attributed to the ability of urea to i cause unfolding of proteins by interrupting hydrogen bonding between amide and carbonyl groups of proteins and ii inhibit protein aggregation the deposition of proteins on the membrane surface has been shown to accelerate fouling by serving as a nucleation site for the formation of larger protein aggregates kelly et al 1993 kelly and zydney 1994 1995 aggregation of proteins occurs predominantly through intermolecular disulfide bonds kelly and zydney 1994 steinhauer et al 2015 the availability of free sulfhydryl groups is essential to the aggregation reactions huggins et al 1951 urea eliminates the formation of protein aggregates by blocking the free sulfhydryl group kelly and zydney 1994 mo and ng 2010 thereby minimizing the accumulation of the foulant on the membrane surface several studies have demonstrated that by strategically pairing chemical agents that have complementary cleaning mechanisms foulants can be removed from the membrane surface more efficiently ang et al 2011 bartlett et al 1995 madaeni and samieirad 2010 shi et al 2014 pairing of urea and hcl in this study yielded higher cleaning efficiencies it is plausible that i the first stage urea cleaning disrupts the biofilm stability by interfering with the hydrogen bond network of biofilm and ii the second stage acid cleaning minimizes the ligand binding of divalent atoms between negatively charged groups on the eps due to lower ph in other words urea creates a loose fouling layer that allows for deeper penetration of hcl into the biofilm consequently enhancing the solubilization of deposits these results fig 6 are based on the analysis of total eps extracted from the biofilm present on membrane spacer coupons using the formaldehyde naoh method the total eps extract was then subjected to subsequent extraction methods for individual eps components i e proteins and carbohydrates analysis of the individual eps components resulted in similar concentrations of total proteins and carbohydrates after cleaning with r u and u a fig 5 suggesting possible limitations of the extraction methods all three cleaning protocols yielded 50 reduction in total proteins and carbohydrates 4 4 future research the potential of urea as an alternative cleaning agent should also be evaluated in full scale spiral wound ro membrane modules when several fouling types might exist simultaneously the possibility of reclaiming urea from the waste solution post cleaning should be explored all the used urea can potentially be recovered by eutectic freeze crystallization as its eutectic point lies around 12 c and 33 wt which temperature is high enough to allow for energy efficient operation van der ham 1999 this would allow for urea to be reused after the removal of impurities in an effort to reduce the volume of chemical waste and the costs associated with cleaning and treating chemical waste appropriate urea waste disposal methods must be implemented leading to eco friendly and preferential use of urea over the conventional cleaning agents bacterial cells in biofilms are known to develop resistance to antimicrobial agents and cleaning chemicals bridier et al 2011 several studies have reported that repeated cleaning cycles select for microbial groups that strongly attach to the ro membrane surface by producing rigid and adhesive eps al ashhab et al 2017 and that the type and amount of deposits remaining after cleaning will have an effect on the rate and extent of biofilm regrowth bereschenko et al 2011 therefore investigating the changes in biofilm structure and composition after repetitive urea cleaning cycles and the impact of urea on membrane performance restoration during long term membrane operation should be pursued chemical cleaning combined with physical cleaning methods such as increase in shear vrouwenvelder et al 2010 or the use of air bubble scouring cornelissen et al 2007 may enhance biofilm removal since urea weakens the fouling layer furthermore studies have shown that the composition of the eps matrix can influence the hydraulic biofilm resistance desmond et al 2018 dreszer et al 2013 it may be addressed in future studies how urea cleaning affects the hydraulic resistance of biofilms and possibly leads to enhanced permeate flux 5 conclusions the suitability of alternative chemical cleaning strategies employing concentrated urea for biofilm solubilization was studied in comparison with the conventional cleaning protocol as applied in practice to reverse osmosis membranes based on the results of the lab scale membrane fouling simulator studies it can be concluded that urea is a compatible chemical cleaning agent for reverse osmosis polyamide membranes enhanced biomass removal is achieved with increasing urea concentration and temperature until the effect begins to plateau performance of urea as a chemical cleaning agent is superior to conventional cleaning in terms of biomass inactivation and biofilm protein solubilization based on feem analysis of total extracted eps chemical cleaning with urea is as effective as the standard acid alkali cleaning in terms of membrane performance restoration and extracellular polymeric substances reduction alternative urea based cleaning strategy is an inexpensive simple and successful approach to control organic and biological fouling research is underway to recover and reuse urea from the waste solution conflict of interest the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgements the

20028,riverbank filtration rbf is used worldwide to produce high quality drinking water with river water often contaminated by micropollutants mps from various sources this study addresses the occurrence and fate of such mps at three different rbf sites with oxic alluvial sediments and short travel times to the drinking water well down to hours a broad range of mps with various physico chemical properties were analysed with detection limits in the low ng l 1 range using solid phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem high resolution mass spectrometry out of the 526 mps targeted a total of 123 different mps were detected above the limit of quantification at the three different rbf sites of the 75 96 mps detected in each river 43 59 were attenuated during rbf the remaining total concentrations of the mps in the raw drinking water accounted to 0 6 1 6 μgl 1 with only a few compounds exceeding 0 1 μgl 1 an often used threshold value the attenuation was most pronounced in the first meters of infiltration with a full elimination of 17 compounds at all three sites however a mixing with groundwater related to regional groundwater flow complicated the characterisation of natural attenuation potentials along the transects additional non target screening at one site revealed similar trends for further non target components overall a risk assessment of the target and estimated non target compound concentrations finally indicated during the sampling period no health risk of the drinking water according to current guidelines our results demonstrate that monitoring of contamination sources within a catchment and the affected water quality remains important in such vulnerable systems with partially short residence times graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater lc hrms ms riverbank filtration drinking water organic contaminants risk assessment 1 introduction riverbank filtration rbf is used worldwide as a natural process to produce high quality drinking water with relatively low environmental impact and at low capital costs maeng et al 2011 due to discharges of wastewater treatment plants wwtps as well as urban and agricultural runoff river water contains nutrients pathogens and a multitude of organic micropollutants mps such as pharmaceuticals pesticides biocides illicit drugs personal care products and industrial chemicals especially in densely populated areas daughton and ternes 1999 heberer 2002 perez and barcelo 2007 although the vast majority of mps are present in the low ng per liter range many of these compounds can nevertheless raise environmental and human health issues burkhardt holm 2010 jones et al 2001 kummerer 2009 schwarzenbach et al 2006 the infiltration of such surface water might lead to a consequent transfer of mps into groundwater used for drinking water extraction hence the load of mps in surface water pose a potential risk to water supplies barber et al 2013 kunkel and radke 2012 and pose a considerable risk for ensuring drinking water quality criteria varying mp loads discharged with wwtp effluents due to differences in regional usage and prescription as well as varying wwtp efficiencies implicate observable stream to stream and within stream spatio temporal variability of mp concentrations processes including biotransformation photolysis sorption dispersion and volatilization influence the fate and attenuation of mps in aquatic systems escher and fenner 2011 gurr and reinhard 2006 schwarzenbach et al 2006 all these processes are affected by the physico chemical properties of the compounds as well as the physical and biological parameters of the river such as river flow rate turbidity dissolved oxygen concentration ph temperature the structure of microbial communities the hydraulic regime and the extent of hyporheic exchange in the river boulton et al 2010 in addition mixing with groundwater that is not influenced by surface water may considerably complicate the identification of natural attenuation potentials several studies strongly indicate that natural attenuation is most pronounced already in the first few meters of infiltration i e within the highly reactive hyporheic zone brunke and gonser 1997 heberer et al 2008 huntscha et al 2013 lawrence et al 2013 regnery et al 2015 despite its importance few attempts have been made to correlate this attenuation potential of mps with their physico chemical properties polar compounds with low log k ow octanol water distribution coefficient values which are negatively charged or neutral move rapidly with the infiltrating river water into the groundwater and can only be eliminated by microbial degradation huntscha et al 2013 in contrast neutral compounds with higher log k ow values or positively charged compounds can also adsorb to organic matter which is usually slightly negatively charged benotti et al 2012 ramil et al 2010 cationic compounds can additionally sorb to clay surfaces droge and goss 2013 as mentioned above these general trends are modulated by many parameters such as temperature discharge organic carbon content and the residence time in the riverbank massmann et al 2006 rauch williams et al 2010 storck et al 2012 recently organic compounds that have substantial persistence freshwater half life 40 days according to reach definition and mobility characteristics log doc organic carbon water distribution coefficient 4 5 between ph 4 10 to be transported through natural and urban barriers and reach sources of drinking water have been defined as pmocs persistent and mobile organic chemicals and have received more attention arp et al 2017 in general information on vertical and lateral transport of mps within surface waters and from surface water into aquifers is scarce only few studies have been conducted to evaluate the natural attenuation potential of selected mps in different aquifer types for example the attenuation potential of a rapidly recharging karst aquifer in southern germany with short residence times was investigated using waste water specific tracers hillebrand et al 2012 2015 high attenuation rates with degradation half lives ranging from 37 h to 90 h were obtained for atenolol caffeine ibuprofen and paracetamol depicting the high degradability of these compounds the fate of mps in the hyporheic zone and the influence of temperature and redox potential on attenuation was also studied at an eutrophic lowland stream lewandowski et al 2011 and a sediment core in the laboratory burke et al 2014 except for benzotriazole and carbamazepine remaining persistent degradation rates decreased from warm to cold and oxic to manganese reducing conditions in the laboratory experiments in another bench scaled flume experiment designed to study hyporheic processes li et al 2015 transformation products tps were detected which were only formed in the sediment but released to the water hinting at secondary contamination with tps writer et al 2013 kunkel and radke 2012 provided a list of favourable attenuation conditions within rivers located in central europe and reported higher attenuation for sunny dry weather periods during periods of low discharge in comparison to the above mentioned studies in switzerland mostly aerobic conditions prevail in the aquifers and groundwater usually contains less dissolved organic carbon doc hence oxic redox independent conditions predominate rbf processes as a consequence of the predominance of mainly alluvial gravel aquifers rbf is often highly dynamic with short groundwater residence times the growing number of river restoration projects that are conducted along swiss rivers as modern flood protection measures and to achieve a good ecological status of rivers as required by the european water framework directive european parliament 2000 might further decrease the average residence times in rbf systems by removal of bank fixation and widening of the river schirmer et al 2014 swiss legislation for drinking water abstraction requires only a minimum subsurface residence time of 10 days 5 times less than in the european union and about 30 of swiss drinking water is produced at rbf sites the resulting raw water extracted at rbf sites is frequently only marginally treated to account for bacterial contamination e g by uv lamps an upgrade of those treatment chains to abate mps would be quite costly since many small decentral drinking water production sites are spread over switzerland therefore an improved understanding of the environmental fate and transport of mps during rbf is essential to provide a basis on which to decide whether drinking water sources are sufficiently protected or additional measures are needed as thousands of mps in daily use enter rivers directly or indirectly after incomplete treatment from their various sources such as agriculture households and industry it is extremely important to study not only a few selected compounds herein but to get a comprehensive overview on mps in surface waters that either attenuate or persist during rbf thus in the presented study we aimed to determine the occurrence of several hundreds of mps from various sources at three different rbf sites with varying residence times from hours to months to get a comprehensive picture on the contamination more than 500 mps with a broad range of physico chemical properties were analysed with detection limits in the low ng l 1 range using solid phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution tandem mass spectrometry lc hrms ms the concentrations of mps in each river sample and the respective fate during rbf was evaluated correlated with physico chemical data and compared with literature data additionally a profiling of peak pattern of non target compounds was conducted at one site finally the implications with regard to drinking water consumption of the resulting raw water was assessed due to the breadth of compounds it was not possible to investigate the time variable nature of contaminant distribution in the river and groundwater samples in more detail and constrain fate processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 field sites the study was conducted at three different rbf sites along the rivers birs ergolz and frenke all located in the north western part of switzerland in the canton of basle landscape fig 1 for a detailed description of the rbf sites including the geological and hydrogeological settings please refer to epting et al 2018 along the three river sites no lakes or reservoirs are located upstream together with the geology and topography within the catchment area this results in abrupt discharge changes after heavy rainfall events implying highly dynamic river systems all three locations are characterized by alluvial aquifer systems the aquifer material mainly consists of carbonate gravel triassic and jurassic composed by well rounded variably sorted sediments with few layers of clay and silt in between resulting in a large variance in hydraulic properties whereas hydraulic conductivities range from 10 5 to 10 2 m s 1 the rivers were once canalized at the end of the nineteenth century and river bed levels have subsequently eroded by several meters into the former floodplains from which they were eventually disconnected whereas the rivers at the study sites birs and frenke are connected to the groundwater systems at the location of the study site ergolz the river is partly disconnected from the groundwater system and infiltration occurs via the unsaturated zone epting et al 2018 discharges recorded between 1917 and 2013 at the river birs bafu discharge station 2106 muenchenstein hofmatt ranged from 0 83 to 383 m3 s 1and at the ergolz bafu discharge station 2202 liestal from 0 1 to 146 m3 s 1 respectively discharge at the frenke vordere frenke bubendorf was 0 04 27 3 m3 s 1 between 1978 and 2013 amt für umweltschutz und energie 2013 the land use within the whole region of the canton basle landscape is dominated by agricultural 41 and forestal use 41 and a smaller portion by urban areas 18 historically most pronounced close to the rivers in total 30 wwtps with a population equivalent of over 220000 are connected to the different streams in the canton resulting in a proportion of up to 13 23 and 7 treated wastewater during base flow conditions in the rivers birs q95 3 1 m3 s ergolz q95 0 5 m3 s 1 and frenke q95 0 2 m3 s 1 respectively amt für umweltschutz und energie 2015 at the three sampling sites in total four rbf transects were investigated table 1 transect birs a included the observation well 24 j 28 and the extraction well 24 a 8 which was out of operation during the sampling campaign fig 1c transect birs b included the observation well 24 j 26 and the extraction well 24 a 2 extraction rate approximately 0 04 m3 s 1 during sampling both transects were chosen according to previous investigations from affolter et al 2010 documenting an intense river groundwater interaction at these sites with short groundwater residence times less than 20 h from the river to the observation wells 24 j 26 and 24 j 28 maximal groundwater depth at the birs site is around 29 m and the thickness of the saturated zone varies between 0 6 and 10 m due to the bedrock topography as well as the transition zone of the bedrock to the hill slope to the west like at all other investigated transects at the rivers ergolz and frenke table 1 the redox groundwater conditions at the birs are oxic page et al 2012 the ergolz transect includes three observation wells 35 l 1 35 l 2 and 41 j 1 and the extraction well 41 a 4 which is extracting approximately 0 08 m3 s 1 mainly during night time whilst the observation wells 35 l 1 and 35 l 2 are close to the river bank 10 m and 45 m respectively the distance between 41 j 1 and the river is around 280 m and the extraction well 41 a 4 is located around 1500 m downgradient of the river sampling site fig 1d with this setup the ergolz transect is different to the other two sites however as highest attenuation rates can be observed close to the riverbank the results from the observation wells 35 l 1 and 35 l 2 are representing the attenuation capacity at the ergolz site for these two observation wells travel times were calculated before the sampling campaign by conducting a non parametric deconvolution of time series of the electrical conductivity ec cirpka et al 2007 vogt et al 2010 measured both in the river and at the two wells table 1 with loggers from sensor technik sirnach type dln70 from february 2014 till september 2014 for the quantitative mp screening at the frenke transect only data from the river frenke and the extraction well 33 a 2 were included as the extraction well is very close to the riverbank around 40 m perpendicular to the frenke river fig 1e with mean travel times during the campaign of less than 20 h table 1 in general the extraction well is operated during night time with an extraction rate of around 0 04 m3 s 1 the organic carbon content in the fine material of the aquifer material at the sites of frenke and ergolz ranged from 0 1 to 1 method see si with a typical particle size contribution of the material 0 2 mm of 2 5 determined for the frenke sample the fraction of organic carbon foc of the whole aquifer material at the investigated sites can be assumed to range in between 0 002 and 0 05 this is in the same order found for fluvial sandy gravels in the prealpine thur valley aquifer in switzerland huntscha et al 2013 2 2 sampling all samples were taken during low discharge conditions in december 2013 when the concentrations in rivers are expected to be relatively stable and wastewater derived compounds usually show the highest concentrations see table 1 for exact discharge values during the sampling campaign the sampling of 24 h composite river samples at each river site was performed with automated samplers placed on a flat riverbank where 150 mll samples were sampled hourly in a 9 5 l glass bottle teledyne isco 6712 sampler lincoln groundwater and raw drinking water grab samples were sampled in 5 different observation wells at all four transects as well as at four drinking water

compounds were selected based on consumption data and occurrence in former monitoring campaigns of surface and groundwater in switzerland huntscha et al 2012 moschet et al 2014 schymanski et al 2014 and covered pharmaceuticals 215 plant protection products abbreviated in the following as pesticides 142 biocides 18 illicit drugs 11 perfluorinated compounds pfcs 16 others 23 including 8 food additives and 15 industrial compounds as well as 101 major metabolites mostly from pesticides and pharmaceuticals for which reference standards were available table s7 fig s1 the compounds covered a

molecular structures containing various functional groups fig s2 predictions using episuite us epa 2012 due to the enrichment by various mechanisms using five different solid phase materials for more than 70 of the compounds relative recoveries in the range of 80 120 were achieved fig s3 together with an enrichment factor of 1000 and the sensitive and selective detection by hrms ms from the overall 526 mps included in the analytical method for 80 the loq was below 10 ng l 1 and for 24 even below 1 ng l 1 in the surface and groundwater samples the determined loqs varied only slightly between the surface and groundwater fig s4 3 2 mps pattern in surface water out of the 526 mps that could be quantified a total of 123 were detected above the loq at the three different rbf sites individual values in table s7 therefrom in total 86 96 and 75 were detected in the three different 24 h composite samples of the rivers birs ergolz and frenke respectively fig 2 median concentrations of all quantified mps were 9 0 6 9 and 5 6 ng l 1 in these rivers respectively fig 2 the highest quantified concentration in the 24 h composite river water samples were the persistent artificial sweeteners acesulfam and sucralose the anti corrosive agent benzotriazole the drugs metformin cetirizine and paracetamol as well as caffeine these findings are in line with other surface water monitoring studies in europe and switzerland huntscha et al 2012 loos et al 2009 however the concentrations were below 1 μg l 1 for individual compounds and apart from the above mentioned below 0 1 μg l 1 in agreement with the wastewater proportion amt für umweltschutz und energie 2015 the wwtps upstream the rbf sites exhibit obviously sufficient elimination efficiencies as well degradable compounds such as paracetamol or mefenamic acid which are used in high amounts in switzerland were only detected in relatively low concentrations or even below their loqs these concentrations may even be lower at other times since our sampling was conducted in winter when slightly lower degradation in the wastewater treatment plant can be expected munz et al 2017 hence the quantified concentrations of the mps in the three rivers are distinctly lower compared to previously published studies from other countries where either higher portions of treated wastewater were usually reported in the rivers or less treatment or even sewage overflow of untreated wastewater occurred acuna et al 2015 bradley et al 2014 hughes et al 2013 regnery et al 2015 writer et al 2013 as our primary focus was on the elucidation of contamination from wastewater we sampled under dry weather conditions so that neither storm water overflow nor run off from agricultural fields was anticipated similarly and with the sampling period ranging outside the respective application period we also did not expect pesticides peak concentrations to occur however as recently observed munz et al 2017 pesticides can be detected all over the year due to biocide use as well as accidental spills nevertheless only between 7 and 12 pesticides or pesticide tps from the 207 included in the analysis were detected with concentrations below 0 03 μg l 1 this might even result predominantly from exfiltration of groundwater upstream of the rbf sites such as the tps from chloridazon metolachlor and atrazine application outphased in switzerland even though the highest number of compounds detected was in the river ergolz where also the highest proportion of treated wastewater within the three different sites was reported up to 23 the highest median concentrations were determined for the river birs fig 2 however differences between number of compounds and median concentrations were small and the total concentration was rather driven by a few compounds with higher concentrations overall the observed substance spectrum and the quantified concentrations did not vary strongly at the different locations between 45 frenke and 59 ergolz pharmaceuticals were detected overall 70 different pharmaceuticals from 251 analysed 3 3 mps attenuation during riverbank filtration at individual sites in all observation well samples collected a few meters 20 m from the river with low residence times in the aquifer the number of quantified mps loq decreased to 43 and 56 birs tansect a and b 59 ergolz and 51 frenke respectively showing overall a good rbf potential at the birs transect a the number of quantified mps decreased from 86 in the river to 37 at the observation well 24 j 28 within 10 14 h flow time which could also be observed in the significant decline of the median concentration from 9 0 to 4 4 ng l 1 fig 2 however an increase of quantified mps was documented for the well house sample 24 a 8 50 mps with a median concentration of 5 2 ng l 1 according to epting et al 2018 for this rbf site groundwater at the extraction well 24 a 8 consisted of up to 80 of regional groundwater during the sampling time of early december 2013 and was only marginally influenced by infiltrating river water thus the increase in the number of detects can likely be attributed to other urban contamination sources within the contributing area at the birs transect b the number of quantifiable mps was reduced within 19 21 h mean travel time to the observation well 24 j 26 from 86 to 49 and to the extraction well 24 a 2 further to 32 the median concentration dropped from 8 8 to 6 2 ng l 1 in the first observation well and afterwards remained almost constant a comparable situation could also be documented for all the samples obtained at the ergolz site again the number of detected mps decreased markedly from 96 to 57 in the first observation well and then remained constant within the measurement uncertainty taking into account that quite some compounds were quantified close to the loq fig 2 similarly the total concentration of mps decreased significantly from 2 8 to 1 8 μg l 1 but the differences between the median concentrations are rather marginal the investigations performed at the frenke transect did not include a groundwater observation well fig 2 but the extraction well is located closely to the river with a calculated residence time of only 16 h calculation based on darcy s law including the water levels measured at the day of sampling nevertheless a significant decrease in the number of detected mps from initially 75 to 38 was documented which goes along with a reduction in the median concentration of 5 6 to 4 2 ng l 1 according to epting et al 2018 a typical riverbank filtration situation was captured during the low flow sampling 3 4 generalization of mps behaviour during riverbank filtration as expected at all three sites the well known persistent compounds carbamazepine acesulfam and sucralose that are often used as wastewater tracers showed no clear decreasing trend from surface to groundwater samples benotti et al 2012 bradley et al 2014 huntscha et al 2012 scheurer et al 2011 van stempvoort et al 2011 zirlewagen et al 2016 to account for dilution often ratios between concentrations of mps and a conservative tracer are used in lieu of actual concentrations huntscha et al 2013 scheurer et al 2011 however the change of the tracer concentrations compared to the surface water samples showed not the same trend for the three tracers and changed also differently along transects this may likely be attributed to fluctuating tracer concentrations in wastewater effluents combined with the difficulty to sample the same water package along the transect and mixing with other regional groundwater fractions overall we conclude that those tracers cannot be reliably used to correct for the dilution in such a dynamic system and consequently all concentration changes must be interpreted with care the first observation wells extraction well for frenke with the lowest mean travel time 24 h table 1 can best be linked to the 24 h composite samples of the surface water respectively consequently we attributed only mps with concentration decreases 50 between the surface water and the first observation well at all three sites frenke ergolz birs b as natural attenuated by retardation or degradation in addition only compounds with concentrations higher than three times their loq in the surface water were included in this assessment as otherwise dilution can easily lead to misinterpretations due to concentrations falling below their loq using this approach 17 compounds table 2 were consistently eliminated by natural attenuation at all three sites on the contrary 13 mps table 2 including the three tracers mentioned above showed 50 elimination at all three sites and were hence considered persistent the remaining 40 50 compounds at each site were either not ubiquitously detected e g several pesticides x ray contrast media illicit drugs or the well degradable paracetamol the concentrations were not three times higher than their loq e g pfcs the well degradable mefenamic acid or the concentrations decrease varied between and 50 at the sites e g benzotriazole atenolol acid so that no unambiguous classification could be achieved for most of the compounds compiled in table 2 sorption to organic material is expected to be negligible since log k ow values are relatively low or the compounds are anionic e g diclofenac irbesartan additionally the fraction of organic carbon foc of the aquifer material is estimated to be quite low 0 002 0 05 for the positively charged atenolol and metoprolol cation exchange was reported to be relevant schaffer et al 2012 however due to the low foc and results from a similar swiss aquifer huntscha et al 2013 such retardation is also expected to be of minor importance for those compounds similar to the results in this study biodegradation has already been reported in rbf studies for compounds such as atenolol bradley et al 2014 huntscha et al 2013 caffeine hillebrand et al 2015 metformin bradley et al 2014 diclofenac 4 actamidoantipyrine metoprolol huntscha et al 2013 burke et al 2014 naproxen and trimethoprim regnery et al 2015 for sulfamethoxazole partial degradation during oxic laboratory column tests was reported baumgarten et al 2011 bertelkamp et al 2016a but minor attenuation was determined at any of the four studied transects as well as elsewhere benotti et al 2012 bradley et al 2014 storck et al 2012 for benzotriazole a slight degrading trend at all transects was observable despite persistence documented in other studies burke et al 2014 reemtsma et al 2010 in contrast to the so far mentioned compounds information on the behaviour of sartans during rbf is scarce nödler et al 2013 irbesartan valsartan and their tp valsartan acid were well degraded at all three sites whereas candesartan showed persistence despite their similar structure however the overall behaviour is in general agreement with the biodegradability reported in wwtps with candesartan showing persistence as well bayer et al 2014 no information about the newer antidiabetic drug sitagliptin is available in literature in a recent study we found persistence of sitagliptin in wwtps goetz and singer 2015 but obviously during rbf the cationic amine can be attenuated either by biodegradation or sorption the persistence of the less studied hydrochlorothiazide and lamotrigine is in agreement with recent literature bertelkamp et al 2016a b bollmann et al 2016 persistence of the pesticide tps of chloridazon atrazine and dichlobenil is well known buttiglieri et al 2009 kern et al 2011 kolpin et al 1998 for the latter two pesticides application is no longer permitted for some years already but they still can be found in groundwater as well as surface water due to exfiltration loos et al 2010 reemtsma et al 2013 for mps characterized either as natural attenuated or persistent at the three sites table 2 there is no clear trend between physico chemical properties log kow log dow and behaviour this is complicated by the fact that sorption and degradation cannot be distinguished with regard to biodegradability the prediction program biowin us epa 2012 comprises a series of six aerobic and one anaerobic models to correlate the presence of structural fragments with biodegradation data and persistence from different databases howard et al 1992 jaworska et al 2003 the results for the seven models table s8 show no correlation between the persistence of the compounds and the predictions based on structural moieties this is not surprising as the compounds different to simple hydrocarbons comprise various functional groups for which biodegradation is extremely difficult to predict 3 5 peak pattern of non target peaks at ergolz site in addition to the above target screening see fig s5 for concentration distribution for substance classes a non target screening using lc hrms ms data was conducted at the ergolz site to search for further important contaminants in the groundwater used for drinking water production first all adduct and isotopologue peaks of target and internal standard compounds as well as peaks occurring in the blank measurements and finally all peaks not measurable in all replicates were removed transect profiles were then built for the remaining peaks in the four samples and afterwards combined to component profiles by grouping adduct and isotopologue profiles each component is then solely represented by the most intense profile altogether 7500 profile components resulted as depicted in the venn diagram of fig 3 as expected the highest number of such components was detected in the surface water 4400 whereas the different groundwater samples showed a similar number of profiles 3300 3600 about 800 components can be found in all samples indicating some persistence the two young groundwater samples at the ergolz site 35 l 1 and 35 l 2 fig 1 have about two thirds of such non target components in common whereas the raw water at extraction well 41 a 4 around 1 5 km further downstream fig 1 is more different this finding may be explained by the longer mean travel time and the inflow of regional groundwater from the urbanized part of the catchment or formation of transformation products this groundwater transports 700 components which can only be found in this latter raw water in order to assess the importance of all these non target components the cumulative signal intensity is plotted in fig 4 a herein the intensity drops markedly from the ergolz river water to the three groundwater samples for the raw drinking water the concentrations for non target profiles were estimated using calibration models of 43 randomly selected target internal standard pairs fig 4b thereby we tried to account for the response fluctuation in esi ms by orders of magnitude assuming even a relatively low response of the non target peaks 3rd quantile dotted line in fig 4b no profile intensities suggested an estimated concentration above 0 1 μg l 1 and less than 3 of the profiles might have a concentration between 0 05 and 0 1 μg l 1 therefore despite the multitude of profiles and their underlying organic compounds detected by the sensitive lc esi hrms ms method no substantial contamination with other polar compounds is expected and consequently no further efforts of profile identification was conducted it has to be noted though that such non target concentration estimates are subject to larger uncertainties than those for target analysis and somewhat depend on the set of calibration models used for their estimation in addition very small ionic compounds including certain pmocs would have to be covered by other enrichment and separation methods reemtsma et al 2016 3 6 potential implications to human health the drinking water directive 98 83 ec 1998 article 4 1 defines that water intended for human consumption shall be wholesome and clean if it is free from substances which in numbers or concentrations constitute a potential danger to human health complete absence of any trace contaminant in treated drinking water produced from alluvial aquifers in urbanized river valleys is an illusion since current analytical techniques as used in this study are capable of detecting very low concentrations as most of the substances detected have not yet been regulated and lack sufficient toxicity data to derive safe levels other approaches have to be used to derive threshold values often the threshold of toxicological concern ttc approach is used to assess potential human health concerns for a chemical based on its structural chemical characteristics and estimated exposure in switzerland for perfluorinated surfactants the ttc approach resulted for perfluorooctansulfonic acid and perfluorohexansulfonic acid at 0 3 μg l 1 and for perfluorooctanic acid at 0 5 μg l 1 federal food safety and veterinary office mons et al 2013 set target values for individual genotoxic and steroid endocrine chemicals at 0 01 μg l 1 and for all other organic chemicals at 0 1 μg l 1 based on the ttc and further considerations they addressed also the occurrence of mixtures and proposed target values for the total sum of genotoxic chemicals the total sum of steroid hormones and the total sum of all other organic compounds at 0 01 0 01 and 1 μg l 1 respectively furthermore for several individual chemicals the german federal office for the environment has proposed threshold and guiding values dieter 2011 for 1h benzotriazole carbamazepine clofibrate x ray contrast media und diclofenac a precautionary value of 0 1 μg l 1 in drinking water was defined unless toxicological studies call for an even lower value e g genotoxic compounds a threshold value of 0 1 μg l 1 for anthropogenic non natural compounds such as pesticides and pharmaceuticals was also proposed by the international associations of water works of the large rivers in europe e g rhine danube elbe in their memorandum to protect the provision of drinking water iawr 2013 for all other compounds without known effects they proposed 1 μg l 1 the widely suggested threshold value of 0 1 μg l 1 was exceeded in the raw drinking water analysed in this study under dry weather conditions for only four out of the more than 500 compounds analysed acesulfam exceeded the threshold value significantly at all sites showing the high usage of this artificial sweetener the other sweetener sucralose exceeded the threshold value only slightly at one site 0 12 μg l 1 otherwise benzotriazole 0 1 μg l 1 and tris 2 cloropropylphosphate flame retardant 0 12 μg l 1 showed each an exceedance at one of the sites the total concentration of all compounds is at two of the sites above the proposed threshold of 1 μg l 1 by mons et al 2013 however this is not surprising when so many compounds are analysed overall the risk associated with the target and the detected non target compounds of the raw water at the three sites seems relatively low however especially at frenke and birs the short residence times lead to vulnerability with regard to contamination as the treatment of the raw water is only minor uv disinfection and most probably will not reduce the concentration of mps significantly in case of rain events untreated wastewater and during pesticide application periods pesticides might reach the surface water in high concentrations thereby leading to elevated concentrations also in the raw water after short timeframes additionally accidental spills from industry or other sources as detected even in the rhine river with high dilution hollender et al 2017 cannot be ruled out therefore the anthropogenic activities in the catchment such as wastewater treatment and industrial production should be monitored and the raw water quality regularly investigated an additional barrier such as activated carbon or sand filtration to eliminate accidental spills could be beneficial 4 conclusions multi target and non target screening of mps at three rbf sites revealed that rbf is an effective natural process to reduce or even remove mps from river water and even for the short residence times observed from the 461 mps analysed with sufficient sensitivity 75 96 mps were detected in the rivers and therefrom 43 59 eliminated during rbf no correlation of natural attenuation of mps with physico chemical properties was revealed the remaining total concentrations of the mps in the raw drinking water accounted to 0 6 1 6 μg l 1 during the sampling period only a few of the targeted compounds exceeded 0 1 μg l 1 a threshold value often used to indicate the absence of health risks non target screening at one site indicates no further high

20028,riverbank filtration rbf is used worldwide to produce high quality drinking water with river water often contaminated by micropollutants mps from various sources this study addresses the occurrence and fate of such mps at three different rbf sites with oxic alluvial sediments and short travel times to the drinking water well down to hours a broad range of mps with various physico chemical properties were analysed with detection limits in the low ng l 1 range using solid phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem high resolution mass spectrometry out of the 526 mps targeted a total of 123 different mps were detected above the limit of quantification at the three different rbf sites of the 75 96 mps detected in each river 43 59 were attenuated during rbf the remaining total concentrations of the mps in the raw drinking water accounted to 0 6 1 6 μgl 1 with only a few compounds exceeding 0 1 μgl 1 an often used threshold value the attenuation was most pronounced in the first meters of infiltration with a full elimination of 17 compounds at all three sites however a mixing with groundwater related to regional groundwater flow complicated the characterisation of natural attenuation potentials along the transects additional non target screening at one site revealed similar trends for further non target components overall a risk assessment of the target and estimated non target compound concentrations finally indicated during the sampling period no health risk of the drinking water according to current guidelines our results demonstrate that monitoring of contamination sources within a catchment and the affected water quality remains important in such vulnerable systems with partially short residence times graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater lc hrms ms riverbank filtration drinking water organic contaminants risk assessment 1 introduction riverbank filtration rbf is used worldwide as a natural process to produce high quality drinking water with relatively low environmental impact and at low capital costs maeng et al 2011 due to discharges of wastewater treatment plants wwtps as well as urban and agricultural runoff river water contains nutrients pathogens and a multitude of organic micropollutants mps such as pharmaceuticals pesticides biocides illicit drugs personal care products and industrial chemicals especially in densely populated areas daughton and ternes 1999 heberer 2002 perez and barcelo 2007 although the vast majority of mps are present in the low ng per liter range many of these compounds can nevertheless raise environmental and human health issues burkhardt holm 2010 jones et al 2001 kummerer 2009 schwarzenbach et al 2006 the infiltration of such surface water might lead to a consequent transfer of mps into groundwater used for drinking water extraction hence the load of mps in surface water pose a potential risk to water supplies barber et al 2013 kunkel and radke 2012 and pose a considerable risk for ensuring drinking water quality criteria varying mp loads discharged with wwtp effluents due to differences in regional usage and prescription as well as varying wwtp efficiencies implicate observable stream to stream and within stream spatio temporal variability of mp concentrations processes including biotransformation photolysis sorption dispersion and volatilization influence the fate and attenuation of mps in aquatic systems escher and fenner 2011 gurr and reinhard 2006 schwarzenbach et al 2006 all these processes are affected by the physico chemical properties of the compounds as well as the physical and biological parameters of the river such as river flow rate turbidity dissolved oxygen concentration ph temperature the structure of microbial communities the hydraulic regime and the extent of hyporheic exchange in the river boulton et al 2010 in addition mixing with groundwater that is not influenced by surface water may considerably complicate the identification of natural attenuation potentials several studies strongly indicate that natural attenuation is most pronounced already in the first few meters of infiltration i e within the highly reactive hyporheic zone brunke and gonser 1997 heberer et al 2008 huntscha et al 2013 lawrence et al 2013 regnery et al 2015 despite its importance few attempts have been made to correlate this attenuation potential of mps with their physico chemical properties polar compounds with low log k ow octanol water distribution coefficient values which are negatively charged or neutral move rapidly with the infiltrating river water into the groundwater and can only be eliminated by microbial degradation huntscha et al 2013 in contrast neutral compounds with higher log k ow values or positively charged compounds can also adsorb to organic matter which is usually slightly negatively charged benotti et al 2012 ramil et al 2010 cationic compounds can additionally sorb to clay surfaces droge and goss 2013 as mentioned above these general trends are modulated by many parameters such as temperature discharge organic carbon content and the residence time in the riverbank massmann et al 2006 rauch williams et al 2010 storck et al 2012 recently organic compounds that have substantial persistence freshwater half life 40

sources of drinking water have been defined as pmocs persistent and mobile organic chemicals and have received more attention arp et al 2017 in general information on vertical and lateral transport of mps within surface waters and from surface water into aquifers is scarce only few studies have been conducted to evaluate the natural attenuation potential of selected mps in different aquifer types for example the attenuation potential of a rapidly recharging karst aquifer in southern germany with short residence times was investigated using waste water specific tracers hillebrand et al 2012 2015 high attenuation rates with degradation half lives ranging from 37 h to 90 h were obtained for atenolol caffeine ibuprofen and paracetamol depicting the high degradability of these compounds the fate of mps in the hyporheic zone and the influence of temperature and redox potential on attenuation was also studied at an eutrophic lowland stream lewandowski et al 2011 and a sediment core in the laboratory burke et al 2014 except for benzotriazole and carbamazepine remaining persistent degradation rates decreased from warm to cold and oxic to manganese reducing conditions in the laboratory experiments in another bench scaled flume experiment designed to study hyporheic processes li et al 2015 transformation products tps were detected which were only formed in the sediment but released to the water hinting at secondary contamination with tps writer et al 2013 kunkel and radke 2012 provided a list of favourable attenuation conditions within rivers located in central europe and reported higher attenuation for sunny dry weather periods during periods of low discharge in comparison to the above mentioned studies in switzerland mostly aerobic conditions prevail in the aquifers and groundwater usually contains less dissolved organic carbon doc hence oxic redox independent conditions predominate rbf processes as a consequence of the predominance of mainly alluvial gravel aquifers rbf is often highly dynamic with short groundwater residence times the growing number of river restoration projects that are conducted along swiss rivers as modern flood protection measures and to achieve a good ecological status of rivers as required by the european water framework directive european parliament 2000 might further decrease the average residence times in rbf systems by removal of bank fixation and widening of the river schirmer et al 2014 swiss legislation for drinking water abstraction requires only a minimum subsurface residence time of 10 days 5 times less than in the european union and about 30 of swiss drinking water is produced at rbf sites the resulting raw water extracted at rbf sites is frequently only marginally treated to account for bacterial contamination e g by uv lamps an upgrade of those treatment chains to abate mps would be quite costly since many small decentral drinking water production sites are spread over switzerland therefore an improved understanding of the environmental fate and transport of mps during rbf is essential to provide a basis on which to decide whether drinking water sources are sufficiently protected or additional measures are needed as thousands of mps in daily use enter rivers directly or indirectly after incomplete treatment from their various sources such as agriculture households and industry it is extremely important to study not only a few selected compounds herein but to get a comprehensive overview on mps in surface waters that either attenuate or persist during rbf thus in the presented study we aimed to determine the occurrence of several hundreds of mps from various sources at three different rbf sites with varying residence times from hours to months to get a comprehensive picture on the contamination more than 500 mps with a broad range of physico chemical properties were analysed with detection limits in the low ng l 1 range using solid phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution tandem mass spectrometry lc hrms ms the concentrations of mps in each river sample and the respective fate during rbf was evaluated correlated with physico chemical data and compared with literature data additionally a profiling of peak pattern of non target compounds was conducted at one site finally the implications with regard to drinking water consumption of the resulting raw water was assessed due to the breadth of compounds it was not possible to investigate the time variable nature of contaminant distribution in the river and groundwater samples in more detail and constrain fate processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 field sites the study was conducted at three different rbf sites along the rivers birs ergolz and frenke all located in the north western part of switzerland in the canton of basle landscape fig 1 for a detailed description of the rbf sites including the geological and hydrogeological settings please refer to epting et al 2018 along the three river sites no lakes or reservoirs are located upstream together with the geology and topography within the catchment area this results in abrupt discharge changes after heavy rainfall events implying highly dynamic river systems all three locations are characterized by alluvial aquifer systems the aquifer material mainly consists of carbonate gravel triassic and jurassic composed by well rounded variably sorted sediments with few layers of clay and silt in between resulting in a large variance in hydraulic properties whereas hydraulic conductivities range from 10 5 to 10 2 m s 1 the rivers were once canalized at the end of the nineteenth century and river bed levels have subsequently eroded by several meters into the former floodplains from which they were eventually disconnected whereas the rivers at the study sites birs and frenke are connected to the groundwater systems at the location of the study site ergolz the river is partly disconnected from the groundwater system and infiltration occurs via the unsaturated zone epting et al 2018 discharges recorded between 1917 and 2013 at the river birs bafu discharge station 2106 muenchenstein hofmatt ranged from 0 83 to 383 m3 s 1and at the ergolz bafu discharge station 2202 liestal from 0 1 to 146 m3 s 1 respectively discharge at the frenke vordere frenke bubendorf was 0 04 27 3 m3 s 1 between 1978 and 2013 amt für umweltschutz und energie 2013 the land use within the whole region of the canton basle landscape is dominated by agricultural 41 and forestal use 41 and a smaller portion by urban areas 18 historically most pronounced close to the rivers in total 30 wwtps with a population equivalent of over 220000 are connected to the different streams in the canton resulting in a proportion of up to 13 23 and 7 treated wastewater during base flow conditions in the rivers birs q95 3 1 m3 s ergolz q95 0 5 m3 s 1 and frenke q95 0 2 m3 s 1 respectively amt für umweltschutz und energie 2015 at the three sampling sites in total four rbf transects were investigated table 1 transect birs a included the observation well 24 j 28 and the extraction well 24 a 8 which was out of operation during the sampling campaign fig 1c transect birs b included the observation well 24 j 26 and the extraction well 24 a 2 extraction rate approximately 0 04 m3 s 1 during sampling both transects were chosen according to previous investigations from affolter et al 2010 documenting an intense river groundwater interaction at these sites with short groundwater residence times less than 20 h from the river to the observation wells 24 j 26 and 24 j 28 maximal groundwater depth at the birs site is around 29 m and the thickness of the saturated zone varies between 0 6 and 10 m due to the bedrock topography as well as the transition zone of the bedrock to the hill slope to the west like at all other investigated transects at the rivers ergolz and frenke table 1 the redox groundwater conditions at the birs are oxic page et al 2012 the ergolz transect includes three observation wells 35 l 1 35 l 2 and 41 j 1 and the extraction well 41 a 4 which is extracting approximately 0 08 m3 s 1 mainly during night time whilst the observation wells 35 l 1 and 35 l 2 are close to the river bank 10 m and 45 m respectively the distance between 41 j 1 and the river is around 280 m and the extraction well 41 a 4 is located around 1500 m downgradient of the river sampling site fig 1d with this setup the ergolz transect is different to the other two sites however as highest attenuation rates can be observed close to the riverbank the results from the observation wells 35 l 1 and 35 l 2 are representing the attenuation capacity at the ergolz site for these two observation wells travel times were calculated before the sampling campaign by conducting a non parametric deconvolution of time series of the electrical conductivity ec cirpka et al 2007 vogt et al 2010 measured both in the river and at the two wells table 1 with loggers from sensor technik sirnach type dln70 from february 2014 till september 2014 for the quantitative mp screening at the frenke transect only data from the river frenke and the extraction well 33 a 2 were included as the extraction well is very close to the riverbank around 40 m perpendicular to the frenke river fig 1e with mean travel times during the campaign of less than 20 h table 1 in general the extraction well is operated during night time with an extraction rate of around 0 04 m3 s 1 the organic carbon content in the fine material of the aquifer material at the sites of frenke and ergolz ranged from 0 1 to 1 method see si with a typical particle size contribution of the material 0 2 mm of 2 5 determined for the frenke sample the fraction of organic carbon foc of the whole aquifer material at the investigated sites can be assumed to range in between 0 002 and 0 05 this is in the same order found for fluvial sandy gravels in the prealpine thur valley aquifer in switzerland huntscha et al 2013 2 2 sampling all samples were taken during low discharge conditions in december 2013 when the concentrations in rivers are expected to be relatively stable and wastewater derived compounds usually show the highest concentrations see table 1 for exact discharge values during the sampling campaign the sampling of 24 h composite river samples at each river site was performed with automated samplers placed on a flat riverbank where 150 mll samples were sampled hourly in a 9 5 l glass bottle teledyne isco 6712 sampler lincoln groundwater and raw drinking water grab samples were sampled in 5 different observation wells at all four transects as well as at four drinking water

this workflow extracted ion chromatograms were first detected a peak picking run and non replicable peaks discarded parameters given in table s1 for all remaining peaks per replicate the masses were then recalibrated parameters given in table s2 their intensities normalized and a retention time dependent limit of detection estimated all isotopic peaks of target and internal standard compounds were removed for major adducts m h m nh4 m na m k table s3 to focus on non target peaks only thereupon a blank peak subtraction was conducted with and without internal standards based on a 100 fold intensity threshold table s4 subsequently a non targeted adduct m h m nh4 m na m k and resolution specific isotopologue grouping table s5 was carried out for all peaks in each sample finally intensity changes of a mass over the sites and replicates were extracted using an intensity descent over all pooled peaks resulting in so called non target profiles table s6 profiles of different adducts and isotopologues of the same non target analyte were further combined to components based on the intensity correlation among all profiles of similar retention time the most intense profiles per component were then used with tailored r scripts to derive venn diagrams hanbo accessed 22 august 2016 and cumulative intensity distributions moreover concentrations for these non target profiles were estimated combining calibration models of 43 randomly selected target internal standard standard pairs 3 results and discussion 3 1 micropollutants mps selection and coverage by analytical method 526 target compounds were selected based on consumption data and occurrence in former monitoring campaigns of surface and groundwater in switzerland huntscha et al 2012 moschet et al 2014 schymanski et al 2014 and covered pharmaceuticals 215 plant protection products abbreviated in the following as pesticides 142 biocides 18 illicit drugs 11 perfluorinated compounds pfcs 16 others 23 including 8 food additives and 15 industrial compounds as well as 101 major metabolites mostly from pesticides and pharmaceuticals for which reference standards were available table s7 fig s1 the compounds covered a

molecular structures containing various functional groups fig s2 predictions using episuite us epa 2012 due to the enrichment by various mechanisms using five different solid phase materials for more than 70 of the compounds relative recoveries in the range of 80 120 were achieved fig s3 together with an enrichment factor of 1000 and the sensitive and selective detection by hrms ms from the overall 526 mps included in the analytical method for 80 the loq was below 10 ng l 1 and for 24 even below 1 ng l 1 in the surface and groundwater samples the determined loqs varied only slightly between the surface and groundwater fig s4 3 2 mps pattern in surface water out of the 526 mps that could be quantified a total of 123 were detected above the loq at the three different rbf sites individual values in table s7 therefrom in total 86 96 and 75 were detected in the three different 24 h composite samples of the rivers birs ergolz and frenke respectively fig 2 median concentrations of all quantified mps were 9 0 6 9 and 5 6 ng l 1 in these rivers respectively fig 2 the highest quantified concentration in the 24 h composite river water samples were the persistent artificial sweeteners acesulfam and sucralose the anti corrosive agent benzotriazole the drugs metformin cetirizine and paracetamol as well as caffeine these findings are in line with other surface water monitoring studies in europe and switzerland huntscha et al 2012 loos et al 2009 however the concentrations were below 1 μg l 1 for individual compounds and apart from the above mentioned below 0 1 μg l 1 in agreement with the wastewater proportion amt für umweltschutz und energie 2015 the wwtps upstream the rbf sites exhibit obviously sufficient elimination efficiencies as well degradable compounds such as paracetamol or mefenamic acid which are used in high amounts in switzerland were only detected in relatively low concentrations or even below their loqs these concentrations may even be lower at other times since our sampling was conducted in winter when slightly lower degradation in the wastewater treatment plant can be expected munz et al 2017 hence the quantified concentrations of the mps in the three rivers are distinctly lower compared to previously published studies from other countries where either higher portions of treated wastewater were usually reported in the rivers or less treatment or even sewage overflow of untreated wastewater occurred acuna et al 2015 bradley et al 2014 hughes et al 2013 regnery et al 2015 writer et al 2013 as our primary focus was on the elucidation of contamination from wastewater we sampled under dry weather conditions so that neither storm water overflow nor run off from agricultural fields was anticipated similarly and with the sampling period ranging outside the respective application period we also did not expect pesticides peak concentrations to occur however as recently observed munz et al 2017 pesticides can be detected all over the year due to biocide use as well as accidental spills nevertheless only between 7 and 12 pesticides or pesticide tps from the 207 included in the analysis were detected with concentrations below 0 03 μg l 1 this might even result predominantly from exfiltration of groundwater upstream of the rbf sites such as the tps from chloridazon metolachlor and atrazine application outphased in switzerland even though the highest number of compounds detected was in the river ergolz where also the highest proportion of treated wastewater within the three different sites was reported up to 23 the highest median concentrations were determined for the river birs fig 2 however differences between number of compounds and median concentrations were small and the total concentration was rather driven by a few compounds with higher concentrations overall the observed substance spectrum and the quantified concentrations did not vary strongly at the different locations between 45 frenke and 59 ergolz pharmaceuticals were detected overall 70 different pharmaceuticals from 251 analysed 3 3 mps attenuation during riverbank filtration at individual sites in all observation well samples collected a few meters 20 m from the river with low residence times in the aquifer the number of quantified mps loq decreased to 43 and 56 birs tansect a and b 59 ergolz and 51 frenke respectively showing overall a good rbf potential at the birs transect a the number of quantified mps decreased from 86 in the river to 37 at the observation well 24 j 28 within 10 14 h flow time which could also be observed in the significant decline of the median concentration from 9 0 to 4 4 ng l 1 fig 2 however an increase of quantified mps was documented for the well house sample 24 a 8 50 mps with a median concentration of 5 2 ng l 1 according to epting et al 2018 for this rbf site groundwater at the extraction well 24 a 8 consisted of up to 80 of regional groundwater during the sampling time of early december 2013 and was only marginally influenced by infiltrating river water thus the increase in the number of detects can likely be attributed to other urban contamination sources within the contributing area at the birs transect b the number of quantifiable mps was reduced within 19 21 h mean travel time to the observation well 24 j 26 from 86 to 49 and to the extraction well 24 a 2 further to 32 the median concentration dropped from 8 8 to 6 2 ng l 1 in the first observation well and afterwards remained almost constant a comparable situation could also be documented for all the samples obtained at the ergolz site again the number of detected mps decreased markedly from 96 to 57 in the first observation well and then remained constant within the measurement uncertainty taking into account that quite some compounds were quantified close to the loq fig 2 similarly the total concentration of mps decreased significantly from 2 8 to 1 8 μg l 1 but the differences between the median concentrations are rather marginal the investigations performed at the frenke transect did not include a groundwater observation well fig 2 but the extraction well is located closely to the river with a calculated residence time of only 16 h calculation based on darcy s law including the water levels measured at the day of sampling nevertheless a significant decrease in the number of detected mps from initially 75 to 38 was documented which goes along with a reduction in the median concentration of 5 6 to 4 2 ng l 1 according to epting et al 2018 a typical riverbank filtration situation was captured during the low flow sampling 3 4 generalization of mps behaviour during riverbank filtration as expected at all three sites the well known persistent compounds carbamazepine acesulfam and sucralose that are often used as wastewater tracers showed no clear decreasing trend from surface to groundwater samples benotti et al 2012 bradley et al 2014 huntscha et al 2012 scheurer et al 2011 van stempvoort et al 2011 zirlewagen et al 2016 to account for dilution often ratios between concentrations of mps and a conservative tracer are used in lieu of actual concentrations huntscha et al 2013 scheurer et al 2011 however the change of the tracer concentrations compared to the surface water samples showed not the same trend for the three tracers and changed also differently along transects this may likely be attributed to fluctuating tracer concentrations in wastewater effluents combined with the difficulty to sample the same water package along the transect and mixing with other regional groundwater fractions overall we conclude that those tracers cannot be reliably used to correct for the dilution in such a dynamic system and consequently all concentration changes must be interpreted with care the first observation wells extraction well for frenke with the lowest mean travel time 24 h table 1 can best be linked to the 24 h composite samples of the surface water respectively consequently we attributed only mps with concentration decreases 50 between the surface water and the first observation well at all three sites frenke ergolz birs b as natural attenuated by retardation or degradation in addition only compounds with concentrations higher than three times their loq in the surface water were included in this assessment as otherwise dilution can easily lead to misinterpretations due to concentrations falling below their loq using this approach 17 compounds table 2 were consistently eliminated by natural attenuation at all three sites on the contrary 13 mps table 2 including the three tracers mentioned above showed 50 elimination at all three sites and were hence considered persistent the remaining 40 50 compounds at each site were either not ubiquitously detected e g several pesticides x ray contrast media illicit drugs or the well degradable paracetamol the concentrations were not three times higher than their loq e g pfcs the well degradable mefenamic acid or the concentrations decrease varied between and 50 at the sites e g benzotriazole atenolol acid so that no unambiguous classification could be achieved for most of the compounds compiled in table 2 sorption to organic material is expected to be negligible since log k ow values are relatively low or the compounds are anionic e g diclofenac irbesartan additionally the fraction of organic carbon foc of the aquifer material is estimated to be quite low 0 002 0 05 for the positively charged atenolol and metoprolol cation exchange was reported to be relevant schaffer et al 2012 however due to the low foc and results from a similar swiss aquifer huntscha et al 2013 such retardation is also expected to be of minor importance for those compounds similar to the results in this study biodegradation has already been reported in rbf studies for compounds such as atenolol bradley et al 2014 huntscha et al 2013 caffeine hillebrand et al 2015 metformin bradley et al 2014 diclofenac 4 actamidoantipyrine metoprolol huntscha et al 2013 burke et al 2014 naproxen and trimethoprim regnery et al 2015 for sulfamethoxazole partial degradation during oxic laboratory column tests was reported baumgarten et al 2011 bertelkamp et al 2016a but minor attenuation was determined at any of the four studied transects as well as elsewhere benotti et al 2012 bradley et al 2014 storck et al 2012 for benzotriazole a slight degrading trend at all transects was observable despite persistence documented in other studies burke et al 2014 reemtsma et al 2010 in contrast to the so far mentioned compounds information on the behaviour of sartans during rbf is scarce nödler et al 2013 irbesartan valsartan and their tp valsartan acid were well degraded at all three sites whereas candesartan showed persistence despite their similar structure however the overall behaviour is in general agreement with the biodegradability reported in wwtps with candesartan showing persistence as well bayer et al 2014 no information about the newer antidiabetic drug sitagliptin is available in literature in a recent study we found persistence of sitagliptin in wwtps goetz and singer 2015 but obviously during rbf the cationic amine can be attenuated either by biodegradation or sorption the persistence of the less studied hydrochlorothiazide and lamotrigine is in agreement with recent literature bertelkamp et al 2016a b bollmann et al 2016 persistence of the pesticide tps of chloridazon atrazine and dichlobenil is well known buttiglieri et al 2009 kern et al 2011 kolpin et al 1998 for the latter two pesticides application is no longer permitted for some years already but they still can be found in groundwater as well as surface water due to exfiltration loos et al 2010 reemtsma et al 2013 for mps characterized either as natural attenuated or persistent at the three sites table 2 there is no clear trend between physico chemical properties log kow log dow and behaviour this is complicated by the fact that sorption and degradation cannot be distinguished with regard to biodegradability the prediction program biowin us epa 2012 comprises a series of six aerobic and one anaerobic models to correlate the presence of structural fragments with biodegradation data and persistence from different databases howard et al 1992 jaworska et al 2003 the results for the seven models table s8 show no correlation between the persistence of the compounds and the predictions based on structural moieties this is not surprising as the compounds different to simple hydrocarbons comprise various functional groups for which biodegradation is extremely difficult to predict 3 5 peak pattern of non target peaks at ergolz site in addition to the above target screening see fig s5 for concentration distribution for substance classes a non target screening using lc hrms ms data was conducted at the ergolz site to search for further important contaminants in the groundwater used for drinking water production first all adduct and isotopologue peaks of target and internal standard compounds as well as peaks occurring in the blank measurements and finally all peaks not measurable in all replicates were removed transect profiles were then built for the remaining peaks in the four samples and afterwards combined to component profiles by grouping adduct and isotopologue profiles each component is then solely represented by the most intense profile altogether 7500 profile components resulted as depicted in the venn diagram of fig 3 as expected the highest number of such components was detected in the surface water 4400 whereas the different groundwater samples showed a similar number of profiles 3300 3600 about 800 components can be found in all samples indicating some persistence the two young groundwater samples at the ergolz site 35 l 1 and 35 l 2 fig 1 have about two thirds of such non target components in common whereas the raw water at extraction well 41 a 4 around 1 5 km further downstream fig 1 is more different this finding may be explained by the longer mean travel time and the inflow of regional groundwater from the urbanized part of the catchment or formation of transformation products this groundwater transports 700 components which can only be found in this latter raw water in order to assess the importance of all these non target components the cumulative signal intensity is plotted in fig 4 a herein the intensity drops markedly from the ergolz river water to the three groundwater samples for the raw drinking water the concentrations for non target profiles were estimated using calibration models of 43 randomly selected target internal standard pairs fig 4b thereby we tried to account for the response fluctuation in esi ms by orders of magnitude assuming even a relatively low response of the non target peaks 3rd quantile dotted line in fig 4b no profile intensities suggested an estimated concentration above 0 1 μg l 1 and less than 3 of the profiles might have a concentration between 0 05 and 0 1 μg l 1 therefore despite the multitude of profiles and their underlying organic compounds detected by the sensitive lc esi hrms ms method no substantial contamination with other polar compounds is expected and consequently no further efforts of profile identification was conducted it has to be noted though that such non target concentration estimates are subject to larger uncertainties than those for target analysis and somewhat depend on the set of calibration models used for their estimation in addition very small ionic compounds including certain pmocs would have to be covered by other enrichment and separation methods reemtsma et al 2016 3 6 potential implications to human health the drinking water directive 98 83 ec 1998 article 4 1 defines that water intended for human consumption shall be wholesome and clean if it is free from substances which in numbers or concentrations constitute a potential danger to human health complete absence of any trace contaminant in treated drinking water produced from alluvial aquifers in urbanized river valleys is an illusion since current analytical techniques as used in this study are capable of detecting very low concentrations as most of the substances detected have not yet been regulated and lack sufficient toxicity data to derive safe levels other approaches have to be used to derive threshold values often the threshold of toxicological concern ttc approach is used to assess potential human health concerns for a chemical based on its structural chemical characteristics and estimated exposure in switzerland for perfluorinated surfactants the ttc approach resulted for perfluorooctansulfonic acid and perfluorohexansulfonic acid at 0 3 μg l 1 and for perfluorooctanic acid at 0 5 μg l 1 federal food safety and veterinary office mons et al 2013 set target values for individual genotoxic and steroid endocrine chemicals at 0 01 μg l 1 and for all other organic chemicals at 0 1 μg l 1 based on the ttc and further considerations they addressed also the occurrence of mixtures and proposed target values for the total sum of genotoxic chemicals the total sum of steroid hormones and the total sum of all other organic compounds at 0 01 0 01 and 1 μg l 1 respectively furthermore for several individual chemicals the german federal office for the environment has proposed threshold and guiding values dieter 2011 for 1h benzotriazole carbamazepine clofibrate x ray contrast media und diclofenac a precautionary value of 0 1 μg l 1 in drinking water was defined unless toxicological studies call for an even lower value e g genotoxic compounds a threshold value of 0 1 μg l 1 for anthropogenic non natural compounds such as pesticides and pharmaceuticals was also proposed by the international associations of water works of the large rivers in europe e g rhine danube elbe in their memorandum to protect the provision of drinking water iawr 2013 for all other compounds without known effects they proposed 1 μg l 1 the widely suggested threshold value of 0 1 μg l 1 was exceeded in the raw drinking water analysed in this study under dry weather conditions for only four out of the more than 500 compounds analysed acesulfam exceeded the threshold value significantly at all sites showing the high usage of this artificial sweetener the other sweetener sucralose exceeded the threshold value only slightly at one site 0 12 μg l 1 otherwise benzotriazole 0 1 μg l 1 and tris 2 cloropropylphosphate flame retardant 0 12 μg l 1 showed each an exceedance at one of the sites the total concentration of all compounds is at two of the sites above the proposed threshold of 1 μg l 1 by mons et al 2013 however this is not surprising when so many compounds are analysed overall the risk associated with the target and the detected non target compounds of the raw water at the three sites seems relatively low however especially at frenke and birs the short residence times lead to vulnerability with regard to contamination as the treatment of the raw water is only minor uv disinfection and most probably will not reduce the concentration of mps significantly in case of rain events untreated wastewater and during pesticide application periods pesticides might reach the surface water in high concentrations thereby leading to elevated concentrations also in the raw water after short timeframes additionally accidental spills from industry or other sources as detected even in the rhine river with high dilution hollender et al 2017 cannot be ruled out therefore the anthropogenic activities in the catchment such as wastewater treatment and industrial production should be monitored and the raw water quality regularly investigated an additional barrier such as activated carbon or sand filtration to eliminate accidental spills could be beneficial 4 conclusions multi target and non target screening of mps at three rbf sites revealed that rbf is an effective natural process to reduce or even remove mps from river water and even for the short residence times observed from the 461 mps analysed with sufficient sensitivity 75 96 mps were detected in the rivers and therefrom 43 59 eliminated during rbf no correlation of natural attenuation of mps with physico chemical properties was revealed the remaining total concentrations of the mps in the raw drinking water accounted to 0 6 1 6 μg l 1 during the sampling period only a few of the targeted compounds exceeded 0 1 μg l 1 a threshold value often used to indicate the absence of health risks non target screening at one site indicates no further high

20029,groundwater contamination by bacteria poses a serious threat to our drinking water supplies in cold climate regions microorganisms introduced to upper soil layers by spreading of animal manure are subject to low temperatures and multiple cycles of freezing and thawing at the beginning of winter and during spring melt we investigated the influence of temperature fluctuations around the freezing point known as freeze thaw ft on the inactivation rates growth and biofilm formation of a manure isolated strain of salmonella typhimurium moreover the effects of ft on the transport characteristics of s typhimurium in quartz sand were monitored in model porewater solutions of two different ionic strengths is 10 and 100 mm kcl and two different humic acid ha concentrations 1 and 5 mg l increasing numbers of ft cycles were found to decrease the deposition of s typhimurium onto quartz sand and increase the percentage of detached cells in sand packed column experiments based on the calculated bacterial attachment efficiencies the predicted minimum setback distances between the location of water supply wells and manure spreading activities are higher when the effects of ft are taken into consideration while ft treatment significantly affected cell viability in the presence of ha most cells were in a viable but non culturable vbnc state with compromised ability to form biofilm this investigation demonstrates the effects of spring temperature variations in upper soil layers on s typhimurium properties and the potential increased risk of bacterial contamination in representative aquifer environments in cold climate regions graphical abstract image 1 keywords bacteria transport salmonella freeze thaw climate change public health risk groundwater contamination 1 introduction although animal waste can be beneficial to the soil ecosystem by adding organic matter that improves the water holding capacity and by providing an economical source of nutrients for plant growth it can also be a source of pathogen contamination brannan et al 2000 therefore it is important to evaluate the survival and transport behavior of pathogenic microorganisms when animal manure is applied onto agricultural fields gerba and smith 2005 the majority of these pathogens are enteric in origin and can cause waterborne diseases ewald 1991 some of the most common pathogenic microorganisms found in animal waste are salmonella spp yersinia spp vibrio cholerae campylobacter jejuni and pathogenic escherichia coli gerba and smith 2005 sidhu and toze 2009 salmonella spp alone are responsible for infecting annually an estimated 88 000 people in canada and 1 2 million people in the united states who consume food contaminated by animal waste or contaminated water jacobsen and bech 2012 thomas et al 2013 a study conducted in canada from 2014 to 2016 found salmonella to be the sole pathogen independently associated with severe disease in children presenting for emergency care with gastroenteritis freedman et al 2017 salmonella has been identified as a direct source of contamination of produce and well water and is therefore of particular concern borchardt et al 2003 bennett et al 2018 li and uyttendaele 2018 although not commonly associated directly with drinking water outbreaks salmonella was chosen as a representative bacterium in this study because it may be present in animal waste and groundwater while it presents a relatively lower biohazard in the laboratory as compared with the more pathogenic campylobacter or e coli o157 h7 salmonella typhimurium is a gram negative motile rod shaped bacterium approximately 0 7 1 5 μm in width and 2 0 5 0 μm in length bernard and wormser 2006 it has been shown to survive in cattle manure for 48 days and soil for 231 days greenberg 1964 in nature microorganisms are able to modify their properties to adapt to their environment and survive mindock et al 2001 thus environmental isolates may exhibit very different behaviors from laboratory strains mikkola and kurland 1988 for instance salmonella isolated from aquaculture environments was reported to exhibit increased survival properties and environmental escherichia coli isolates were found to have a higher electrostatic charge hydrophobicity and biofilm formation compared to lab cultures akinbowale et al 2006 yang et al 2012 many studies report the transport and survival behavior of salmonella using laboratory strains kim and surette 2005 dourou et al 2009 but few studies have examined manure isolates melendez et al 2010 to reduce the risk of pathogen outbreaks a better understanding of the effects of environmental conditions on the behavior and survival of naturally occurring microorganisms in representative aquifer media is required in quebec during the transition from winter to spring pathogens in surface soil are subject to repeated freeze thaw cycles it has been shown that repeated fluctuations in temperature could decrease the survival of microorganisms to a greater extent than a constant cold temperature asadishad et al 2013 2014 for instance survival rates of microorganisms such as yersinia enterocolitica bacillus subtilis and cryptosporidium parvum oocysts decrease after exposure to fluctuating cold temperatures asadishad et al 2013 2014 kato et al 2002 similarly escherichia coli o157 h7 and salmonella typhimurium experience loss in viability when the temperature of their holding environments varied in increments of 4 c and 7 c semenov et al 2007 temperature fluctuations may also affect bacteria transport behaviour by influencing their physicochemical properties such as cell membrane composition and surface chemistry or cell size for instance cold and freezing temperatures have an impact on the membrane and surface chemistry of bacteria mindock et al 2001 however different studies report contradictory results on the role of cold temperature on bacterial transport for example it has been demonstrated that cold temperature or ft events can lead to both enhanced mccaulou et al 1995 stevik et al 2004 or decreased transport of bacteria in the subsurface asadishad et al 2013 2014 found that pre exposure to temperature variations from 10 c to 10 c enhanced attachment of yersinia enterocolitica and bacillus subtilis onto model aquifer grains stevik et al 2004 found a reduction in attachment of escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium when temperature was decreased from 20 c to 3 c during the transport experiments in representative aquifer environments both temperature and dissolved organic matter affect the survival rate of microorganisms and are therefore important factors to incorporate in risk assessment studies of groundwater contamination avery et al 2004 chowdhury et al 2015 humic acids are the major organic constituents of surface soil and their concentrations can influence the transport and fate of microorganisms for instance the presence of humic acids reduced the attachment efficiency of salmonella cells onto a model aquifer grain glass bead surface chowdhury et al 2015 and significantly reduced their inactivation in terms of loss in culturability ramamurthy et al 2014 in this latter study the change in ph upon addition of nom was not accounted for and may have contributed to the observed effect the relative impacts of temperature fluctuations and humic acid levels on the risk of salmonella groundwater contamination may however vary because of the high potential for attachment of colloids at air water interfaces particularly in unsaturated soils note that the graphical abstract represents only the saturated zone of the land spreading risk pathway as a worst case scenario a few studies have investigated the inactivation and transport behavior of microorganisms in the presence of dissolved organic matter johnson and logan 1996 chowdhury et al 2015 or in response to variable temperature john and rose 2005 however most studies have overlooked the combined effect of varying cold temperatures in the presence of dissolved organic matter chowdhury et al 2015 davies and evison 1991 walker et al 2006 the aim of this study was to characterize the effect of cold temperatures and ft events typically encountered in southern canada on the survival and transport behavior of s typhimurium in model aquifer environments a systematic laboratory investigation was conducted to evaluate how variations in temperature and dissolved organic matter content in porewater influence the survival and transport behavior of s typhimurium in packed column experiments the scope of this study does not include the effect of freeze thaw on transport from topsoil to the water table but rather focuses on the risk of contamination through the water saturated flow transport pathways in model aquifer material 2 materials and methods 2 1 cell culture preparation a wild type strain of s typhimurium isolated from bovine manure in an agricultural site at saint simon montérégie québec and supplied by irda institut de recherche et de développement en agroenvironnement was used as the model microorganism the s typhimurium irda 4 5 i 1 2 stock cultures were stored in lysogeny broth lb with 30 glycerol at 80 c martinez et al 2005 bacteria were inoculated in sterile lb broth and grown overnight 18 hr to stationary phase 37 c 140 rpm for each experiment 1 ml of the fresh overnight culture was used to inoculate 30 ml of fresh lb broth cultures were grown to exponential phase for 4 hr at the same conditions harvested and washed by centrifugation 5 000g for 10 min at 10 c and re suspended in 50 ml of electrolyte 1 mm 10 mm 100 mm kcl to study the role of dissolved organic matter in some experiments the bacteria were suspended in 10 mm kcl containing 1 mg l or 5 mg l suwannee river humic acid ha as a representative dissolved organic matter international humic substances society without additional nutrients more details are provided in supporting information 2 2 freeze thaw treatment each ft cycle was 32 hr in total and the temperature profile comprised of four 8 hr time steps varying between 10 c and 10 c cell suspensions were prepared in seven 50 ml aliquots for different treatments 1 before ft samples were tested after being maintained at 10 c for 4 hr acclimatization 2 4 ft samples were exposed to 4 ft cycles 3 10 ft samples were exposed to 10 ft cycles 4 and 5 kcl samples were kept in electrolyte at 10 c for 128 hr or 320 hr the duration of 4 ft and 10 ft cycles respectively 6 and 7 lb samples were kept in lb broth reference sample with no starvation at 10 c for 128 hr or 320 hr this experimental matrix is similar to that used in our previous study asadishad et al 2013 the reference samples that remained at a constant temperature of 10 c in electrolyte or in lb broth allow us to distinguish between the influence of ft and starvation on bacterial properties respectively additional details are provided in supporting information 2 3 bacterial transport experiments transport experiments were performed inside chambers maintained at 10 c which is representative of groundwater temperature in southern canada lesage et al 1990 castro and tufenkji 2007 bacterial suspensions were injected into a glass column packed with granular quartz sand having a mean size of 256 μm us standard mesh size 50 70 sigma aldrich prior to conducting bacterial transport experiments the column was equilibrated by injecting 6 pore volumes pvs of background electrolyte solution kcl the rate of injection was 0 8 ml min equivalent to a darcy velocity of 14 7 m d for all column experiments to establish breakthrough curves the bacterial suspensions at a concentration c 0 were injected for 17 pvs followed by a cell free electrolyte solution for 3 pvs the concentration of the effluent c was measured in real time by uv visible spectroscopy agilent hp8453 at a wavelength of 600 nm using a 1 cm flow through cell mitzel and tufenkji 2014 finally to study the strength of bacterial attachment to the sand grains a cell free electrolyte at a lower ionic strength 1 mm kcl was injected into the column and the extent of bacterial detachment was quantified more details regarding the column experiment are provided in the supporting information 2 4 cell characterization the culturability of the cells was evaluated by counting colony forming units cfus on lb agar plates the viability of the cells was evaluated by assessing membrane integrity using the baclight live dead kit invitrogen the electrophoretic mobility epm and hydrodynamic diameter of the bacteria were measured using dynamic light scattering dls at 10 c using cells suspended in kcl before and after ft treatment zetasizer nano zs malvern castro et al 2010 details are provided in the supporting information the kcl and lb control data of the cell characterization experiments are presented in tables s1 to s7 2 5 biofilm and growth assays biofilm formation and growth curves were measured for each temperature treatment using a microtitre plate model merritt et al 2005 o toole et al 1999 to quantify the amount of biofilm formation and the amount of bacterial growth before and after temperature treatment the absorbance of solubilized crystal violet was measured using a microplate reader at 570 nm tecan infinite m200 pro switzerland karaca et al 2013 details are provided in the supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 the deposition of s typhimurium decreases with ft treatment the transport and deposition behavior of s typhimurium was evaluated over the range of solution chemistries for the control before ft cells and for cells exposed to 4 or 10 ft cycles bacterial retention onto sand grains decreased as the number of ft cycles increased in all solution chemistries fig 1 the extent of bacterial attachment was greater at higher is before ft for example the percentage of bacterial retention 1 c c 0 was 23 0 2 and 35 0 3 for the cells without treatment before ft in 10 and 100 mm kcl respectively fig 1a and b c c 0 was quantified by integrating the area under the breakthrough curves btcs the percentage of bacterial retention decreased to 4 1 7 after 10 ft in both 10 and 100 mm kcl the trend observed in bacterial retention after exposure to ft in salmonella was not in agreement with that previously observed in our laboratory using bacillus subtilis and yersinia enterocolitica asadishad et al 2013 2014 whereby those organisms exhibited higher retention on sand after exposure to ft because s typhimurium and y enterocolitica only rarely cause outbreaks in well water users it could be inferred that both pathogens have low mobility in representative aquifer environments under all climatic conditions including ft the dichotomy of high transport potential of s typhimurium after freeze thaw might be explained by the difference in type of isolates in our studies where s typhimurium was isolated from manure and y enterocolitica is a laboratory strain to take into account the starvation condition experienced by bacteria in groundwater environments we conducted column experiments with cells that had been maintained at 10 c in electrolyte no nutrients for 128 hr and 320 hr results shown in the supporting information fig s1 reveal that starvation is not responsible for the observed bacterial transport patterns in a set of parallel experiments the electrolyte was amended with dissolved ha to determine the effect of dissolved organic matter in representative aquifer environments on the transport behavior of bacteria exposed to ft the extent of bacterial attachment onto sand grains in the presence of ha also decreased after ft treatment fig 1c and d for example the percentage of cells retained onto sand before ft treatment was 30 0 3 and 85 0 4 in 10 mm kcl amended with 1 mg l and 5 mg l ha respectively and these values decreased to 10 1 5 and 22 2 2 after 10 ft treatment respectively interestingly an increase in bacterial retention onto sand was observed in the presence of 5 mg l ha when compared to pure electrolyte without ha this observation is contrary to the findings of some other studies of bacterial transport in the presence of dissolved organic matter knapp et al 1998 yang et al 2012 for instance foppen et al reported that the presence of humic acid decreased the attachment of escherichia coli atcc 25922 onto goethite coated sand foppen and schijven 2006 park and kim also showed that the attachment of e coli atcc 11105 onto iron coated sand decreased with increasing humic acid concentration park and kim 2009 abudalo et al found that the attachment of cryptosporidium parvum oocysts to ferric oxyhydroxide coated quartz sand decreased as the concentration of fulvic acid increased abudalo et al 2010 one explanation for the differences in the bacterial retention results could be related to differences in the granular media used in the other studies abudalo et al 2010 park and kim 2009 foppen and schijven 2006 the sand was coated with clays or metal oxides which would be masked by the humic acid resulting in decreased bacterial retention another factor that may have led to the observed differences in bacterial retention could be the aggregation of cells in the presence of ha in this study which in turn could lead to physical straining of the bacteria in the porous medium petosa et al 2013 this is supported by the larger hydrodynamic diameter 2 2 0 1 μm measured for bacteria in 10 mm kcl 5 mg l ha compared to ha free solutions of 10 mm kcl 1 2 0 2 μm table 1 aggregation would also lead to an increase in contact frequency with grain surfaces due to an increase in gravitational settling and interception tufenkji and elimelech 2004 the average cell size changed significantly as a result of ft treatment in 100 mm kcl with hydrodynamic diameters of 1 0 2 μm before ft and 0 7 0 2 μm after 10 ft under the no nutrient condition table 1 p 0 05 similarly the average cell size was smaller after ft treatment when cells were suspended in 10 mm kcl with or without ha p 0 05 the observed decrease in cell sizes after ft treatment may have influenced the single collector contact efficiency as well as any potential role of straining in bacterial retention bacterial zeta potentials were evaluated from epm measurements conducted over the range of experimental conditions and are presented in table 1 the results indicate that bacteria were negatively charged in all aqueous chemistries the absolute magnitude of the cell zeta potential tended to decrease with an increase in is of kcl zeta potentials of clean sand are also negative at these conditions 30 mv and 5 mv for 10 and 100 mm kcl respectively at ph 6 5 as reported elsewhere redman et al 2004 in 10 mm and 100 mm kcl the absolute zeta potential of bacterial cell surface charge did not change significantly after 4 ft from 27 to 28 mv for 10 mm kcl and 22 to 26 mm for 100 mm kcl p 0 05 but decreased to values lower than its initial value after 10 ft p 0 05 if classical dlvo derjaguin landau verwey overbeek interactions were controlling the bacterial transport behavior we would expect the cells exposed to 10 ft to exhibit higher retention than the untreated cells before ft however inspection of fig 1 reveals that this is not the case even for electrolyte solutions containing ha thus bacterial zeta potential data suggest that factors other than purely electrostatic forces were involved in controlling the transport behavior of ft treated s typhimurium it is likely that changes to the cell membrane properties e g membrane fluidity integrity of pili and flagella contributed to the different transport characteristics after being subjected to freeze thaw cycles that involve rapid changes in temperature as well as changes in salinity associated with salt exclusion during freezing our prior work with a model bacterial strain showed that motility flagellar activity and the stiffness of the cell silica bond were influenced by ft cycles asadishad et al 2014 for each experimental condition the bacterial cell sand attachment efficiency α pc was calculated using the following equation yao et al 1971 1 α p c 2 3 d c 1 θ l η 0 ln c c 0 where d c is the mean grain diameter θ is the bed porosity l is the packed bed length and η 0 is the single collector contact efficiency calculated using the tufenkji elimelech equation tufenkji and elimelech 2004 values of c c 0 in eq 1 were obtained by integration of the btcs overall bacteria attachment efficiencies decreased after ft treatment table 2 for instance the attachment efficiency decreased by 72 0 2 and 95 1 7 after 4 and 10 ft in 10 mm kcl respectively moreover in the presence of ha the attachment efficiency decreased by 28 0 3 and 51 1 5 after 4 and 10 ft cycles respectively when compared to no ft the calculated attachment efficiencies table 2 were used to estimate setback distances between drinking water wells and manure spreading activities i e the length of the packed porous medium required for 99 9 3 log removal of bacteria in the pore fluid was calculated using the tufenkji elimelech equation by setting c c 0 0 001 our results demonstrate that the estimated setback distance would be greater after ft treatment hence manure management practices need to take into consideration the effect of cold temperature variations on the transport behavior of pathogens in this study cell suspensions stored in the same electrolyte at 10 c for an equivalent amount of time i e 128 hr and 320 hr without ft treatment exhibited no change in zeta potential tables s1 and s2 also the mean cell hydrodynamic diameter of starved cells was 0 8 0 0 μm after 320 hr in 100 mm kcl table s1 starved cells have been reported to decrease in volume kjelleberg and hermansson 1984 however 320 hr lb samples kept at constant 10 c no starvation exhibited the same cell size 0 7 0 3 μm the results in tables 1 and s1 suggest that variations in cell size and surface charge were not contributing factors in the observed bacterial retention following ft treatment at higher is 3 2 the release of s typhimurium cells from sand may increase following ft treatment the results of bench scale column studies showed that the risk of s typhimurium contamination could increase with ft it is also of interest to consider the impact of disturbances such as snowmelt or surface runoff on bacterial transport and on detachment of cells from sediment grain surfaces cells attached to aquifer or sediment grain surfaces can detach and re mobilize to better predict the transport behavior of s typhimurium under disturbed conditions we modeled porewater changes by injecting an electrolyte solution at lower is after obtaining a complete btc lowering the is of the pore fluid gives rise to more repulsive electrostatic interactions between the bacterial cells and the sand grains which may cause release of attached cells from the secondary energy minimum tufenkji 2007 after injecting 1 mm kcl to the packed columns that had been previously equilibrated at 10 mm kcl or 100 mm kcl or 10 mm kcl 5 mg l ha we observed a distinctive peak for released bacteria fig 2 a b d in general the percentage of detached cells was higher for bacteria that had been exposed to ft however for 10 mm kcl 1 mg l ha condition the bacteria before and after ft treatment were detached to the same extent when 1 mm kcl was injected to the column 3 3 s typhimurium become viable but non culturable vbnc after ft treatment viability as characterized by cell membrane integrity and culturability were measured for cells acclimatized at 10 c for 4 hr with no exposure to ft before ft and for cells exposed to 4 and 10 ft using baclight live dead and cfu assays respectively a cell is considered viable if the cell membrane is intact while a cell is considered culturable if it also has the ability to divide and replicate a vnbc cell cannot divide or replicate although it remains alive but could recover these abilities given environmental conditions that would restore its metabolic activity as presented in fig 3 a the culturability of the cells significantly decreased from 2 108 cfu ml to 3 106 and 7 106 cfu ml after 4 and 10 ft cycles in 10 mm kcl respectively p 0 05 the same trend was observed in 100 mm kcl 10 mm kcl 1 mg l ha and 10 mm kcl 5 mg l ha fig 3b c d the live dead assay results showed only 4 reduction in viability after 10 ft cycles in both 10 and 100 mm kcl indicating that s typhimurium cell membranes were resistant to ft temperature fluctuations in 10 mm and 100 mm kcl fig 3a and b thus after ft treatment the cells became less culturable but were still intact as measured by the baclight live dead assay the reduction in viability was more pronounced in model groundwater containing ha ha is known to lower the ph of the environment in this study the addition of 5 mg l ha to 10 mm kcl decreased the solution ph to 6 0 initially ph 6 5 the significant decrease in cell viability from 95 3 and 85 3 before ft treatment to 60 4 and 48 4 after 10 ft in 10 mm kcl 1 mg l ha and 10 mm kcl 5 mg l ha fig 3c and d respectively may be related to the slightly more acidic environment p 0 05 in this study s typhimurium survival uncertainty ranges between 1 2 under ft conditions and between 0 2 at constant temperature y enterocolitica survival uncertainty ranges between 2 4 under ft conditions and between 0 1 at constant temperature asadishad et al 2013 for b subtilis survival uncertainty ranges between 2 7 under ft conditions and between 0 1 at constant temperature asadishad et al 2014 in light of the review of uncertainty ranges reported in the previously published datasets above mentioned it seems freeze thaw may increase the overall survival uncertainty ranges of pathogen survival however this increase is minimal the culturability of the bacteria in electrolyte with ha was lower than the culturability in electrolyte without ha in all treatments before ft after 4 and 10 ft for example in 10 mm kcl 5 mg l ha the number of culturable bacteria decreased from 9 106 cfu ml 3 9 106 before ft to 1 3 103 cfu ml 6 9 101 after 10 ft in all other conditions 10 mm kcl 100 mm kcl and 10 mm kcl 1 mg l ha the culturability of the cells after 4 ft was lower compared to 10 ft this may be related to the fact that the cells acclimatized to the ft treatments and became more resistant to the cold variations after 4 ft additional studies are needed to better understand the s typhimurium ft stress response to predict whether the bacteria can build ft resistance in this study cell suspensions stored in the same electrolyte at 10 c for the same amount of time but without ft treatment showed no significant reduction in viability or culturability p 0 05 tables s3 s6 therefore the loss of culturability of the cells can be directly attributed to the temperature variations and ft exposure the analysis of s typhimurium viability revealed their unexpected resistance to ft in electrolyte without ha the reduction in viability was more pronounced in model groundwater containing ha which suggests that further investigation into the effect of dissolved organic matter on salmonella growth and survival is needed 3 4 s typhimurium forms less biofilm but has the potential to recover and re grow after ft to evaluate the effect of cold temperature and ft treatment on the survival strategy of s typhimurium biofilm formation and planktonic growth potential were evaluated overall after ft biofilm formation decreased and hence cells were more likely to remain in planktonic state biofilm formation decreased by 69 2 after 4 ft cycles fig 4 a reference controls were used to measure the effect of starvation and ft the control cell suspensions that remained in lb at 10 c with no ft for 128 hr duration of 4 ft cycles and for 320 hr duration of 10 ft cycles resulted in the same amount of biofilm formation as the control samples before ft the same result was observed for cell suspensions in 10 mm kcl after 320 hr at 10 c however after 128 hr in kcl at 10 c biofilm formation decreased by 62 3 this particular behavior indicates that s typhimurium was affected by starvation conditions after a duration corresponding to 4 ft cycles however after 320 hr in kcl the biofilm formation increased suggesting that starvation conditions did not affect biofilm formation after 10 ft the increase in biofilm formation observed in the lb or kcl controls may be attributed to cell acclimatization a similar trend was observed in planktonic growth patterns of s typhimurium planktonic growth decreased after 4 ft cycles and then increased after 10 ft relative to 4 ft overall the extent of planktonic growth decreased after ft treatment fig 4 the growth rates before and after ft treatment remained the same fig 4b however the lag phase and growth yields in lb broth at 37 c were affected planktonic growth started 50 min and 250 min later after 10 ft and 4 ft respectively a clear understanding of the processes governing s typhimurium ft stress responses is needed to understand whether the cells harbor ft or starvation resistance analysis of planktonic growth of s typhimurium at 10 c before and after ft treatment reveals the ability of bacteria to recover and grow during thaw temperature periods after 10 ft planktonic growth is reduced by 70 0 5 fig s2 but cells are still alive it only takes a small number of pathogenic cells to present a risk of contamination for instance salmonella cells can transfer into fresh produce through direct contamination of seedling or rainfall induced splashes that may contaminate the edible part of the plant jacobsen and bech 2012 the presence of 5 mg l ha inhibited the growth of s typhimurium at 10 c as described above this could be caused by the increase in acidity ph without ha 6 5 ph with ha 6 0 induced by ha but further studies need to be done to confirm the ph sensitivity of s typhimurium although ft exposure had little effect on cell membrane integrity most cells became viable but non culturable vbnc and their biofilm formation decreased moreover during thawing at 10 c s typhimurium cells could recover from their vbnc state the presence of ha was found to significantly impair s typhimurium culturability and to increase bacterial retention in model groundwater environments p 0 05 further investigation needs to be done to understand how the presence of ha may impact salmonella behavior in the environment this is especially important because the chosen ha concentrations for this study were relatively low to represent saturated zone conditions in future studies it may be of interest to examine the impact of higher concentrations of dissolved organic matter which may be more characteristic of manure land spreading sites furthermore this study shows that s typhimurium cells have little retention and high survival rates after experiencing ft cycles which makes it an important organism to be further investigated future work needs to analyse the virulence characteristics of s typhimurium cells isolated from manure that have survived prolonged exposure to cold temperature and repeated ft 4 conclusions subjecting s typhimurium to increasing numbers of freeze thaw cycles led to increased bacterial transport in saturated quartz sand and increased the likelihood of remobilization of retained cells to protect groundwater consumers from pathogen contamination for private and public water supply wells the setback distances between the location of water supply wells and manure spreading activities necessary to provide three log pathogen removal in uncoated sand could exceed 40 m depending on local aquifer conditions it is also noteworthy that the transport behavior of salmonella after ft exposure was in direct contrast with that previously observed in our laboratory using bacillus subtilis and yersinia enterocolitica this outcome points to the need for further studies with different pathogenic bacteria and particularly with strains indigenous to manure amended soils in an effort to understand the effects of environmental conditions on the risks for source water contamination

20029,groundwater contamination by bacteria poses a serious threat to our drinking water supplies in cold climate regions microorganisms introduced to upper soil layers by spreading of animal manure are subject to low temperatures and multiple cycles of freezing and thawing at the beginning of winter and during spring melt we investigated the influence of temperature fluctuations around the freezing point known as freeze thaw ft on the inactivation rates growth and biofilm formation of a manure isolated strain of salmonella typhimurium moreover the effects of ft on the transport characteristics of s typhimurium in quartz sand were monitored in model porewater solutions of two different ionic strengths is 10 and 100 mm kcl and two different humic acid ha concentrations 1 and 5 mg l increasing numbers of ft cycles were found to decrease the deposition of s typhimurium onto quartz sand and increase the percentage of detached cells in sand packed column experiments based on the calculated bacterial attachment efficiencies the predicted minimum setback distances between the location of water supply wells and manure spreading activities are higher when the effects of ft are taken into consideration while ft treatment significantly affected cell viability in the presence of ha most cells were in a viable but non culturable vbnc state with compromised ability to form biofilm this investigation demonstrates the effects of spring temperature variations in upper soil layers on s typhimurium properties and the potential increased risk of bacterial contamination in representative aquifer environments in cold climate regions graphical abstract image 1 keywords bacteria transport salmonella freeze thaw climate change public health risk groundwater contamination 1 introduction although animal waste can be beneficial to the soil ecosystem by adding organic matter that improves the water holding capacity and by providing an economical source of nutrients for plant growth it can also be a source of pathogen contamination brannan et al 2000 therefore it is important to evaluate the survival and transport behavior of pathogenic microorganisms when animal manure is applied onto agricultural fields gerba and smith 2005 the majority of these pathogens are enteric in origin and can cause waterborne diseases ewald 1991 some of the most common pathogenic microorganisms found in animal waste are salmonella spp yersinia spp vibrio cholerae campylobacter jejuni and pathogenic escherichia coli gerba and smith 2005 sidhu and toze 2009 salmonella spp alone are responsible for infecting annually an estimated 88 000 people in canada and 1 2 million people in the united states who consume food contaminated by animal waste or contaminated water jacobsen and bech 2012 thomas et al 2013 a study conducted in canada from 2014 to 2016 found salmonella to be the sole pathogen independently associated with severe disease in children presenting for emergency care with gastroenteritis freedman et al 2017 salmonella has been identified as a direct source of contamination of produce and well water and is therefore of particular concern borchardt et al 2003 bennett et al 2018 li and uyttendaele 2018 although not commonly associated directly with drinking water outbreaks salmonella was chosen as a representative bacterium in this study because it may be present in animal waste and groundwater while it presents a relatively lower biohazard in the laboratory as compared with the more pathogenic campylobacter or e coli o157 h7 salmonella typhimurium is a gram negative motile rod shaped bacterium approximately 0 7 1 5 μm in width and 2 0 5 0 μm in length bernard and wormser 2006 it has been shown to survive in cattle manure for 48 days and soil for 231 days greenberg 1964 in nature microorganisms are able to modify their properties to adapt to their environment and survive mindock et al 2001 thus environmental isolates may exhibit very different behaviors from laboratory strains mikkola and kurland 1988 for instance salmonella isolated from aquaculture environments was reported to exhibit increased survival properties and environmental escherichia coli isolates were found to have a higher electrostatic charge hydrophobicity and biofilm formation compared to lab cultures akinbowale et al 2006 yang et al 2012 many studies report the transport and survival behavior of salmonella using laboratory strains kim and surette 2005 dourou et al 2009 but few studies have examined manure isolates melendez et al 2010 to reduce the risk of pathogen outbreaks a better understanding of the effects of environmental conditions on the behavior and survival of naturally occurring microorganisms in representative aquifer media is required in quebec during the transition from winter to spring pathogens in surface soil are subject to repeated freeze thaw cycles it has been shown that repeated fluctuations in temperature could decrease the survival of microorganisms to a greater extent than a constant cold temperature asadishad et al 2013 2014 for instance survival rates of microorganisms such as yersinia enterocolitica bacillus subtilis and cryptosporidium parvum oocysts decrease after exposure to fluctuating cold temperatures asadishad et al 2013 2014 kato et al 2002 similarly escherichia coli o157 h7 and salmonella typhimurium experience loss in viability when the temperature of their holding environments varied in increments of 4 c and 7 c semenov et al 2007 temperature fluctuations may also affect bacteria transport behaviour by influencing their physicochemical properties such as cell membrane composition and surface chemistry or cell size for instance cold and freezing temperatures have an impact on the membrane and surface chemistry of bacteria mindock et al 2001 however different studies report contradictory results on the role of cold temperature on bacterial transport for example it has been demonstrated that cold temperature or ft events can lead to both enhanced mccaulou et al 1995 stevik et al 2004 or decreased transport of bacteria in the subsurface asadishad et al 2013 2014 found that pre exposure to temperature variations from 10 c to 10 c enhanced attachment of yersinia enterocolitica and bacillus subtilis onto model aquifer grains stevik et al 2004 found a reduction in attachment of escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium when temperature was decreased from 20 c to 3 c during the transport experiments in representative aquifer environments both temperature and dissolved organic matter affect the survival rate of microorganisms and are therefore important factors to incorporate in risk assessment studies of groundwater contamination avery et al 2004 chowdhury et al 2015 humic acids are the major organic constituents of surface soil and their concentrations can influence the transport and fate of microorganisms for instance the presence of humic acids reduced the attachment efficiency of salmonella cells onto a model aquifer grain glass bead surface chowdhury et al 2015 and significantly reduced their inactivation in terms of loss in culturability ramamurthy et al 2014 in this latter study the change in ph upon addition of nom was not accounted for and may have contributed to the observed effect the relative impacts of temperature fluctuations and humic acid levels on the risk of salmonella groundwater contamination may however vary because of the high potential for attachment of colloids at air water interfaces particularly in unsaturated soils note that the graphical abstract represents only the saturated zone of the land spreading risk pathway as a worst case scenario a few studies have investigated the inactivation and transport behavior of microorganisms in the presence of dissolved organic matter johnson and logan 1996 chowdhury et al 2015 or in response to variable temperature john and rose 2005 however most studies have overlooked the combined effect of varying cold temperatures in the presence of dissolved organic matter chowdhury et al 2015 davies and evison 1991 walker et al 2006 the aim of this study was to characterize the effect of cold temperatures and ft events typically encountered in southern canada on the survival and transport behavior of s typhimurium in model aquifer environments a systematic laboratory investigation was conducted to evaluate how variations in temperature and dissolved organic matter content in porewater influence the survival and transport behavior of s typhimurium in packed column experiments the scope of this study does not include the effect of freeze thaw on transport from topsoil to the water table but rather focuses on the risk of contamination through the water saturated flow transport pathways in model aquifer material 2 materials and methods 2 1 cell culture preparation a wild type strain of s typhimurium isolated from bovine manure in an agricultural site at saint simon montérégie québec and supplied by irda institut de recherche et de développement en agroenvironnement was used as the model microorganism the s typhimurium irda 4 5 i 1 2 stock cultures were stored in lysogeny broth lb with 30 glycerol at 80 c martinez et al 2005 bacteria were inoculated in sterile lb broth and grown overnight 18 hr to stationary phase 37 c 140 rpm for each experiment 1 ml of the fresh overnight culture was used to inoculate 30 ml of fresh lb broth cultures were grown to exponential phase for 4 hr at the same conditions harvested and washed by centrifugation 5 000g for 10 min at 10 c and re suspended in 50 ml of electrolyte 1 mm 10 mm 100 mm kcl to study the role of dissolved organic matter in some experiments the bacteria were suspended in 10 mm kcl containing 1 mg l or 5 mg l suwannee river humic acid ha as a representative dissolved organic matter international humic substances society without additional nutrients more details are provided in supporting information 2 2 freeze thaw treatment each ft cycle was 32 hr in total and the temperature profile comprised of four 8 hr time steps varying between 10 c and 10 c cell suspensions were prepared in seven 50 ml aliquots for different treatments 1 before ft samples were tested after being maintained at 10 c for 4 hr acclimatization 2 4 ft samples were exposed to 4 ft cycles 3 10 ft samples were exposed to 10 ft cycles 4 and 5 kcl samples were kept in electrolyte at 10 c for 128 hr or 320 hr the duration of 4 ft and 10 ft cycles respectively 6 and 7 lb samples were kept in lb broth reference sample with no starvation at 10 c for 128 hr or 320 hr this experimental matrix is similar to that used in our previous study asadishad et al 2013 the reference samples that remained at a constant temperature of 10 c in electrolyte or in lb broth allow us to distinguish between the influence of ft and starvation on bacterial properties respectively additional details are provided in supporting information 2 3 bacterial transport experiments transport experiments were performed inside chambers maintained at 10 c which is representative of groundwater temperature in southern canada lesage et al 1990 castro and tufenkji 2007 bacterial suspensions were injected into a glass column packed with granular quartz sand having a mean size of 256 μm us standard mesh size 50 70 sigma aldrich prior to conducting bacterial transport experiments the column was equilibrated by injecting 6 pore volumes pvs of background electrolyte solution kcl the rate of injection was 0 8 ml min equivalent to a darcy velocity of 14 7 m d for all column experiments to establish breakthrough curves the bacterial suspensions at a concentration c 0 were injected for 17 pvs followed by a cell free electrolyte solution for 3 pvs the concentration of the effluent c was measured in real time by uv visible spectroscopy agilent hp8453 at a wavelength of 600 nm using a 1 cm flow through cell mitzel and tufenkji 2014 finally to study the strength of bacterial attachment to the sand grains a cell free electrolyte at a lower ionic strength 1 mm kcl was injected into the column and the extent of bacterial detachment was quantified more details regarding the column experiment are provided in the supporting information 2 4 cell characterization the culturability of the cells was evaluated by counting colony forming units cfus on lb agar plates the viability of the cells was evaluated by assessing membrane integrity using the baclight live dead kit invitrogen the electrophoretic mobility epm and hydrodynamic diameter of the bacteria were measured using dynamic light scattering dls at 10 c using cells suspended in kcl before and after ft treatment zetasizer nano zs malvern castro et al 2010 details are provided in the supporting information the kcl and lb control data of the cell characterization experiments are presented in tables s1 to s7 2 5 biofilm and growth assays biofilm formation and growth curves were measured for each temperature treatment using a microtitre plate model merritt et al 2005 o toole et al 1999 to quantify the amount of biofilm formation and the amount of bacterial growth before and after temperature treatment the absorbance of solubilized crystal violet was measured using a microplate reader at 570 nm tecan infinite m200 pro switzerland karaca et al 2013 details are provided in the supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 the deposition of s typhimurium decreases with ft treatment the transport and deposition behavior of s typhimurium was evaluated over the range of solution chemistries for the control before ft cells and for cells exposed to 4 or 10 ft cycles bacterial retention onto sand grains decreased as the number of ft cycles increased in all solution chemistries fig 1 the extent of bacterial attachment was greater at higher is before ft for example the percentage of bacterial retention 1 c c 0 was 23 0 2 and 35 0 3 for the cells without treatment before ft in 10 and 100 mm kcl respectively fig 1a and b c c 0 was quantified by integrating the area under the breakthrough curves btcs the percentage of bacterial retention decreased to 4 1 7 after 10 ft in both 10 and 100 mm kcl the trend observed in bacterial retention after exposure to ft in salmonella was not in agreement with that previously observed in our laboratory using bacillus subtilis and yersinia enterocolitica asadishad et al 2013 2014 whereby those organisms exhibited higher retention on sand after exposure to ft because s typhimurium and y enterocolitica only rarely cause outbreaks in well water users it could be inferred that both pathogens have low mobility in representative aquifer environments under all climatic conditions including ft the dichotomy of high transport potential of s typhimurium after freeze thaw might be explained by the difference in type of isolates in our studies where s typhimurium was isolated from manure and y enterocolitica is a laboratory strain to take into account the starvation condition experienced by bacteria in groundwater environments we conducted column experiments with cells that had been maintained at 10 c in electrolyte no nutrients for 128 hr and 320 hr results shown in the supporting information fig s1 reveal that starvation is not responsible for the observed bacterial transport patterns in a set of parallel experiments the electrolyte was amended with dissolved ha to determine the effect of dissolved organic matter in representative aquifer environments on the transport behavior of bacteria exposed to ft the extent of bacterial attachment onto sand grains in the presence of ha also decreased after ft treatment fig 1c and d for example the percentage of cells retained onto sand before ft treatment was 30 0 3 and 85 0 4 in 10 mm kcl amended with 1 mg l and 5 mg l ha respectively and these values decreased to 10 1 5 and 22 2 2 after 10 ft treatment respectively interestingly an increase in bacterial retention onto sand was observed in the presence of 5 mg l ha when compared to pure electrolyte without ha this observation is contrary to the findings of some other studies of bacterial transport in the presence of dissolved organic matter knapp et al 1998 yang et al 2012 for instance foppen et al reported that the presence of humic acid decreased the attachment of escherichia coli atcc 25922 onto goethite coated sand foppen and schijven 2006 park and kim also showed that the attachment of e coli atcc 11105 onto iron coated sand decreased with increasing humic acid concentration park and kim 2009 abudalo et al found that the attachment of cryptosporidium parvum oocysts to ferric oxyhydroxide coated quartz sand decreased as the concentration of fulvic acid increased abudalo et al 2010 one explanation for the differences in the bacterial retention results could be related to differences in the granular media used in the other studies abudalo et al 2010 park and kim 2009 foppen and schijven 2006 the sand was coated with clays or metal oxides which would be masked by the humic acid resulting in decreased bacterial retention another factor that may have led to the observed differences in bacterial retention could be the aggregation of cells in the presence of ha in this study which in turn could lead to physical straining of the bacteria in the porous medium petosa et al 2013 this is supported by the larger hydrodynamic diameter 2 2 0 1 μm measured for bacteria in 10 mm kcl 5 mg l ha compared to ha free solutions of 10 mm kcl 1 2 0 2 μm table 1 aggregation would also lead to an increase in contact frequency with grain surfaces due to an increase in gravitational settling and interception tufenkji and elimelech 2004 the average cell size changed significantly as a result of ft treatment in 100 mm kcl with hydrodynamic diameters of 1 0 2 μm before ft and 0 7 0 2 μm after 10 ft under the no nutrient condition table 1 p 0 05 similarly the average cell size was smaller after ft treatment when cells were suspended in 10 mm kcl with or without ha p 0 05 the observed decrease in cell sizes after ft treatment may have influenced the single collector contact efficiency as well as any potential role of straining in bacterial retention bacterial zeta potentials were evaluated from epm measurements conducted over the range of experimental conditions and are presented in table 1 the results indicate that bacteria were negatively charged in all aqueous chemistries the absolute magnitude of the cell zeta potential tended to decrease with an increase in is of kcl zeta potentials of clean sand are also negative at these conditions 30 mv and 5 mv for 10 and 100 mm kcl respectively at ph 6 5 as reported elsewhere redman et al 2004 in 10 mm and 100 mm kcl the absolute zeta potential of bacterial cell surface charge did not change significantly after 4 ft from 27 to 28 mv for 10 mm kcl and 22 to 26 mm for 100 mm kcl p 0 05 but decreased to values lower than its initial value after 10 ft p 0 05 if classical dlvo derjaguin landau verwey overbeek interactions were controlling the bacterial transport behavior we would expect the cells exposed to 10 ft to exhibit higher retention than the untreated cells before ft however inspection of fig 1 reveals that this is not the case even for electrolyte solutions containing ha thus bacterial zeta potential data suggest that factors other than purely electrostatic forces were involved in controlling the transport behavior of ft treated s typhimurium it is likely that changes to the cell membrane properties e g membrane fluidity integrity of pili and flagella contributed to the different transport characteristics after being subjected to freeze thaw cycles that involve rapid changes in temperature as well as changes in salinity associated with salt exclusion during freezing our prior work with a model bacterial strain showed that motility flagellar activity and the stiffness of the cell silica bond were influenced by ft cycles asadishad et al 2014 for each experimental condition the bacterial cell sand attachment efficiency α pc was calculated using the following equation yao et al 1971 1 α p c 2 3 d c 1 θ l η 0 ln c c 0 where d c is the mean grain diameter θ is the bed porosity l is the packed bed length and η 0 is the single collector contact efficiency calculated using the tufenkji elimelech equation tufenkji and elimelech 2004 values of c c 0 in eq 1 were obtained by integration of the btcs overall bacteria attachment efficiencies decreased after ft treatment table 2 for instance the attachment efficiency decreased by 72 0 2 and 95 1 7 after 4 and 10 ft in 10 mm kcl respectively moreover in the presence of ha the attachment efficiency decreased by 28 0 3 and 51 1 5 after 4 and 10 ft cycles respectively when compared to no ft the calculated attachment efficiencies table 2 were used to estimate setback distances between drinking water wells and manure spreading activities i e the length of the packed porous medium required for 99 9 3 log removal of bacteria in the pore fluid was calculated using the tufenkji elimelech equation by setting c c 0 0 001 our results demonstrate that the estimated setback distance would be greater after ft treatment hence manure management practices need to take into consideration the effect of cold temperature variations on the transport behavior of pathogens in this study cell suspensions stored in the same electrolyte at 10 c for an equivalent amount of time i e 128 hr and 320 hr without ft treatment exhibited no change in zeta potential tables s1 and s2 also the mean cell hydrodynamic diameter of starved cells was 0 8 0 0 μm after 320 hr in 100 mm kcl table s1 starved cells have been reported to decrease in volume kjelleberg and hermansson 1984 however 320 hr lb samples kept at constant 10 c no starvation exhibited the same cell size 0 7 0 3 μm the results in tables 1 and s1 suggest that variations in cell size and surface charge were not contributing factors in the observed bacterial retention following ft treatment at higher is 3 2 the release of s typhimurium cells from sand may increase following ft treatment the results of bench scale column studies showed that the risk of s typhimurium contamination could increase with ft it is also of interest to consider the impact of disturbances such as snowmelt or surface runoff on bacterial transport and on detachment of cells from sediment grain surfaces cells attached to aquifer or sediment grain surfaces can detach and re mobilize to better predict the transport behavior of s typhimurium under disturbed conditions we modeled porewater changes by injecting an electrolyte solution at lower is after obtaining a complete btc lowering the is of the pore fluid gives rise to more repulsive electrostatic interactions between the bacterial cells and the sand grains which may cause release of attached cells from the secondary energy minimum tufenkji 2007 after injecting 1 mm kcl to the packed columns that had been previously equilibrated at 10 mm kcl or 100 mm kcl or 10 mm kcl 5 mg l ha we observed a distinctive peak for released bacteria fig 2 a b d in general the percentage of detached cells was higher for bacteria that had been exposed to ft however for 10 mm kcl 1 mg l ha condition the bacteria before and after ft treatment were detached to the same extent when 1 mm kcl was injected to the column 3 3 s typhimurium become viable but non culturable vbnc after ft treatment viability as characterized by cell membrane integrity and culturability were measured for cells acclimatized at 10 c for 4 hr with no exposure to ft before ft and for cells exposed to 4 and 10 ft using baclight live dead and cfu assays respectively a cell is considered viable if the cell membrane is intact while a cell is considered culturable if it also has the ability to divide and replicate a vnbc cell cannot divide or replicate although it remains alive but could recover these abilities given environmental conditions that would restore its metabolic activity as presented in fig 3 a the culturability of the cells significantly decreased from 2 108 cfu ml to 3 106 and 7 106 cfu ml after 4 and 10 ft cycles in 10 mm kcl respectively p 0 05 the same trend was observed in 100 mm kcl 10 mm kcl 1 mg l ha and 10 mm kcl 5 mg l ha fig 3b c d the live dead assay results showed only 4 reduction in viability after 10 ft cycles in both 10 and 100 mm kcl indicating that s typhimurium cell membranes were resistant to ft temperature fluctuations in 10 mm and 100 mm kcl fig 3a and b thus after ft treatment the cells became less culturable but were still intact as measured by the baclight live dead assay the reduction in viability was more pronounced in model groundwater containing ha ha is known to lower the ph of the environment in this study the addition of 5 mg l ha to 10 mm kcl decreased the solution ph to 6 0 initially ph 6 5 the significant decrease in cell viability from 95 3 and 85 3 before ft treatment to 60 4 and 48 4 after 10 ft in 10 mm kcl 1 mg l ha and 10 mm kcl 5 mg l ha fig 3c and d respectively may be related to the slightly more acidic environment p 0 05 in this study s typhimurium survival uncertainty ranges between 1 2 under ft conditions and between 0 2 at constant temperature y enterocolitica survival uncertainty ranges between 2 4 under ft conditions and between 0 1 at constant temperature asadishad et al 2013 for b subtilis survival uncertainty ranges between 2 7 under ft conditions and between 0 1 at constant temperature asadishad et al 2014 in light of the review of uncertainty ranges reported in the previously published datasets above mentioned it seems freeze thaw may increase the overall survival uncertainty ranges of pathogen survival however this increase is minimal the culturability of the bacteria in electrolyte with ha was lower than the culturability in electrolyte without ha in all treatments before ft after 4 and 10 ft for example in 10 mm kcl 5 mg l ha the number of culturable bacteria decreased from 9 106 cfu ml 3 9 106 before ft to 1 3 103 cfu ml 6 9 101 after 10 ft in all other conditions 10 mm kcl 100 mm kcl and 10 mm kcl 1 mg l ha the culturability of the cells after 4 ft was lower compared to 10 ft this may be related to the fact that the cells acclimatized to the ft treatments and became more resistant to the cold variations after 4 ft additional studies are needed to better understand the s typhimurium ft stress response to predict whether the bacteria can build ft resistance in this study cell suspensions stored in the same electrolyte at 10 c for the same amount of time but without ft treatment showed no significant reduction in viability or culturability p 0 05 tables s3 s6 therefore the loss of culturability of the cells can be directly attributed to the temperature variations and ft exposure the analysis of s typhimurium viability revealed their unexpected resistance to ft in electrolyte without ha the reduction in viability was more pronounced in model groundwater containing ha which suggests that further investigation into the effect of dissolved organic matter on salmonella growth and survival is needed 3 4 s typhimurium forms less biofilm but has the potential to recover and re grow after ft to evaluate the effect of cold temperature and ft treatment on the survival strategy of s typhimurium biofilm formation and planktonic growth potential were evaluated overall after ft biofilm formation decreased and hence cells were more likely to remain in planktonic state biofilm formation decreased by 69 2 after 4 ft cycles fig 4 a reference controls were used to measure the effect of starvation and ft the control cell suspensions that remained in lb at 10 c with no ft for 128 hr duration of 4 ft cycles and for 320 hr duration of 10 ft cycles resulted in the same amount of biofilm formation as the control samples before ft the same result was observed for cell suspensions in 10 mm kcl after 320 hr at 10 c however after 128 hr in kcl at 10 c biofilm formation decreased by 62 3 this particular behavior indicates that s typhimurium was affected by starvation conditions after a duration corresponding to 4 ft cycles however after 320 hr in kcl the biofilm formation increased suggesting that starvation conditions did not affect biofilm formation after 10 ft the increase in biofilm formation observed in the lb or kcl controls may be attributed to cell acclimatization a similar trend was observed in planktonic growth patterns of s typhimurium planktonic growth decreased after 4 ft cycles and then increased after 10 ft relative to 4 ft overall the extent of planktonic growth decreased after ft treatment fig 4 the growth rates before and after ft treatment remained the same fig 4b however the lag phase and growth yields in lb broth at 37 c were affected planktonic growth started 50 min and 250 min later after 10 ft and 4 ft respectively a clear understanding of the processes governing s typhimurium ft stress responses is needed to understand whether the cells harbor ft or starvation resistance analysis of planktonic growth of s typhimurium at 10 c before and after ft treatment reveals the ability of bacteria to recover and grow during thaw temperature periods after 10 ft planktonic growth is reduced by 70 0 5 fig s2 but cells are still alive it only takes a small number of pathogenic cells to present a risk of contamination for instance salmonella cells can transfer into fresh produce through direct contamination of seedling or rainfall induced splashes that may contaminate the edible part of the plant jacobsen and bech 2012 the presence of 5 mg l ha inhibited the growth of s typhimurium at 10 c as described above this could be caused by the increase in acidity ph without ha 6 5 ph with ha 6 0 induced by ha but further studies need to be done to confirm the ph sensitivity of s typhimurium although ft exposure had little effect on cell membrane integrity most cells became viable but non culturable vbnc and their biofilm formation decreased moreover during thawing at 10 c s typhimurium cells could recover from their vbnc state the presence of ha was found to significantly impair s typhimurium culturability and to increase bacterial retention in model groundwater environments p 0 05 further investigation needs to be done to understand how the presence of ha may impact salmonella behavior in the environment this is especially important because the chosen ha concentrations for this study were relatively low to represent saturated zone conditions in future studies it may be of interest to examine the impact of higher concentrations of dissolved organic matter which may be more characteristic of manure land spreading sites furthermore this study shows that s typhimurium cells have little retention and high survival rates after experiencing ft cycles which makes it an important organism to be further investigated future work needs to analyse the virulence characteristics of s typhimurium cells isolated from manure that have survived prolonged exposure to cold temperature and repeated ft 4 conclusions subjecting s typhimurium to increasing numbers of freeze thaw cycles led to increased bacterial transport in saturated quartz sand and increased the likelihood of remobilization of retained cells to protect groundwater consumers from pathogen contamination for private and public water supply wells the setback distances between the location of water supply wells and manure spreading activities necessary to provide three log pathogen removal in uncoated sand could exceed 40 m depending on local aquifer conditions it is also noteworthy that the transport behavior of salmonella after ft exposure was in direct contrast with that previously observed in our laboratory using bacillus subtilis and yersinia enterocolitica this outcome points to the need for further studies with different pathogenic bacteria and particularly with strains indigenous to manure amended soils in an effort to understand the effects of environmental conditions on the risks for source water contamination
