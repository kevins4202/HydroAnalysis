15975,neonicotinoids neos as the most consumed pesticides on a global scale have posed a serious threat to human health and ecological environment information regarding the emission history of neos is of great importance to improve the prediction of their environmental loading and biological risk potential in the present study contamination levels and compositions of 12 neos were identified in 8 sediment cores from the lingdingyang estuary which was impacted by agricultural emissions in riverine runoff of the pearl river basin for centuries the total concentration of 12 target neos 12neos ranged from 0 02 to 69 5 ng g dw along the sediment core profile with a mean of 12 9 15 9 ng g dw net deposition fluxes and concentrations of 5 parent neos experienced a remarkable exponential increase in the vertical profile of sediment cores except for imidacloprid imi despite the similar exponential growth before 2012 subsequent decreased levels of imi in historical sediment indicated its gradual replacement by other neos imi was the neo with the highest frequency of 80 3 and the highest mean concentration of 7 66 8 76 ng g dw the ecological risk assessment of neos suggests that 65 1 of sediment samples exceeded the chronic threshold for aqueous organisms using equilibrium partitioning approach since downward diffusion of neos in the lingdingyang estuary was rectified by their rapid desorption the sedimentary record probably provided an accurate illustration of agricultural neo emissions in the pearl river basin china the recent neo inventory in the adjacent waters of core sites was estimated with a mean of 76 8 tons yr this study provides insights into the role of agricultural emission in riverine runoff in the environmental loads of neos in the historical sediment

fatal toxicity to invertebrates raby et al 2018 hirano et al 2019 zhang et al 2021a khaldoun oularbi et al 2017 swenson et al 2013 zhang et al 2022 as long lasting pesticides neos were designed to be persistent in the environment zhang et al 2020b yi et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a as neos are routinely applied to agriculture they begin the passive transfer process among multiple environmental matrices i e atmosphere soil water and sediment with the help of rainfall and runoff yi et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 the riverine runoff plays a crucial role in the formation of the historical sediment in the estuary because it carries suspended sediment particles with neos from the upper river basin to the estuary liao et al 2017 the transport and accumulation of neos in riverine runoff resulted from previous application patterns are directly reflected in their concentrations in the affected sediment due to its deposition characteristics qiu et al 2019 hladik et al 2018 since neos have been developed and utilized in the pest management for three decades it is of great importance to delineate their emission history for better understanding of the environmental loads and to predict their potential exposure to humans and wildlife especially in agricultural regions due to the prohibition of organochlorine and organophosphorus pesticide use in early 1990 s neo congeners attained extensive application as soon as they were successively introduced into the global pesticide market zhang et al 2019b jeschke et al 2011 during the two decades from the first development in 1990 to 2010 neos have emerged as the most consumed pesticides worldwide with an annual production volume of 1 9 billion accounting for approximately 25 of the global pesticide market jeschke et al 2011 chen et al 2019 li et al 2020 the level of annual production of neos reached 40 million lbs in 2010 cimino et al 2017 currently the consumption of neos has already exceeded 30 of the market capitalization zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020b china is the largest producer of neos on a global scale and its production maintained a substantial increase in recent years shao et al 2013 for example the production of imi increased from 12 000 tons in 2012 accounting for approximately 67 of global production to 23 000 tons in 2016 fang 2017 the pearl river basin is considered one of the most developed agricultural regions in china chen et al 2019 considering the multiple cropping systems i e double or triple cropping in a year frequent agricultural activities require higher pesticide consumption including neos in the pearl river basin than other regions zhang et al 2021b according to statistical data approximately 52 9 34 6 tons of neos were released through riverine runoff of the pearl river basin into the south china sea in 2016 which was 35 0 and 19 6 greater than those of the yellow sea and the bohai sea in china respectively chen et al 2019 the amount and composition of applied neos are expected to fluctuate along with the temporal variation since they are influenced by application patterns production capacities and local regulations douglas et al 2015 kuechle et al 2019 short et al 2021 however few studies took historical trends and patterns of neos into consideration previous studies show that the sediment cores in aquatic environments provide accurate illustration of the historical emission and deposition of persistent organic pollutants li et al 2019a cao et al 2017 hale et al 2012 wei et al 2012 neos deposited in marine sediment cores in the lingdingyang estuary accumulating the majority of the pearl river runoff are expected to have the representative significance for the interference of their emission history in the pearl river basin gui et al 2019 he et al 2020 li et al 2019b accordingly the ecological risk of neos in the lingdingyang estuary should be evaluated to provide the potential for adverse ecological effects on the sensitive aquatic invertebrates considering the abundant biology diversity in the pearl river basin additionally the deposition of neos in marine sediment cores should take their downward diffusion into consideration li et al 2019a cao et al 2017 the downward shift is highly associated with the rapid desorption fraction frapid which can be accurately estimated by the tenax extraction method cui et al 2013 previous studies indicate that the frapid of organic pollutants is remarkably minimized after sufficient degradation meng et al 2015 mcclellan et al 2010 considering the prolonged degradation in the processes of alluvial and deposition marine sediments impacted by riverine runoff may reflect the accurate emission history of neos in the present study eight sediment cores were collected from the lingdingyang estuary of the pearl river which has a prolonged history of agricultural discharge the aims of the present study were to 1 determine concentrations and compositions of neos along the vertical profile to infer their historical deposition patterns 2 evaluate the downward diffusion of neos and the influence of frapid and 3 estimate the annual inventories of neos from agricultural discharge in the pearl river basin and extrapolate the role of riverine runoff for the mass loading of neos into oceans to the best of our knowledge this is the first systematic study associated with the historical deposition patterns and the annual inventories of neos in the pearl river basin china 2 materials and methods 2 1 collection and characterization of sediment cores eight sediment cores were collected from the western waters ww c1 c4 and eastern waters ew c5 c8 of the lingdingyang estuary that is subject to intensive impacts of agricultural riverine runoff fig 1 a columnar sediment collector was used for the collection of sediment cores during the drilling the water soil interface of the obtained core was maintained clear to ensure the sediment layers were not disturbed the obtained sediment cores were rapidly frozen in dry ice after transferred to laboratory the sediment cores were sliced at 4 and 5 cm intervals for ww and ew respectively with a stainless steel saw and then stored at 80 c the cores were lyophilized before the sample extraction procedures the relationships between the depth and age of sediment cores were determined based on the analysis of 210pb by Î³ ray spectrometry the detailed information of the specific procedure on the determination of the relationships between the depth and age of sediment cores were presented in text s1 in supplementary materials 2 2 sediment sample extraction standards and reagents used in the sediment sample extraction were presented in text s2 in supplementary materials the extraction procedure of the sediment samples for neos and their metabolites was based on the dispersive liquid liquid microextraction after lyophilization and trituration each sediment sample 5 00 g dry weight dw was accurately weighted and extracted using 20 ml mixture of acetonitrile and dichloromethane v v 2 1 for three times after centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 min the extract was transferred to a rotary evaporator and concentrated to 1 ml the concentrated solution was mixed with 0 8 g nacl 10 ml milli q water and 2 ml dichloromethane followed by vortex 1 min ultrasonic extraction 10 min and centrifugation 5 min at 4000 rpm the organic liquid layer was dried in nitrogen atmosphere and redissolved in 0 5 ml acetonitrile the extract was filtered by a 0 22 Î¼m membrane and transferred into a 2 ml sampler vial for further instrumental analysis 2 3 identification and quantification of neos the quantitative analysis of neos in the sediment samples was conducted by an hplc system agilent 1200 series equipped with an agilent g6410b triple quadrupole mass spectrometer and a zorbax sb c18 column 3 5 Î¼m Ã¸2 1 mm 100 mm agilent technology usa acetonitrile and 0 1 formic acid in water were respectively used as the solvents a and b of the mobile phase at a total flow rate of 0 3 ml min 1 the initial injection volume of samples was set to 2 Î¼l with the column temperature of 30 c twelve neo congeners including 6 parent neos and 6 environmental metabolites were analyzed in all the samples n 229 from 8 sediment cores the mrm transitions and other hplc ms ms conditions of neos were presented in table s1 the parent neos include imidacloprid imi thiamethoxam thm clothianidin clo acetamiprid ace dinotefuran din and thiacloprid tha the environmental metabolites of neos include 5 hydroxy imidacloprid 5 oh imi olefin imidacloprid of imi thiamethoxam urea thm urea n desmethyl acetamiprid n dm ace 1 methyl 3 tetrahydro 3 furylmethyl guanidine din g and 1 methyl 3 tetrahydro 3 furylmethyl din u quality control and quality assurance were presented in text s3 in supplementary materials 2 4 ecological risk assessment of neos in sediment cores ecological risk assessment of individual neos for water environment was based on the probabilistic risk by exposure distributions whose benchmarks are 35 and 200 ng l and for chronic and acute ecotoxicity for sensitive aquatic invertebrates respectively morrissey et al 2015 however there are no sediment benchmarks of neos for reference according to the equilibrium partitioning approach the sediment bound neos could be converted to their corresponding porewater concentrations for ecotoxicity risk assessment huang et al 2020 di toro et al 1991 the concentrations of neos in different samples were sorted in the descending order and their percentiles were calculated by eq 1 1 p e r c e n t i l e i 100 n 1 where i represents the numerical rank of neo concentration in porewater cpw which is estimated by sediment bound neo concentration cs the organic carbon fraction of the sediment foc and the corresponding organic carbon normalized partition coefficient koc di toro et al 1991 2 c s c p w f o c k o c 2 5 determination of rapid desorption fraction tenax aided desorption approach 24 h was used for the determination of the rapid desorption fraction frapid of neos in the marine sediments jia et al 2016 he et al 2017 briefly lyophilized sediment sample 5 g dry weight dw tenax beads 0 5 g and 0 2 nan3 solution 20 ml were transferred to a scintillation vial and then extracted at 200 rpm for 24 h nan3 was used as a microbicide for prevention of the neo degradation during the extraction after centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 min the supernatant and the tenax beads were pumping filtered by the ptfe micro pore membrane the tenax beads were collected and rinsed by milli q water neos on the tenax beads were extracted by 20 min sonication in the mixture of acetone hexane v v 1 1 10 ml for three times in a scintillation vial the extracts were combined and dried in nitrogen atmosphere followed by redissolving in 1 0 ml acetonitrile the rapid desorption fraction frapid was calculated by the desorbed and initial neos in sediment samples 2 6 calculation of downward diffusion the fraction of dissolved neos fiw the diffusivity in water diw the effective diffusivity coefficient dieff and the distance of downward diffusion x of neos can be calculated by eqs 3 7 in the sediment cores from the lingdingyang estuary white et al 2005 fuller et al 1966 schramke et al 1999 song et al 2004 3 f i w 1 r s w k d f r a p i d 1 4 k d k o c f o c

of sediment core sites in the lingdingyang estuary is approximately 610 km2 the calculation of net deposition flux is presented in text s4 in supplementary materials 3 results and discussion 3 1 neo levels and patterns in sediment cores table s2 depicts the descriptive statistics of neo compounds in the sediment cores n 229 neos in the sediment cores from the lingdingyang estuary of the pearl river were detected with high frequency of 80 8 the total concentration of 12 target neos 12neos in the sediment cores ranged from 0 02 to 69 5 ng g dw with a mean of 12 9 15 9 ng g dw compared with the surface sediments from regions on a global scale neos in the present study were much higher than those from the floodplain wetland sediments across missouri usa maximum 17 99 ng g dw mean 1 19 ng

reaches of the pearl river maximum 11 7 ng g dw mean 2 16 ng g dw zhang et al 2019a the guangzhou section of the pearl river maximum 2 59 ng g dw mean 1 12 ng g dw yi et al 2019 and the creeks in guangzhou china maximum 31 3 ng g dw mean 1 11 ng g dw zhang et al 2020b some obvious reasons for the high level of neos in the sediment are related to the fact that the lingdingyang estuary accumulate the majority of runoff and silt deposition from the pearl river gui et al 2019 he et al 2020 li et al 2019b since the application of neos dates back to the 1990s in china zhang et al 2021b the lingdingyang estuary of the pearl river has already been exposed to the contamination of neos for approximately three decades according to the statistical data in table s4 227 1 tons of pesticides 52 9 34 6 tons of neos were annually released into the south china sea from the pearl river basin chen et al 2019 where the input source of neos was considered to be nonpoint agricultural emissions thus the high level of neos in the sediment cores from the lingdingyang estuary was probably associated with local agricultural discharges the suspended particles with neos in the pearl river tend to deposit in the lingdingyang estuary due to its open and gentle terrains compared to the upstream narrow waterways fig 1 wang et al 2020 xia et al 2013 in addition the high concentration of neos in historical sediment samples may be attributed to the weak natural degradation due to their environmental persistence derived from their heterocyclic and chlorinated structures zhang et al 2020a meanwhile the emission of agrochemical wastewater is also considered a primary source of neos in the riverine runoff zhang et al 2019a yi et al 2019 zhang et al 2020b for the purpose of water purification the sorption of organic contaminants to solid particles is an important elimination pathway in agrochemical wastewater treatment and the adsorption capacities are closely associated with the hydrophobicity log k oc table s2 kim et al 2017 imi was the neo with the highest frequency of 80 3 in the historical sediment samples with a mean concentration of 7 66 8 76 ng g dw followed by of imi 66 8 0 37 0 70 ng g dw 5 oh imi 63 8 0 47 1 63 ng g dw thm 59 0 1 34 3 12 ng g dw ace 56 7 0 55 0 94 ng g dw thm urea 51 5 0 33 0 77 ng g dw n dm ace 42 8 0 13 0 28 ng g dw clo 40 6 0 31 0 68 ng g dw tha 39 7 0 68 1 42 ng g dw din 34 9 0 70 2 12 ng g dw din g 32 8 0 11 0 34 ng g dw and din u 29 7 0 27 0 94 ng g dw as the first generation neo imi has a long consumption history since 1990 before other congeners were developed and permitted to the domestic pesticide market in succession zhang et al 2020b raby et al 2018 accordingly the imi concentrations detected in the historical sediment samples are expected to be higher than other neos especially in the deep sediment layers in addition according to the historical patterns of individual neos presented in fig 2 a h imi is still considered the primary neo applied in the pearl river basin in recent years the consumption preference is probably responsible for the high imi concentration and detection frequency for a long historical period zhang et al 2021b table s3 depicts that the concentrations of 12neos were significantly different between ww and ew in the lingdingyang estuary p 0 001 in the 1 significance level with decreasing order ww ew the catchment area of ww contains the yunnan province guangxi province parts of guizhou province and western guangdong province in china covering an area of approximately 400 000 km2 in contrast the catchment area of ew only contains the eastern guangdong province with an area of approximately 35 000 km2 the reason for the high level neos in ww is probably related to the fact that more neos are accumulated in the larger catchment area of ww than in the smaller catchment area of ew fischer et al 2012 the low detection of neos in deep sediment layers in ew was most likely due to the slow sedimentary rate in ew approximately 2 56 cm yr text s1 in supplementary materials and the short consumption history of neos three decades this means that deep sediment layers in ew can date back to the time period before 1990s when neos were not introduced to china this is also believed to be the most probable primary reason for the lower detection frequencies of individual neos in the sediment cores from ew than those from ww fig 3 depicts the analysis results of pearson correlation r and spearman rank correlation Ï of individual neo concentrations and 12neos in the sediment samples from ww and ew in the lingdingyang estuary the simultaneous application of pearson and spearman rank correlations is intended to decrease the error derived from the non normal distribution of neo concentrations it is noteworthy that relatively strong correlations were exhibited between the parent neos in spite of ww and ew such as thm versus clo r 0 85 and Ï 0 93 for ww r 0 73 and Ï 0 81 for ew thm versus ace r 0 78 and Ï 0 91 for ww r 0 95 and Ï 0 99 for ew clo versus ace r 0 88 and Ï 0 96 for ww r 0 73 and Ï 0 82 for ew and din versus tha r 0 76 and Ï 0 95 for ww r 0 88 and Ï 0 96 for ew this may be attributed to frequent application of multi mixed neos for better insecticidal efficiency in commercial pesticide products song et al 2020 the similar exponential growth trends of the parent neo concentrations are also probably responsible for their strong correlations in the historical sediment samples over time fig s1 in addition clo is also considered an important environmental metabolite of thm wang et al 2019 which may help explain their strong correlations the correlations between neo congeners and 12neos indicate their contributions to 12neos such as imi as the dominant neo with the highest correlations of r 0 89 and Ï 0 91 for ww and r 0 95 and Ï 0 99 for ew however none of these correlations were significantly remarkable between parent neos and their corresponding metabolites which could be explained by the different microbial degradation intensities over time fu et al 2013 liu et al 2011 3 2 temporal trends among the 8 marine sediment cores in the lingdingyang estuary a remarkable increasing tendency was presented for neos in the vertical concentration profile fig 2a h the initial concentrations of neos close to the mdls in deep sediment layers traced back to 1990 or thereabouts thereafter the emissions of neo contamination into the lingdingyang estuary experienced a slow development before the middle of the first decade in the 2000 s which may be associated with the slow increase in the crop acreage and pesticide consumption in the pearl river basin fig 2i and j between 2005 and 2010 a remarkable increase in the neo level was detected from the historical sediment samples presenting an apparent response to the pesticide consumption and agricultural production output a sustained growth in the concentrations of neos was observed after 2006 coinciding with the upward trend in crop acreage after the sharp loss of cultivated land in the pearl river basin around 2005 fig 2j this may be attributed to the implementation of the responsibility assessment of cultivated land protection of provincial government in china in 2005 china s state council 2005 which provided support for protecting the cultivated land from illegal occupation at the national level despite the decrease in the pesticide consumption after 2016 fig 2i the contamination level of neos in the sediment samples was still on a remarkably upward curve which may be associated with the gradual restrictions of other pesticide products and neos as the alternative pesticides were applied in agricultural fields englert et al 2017 among the 8 sediment cores the concentrations of imi and its metabolites 5 oh imi and of imi detected in the historical sediment samples accounted for an absolute proportion 80 100 in the level of 12neos before the early 2000s this indicated that imi was the dominant neo pesticide in the agricultural application in the pearl river basin from its first registration to early 2000s along with the successive introduction and application of other neo congeners into the local pesticide market the proportion of imi and its metabolites in 12neos exhibited a remarkably continuous downward tendency over time especially after 2003 considering the downward diffusion of neos in sediment cores this condition approximately coincides the registration time of individual neo congeners in the domestic pesticide market cpin 2019 however despite the decrease in market share imi and its metabolites are still the primary neo contaminants in surface sediment layers accounting for approximately 30 and 45 of 12neos in ww c1 c4 and ew c5 c8 in the lingdingyang estuary respectively this result demonstrates that imi still plays an important role in the agricultural production among the different neo congeners in recent years this condition can be attributed to the multiple application methods i e seed treatment foliar sprays soil drenches granules and injection and diverse applicable crops table s5 of imi compared with other neos in addition the consumption preference after long term historical applications of imi may be responsible for its dominant role in neo contamination recently zhang et al 2021b similar temporal trends were observed among the parent neos in all 8 sediment cores from the lingdingyang estuary fig 4 and s1 present the net deposition fluxes and concentrations of 6 parent neos in core c1 as the representative sediment core site respectively exponential increases were observed for thm clo ace din and tha in the vertical profile of sediment cores since the 1990s fig s1 despite the decrease after 2012 a remarkable exponential growth was also presented in the concentration of imi over time in the historical sediment samples before it was gradually replaced by other neos these conditions indicate the rapid growth rate of the agricultural consumption of neos in the pearl river basin as shown in fig 4 all parent neo congeners increased exponentially at core c1 after 1990 with apparent doubling time t2 ranging from 2 1 to 3 3 years increases in the deposition fluxes were presented at core c1 depending on individual neos and most trends were statistically significant p 0 0001 3 3 ecological risk of neos in sediment cores considering there is no benchmarks for the ecotoxicity of neos in sediment the aquatic risks of neos in the sediment cores from lingdingyang estuary were evaluated by the conversion of sediment concentrations to water concentration through koc values according to eqs 1 and 2 huang et al 2020 as shown in fig 5 a the probabilities for the concentrations of individual neo congeners i e imi of imi 5 oh imi thm thm urea clo ace n dm ace din din g din u and tha in sediment porewater of ww c1 c4 over the acute threshold 200 ng l were 55 9 1 0 2 7 10 8 1 0 1 8 0 0 9 0 0 3 6 and 12 6 respectively for chronic threshold the corresponding probabilities are 73 9 25 2 20 7 35 1 27 0 24 3 19 8 4 5 18 0 6 3 10 8 and 29 7 respectively fig 5b depicts that the concentrations of imi thm din and tha in 47 5 6 7 0 8 and 7 5 of sediment porewater are higher than the acute threshold in ew c5 c8 respectively the probabilities over the chronic threshold in ew for imi thm ace din and tha are 57 5 24 2 19 2 10 8 and 17 5 respectively the ecological risks of imi in the present study were lower than those in guangdong and fujian provinces in china 64 for the acute risk and 100 for the chronic risk huang et al 2020 and the united states 82 7 for the chronic risk wolfram et al 2018 but higher than that in north liberty iowa 54 2 for the chronic risk webb et al 2021 accordingly regardless of ww and ew the neo with the highest ecological risk was imi in the present study followed by thm tha din and ace although there were no sample concentrations over the acute threshold ace had relatively high probabilities to exceed the chronic threshold this result also indicates the remarkably long term exposure risk of ace in addition the relatively high ecological risk derived from clo was presented for chronic exposure in ww according to fig 2 it is noteworthy that the relatively high concentrations of neos were concentrated in recent sedimentary layers which were associated with the increased ecological risk 3 4 influence of downward diffusion the apparent sedimentary concentration records of neos may be easily influenced by their migration downward within the sediment profile via diffusion in porewater li et al 2019a cao et al 2017 in the present study there were relatively obvious distributions observed for the parent neos and their corresponding metabolites which were in accordance with sedimentary records and their registration times for agricultural application in china fig 2 cpin 2019 the desorption of neo congeners from sediment phase into porewater is a prerequisite for their downward diffusion however their desorption process becomes progressively slower because neos are trapped in micropores of sediment samples li et al 2019a accordingly the contribution of slow desorption fraction fslow of neos to downward diffusion in porewater is negligibly small compared to its counterpart frapid which is considered the only fraction participated in the phase equilibrium with porewater you et al 2007 thus values of frapid are probably responsible for the vertical migration of neos in sediment cores in the present study tenax aided desorption was applied to determine the frapid of 12 neo congeners 6 parent neos and 6 metabolites in sediment core c8 table s6 the lowest and highest values of frapid were observed for tha and din respectively which are probably proportional to their hydrophilicities zhang et al 2021b subsequently the values of frapid were applied for the fraction prediction of the dissolved neos fiw and the downward diffusion based on eqs 3 7 accordingly the calculated values of effective diffusivity coefficient dieff and the downward diffusion distance x of imi as the dominant neo in core c8 were determined as 11 6 cm2 yr and 13 2 cm respectively in 30 years because its initial application time was around 1990 interestingly the estimated distance of downward movement for imi in core c8 was in close agreement with the observed distance 10 15 cm fig 2h for thm clo ace din and tha the effective diffusivity coefficients were estimated as 11 8 11 0 11 5 10 7 and 11 4 cm2 yr respectively therefore the downward diffusion probably resulted in the penetration of neo congeners to sediment layers deeper than the actual emission which indicated the decreased mobility and prolonged persistence of neos in marine sediments after deposition in addition the foregoing analysis also depicts that the time resolved concentration record of neos in marine sediment impacted by agricultural riverine runoff may reflect a relatively accurate historical deposition of neos in the study area 3 5 neo inventory and load estimation since concentrations of neos in sediment cores were identified to increase rapidly for several decades it is of great importance to estimate the annual inventory of neos in the lingdingyang estuary from agricultural emissions in the pearl river basin based on average sedimentation rates and porosity in eq 8 neo inventories in sediment cores c1 c8 were 585 77 251 26 331 98 485 57 106 22 97 4 74 05 80 93 ng cm 1 in the last two years 2019 and 2020 respectively accordingly the total neo inventory in the adjacent waters of sediment core sites in the lingdingyang estuary was estimated with a mean of 76 8 tons yr eq 9 interestingly the estimated inventory for neos were in close agreement with the total loading amounts of neos into the south china sea 52 9 34 6 tons reflected in the historical data in 2016 chen et al 2019 this result also indicates that a remarkable continuous increasing trend was presented in the inventory of neos in the lingdingyang estuary however it is evident that this inventory of neos was likely an underestimate for the lingdingyang estuary because only the core waters suitable for contamination deposition were considered in this study this is plausible because only the local consumption of neos was counted as the historical neo load in the year in addition the advective movement caused by ocean currents plays an important role in sedimentation of neos in the lingdingyang estuary li et al 2019a 4 conclusions the present study provides credible supporting evidence for sediment contamination of neos in the lingdingyang estuary and exhibits the time resolved record of neo congeners and their historical deposition patterns based on the vertical profiles of 8 sediment cores the contamination of neos detected in the covered historical period enabled a demonstration of the prominent roles of agricultural development and regulatory actions the riverine runoff of the pearl river basin impacted by agricultural emissions is considered a primary source for the neo loads in the marine sediment cores from the lingdingyang estuary with the possible influence of sediment resuspension and current advection the accelerated deposition of neo congeners to sediment may directly reflect their incremental consumption and the increasingly serious neo contamination in the pearl river basin the pearl river basin is one of the most densely populated regions on a global scale it is of great importance to guarantee drinking water sources against the contamination of neo congeners considering that the drinking water in this area is mainly derived from the pearl river the incremental consumption of neo pesticides may have negative impacts on human health and ecological environment furthermore neos are the most consumed pesticides on a global scale which indicates that similar contamination patterns of neos are likely to be presented in other regions accordingly non toxic alternative pesticides warrant further development to replace neos for protection of humans and other organisms from their contamination in water sediment and even foods regarding historical emission tracing of neo congeners or other persistent organic pollutants by sediment analysis the influence of downward diffusion through sediment porewater should be taken into consideration for concentration rectification of neos in different years this study provides additional evidence that the downward shift of neos is highly associated with the rapid desorption fraction frapid which can be accurately estimated by the tenax extraction method in addition the equilibrium partitioning approach could be used for ecological risk evaluation of persistent organic pollutants such as neos in sediment by converting the sediment contamination levels into porewater

15975,neonicotinoids neos as the most consumed pesticides on a global scale have posed a serious threat to human health and ecological environment information regarding the emission history of neos is of great importance to improve the prediction of their environmental loading and biological risk potential in the present study contamination levels and compositions of 12 neos were identified in 8 sediment cores from the lingdingyang estuary which was impacted by agricultural emissions in riverine runoff of the pearl river basin for centuries the total concentration of 12 target neos 12neos ranged from 0 02 to 69 5 ng g dw along the sediment core profile with a mean of 12 9 15 9 ng g dw net deposition fluxes and concentrations of 5 parent neos experienced a remarkable exponential increase in the vertical profile of sediment cores except for imidacloprid imi despite the similar exponential growth before 2012 subsequent decreased levels of imi in historical sediment indicated its gradual replacement by other neos imi was the neo with the highest frequency of 80 3 and the highest mean concentration of 7 66 8 76 ng g dw the ecological risk assessment of neos suggests that 65 1 of sediment samples exceeded the chronic threshold for aqueous organisms using equilibrium partitioning approach since downward diffusion of neos in the lingdingyang estuary was rectified by their rapid desorption the sedimentary record probably provided an accurate illustration of agricultural neo emissions in the pearl river basin china the recent neo inventory in the adjacent waters of core sites was estimated with a mean of 76 8 tons yr this study provides insights into the role of agricultural emission in riverine runoff in the environmental loads of neos in the historical sediment

fatal toxicity to invertebrates raby et al 2018 hirano et al 2019 zhang et al 2021a khaldoun oularbi et al 2017 swenson et al 2013 zhang et al 2022 as long lasting pesticides neos were designed to be persistent in the environment zhang et al 2020b yi et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a as neos are routinely applied to agriculture they begin the passive transfer process among multiple environmental matrices i e atmosphere soil water and sediment with the help of rainfall and runoff yi et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 the riverine runoff plays a crucial role in the formation of the historical sediment in the estuary because it carries suspended sediment particles with neos from the upper river basin to the estuary liao et al 2017 the transport and accumulation of neos in riverine runoff resulted from previous application patterns are directly reflected in their concentrations in the affected sediment due to its deposition characteristics qiu et al 2019 hladik et al 2018 since neos have been developed and utilized in the pest management for three decades it is of great importance to delineate their emission history for better understanding of the environmental loads and to predict their potential exposure to humans and wildlife especially in agricultural regions due to the prohibition of organochlorine and organophosphorus pesticide use in early 1990 s neo congeners attained extensive application as soon as they were successively introduced into the global pesticide market zhang et al 2019b jeschke et al 2011 during the two decades from the first development in 1990 to 2010 neos have emerged as the most consumed pesticides worldwide with an annual production volume of 1 9 billion accounting for approximately 25 of the global pesticide market jeschke et al 2011 chen et al 2019 li et al 2020 the level of annual production of neos reached 40 million lbs in 2010 cimino et al 2017 currently the consumption of neos has already exceeded 30 of the market capitalization zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020b china is the largest producer of neos on a global scale and its production maintained a substantial increase in recent years shao et al 2013 for example the production of imi increased from 12 000 tons in 2012 accounting for approximately 67 of global production to 23 000 tons in 2016 fang 2017 the pearl river basin is considered one of the most developed agricultural regions in china chen et al 2019 considering the multiple cropping systems i e double or triple cropping in a year frequent agricultural activities require higher pesticide consumption including neos in the pearl river basin than other regions zhang et al 2021b according to statistical data approximately 52 9 34 6 tons of neos were released through riverine runoff of the pearl river basin into the south china sea in 2016 which was 35 0 and 19 6 greater than those of the yellow sea and the bohai sea in china respectively chen et al 2019 the amount and composition of applied neos are expected to fluctuate along with the temporal variation since they are influenced by application patterns production capacities and local regulations douglas et al 2015 kuechle et al 2019 short et al 2021 however few studies took historical trends and patterns of neos into consideration previous studies show that the sediment cores in aquatic environments provide accurate illustration of the historical emission and deposition of persistent organic pollutants li et al 2019a cao et al 2017 hale et al 2012 wei et al 2012 neos deposited in marine sediment cores in the lingdingyang estuary accumulating the majority of the pearl river runoff are expected to have the representative significance for the interference of their emission history in the pearl river basin gui et al 2019 he et al 2020 li et al 2019b accordingly the ecological risk of neos in the lingdingyang estuary should be evaluated to provide the potential for adverse ecological effects on the sensitive aquatic invertebrates considering the abundant biology diversity in the pearl river basin additionally the deposition of neos in marine sediment cores should take their downward diffusion into consideration li et al 2019a cao et al 2017 the downward shift is highly associated with the rapid desorption fraction frapid which can be accurately estimated by the tenax extraction method cui et al 2013 previous studies indicate that the frapid of organic pollutants is remarkably minimized after sufficient degradation meng et al 2015 mcclellan et al 2010 considering the prolonged degradation in the processes of alluvial and deposition marine sediments impacted by riverine runoff may reflect the accurate emission history of neos in the present study eight sediment cores were collected from the lingdingyang estuary of the pearl river which has a prolonged history of agricultural discharge the aims of the present study were to 1 determine concentrations and compositions of neos along the vertical profile to infer their historical deposition patterns 2 evaluate the downward diffusion of neos and the influence of frapid and 3 estimate the annual inventories of neos from agricultural discharge in the pearl river basin and extrapolate the role of riverine runoff for the mass loading of neos into oceans to the best of our knowledge this is the first systematic study associated with the historical deposition patterns and the annual inventories of neos in the pearl river basin china 2 materials and methods 2 1 collection and characterization of sediment cores eight sediment cores were collected from the western waters ww c1 c4 and eastern waters ew c5 c8 of the lingdingyang estuary that is subject to intensive impacts of agricultural riverine runoff fig 1 a columnar sediment collector was used for the collection of sediment cores during the drilling the water soil interface of the obtained core was maintained clear to ensure the sediment layers were not disturbed the obtained sediment cores were rapidly frozen in dry ice after transferred to laboratory the sediment cores were sliced at 4 and 5 cm intervals for ww and ew respectively with a stainless steel saw and then stored at 80 c the cores were lyophilized before the sample extraction procedures the relationships between the depth and age of sediment cores were determined based on the analysis of 210pb by Î³ ray spectrometry the detailed information of the specific procedure on the determination of the relationships between the depth and age of sediment cores were presented in text s1 in supplementary materials 2 2 sediment sample extraction standards and reagents used in the sediment sample extraction were presented in text s2 in supplementary materials the extraction procedure of the sediment samples for neos and their metabolites was based on the dispersive liquid liquid microextraction after lyophilization and trituration each sediment sample 5 00 g dry weight dw was accurately weighted and extracted using 20 ml mixture of acetonitrile and dichloromethane v v 2 1 for three times after centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 min the extract was transferred to a rotary evaporator and concentrated to 1 ml the concentrated solution was mixed with 0 8 g nacl 10 ml milli q water and 2 ml dichloromethane followed by vortex 1 min ultrasonic extraction 10 min and centrifugation 5 min at 4000 rpm the organic liquid layer was dried in nitrogen atmosphere and redissolved in 0 5 ml acetonitrile the extract was filtered by a 0 22 Î¼m membrane and transferred into a 2 ml sampler vial for further instrumental analysis 2 3 identification and quantification of neos the quantitative analysis of neos in the sediment samples was conducted by an hplc system agilent 1200 series equipped with an agilent g6410b triple quadrupole mass spectrometer and a zorbax sb c18 column 3 5 Î¼m Ã¸2 1 mm 100 mm agilent technology usa acetonitrile and 0 1 formic acid in water were respectively used as the solvents a and b of the mobile phase at a total flow rate of 0 3 ml min 1 the initial injection volume of samples was set to 2 Î¼l with the column temperature of 30 c twelve neo congeners including 6 parent neos and 6 environmental metabolites were analyzed in all the samples n 229 from 8 sediment cores the mrm transitions and other hplc ms ms conditions of neos were presented in table s1 the parent neos include imidacloprid imi thiamethoxam thm clothianidin clo acetamiprid ace dinotefuran din and thiacloprid tha the environmental metabolites of neos include 5 hydroxy imidacloprid 5 oh imi olefin imidacloprid of imi thiamethoxam urea thm urea n desmethyl acetamiprid n dm ace 1 methyl 3 tetrahydro 3 furylmethyl guanidine din g and 1 methyl 3 tetrahydro 3 furylmethyl din u quality control and quality assurance were presented in text s3 in supplementary materials 2 4 ecological risk assessment of neos in sediment cores ecological risk assessment of individual neos for water environment was based on the probabilistic risk by exposure distributions whose benchmarks are 35 and 200 ng l and for chronic and acute ecotoxicity for sensitive aquatic invertebrates respectively morrissey et al 2015 however there are no sediment benchmarks of neos for reference according to the equilibrium partitioning approach the sediment bound neos could be converted to their corresponding porewater concentrations for ecotoxicity risk assessment huang et al 2020 di toro et al 1991 the concentrations of neos in different samples were sorted in the descending order and their percentiles were calculated by eq 1 1 p e r c e n t i l e i 100 n 1 where i represents the numerical rank of neo concentration in porewater cpw which is estimated by sediment bound neo concentration cs the organic carbon fraction of the sediment foc and the corresponding organic carbon normalized partition coefficient koc di toro et al 1991 2 c s c p w f o c k o c 2 5 determination of rapid desorption fraction tenax aided desorption approach 24 h was used for the determination of the rapid desorption fraction frapid of neos in the marine sediments jia et al 2016 he et al 2017 briefly lyophilized sediment sample 5 g dry weight dw tenax beads 0 5 g and 0 2 nan3 solution 20 ml were transferred to a scintillation vial and then extracted at 200 rpm for 24 h nan3 was used as a microbicide for prevention of the neo degradation during the extraction after centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 min the supernatant and the tenax beads were pumping filtered by the ptfe micro pore membrane the tenax beads were collected and rinsed by milli q water neos on the tenax beads were extracted by 20 min sonication in the mixture of acetone hexane v v 1 1 10 ml for three times in a scintillation vial the extracts were combined and dried in nitrogen atmosphere followed by redissolving in 1 0 ml acetonitrile the rapid desorption fraction frapid was calculated by the desorbed and initial neos in sediment samples 2 6 calculation of downward diffusion the fraction of dissolved neos fiw the diffusivity in water diw the effective diffusivity coefficient dieff and the distance of downward diffusion x of neos can be calculated by eqs 3 7 in the sediment cores from the lingdingyang estuary white et al 2005 fuller et al 1966 schramke et al 1999 song et al 2004 3 f i w 1 r s w k d f r a p i d 1 4 k d k o c f o c

levels and patterns in sediment cores table s2 depicts the descriptive statistics of neo compounds in the sediment cores n 229 neos in the sediment cores from the lingdingyang estuary of the pearl river were detected with high frequency of 80 8 the total concentration of 12 target neos 12neos in the sediment cores ranged from 0 02 to 69 5 ng g dw with a mean of 12 9 15 9 ng g dw compared with the surface sediments from regions on a global scale neos in the present study were much higher than those from the floodplain wetland sediments across missouri usa maximum 17 99 ng g dw mean 1 19 ng

guangzhou china maximum 31 3 ng g dw mean 1 11 ng g dw zhang et al 2020b some obvious reasons for the high level of neos in the sediment are related to the fact that the lingdingyang estuary accumulate the majority of runoff and silt deposition from the pearl river gui et al 2019 he et al 2020 li et al 2019b since the application of neos dates back to the 1990s in china zhang et al 2021b the lingdingyang estuary of the pearl river has already been exposed to the contamination of neos for approximately three decades according to the statistical data in table s4 227 1 tons of pesticides 52 9 34 6 tons of neos were annually released into the south china sea from the pearl river basin chen et al 2019 where the input source of neos was considered to be nonpoint agricultural emissions thus the high level of neos in the sediment cores from the lingdingyang estuary was probably associated with local agricultural discharges the suspended particles with neos in the pearl river tend to deposit in the lingdingyang estuary due to its open and gentle terrains compared to the upstream narrow waterways fig 1 wang et al 2020 xia et al 2013 in addition the high concentration of neos in historical sediment samples may be attributed to the weak natural degradation due to their environmental persistence derived from their heterocyclic and chlorinated structures zhang et al 2020a meanwhile the emission of agrochemical wastewater is also considered a primary source of neos in the riverine runoff zhang et al 2019a yi et al 2019 zhang et al 2020b for the purpose of water purification the sorption of organic contaminants to solid particles is an important elimination pathway in agrochemical wastewater treatment and the adsorption capacities are closely associated with the hydrophobicity log k oc table s2 kim et al 2017 imi was the neo with the highest frequency of 80 3 in the historical sediment samples with a mean concentration of 7 66 8 76 ng g dw followed by of imi 66 8 0 37 0 70 ng g dw 5 oh imi 63 8 0 47 1 63 ng g dw thm 59 0 1 34 3 12 ng g dw ace 56 7 0 55 0 94 ng g dw thm urea 51 5 0 33 0 77 ng g dw n dm ace 42 8 0 13 0 28 ng g dw clo 40 6 0 31 0 68 ng g

other congeners were developed and permitted to the domestic pesticide market in succession zhang et al 2020b raby et al 2018 accordingly the imi concentrations detected in the historical sediment samples are expected to be higher than other neos especially in the deep sediment layers in addition according to the historical patterns of individual neos presented in fig 2 a h imi is still considered the primary neo applied in the pearl river basin in recent years the consumption preference is probably responsible for the high imi concentration and detection frequency for a long historical period zhang et al 2021b table s3 depicts that the concentrations of 12neos were significantly different between ww and ew in the lingdingyang estuary p 0 001 in the 1 significance level with decreasing order ww ew the catchment area of ww contains the yunnan province guangxi province parts of guizhou province and western guangdong province in china covering an area of approximately 400 000 km2 in contrast the catchment area of ew only contains the eastern guangdong province with an area of approximately 35 000 km2 the reason for the high level neos in ww is probably related to the fact that more neos are accumulated in the larger catchment area of ww than in the smaller catchment area of ew fischer et al 2012 the low detection of neos in deep sediment layers in ew was most likely due to the slow sedimentary rate in ew approximately 2 56 cm yr text s1 in supplementary materials and the short consumption history of neos three decades this means that deep sediment layers in ew can date back to the time period before 1990s when neos were not introduced to china this is also believed to be the most probable primary reason for the lower detection frequencies of individual neos in the sediment cores from ew than those from ww fig 3 depicts the analysis results of pearson correlation r and spearman rank correlation Ï of individual neo concentrations and 12neos in the sediment samples from ww and ew in the lingdingyang estuary the simultaneous application of pearson and spearman rank correlations is intended to decrease the error derived from the non normal distribution of neo concentrations it is noteworthy that relatively strong correlations were exhibited between the parent neos in spite of ww and ew such as thm versus clo r 0 85 and Ï 0 93 for ww r 0 73 and Ï 0 81 for ew thm versus ace r 0 78 and Ï 0 91 for ww r 0 95 and Ï 0 99 for ew clo versus ace r 0 88 and Ï 0 96 for ww r 0 73 and Ï 0 82 for ew and din versus tha r 0 76 and Ï 0 95 for ww r 0 88 and Ï 0 96 for ew this may be attributed to frequent application of multi mixed neos for better insecticidal efficiency in commercial pesticide products song et al 2020 the similar exponential growth trends of the parent neo concentrations are also probably responsible for their strong correlations in the historical sediment samples over time fig s1 in addition clo is also considered an important environmental metabolite of thm wang et al 2019 which may help explain their strong correlations the correlations between neo congeners and 12neos indicate their contributions to 12neos such as imi as the dominant neo with the highest correlations of r 0 89 and Ï 0 91 for ww and r 0 95 and Ï 0 99 for ew however none of these correlations were significantly remarkable between parent neos and their corresponding metabolites which could be explained by the different microbial degradation intensities over time fu et al 2013 liu et al 2011 3 2 temporal trends among the 8 marine sediment cores in the lingdingyang estuary a remarkable increasing tendency was presented for neos in the vertical concentration profile fig 2a h the initial concentrations of neos close to the mdls in deep sediment layers traced back to 1990 or thereabouts thereafter the emissions of neo contamination into the lingdingyang estuary experienced a slow development before the middle of the first decade in the 2000 s which may be associated with the slow increase in the crop acreage and pesticide consumption in the pearl river basin fig 2i and j between 2005 and 2010 a remarkable increase in the neo level was detected from the historical sediment samples presenting an apparent response to the pesticide consumption and agricultural production output a sustained growth in the concentrations of neos was observed after 2006 coinciding with the upward trend in crop acreage after the sharp loss of cultivated land in the pearl river basin around 2005 fig 2j this may be attributed to the implementation of the responsibility assessment of cultivated land protection of provincial government in china in 2005 china s state council 2005 which provided support for protecting the cultivated land from illegal occupation at the national level despite the decrease in the pesticide consumption after 2016 fig 2i the contamination level of neos in the sediment samples was still on a remarkably upward curve which may be associated with the gradual restrictions of other pesticide products and neos as the alternative pesticides were applied in agricultural fields englert et al 2017 among the 8 sediment cores the concentrations of imi and its metabolites 5 oh imi and of imi detected in the historical sediment samples accounted for an absolute proportion 80 100 in the level of 12neos before the early 2000s this indicated that imi was the dominant neo pesticide in the agricultural application in the pearl river basin from its first registration to early 2000s along with the successive introduction and application of other neo congeners into the local pesticide market the proportion of imi and its metabolites in 12neos exhibited a remarkably continuous downward tendency over time especially after 2003 considering the downward diffusion of neos in sediment cores this condition approximately coincides the registration time of individual neo congeners in the domestic pesticide market cpin 2019 however despite the decrease in market share imi and its metabolites are still the primary neo contaminants in surface sediment layers accounting for approximately 30 and 45 of 12neos in ww c1 c4 and ew c5 c8 in the lingdingyang estuary respectively this result demonstrates that imi still plays an important role in the agricultural production among the different neo congeners in recent years this condition can be attributed to the multiple application methods i e seed treatment foliar sprays soil drenches granules and injection and diverse applicable crops table s5 of imi compared with other neos in addition the consumption preference after long term historical applications of imi may be responsible for its dominant role in neo contamination recently zhang et al 2021b similar temporal trends were observed among the parent neos in all 8 sediment cores from the lingdingyang estuary fig 4 and s1 present the net deposition fluxes and concentrations of 6 parent neos in core c1 as the representative sediment core site respectively exponential increases were observed for thm clo ace din and tha in the vertical profile of sediment cores since the 1990s fig s1 despite the decrease after 2012 a remarkable exponential growth was also presented in the concentration of imi over time in the historical sediment samples before it was gradually replaced by other neos these conditions indicate the rapid growth rate of the agricultural consumption of neos in the pearl river basin as shown in fig 4 all parent neo congeners increased exponentially at core c1 after 1990 with apparent doubling time t2 ranging from 2 1 to 3 3 years increases in the deposition fluxes were presented at core c1 depending on individual neos and most trends were statistically significant p 0 0001 3 3 ecological risk of neos in sediment cores considering there is no benchmarks for the ecotoxicity of neos in sediment the aquatic risks of neos in the sediment cores from lingdingyang estuary were evaluated by the conversion of sediment concentrations to water concentration through koc values according to eqs 1 and 2 huang et al 2020 as shown in fig 5 a the probabilities for the concentrations of individual neo congeners i e imi of imi 5 oh imi thm thm urea clo ace n dm ace din din g din u and tha in sediment porewater of ww c1 c4 over the acute threshold 200 ng l were 55 9 1 0 2 7 10 8 1 0 1 8 0 0 9 0 0 3 6 and 12 6 respectively for chronic threshold the corresponding probabilities are 73 9 25 2 20 7 35 1 27 0 24 3 19 8 4 5 18 0 6 3 10 8 and 29 7 respectively fig 5b depicts that the concentrations of imi thm din and tha in 47 5 6 7 0 8 and 7 5 of sediment porewater are higher than the acute threshold in ew c5 c8 respectively the probabilities over the chronic threshold in ew for imi thm ace din and tha are 57 5 24 2 19 2 10 8 and 17 5 respectively the ecological risks of imi in the present study were lower than those in guangdong and fujian provinces in china 64 for the acute risk and 100 for the chronic risk huang et al 2020 and the united states 82 7 for the chronic risk wolfram et al 2018 but higher than that in north liberty iowa 54 2 for the chronic risk webb et al 2021 accordingly regardless of ww and ew the neo with the highest ecological risk was imi in the present study followed by thm tha din and ace although there were no sample concentrations over the acute threshold ace had relatively high probabilities to exceed the chronic threshold this result also indicates the remarkably long term exposure risk of ace in addition the relatively high ecological risk derived from clo was presented for chronic exposure in ww according to fig 2 it is noteworthy that the relatively high concentrations of neos were concentrated in recent sedimentary layers which were associated with the increased ecological risk 3 4 influence of downward diffusion the apparent sedimentary concentration records of neos may be easily influenced by their migration downward within the sediment profile via diffusion in porewater li et al 2019a cao et al 2017 in the present study there were relatively obvious distributions observed for the parent neos and their corresponding metabolites which were in accordance with sedimentary records and their registration times for agricultural application in china fig 2 cpin 2019 the desorption of neo congeners from sediment phase into porewater is a prerequisite for their downward diffusion however their desorption process becomes progressively slower because neos are trapped in micropores of sediment samples li et al 2019a accordingly the contribution of slow desorption fraction fslow of neos to downward diffusion in porewater is negligibly small compared to its counterpart frapid which is considered the only fraction participated in the phase equilibrium with porewater you et al 2007 thus values of frapid are probably responsible for the vertical migration of neos in sediment cores in the present study tenax aided desorption was applied to determine the frapid of 12 neo congeners 6 parent neos and 6 metabolites in sediment core c8 table s6 the lowest and highest values of frapid were observed for tha and din respectively which are probably proportional to their hydrophilicities zhang et al 2021b subsequently the values of frapid were applied for the fraction prediction of the dissolved neos fiw and the downward diffusion based on eqs 3 7 accordingly the calculated values of effective diffusivity coefficient dieff and the downward diffusion distance x of imi as the dominant neo in core c8 were determined as 11 6 cm2 yr and 13 2 cm respectively in 30 years because its initial application time was around 1990 interestingly the estimated distance of downward movement for imi in core c8 was in close agreement with the observed distance 10 15 cm fig 2h for thm clo ace din and tha the effective diffusivity coefficients were estimated as 11 8 11 0 11 5 10 7 and 11 4 cm2 yr respectively therefore the downward diffusion probably resulted in the penetration of neo congeners to sediment layers deeper than the actual emission which indicated the decreased mobility and prolonged persistence of neos in marine sediments after deposition in addition the foregoing analysis also depicts that the time resolved concentration record of neos in marine sediment impacted by agricultural riverine runoff may reflect a relatively accurate historical deposition of neos in the study area 3 5 neo inventory and load estimation since concentrations of neos in sediment cores were identified to increase rapidly for several decades it is of great importance to estimate the annual inventory of neos in the lingdingyang estuary from agricultural emissions in the pearl river basin based on average sedimentation rates and porosity in eq 8 neo inventories in sediment cores c1 c8 were 585 77 251 26 331 98 485 57 106 22 97 4 74 05 80 93 ng cm 1 in the last two years 2019 and 2020 respectively accordingly the total neo inventory in the adjacent waters of sediment core sites in the lingdingyang estuary was estimated with a mean of 76 8 tons yr eq 9 interestingly the estimated inventory for neos were in close agreement with the total loading amounts of neos into the south china sea 52 9 34 6 tons reflected in the historical data in 2016 chen et al 2019 this result also indicates that a remarkable continuous increasing trend was presented in the inventory of neos in the lingdingyang estuary however it is evident that this inventory of neos was likely an underestimate for the lingdingyang estuary because only the core waters suitable for contamination deposition were considered in this study this is plausible because only the local consumption of neos was counted as the historical neo load in the year in addition the advective movement caused by ocean currents plays an important role in sedimentation of neos in the lingdingyang estuary li et al 2019a 4 conclusions the present study provides credible supporting evidence for sediment contamination of neos in the lingdingyang estuary and exhibits the time resolved record of neo congeners and their historical deposition patterns based on the vertical profiles of 8 sediment cores the contamination of neos detected in the covered historical period enabled a demonstration of the prominent roles of agricultural development and regulatory actions the riverine runoff of the pearl river basin impacted by agricultural emissions is considered a primary source for the neo loads in the marine sediment cores from the lingdingyang estuary with the possible influence of sediment resuspension and current advection the accelerated deposition of neo congeners to sediment may directly reflect their incremental consumption and the increasingly serious neo contamination in the pearl river basin the pearl river basin is one of the most densely populated regions on a global scale it is of great importance to guarantee drinking water sources against the contamination of neo congeners considering that the drinking water in this area is mainly derived from the pearl river the incremental consumption of neo pesticides may have negative impacts on human health and ecological environment furthermore neos are the most consumed pesticides on a global scale which indicates that similar contamination patterns of neos are likely to be presented in other regions accordingly non toxic alternative pesticides warrant further development to replace neos for protection of humans and other organisms from their contamination in water sediment and even foods regarding historical emission tracing of neo congeners or other persistent organic pollutants by sediment analysis the influence of downward diffusion through sediment porewater should be taken into consideration for concentration rectification of neos in different years this study provides additional evidence that the downward shift of neos is highly associated with the rapid desorption fraction frapid which can be accurately estimated by the tenax extraction method in addition the equilibrium partitioning approach could be used for ecological risk evaluation of persistent organic pollutants such as neos in sediment by converting the sediment contamination levels into porewater concentrations considering the absence of benchmarks for target contaminants in sediment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

been proposed in theoretical models and studied based on sampling of the water phase merle et al 2020 but has not been confirmed by direct measurements of adsorbed micropollutants in gac filters on a large scale in wastewater applications previous studies on the extraction of micropollutants baresel et al 2019 oesterle et al 2020 reif et al 2020 were not designed to reveal vertical adsorption profiles but rather intended to study such phenomena as biological regeneration and desorption of activated carbon extraction of adsorbed amounts of micropollutants at different filter depths and from different time points allows for mapping of sorption fronts and provides the potential for establishing an historical archive reflecting loading of compounds not necessarily included in sampling of the water phase and separation of the same either through sorption or biodegradation this study aimed to describe the adsorption profiles of accumulated micropollutants with different physicochemical properties in a large pilot scale gac filter at a wwtp the spatial and temporal developments of the adsorption profiles during 1 year of operation were determined through the extraction of micropollutants in gac media from 4 filter depths at 3 occasions in combination with a consistent monitoring of the micropollutant removal in the water phase 2 materials and methods pilot scale ultrafiltration uf and gac filtration units were operated in series downstream in a full scale wwtp fig 1 the removal of micropollutants in the full scale and pilot scale plants was monitored for 1

progression of adsorption fronts not captured by the sampling points would affect the estimates but were not considered and increased the uncertainties further accumulated removal of micropollutants in the gac filter was estimated from the water flow and the micropollutant influent and effluent concentrations si text s1 3 results and discussion removal in the wwtp were 40 for most micropollutants wherein the removal occurred primarily in the biological treatment table s4 certain compounds such as estrone ibuprofen and naproxen are biodegradable suarez et al 2010 shreve and brennan 2019 and showed removals of 80 whereas others including carbamazepine and oxazepam are recalcitrant wick et al 2009 tran and gin 2017 ejhed et al 2018 and showed 20 removal micropollutants were not removed significantly by uf table s4 the removal of micropollutants in the gac filter were high at 0 6000 bvs for most compounds 97 and decreased gradually to 18 000 bvs table s5 a majority of the positively charged compounds were continuously removed to more than 90 whereas most of the negatively changed compounds were removed to less than 80 at 18 000 bvs which is consistent with previous breakthrough studies nguyen et al 2013 meinel et al 2015 benstoem et al 2017 and affinity studies establishing adsorption isotherms gidstedt et al 2022 the effluent of the wwtp contained 13 6 1 6 mg l doc 0 21 0 06 mg l total phosphorous and 9 6 4 9 mg l of nitrogen species of which 4 3 6 mg l ammonium table s6 the uf treatment decreased the total phosphorous concentration to 0 04 0 03 mg l and the doc content to 12 5 1 5 mg l but had a minor effect on the nitrogen species table s6 during the operation of the gac filter a biofilm developed figs s3 s5 enabling nitrification of approximately 1 mg nh4 n l details of the wastewater characteristics are presented in si table s6 and fig s2 3 1 micropollutant extraction from gac media micropollutants were extracted in 5 cycles as shown in fig 2 the extracted amounts decreased with an increasing number of cycles and the last cycle contributed to less than 1 of the total amount that was extracted fig 2 relative standard deviations of the extracted amounts between replicates were generally less than 15 table s7 the applied method may not result in complete recovery of the investigated micropollutants oesterle et al 2020 reported varying recoveries carbamazepine 98 fluconazole 96 oxazepam 57 and trimethoprim 70 using the same solvents and a single extraction cycle with 10 min ultrasonication compared to 5 extraction cycles and 15 min of ultrasonication presented in this study nonetheless the applied method may still serve as a relative measure of the adsorbed amount since the extracted amount in the fifth cycle approached zero for all compounds figs 2 and s6 3 2 adsorption profiles in gac filter 3 2 1 stratification of adsorbed amounts of micropollutants the adsorbed micropollutants in the gac filter were first evaluated after 2600 bvs corresponding to 3 months of operation at 4 filter depths at which point the removal efficiencies in the gac filter were generally higher than 95 table 1 the amounts of micropollutants that were extracted per amount of gac media varied widely between micropollutants in the top layer of the gac filter table 1 ranging from 0 2 Âµg g for zolpidem to 90 Âµg g for metoprolol the extracted amounts reflect the influent concentrations of the micropollutants to the gac filter table 1 as higher amounts were extracted of micropollutants with high influent concentrations to the gac filter and vice versa variation in the influent concentrations table 1 and fig s1 may be associated with dry and wet weather conditions and temporal differences in usage and were prominent for the biodegradable compounds estrone naproxen and ibuprofen table 1 possibly connected to variations in the biological treatment in the full scale wwtp while the variations in imidacloprid concentrations table 1 were rather associated with the temporal use of the insecticide and is further discussed in a subsequent section 3 2 2 stratification and differences in the abundance of micropollutants through the filter bed were evident at 2600 bvs table 1 in table 1 the micropollutants have been ranked by their relative abundance in the top layer 10 20 cm in a recent study by gidstedt et al 2022 adsorption capacities qm ng mg to pac in wastewater were determined for a number of micropollutants from which several were included in this study compounds carrying a positive charge metoprolol atenolol trimethoprim venlafaxine gave the highest adsorption capacities which is in good agreement with the relative abundance results of 80 or more for these compounds at the filter depth 10 20 cm the neutral compounds oxazepam and carbamazepine both showed lower adsorption capacities gidstedt et al 2022 which is reflected by lower abundance in the top layer compared to the compounds with a positive charge further lower adsorption capacities were determined for fluconazole losartan diclofenac naproxen and sulfamethoxazole which is in agreement with the results in the present study pfos apart from other listed compounds in table 1 is a none aromatic compound hence lacking the ability of pi pi interaction which equips organic molecules with a sorptive potential keiluweit and kleber 2009 thus several compounds with high adsorption affinity to activated carbon moreno castilla 2004 guillossou et al 2020 such as ketoconazole propranolol sertraline and citalopram were found primarily in the top layer compounds with lower affinity to activated carbon boehler et al 2012 margot et al 2013 mailler et al 2015 kÃ¥relid et al 2017 cimbritz et al 2019 such as sulfamethoxazole pfos and losartan were also observed in the deeper layers of the filter corresponding to three quarters of the filter depth table 1 further compounds with similar chemical structures such as atenolol and metoprolol had adsorption profiles with comparable progression table 1 supporting a previous theory on the length of the mass transfer zone and the adsorption affinity to activated carbon kennedy and summers 2015 3 2 2 dynamics of adsorption profiles by extracting micropollutants from 4 filter depths at 2600 7300 and 15 500 bvs the accumulation of adsorbed micropollutants with various adsorption behaviors was studied theoretical models have proposed the progressions of adsorption fronts through gac filters resulting in sigmoidal breakthrough curves of micropollutants in gac filters tchobanoglous et al 2014 has been shown by extensive measurements of micropollutant concentrations in the water phase altmann et al 2016 zietzschmann et al 2016 merle et al 2020 extraction of micropollutants may provide additional insights of where micropollutants are accumulated in the filter bed and a possibility to differentiate between sorption and biodegradation as the observed adsorption profiles differ from the proposed theory biodegradation may be most prominent among micropollutants commonly degraded in conventional biological treatment during the first 10 000 bvs the breakthrough of doc increased gradually to 85 fig 3 biological degradation might account for the continuous removal of roughly 15 of the doc reungoat et al 2011 altmann et al 2016 benstroem 2017 because the adsorption front for doc is expected to have reached the deeper layers of the filter earlier than the micropollutants the number of available adsorption sites for micropollutants is most likely reduced preloading of dissolved organic matter in the deeper layers of gac filters has been described kennedy and summers 2015 further the adsorption capacity might differ along the filter bed because larger granules in the deeper layers tend to have a lower specific surface area and adsorption capacity than smaller granules in the top layers ruhl et al 2015 at 7300 and 15 500 bvs higher amounts of micropollutants could be extracted from the deeper layers of the filter figs 4 and s7 as seen for carbamazepine oxazepam and pfos which are persistent in conventional wastewater treatment wick et al 2009 stasinakis et al 2013 luo et al 2014 tran and gin 2017 ejhed et al 2018 lenka et al 2021 carbamazepine may be considered inert and recalcitrant to biological treatment clara et al 2004 suarez et al 2010 lakshminarasimman et al 2018 edefell et al 2021 and thus has been proposed as a reference compound bjÃ¶rlenius et al 2018 in the evaluation of micropollutant adsorption in gac filters the amount of extracted carbamazepine per amount of gac media increased in all filter layers during the operation from 2600 to 15 500 bvs however the amounts of carbamazepine were consistently lower in the deeper layers than the top layer of the filter as the adsorption front progressed through the filter bed fig 4 the results indicate that the capacity to adsorb micropollutants through the gac filter is influenced by both temporal and spatial changes whereas the extracted amounts of carbamazepine increased continuously over time the opposite pattern occurred for several micropollutants including estrone naproxen and citalopram fig 4 although the filter continuously removed 75 of the influent concentrations of these micropollutants table s5 the extracted amounts decreased over time estrone naproxen and citalopram were degraded in the full scale wwtp table s4 degradation is also possible in biofilm systems miÃ¨ge et al 2008 zorita et al 2009 suarez et al 2010 ejhed et al 2018 shreve and brennan 2019 which suggests that the biofilm in the gac filter contributed to the degradation of these micropollutants which explains the decrease in extracted amounts over time recent research with 14c labeled compounds has indicated that some but not all biodegradable micropollutants can be available for degradation after adsorption to gac betsholtz et al 2021 a temporal comparison of adsorption profiles for the different compounds fig s7 reveals that imidacloprid stands out with considerably higher amounts extracted in the second extraction at 7300 bvs compared to the first at 2600 bvs this way extraction data can be used to track specific compounds and to spot historical peak loading events potentially even from substances not included in analysis of the water phase fig 5 illustrates extraction data and influent and effluent concentrations for imidacloprid from the gac filter when comparing data from the second and the third extraction with the latter temporally corresponding to decreased and restored influent concentrations of imidacloprid to the filter two potential explanations appear for the reduced amount desorption and or biological degradation of previously adsorbed imidacloprid desorption could follow intermittent loading corwin and summers 2011 and may explain the decreasing amounts in the two top layers and the increasing amounts in the bottom layers at 15 500 bvs however the effluent concentration for imidacloprid was not increasing and typically below loq 1 3 ng l comparisons of the extracted and the accumulated amounts based on influent and effluent concentrations to the gac filter indicated that 70 80 of the influent amount of imidacloprid could be extracted from the filter media at 15 500 bvs in addition to desorption from the filter bed biological degradation of imidacloprid pang et al 2020 could have influenced the mass estimate although not further explored in this study 3 2 3 mass estimates estimations of accumulated removed amounts based on the influent and effluent concentrations to the gac filter was related to the extracted amounts of micropollutants the calculations should be seen as rough estimates as the uncertainties are increased by varying influent concentrations possible differences in densities of the gac media in the filter layers and an extraction method that may not fully quantify the adsorbed amounts this was a first attempt to use the extraction method and compounds with the most apparent trends are discussed whereas all compounds are shown in the si table s8 the accumulated removed amounts of the presumably nondegradable carbamazepine and oxazepam at 15 500 bvs were estimated to 23 Âµg g and 15 Âµg g respectively and the extracted amounts were estimated to 17 Âµg g and 11 Âµg g respectively table 2 which corresponded to about 70 of the accumulated removals the compounds were adsorbed throughout the filter layers and the spatial relative differences were less pronounced fig 3 although the extraction method may not fully quantify the adsorbed amounts these results indicate efficient extraction of the adsorbed micropollutants the accumulated removed amount of the biodegradable naproxen increased from 4 9 Âµg g at 2600 bvs to 32 Âµg g at 15 500 bvs whereas the extracted amount decreased from 7 1 Âµg g at 2600 bvs to 4 9 Âµg g at 15 500 bvs table 2 although the extraction may not fully quantify the adsorbed amounts of naproxen the extraction method could be used as a relative measure considering the decreasing amounts of extracted naproxen at 7300 and 15 500 bvs table 2 and fig 4 it appears as naproxen was available for biological degradation in the gac filter the differences in the accumulated removed amounts and extracted amounts of sulfamethoxazole and diclofenac also indicate biodegradation of these compounds the biodegradation of sulfamethoxazole in gac filters has been suggested rattier et al 2012 sbardella et al 2018 paredes et al 2016 and degradation of diclofenac has been indicated by detection of transformation products and other end products fundneider et al 2021b betsholtz et al 2021 during the initial stages of filter operation at 2600 bvs when there were large differences in extracted amounts of micropollutants of the investigated filter layers fig 4 the approximation overestimated the adsorbed micropollutant amounts tables 2 and s8 a higher number of sampling points would probably provide better results for more accurate estimates when the extracted amounts differ through the filter 3 3 removal efficiencies and adsorption profiles determining the micropollutant adsorption profiles through the gac filter at various number of treated bed volumes allowed alignment with the trends in removal efficiencies in the treated wastewater fig 6 in the early stages of the operation of the filter the removal efficiencies were high generally 97 fig 6a consistent with the findings for the adsorbed micropollutants at 2600 bvs at which none of the adsorption fronts had reached the bottom of the filter bed fig 6b over time as the number of treated bed volumes increased the various adsorption fronts penetrated further into the filter bed corresponding well with the declining removal efficiencies in the treated wastewater fig 6 sulfamethoxazole and pfos had the lowest removal efficiencies and were adsorbed to a high relative degree at all filter layers at the end of the operational period fig 6 these results confirm the suggested relationship between adsorption profiles and removal efficiencies tchobanoglous et al 2014 benstroem et al 2017 by tracking the amounts of micropollutants that are adsorbed through the gac filter bed it might be possible to improve the design modeling and operation of filters based on the transition of the adsorption front however this study shows that adsorption fronts should not necessarily be considered as sharp fronts as micropollutants could be extracted from the entire filter bed already at low number of treated bed volumes 4 conclusion extraction of adsorbed micropollutants from gac filter media at various filter depths and number of treated bed volumes together with monitoring of micropollutant removal efficiencies over 1 year of large pilot scale operation resulted in the following observations at a low number of treated bed volumes 2600 bvs most micropollutants were adsorbed in the top layers of the filter the adsorption front for doc reached the deeper layers of the gac filter earlier than the micropollutants reducing the available adsorption sites for micropollutants at increasing numbers of treated bed volumes 7300 15 500 bvs the micropollutant adsorption front progressed through the filter bed at varying rates the adsorption front of well adsorbing compounds such as propranolol and citalopram advanced slowly through the filter bed whereas compounds with lower adsorption affinity including sulfamethoxazole pfos and fluconazole progressed faster higher levels of adsorbed amounts in the bottom layer of the filter bed resulted in decreasing removal efficiencies of micropollutants

to decrease the competition for adsorption sites on the gac and reduce clogging and prolong the backwashing intervals for water and wastewater treatment gac filters in operation can be considered as stratified from at least 3 perspectives vertical stratification of the abundance of biofilm velten et al 2011 of granule sizes and densities frank et al 2015 and of the amounts of adsorbed micropollutants moreno castilla 2004 initial stratification of the abundance of biofilm in filters is created by decreasing biofilm concentrations along the flow path simpson 2008 yapsakli and Ã§eÃ§en 2010 velten et al 2011 gibert et al 2013 fundneider et al 2021b the backwashing of filters results in vertical stratification of granules by grain size and density wherein larger and heavier granules accumulate toward the bottom layers of the filter frank et al 2015 ruhl et al 2015 altmann et al 2016 the stratification of granules can also affect the adsorption capacity at different filter layers ruhl et al 2015 and may preserve adsorption fronts in the filter bed graese et al 1987 the amount of adsorbed micropollutants in the filter has been assumed to be stratified due to the declining concentrations of micropollutants in the water along the flow path moreno castilla 2004 putz et al 2005 tchobanoglous et al 2014 benstroem et al 2017 the adsorption profiles for different compounds can be described based on different zones with various degrees of saturation putz et al 2005 in saturated zones the adsorption capacity is expected to be depleted whereas adsorption proceeds in partially saturated zones also referred to as mass transfer zones putz et al 2005 tchobanoglous et al 2014 benstroem et al 2017 the travel velocity of the adsorption fronts and the length of the mass transfer zones are influenced by the chemical and physical properties of the micropollutants and the gac media kennedy and summers 2015 benstroem et al 2017 the progression of adsorption profiles has been proposed in theoretical models and studied based on sampling of the water phase merle et al 2020 but has not been confirmed by direct measurements of adsorbed micropollutants in gac filters on a large scale in wastewater applications previous studies on the extraction of micropollutants baresel et al 2019 oesterle et al 2020 reif et al 2020 were not designed to reveal vertical adsorption profiles but rather intended to study such phenomena as biological regeneration and desorption of activated carbon extraction of adsorbed amounts of micropollutants at different filter depths and from different time points allows for mapping of sorption fronts and provides the potential for establishing an historical archive reflecting loading of compounds not necessarily included in sampling of the water phase and separation of the same either through sorption or biodegradation this study aimed to describe the adsorption profiles of accumulated micropollutants with different physicochemical properties in a large pilot scale gac filter at a wwtp the spatial and temporal developments of the adsorption profiles during 1 year of operation were determined through the extraction of micropollutants in gac media from 4 filter depths at 3 occasions in combination with a consistent monitoring of the micropollutant removal in the water phase 2 materials and methods pilot scale ultrafiltration uf and gac filtration units were operated in series downstream in a full scale wwtp fig 1 the removal of micropollutants in the full scale and pilot scale plants was monitored for 1 year adsorption profiles in the gac filter were assessed through micropollutant extraction of gac media at 4 filter depths at 3 time points which is described in the following sections 2 1 wastewater

design flow of 12 m3 h and a bed volume of 1 7 m3 an equalization tank placed after the uf unit ensured continuous operation of the gac filter despite regular backwash of the uf membranes the gac filter was backwashed several times prior to commencement of the operation manual backwash of the filter was conducted at 6 14 week intervals for the duration of the study to reduce the filter pressure during the second half of the operational period the filter bed was loosened with compressed air weekly to reduce the filter pressure and prolong the backwashing intervals water flow in the pilot plant varied between 4 9 6 3 m3 h resulting in flux of the uf membranes of 30 45 l m2h and an empty bed contact time ebct in the gac filter of 16 21 min with an average of 19 min during the 12

taken as 24 h flow proportional samples from the wwtp and composite grab samples a mixture of 3 grab samples taken over 1 day were collected from the pilot scale units only minor differences in

for the 44 investigated micropollutants are listed in table s2 of the analyzed micropollutants 22 compounds were excluded due to low and varying influent concentrations to the gac filter which made estimating their removal efficiencies difficult the selected 22 micropollutants with sufficient abundance included the following compounds losartan oxazepam zolpidem Î² blockers atenolol metoprolol propranolol analgesics diclofenac ibuprofen naproxen antibiotics clarithromycin erythromycin sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim antidepressants carbamazepine citalopram sertraline venlafaxine antifungals fluconazole ketoconazole the hormone estrone the insecticide imidacloprid and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos the micropollutants had a variety of physical and chemical properties and several of the

the 4 filter depths were used to estimate the mean amount that could be extracted from the gac filter Âµg micropollutant g gac possible variations in densities of the gac media in the filter bed and progression of adsorption fronts not captured by the sampling points would affect the estimates but were not considered and increased the uncertainties further accumulated removal of micropollutants in the gac filter was estimated from the water flow and the micropollutant influent and effluent concentrations si text s1 3 results and discussion removal in the wwtp were 40 for most micropollutants wherein the removal occurred primarily in the biological treatment table s4 certain compounds such as estrone ibuprofen and naproxen are biodegradable suarez et al 2010 shreve and brennan 2019 and showed removals of 80 whereas others including carbamazepine and oxazepam are recalcitrant wick et al 2009 tran and gin 2017 ejhed et al 2018 and showed 20 removal micropollutants were not removed significantly by uf table s4 the removal of micropollutants in the gac filter were high at 0 6000 bvs for most compounds 97 and decreased gradually to 18 000 bvs table s5 a majority of the positively charged compounds were continuously removed to more than 90 whereas most of the negatively changed compounds were removed to less than 80 at 18 000 bvs which is consistent with previous breakthrough studies nguyen et al 2013 meinel et al 2015 benstoem et al 2017 and affinity studies establishing adsorption isotherms gidstedt et al 2022 the effluent of the wwtp contained 13 6 1 6 mg l doc 0 21 0 06 mg l total phosphorous and 9 6 4 9 mg l of nitrogen species of which 4 3 6 mg l ammonium table s6 the uf treatment decreased the total phosphorous concentration to 0 04 0 03 mg l and the doc content to 12 5 1 5 mg l but had a minor effect on the nitrogen species table s6 during the operation of the gac filter a biofilm developed figs s3 s5 enabling nitrification of approximately 1 mg nh4 n l details of the wastewater characteristics are presented in si table s6 and fig s2 3 1 micropollutant extraction from gac media micropollutants were extracted in 5 cycles as shown in fig 2 the extracted amounts decreased with an increasing number of cycles and the last cycle contributed to less than 1 of the total amount that was extracted fig 2 relative standard deviations of the extracted amounts between replicates were generally less than 15 table s7 the applied method may not result in complete recovery of the investigated micropollutants oesterle et al 2020 reported varying recoveries carbamazepine 98 fluconazole 96 oxazepam 57 and trimethoprim 70 using the same solvents and a single extraction cycle with 10 min ultrasonication compared to 5 extraction cycles and 15 min of ultrasonication presented in this study nonetheless the applied method may still serve as a relative measure of the adsorbed amount since the extracted amount in the fifth cycle approached zero for all compounds figs 2 and s6 3 2 adsorption profiles in gac filter 3 2 1 stratification of adsorbed amounts of micropollutants the adsorbed micropollutants in the gac filter were first evaluated after 2600 bvs corresponding to 3 months of operation at 4 filter depths at which point the removal efficiencies in the gac filter were generally higher than 95 table 1 the amounts of micropollutants that were extracted per amount of gac media varied widely between micropollutants in the top layer of the gac filter table 1 ranging from 0 2 Âµg g for zolpidem to 90 Âµg g for metoprolol the extracted amounts reflect the influent concentrations of the micropollutants to the gac filter table 1 as higher amounts were extracted of micropollutants with high influent concentrations to the gac filter and vice versa variation in the influent concentrations table 1 and fig s1 may be associated with dry and wet weather conditions and temporal differences in usage and were prominent for the biodegradable compounds estrone naproxen and ibuprofen table 1 possibly connected to variations in the biological treatment in the full scale wwtp while the variations in imidacloprid concentrations table 1 were rather associated with the temporal use of the insecticide and is further discussed in a subsequent section 3 2 2 stratification and differences in the abundance of micropollutants through the filter bed were evident at 2600 bvs table 1 in table 1 the micropollutants have been ranked by their relative abundance in the top layer 10 20 cm in a recent study by gidstedt et al 2022 adsorption capacities qm ng mg to pac in wastewater were determined for a number of micropollutants from which several were included in this study compounds carrying a positive charge metoprolol atenolol trimethoprim venlafaxine gave the highest adsorption capacities which is in good agreement with the relative abundance results of 80 or more for these compounds at the filter depth 10 20 cm the neutral compounds oxazepam and carbamazepine both showed lower adsorption capacities gidstedt et al 2022 which is reflected by lower abundance in the top layer compared to the compounds with a positive charge further lower adsorption capacities were determined for fluconazole losartan diclofenac naproxen and sulfamethoxazole which is in agreement with the results in the present study pfos apart from other listed compounds in table 1 is a none aromatic compound hence lacking the ability of pi pi interaction which equips organic molecules with a sorptive potential keiluweit and kleber 2009 thus several compounds with high adsorption affinity to activated carbon moreno castilla 2004 guillossou et al 2020 such as ketoconazole propranolol sertraline and citalopram were found primarily in the top layer compounds with lower affinity to activated carbon boehler et al 2012 margot et al 2013 mailler et al 2015 kÃ¥relid et al 2017 cimbritz et al 2019 such as sulfamethoxazole pfos and losartan were also observed in the deeper layers of the filter corresponding to three quarters of the filter depth table 1 further compounds with similar chemical structures such as atenolol and metoprolol had adsorption profiles with comparable progression table 1 supporting a previous theory on the length of the mass transfer zone and the adsorption affinity to activated carbon kennedy and summers 2015 3 2 2 dynamics of adsorption profiles by extracting micropollutants from 4 filter depths at 2600 7300 and 15 500 bvs the accumulation of adsorbed micropollutants with various adsorption behaviors was studied theoretical models have proposed the progressions of adsorption fronts through gac filters resulting in sigmoidal breakthrough curves of micropollutants in gac filters tchobanoglous et al 2014 has been shown by extensive measurements of micropollutant concentrations in the water phase altmann et al 2016 zietzschmann et al 2016 merle et al 2020 extraction of micropollutants may provide additional insights of where micropollutants are accumulated in the filter bed and a possibility to differentiate between sorption and biodegradation as the observed adsorption profiles differ from the proposed theory biodegradation may be most prominent among micropollutants commonly degraded in conventional biological treatment during the first 10 000 bvs the breakthrough of doc increased gradually to 85 fig 3 biological degradation might account for the continuous removal of roughly 15 of the doc reungoat et al 2011 altmann et al 2016 benstroem 2017 because the adsorption front for doc is expected to have reached the deeper layers of the filter earlier than the micropollutants the number of available adsorption sites for micropollutants is most likely reduced preloading of dissolved organic matter in the deeper layers of gac filters has been described kennedy and summers 2015 further the adsorption capacity might differ along the filter bed because larger granules in the deeper layers tend to have a lower specific surface area and adsorption capacity than smaller granules in the top layers ruhl et al 2015 at 7300 and 15 500 bvs higher amounts of micropollutants could be extracted from the deeper layers of the filter figs 4 and s7 as seen for carbamazepine oxazepam and pfos which are persistent in conventional wastewater treatment wick et al 2009 stasinakis et al 2013 luo et al 2014 tran and gin 2017 ejhed et al 2018 lenka et al 2021 carbamazepine may be considered inert and recalcitrant to biological treatment clara et al 2004 suarez et al 2010 lakshminarasimman et al 2018 edefell et al 2021 and thus has been proposed as a reference compound bjÃ¶rlenius et al 2018 in the evaluation of micropollutant adsorption in gac filters the amount of extracted carbamazepine per amount of gac media increased in all filter layers during the operation from 2600 to 15 500 bvs however the amounts of carbamazepine were consistently lower in the deeper layers than the top layer of the filter as the adsorption front progressed through the filter bed fig 4 the results indicate that the capacity to adsorb micropollutants through the gac filter is influenced by both temporal and spatial changes whereas the extracted amounts of carbamazepine increased continuously over time the opposite pattern occurred for several micropollutants including estrone naproxen and citalopram fig 4 although the filter continuously removed 75 of the influent concentrations of these micropollutants table s5 the extracted amounts decreased over time estrone naproxen and citalopram were degraded in the full scale wwtp table s4 degradation is also possible in biofilm systems miÃ¨ge et al 2008 zorita et al 2009 suarez et al 2010 ejhed et al 2018 shreve and brennan 2019 which suggests that the biofilm in the gac filter contributed to the degradation of these micropollutants which explains the decrease in extracted amounts over time recent research with 14c labeled compounds has indicated that some but not all biodegradable micropollutants can be available for degradation after adsorption to gac betsholtz et al 2021 a temporal comparison of adsorption profiles for the different compounds fig s7 reveals that imidacloprid stands out with considerably higher amounts extracted in the second extraction at 7300 bvs compared to the first at 2600 bvs this way extraction data can be used to track specific compounds and to spot historical peak loading events potentially even from substances not included in analysis of the water phase fig 5 illustrates extraction data and influent and effluent concentrations for imidacloprid from the gac filter when comparing data from the second and the third extraction with the latter temporally corresponding to decreased and restored influent concentrations of imidacloprid to the filter two potential explanations appear for the reduced amount desorption and or biological degradation of previously adsorbed imidacloprid desorption could follow intermittent loading corwin and summers 2011 and may explain the decreasing amounts in the two top layers and the increasing amounts in the bottom layers at 15 500 bvs however the effluent concentration for imidacloprid was not increasing and typically below loq 1 3 ng l comparisons of the extracted and the accumulated amounts based on influent and effluent concentrations to the gac filter indicated that 70 80 of the influent amount of imidacloprid could be extracted from the filter media at 15 500 bvs in addition to desorption from the filter bed biological degradation of imidacloprid pang et al 2020 could have influenced the mass estimate although not further explored in this study 3 2 3 mass estimates estimations of accumulated removed amounts based on the influent and effluent concentrations to the gac filter was related to the extracted amounts of micropollutants the calculations should be seen as rough estimates as the uncertainties are increased by varying influent concentrations possible differences in densities of the gac media in the filter layers and an extraction method that may not fully quantify the adsorbed amounts this was a first attempt to use the extraction method and compounds with the most apparent trends are discussed whereas all compounds are shown in the si table s8 the accumulated removed amounts of the presumably nondegradable carbamazepine and oxazepam at 15 500 bvs were estimated to 23 Âµg g and 15 Âµg g respectively and the extracted amounts were estimated to 17 Âµg g and 11 Âµg g respectively table 2 which corresponded to about 70 of the accumulated removals the compounds were adsorbed throughout the filter layers and the spatial relative differences were less pronounced fig 3 although the extraction method may not fully quantify the adsorbed amounts these results indicate efficient extraction of the adsorbed micropollutants the accumulated removed amount of the biodegradable naproxen increased from 4 9 Âµg g at 2600 bvs to 32 Âµg g at 15 500 bvs whereas the extracted amount decreased from 7 1 Âµg g at 2600 bvs to 4 9 Âµg g at 15 500 bvs table 2 although the extraction may not fully quantify the adsorbed amounts of naproxen the extraction method could be used as a relative measure considering the decreasing amounts of extracted naproxen at 7300 and 15 500 bvs table 2 and fig 4 it appears as naproxen was available for biological degradation in the gac filter the differences in the accumulated removed amounts and extracted amounts of sulfamethoxazole and diclofenac also indicate biodegradation of these compounds the biodegradation of sulfamethoxazole in gac filters has been suggested rattier et al 2012 sbardella et al 2018 paredes et al 2016 and degradation of diclofenac has been indicated by detection of transformation products and other end products fundneider et al 2021b betsholtz et al 2021 during the initial stages of filter operation at 2600 bvs when there were large differences in extracted amounts of micropollutants of the investigated filter layers fig 4 the approximation overestimated the adsorbed micropollutant amounts tables 2 and s8 a higher number of sampling points would probably provide better results for more accurate estimates when the extracted amounts differ through the filter 3 3 removal efficiencies and adsorption profiles determining the micropollutant adsorption profiles through the gac filter at various number of treated bed volumes allowed alignment with the trends in removal efficiencies in the treated wastewater fig 6 in the early stages of the operation of the filter the removal efficiencies were high generally 97 fig 6a consistent with the findings for the adsorbed micropollutants at 2600 bvs at which none of the adsorption fronts had reached the bottom of the filter bed fig 6b over time as the number of treated bed volumes increased the various adsorption fronts penetrated further into the filter bed corresponding well with the declining removal efficiencies in the treated wastewater fig 6 sulfamethoxazole and pfos had the lowest removal efficiencies and were adsorbed to a high relative degree at all filter layers at the end of the operational period fig 6 these results confirm the suggested relationship between adsorption profiles and removal efficiencies tchobanoglous et al 2014 benstroem et al 2017 by tracking the amounts of micropollutants that are adsorbed through the gac filter bed it might be possible to improve the design modeling and operation of filters based on the transition of the adsorption front however this study shows that adsorption fronts should not necessarily be considered as sharp fronts as micropollutants could be extracted from the entire filter bed already at low number of treated bed volumes 4 conclusion extraction of adsorbed micropollutants from gac filter media at various filter depths and number of treated bed volumes together with monitoring of micropollutant removal efficiencies over 1 year of large pilot scale operation resulted in the following observations at a low number of treated bed volumes 2600 bvs most micropollutants were adsorbed in the top layers of the filter the adsorption front for doc reached the deeper layers of the gac filter earlier than the micropollutants reducing the available adsorption sites for micropollutants at increasing numbers of treated bed volumes 7300 15 500 bvs the micropollutant adsorption front progressed through the filter bed at varying rates the adsorption front of well adsorbing compounds such as propranolol and citalopram advanced slowly through the filter bed whereas compounds with lower adsorption affinity including sulfamethoxazole pfos and fluconazole progressed faster higher levels of adsorbed amounts in the bottom layer of the filter bed resulted in decreasing removal efficiencies of micropollutants in the treated wastewater mass estimations indicated biodegradation for certain micropollutants such as naproxen diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole extraction of adsorbed micropollutants could provide an

water quality responses after wildfires are highly episodic extremely variable and dynamic over time the many factors which influence post fire water quality including catchment size topography fire

delivery rate expressed in g s 1 q is discharge and a and b are the sediment rating coefficient and exponent respectively 2 8 statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed in origin pro 2021 to aid comparative assessment of fire induced changes in water quality the post fire hydrograph period was divided into discrete intervals based on hydrograph peak timing similarity of hydrograph peak size and the apparent temporal behaviour of analytes as shown in fig 2d to assess the statistical significance of changes in mean median concentrations of analytes designated post fire hydrograph peaks and periods p1 p2 3 p4 6 p7 9 and recovery period see fig 2b c d were compared with corresponding analyte concentrations associated with equivalent q ranges derived from across the entire pre fire period fig 2d concentration c and discharge q relationships for selected intervals were based on the power law relationship 4 c aq b this was transformed into a linear relationship in double logarithmic space as 5 log10 c blog10 q log10 a where log10 a and b are the intercept and slope of the cq relationship respectively slopes close to zero are indicative of chemostatic behaviour whereas negative and positive slopes indicate dilution or mobilisation enrichment type behaviour respectively e g knapp et al 2020 for this study we normalised discharge by the average discharge of the entire monitoring period log10 q qmean as this approach yields intercepts a that better reflect expected concentrations at mean discharge knapp et al 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 aqueous chemistry changes in concentrations of key analytes in relation to the hydrograph and timing of key events are shown in fig 3 during the 3 5 year pre fire period the range of discharge values spanned 5 6 orders of magnitude and relatively stable concentrations of major ions were punctuated by minor excursions during flow events fig 3 in contrast the initial hydrograph peaks during the post fire period displayed distinct statistically significant p 0 01 increases in median values for most major ions as well as doc tss no3 n and po4 fig 4 maximum post fire concentrations exceeded pre fire medians in the order of po4 22x no3 n 21x doc 7 8x k 7 4x ca 5 7x so4 4 7x hco3 3 9x mg 3 6x cl 2 1x na 1 6x and although nh4 was over 104x greater pre fire data are limited most analyte maxima occurred during p1 or p2 3 and significant increases typically persisted for several months fig 4 attribution of the mass fish mortality at bellbrook during p1 to hypoxia is consistent with an excess oxygen demand driven by high tss and carbon rich ash materials similar to that described by dahm et al 2015 during the subsequent hydrograph peaks p2 9 and ensuing recovery period most analyte concentrations decreased monotonically to approximate background pre fire levels fig 4 the rate of decline in mean concentrations of analytes relative to pre fire means over time for the designated periods conform to negative power functions with exponents between 0 23 to 0 40 fig s4 na had notably divergent behaviour to most other cations and did not alter substantially during p1 9 fig 4 and fig s5 major ion chemistry during the pre fire period was a mixed na k hco3 type and underwent a shift towards a ca mg hco3 type during the initial post fire period reflecting increased solubilisation of ca and mg in ash materials p1 3 fig s6 the primary trends and magnitude of changes in post fire aqueous chemistry reported here are largely consistent with prior studies e g smith et al 2011 rust et al 2018 and reflect the behaviour of components known to increase in solubility in burnt soils and ash khanna and raison 1986 earl and blinn 2003 monotonic decreases in analyte concentrations and the reversion to background values within 3 14 months suggest the acute impacts of the fires on water chemistry were relatively short lived similar to some previous studies lane et al 2008 miller et al 2013 rust et al 2018 however other studies e g bladon et al 2008 rhoades et al 2011 murphy et al 2015 suggest potential for more sustained impacts 3 y especially for n and p cycling and thus a longer period of post fire monitoring in the macleay river is warranted 3 1 1 nutrients concentrations of dissolved inorganic n species and po4 were not only highly elevated but also very dynamic during the post fire period fig 5 for example there were three distinct peaks in po4 coincident with the first three p1 3 hydrograph peaks post fire fig 5a phosphate availability in soils can be enhanced by fire schaller et al 2015 and p often strongly associates with suspended sediment in fire impacted aquatic systems son et al 2015 it is therefore unsurprising that dissolved po4 was significantly positively correlated p 0 01 with tss during the post fire period fig s7 and the large increases in po4 likely reflect partial desorption of po4 from entrained ash and fire impacted soil materials post fire changes in inorganic n speciation reveal a complex and dynamic aquatic n cycling regime fig 5b d nh4 n concentrations increased by 2 3 orders of magnitude 105 Î¼m at the initial onset of flow during p1 exceeding the anzecc default guideline values for freshwater ecosystem protection by two fold https www waterquality gov au anz guidelines although this was relatively short lived 6 days fig 5c in contrast substantive increases in no3 n up to 155 Î¼m were delayed and did not occur until p2 3 fig 5b increases in no2 n were not as large up to 30 Î¼m and also relatively short lived 4 weeks fig 5d the net effect was din speciation being overwhelmingly dominated 80 by nh4 n during the first 6 days of the post fire hydrograph fig 6 peak concentrations of no3 reported here were relatively high equivalent to 9 6 mg l 1 as no3 compared to some fire related studies e g bladon et al 2008 mast and clow 2008 although were similar to peak values reported by lane et al 2008 and murphy et al 2015 consequently there were substantial temporary increases from 20 to 60 in the ratio of din dip during the p1 p9 period fig s8 although such shifts typically have implications for aquatic food web dynamics and can influence primary productivity benthic algae and n cycling microbial communities smith 2003 houser et al 2010 the ecological effect of the fire induced changes in nutrient stoichiometry require further investigation in the macleay river generation of ammonia via fire induced reduction of organic matter and soil derived n is a well established process e g khanna and raison 1986 stephens et al 2004 the substantial post fire changes in din speciation recorded here indicate ammonification was clearly an important yet short lived process that generated substantial soluble nh4 that was quickly leached from catchment soils without daily sampling this short term peak in nh4 could easily have been missed subsequent nitrification processes were relatively rapid suggesting that in stream n redox transformations likely had an important influence on the generation of no2 and no3 3 2 cq relationships background pre fire concentration discharge cq relationships for most major ions were relatively chemostatic or displayed mildly diluting type behaviour i e slopes 0 05 for hco3 cl ca mg k na fig 7 and 8 table s1 3 in contrast some analytes i e doc so4 no3 n po4 displayed a background mobilisation type behaviour with slopes 0 1 fig 7 and 8 during the immediate hydrograph peaks following the fires cq relationships for most major ions with exceptions of na and cl were highly distorted relative to both the pre fire and recovery periods fig 7 substantially higher intercepts reflecting higher mean concentrations combined with steeper slopes that indicate mobilisation type behaviour were evident for hco3 doc ca mg k po4 and nh4 n particularly during p1 fig 8 table s1 3 for most analytes there was a progressive reversion in cq relationships over time whereby both intercepts and slopes during the recovery period tended to approximate those of the pre fire period fig 7 and 8 an exception was a notable shift towards more negative cq slopes for ca mg and hco3 during the recovery period fig 7 table s1 3 mainly due to a tendency toward higher concentrations at lower flows this behaviour may reflect increased inputs of groundwater derived solutes from bedrock weathering during low flow during this period due to catchment groundwater recharging post drought or alternatively may be related to weathering of the abundant fine sediment that was deposited on the bed of the trunk channel following the fires the initial post fire cq behaviour of no3 n was distinctive fig 7 with strong dilution behaviour during p1 reflecting delayed onset of higher concentrations as described in section 3 1 1 consistent with prior studies smith et al 2011 din species displayed high variability combined with the greatest distortion in cq relationship slopes reflecting the dynamic changes in n biogeochemical cycling post fire this pattern of temporarily altered cq relationships whereby steeper slopes and mobilisation type behaviour occurred during initial post fire hydrographs is consistent with short term changes in dominant hydrological flow paths e g murphy et al 2018 and increased surface and overland flow favouring dissolution of soluble components abundant in ash materials burnt soil i e ca mg k hco3 doc nh4 po4 khanna and raison 1986 earl and blinn 2003 murphy et al 2018 additionally changes in the rotational direction of event scale concentration discharge hysteresis loops provide further evidence of changes in dominant hydrological flow paths during the initial post fire period for example po4 doc and k from discrete flow events during the pre fire and recovery period display counter clockwise rotation fig s9 which typically indicates higher concentrations of analytes in groundwater and interflow than event based surface water evans and davies 1998 in contrast during p2 in the post fire period the rotational direction inverts and becomes clockwise for po4 doc and k which is consistent with higher analyte concentrations in event based surface water evans and davies 1998 both na and cl displayed the least change in cq relationships which accords with the fact neither are strongly elevated in ash or burnt soils e g murphy et al 2018 3 3 suspended sediment suspended sediment tss increased by several orders of magnitude in the immediate post fire hydrograph period attaining maxima of 5500 mg l 1 fig 3 there was a clear and substantive increase in both the sediment rating curve coefficient a and exponent b during the post fire period when compared to the pre fire period fig 9 a b maximum rating exponent b values occurred during p1 fig 9b indicating the greatest non linearity in the relationship between discharge and sediment transport and thus sensitivity to erosion e g sheridan et al 2011 occurred during the initial hydrograph peaks immediately following the fires negative relationships between log a and the rating exponent b are commonly reported e g asselman 2000 sheridan et al 2011 coefficient and exponent pairs that plot on the same line such as observed for flow events during the pre fire period fig 9c indicate a similar sediment transport regime asselman 2000 although the relatively stable pre fire sediment transport regime of the macleay river was highly disturbed during the post fire period fig 9c both the rating coefficient log a and rating exponent b underwent a systematic and mostly monotonic decline with successive hydrograph peaks until the recovery period whereby coefficient and exponent values approached those of the pre fire period fig 9b c this suggests that within 3 14 months the catchment had largely recovered from the acute effects of the fires enhancing sediment erosion and transport sheridan et al 2011 reported similar systematic shifts in the relationship between the sediment rating coefficient and rating exponent as well as monotonic declines in both over an eight month period following fires in south east australia these systematic shifts likely reflect catchment properties that change over time following fire such as soil erodibility soil water repellency and vegetative ground cover as well as the rapid depletion of fine easily transportable sediments e g desilets et al 2007 sheridan et al 2011 noske et al 2016 the fact that erosion and suspended sediment transport clearly exhibits highest sensitivity to flow events that occur immediately after fire serves to highlight the risk of compounding effects of successive extreme events e g drought and fire followed by floods 3 4 doc characteristics doc spectral characteristics displayed substantial short term shifts during the post fire period e g increases in uv vis254 204 fig s5 analysis of fdom via eem reveals that during the initial post fire hydrograph peaks there was a sharp increase in both the humification index hix and the fluorescence response p i n ratio of region iii fulvic acid like to region i tyrosine like fig 10 these substantive perturbations persisted for 2 6 weeks and had no parallel during the prior or subsequent period of monitoring fig 10 while beyond the scope of the study these shifts in doc composition from labile tyrosine like compounds to more refractory fulvic acid like compounds likely induced changes in the aquatic microbial food web the lack of a similar magnitude shift in either the p iii n p i n ratio or hix during later high flow events in the recovery period 12 months later march 2021 fig 10 indicates these changes in fdom character were strongly associated with the fires yet they were also relatively short lived this is consistent with other recent investigations of wildfire impacts on stream water quality e g uzun et al 2020 that report similar short term increases in both hix and fulvic acid like components region iii during the initial flushing events following fire further analysis of eem data indicates that the sharp initial increase in the p iii n p i n ratio evident in the first 2 weeks after following onset of flow after the fires fig 10 was mainly due to strong attenuation of fluorescence response in region i tyrosine like fig 11 a comparing the excitation emission matrixes for sample a 2 08 2019 pre fire drought and low flow with sample b 13 01 2020 post fire p1 reveals an almost complete absence of a fluorescence response in region i in the post fire sample b fig 10 laboratory and field based investigations of leachate from burnt forest derived organic matter indicates that combustion can produce leachate with lower tyrosine like region i substances especially where there is high oxygen availability wang et al 2015a which is hypothesised as being connected with fire induced protein degradation wang et al 2015b both of the extreme events bracketed here fire and the preceding drought with low river flow influenced fdom characteristics for example fluorescence responses of region v humic acid like relative to region i tyrosine like fall along a distinct central scatter during most of the study period fig 11b however an unusually high fluorescence response occurred in region i during the summer drought low flow period immediately prior to p1 fig 11b region i tyrosine like and amino acid like fluorophores are readily derived microbially from algal biomass mostofa et al 2013 and can vary seasonally miller and mcknight 2010 the elevated region i fluorescence response during the drought low flow period may be related to the fact the macleay river can develop seasonally excessive aquatic algae especially during low flow summer periods ryder et al 2016 johnston et al 2020 3 5 monthly flow weighted mean concentrations and loads substantial increases in monthly flow weighted mean concentrations fwcm and monthly loads lm were evident for select analytes during the initial post fire period fig 12 for example fwcm suspended sediment in the post fire period was up to 108x higher than corresponding pre fire period means monthly suspended sediment export peaked during february 2020 at 1 1 t ha 1 40x higher than largest recorded value during the pre fire period however only 25 of the catchment upstream of the bellbrook monitoring station was burnt during the fires table 1 hence the areal estimates of suspended sediment lm post fire shown in fig 12 also include as the denominator a large proportion of the catchment that was not fire impacted therefore a more refined estimate of sediment yield specifically attributable to the fire effected areas during the february 2020 peak load can be derived as follows assuming the pre fire relationship between monthly discharge qm and monthly sediment load lm remained more or less constant for the unburnt portion of the catchment throughout the entire study period then the regression equation for the pre fire period fig s10 can be used to estimate the sediment load lm attributable to the unburnt portion of the catchment during february 2020 assuming the difference between this estimate and measured sediment yield for february 2020 is primarily attributable to additional fire induced erosion from the catchment area that was actually burnt during the fires then the monthly sediment export for fire impacted parts of the catchment during february 2020 is estimated at 3 7 t ha 1 when expressed on an annual basis sediment yields from the macleay river during the 1st year post fire are reasonably high compared to previously reported values smith et al 2011 for burnt catchments in se australia larger than 100 km2 fig 9d however they are of a similar magnitude to the estimated sediment yields for nsw australia following the 2019 fires reported by robinne et al 2021 and kemter et al 2021 derived from the revised universal soil loss equation rusle model estimates of sediment yield following fires are typically expressed on an annual areal basis however it is clear from this study that such an approach tends to poorly represent the actual scale of temporal heterogeneity for example the vast majority 85 of total sediment yield in the macleay during the entire monitoring period occurred within two separate months following the fires with a large fraction of that load occurring over the span of days fig s11 sharp increases in fwcm of dissolved analytes were mostly confined to the first several months post fire the magnitude by which fwcm during the post fire period exceeded mean fwcm during the pre fire period was greatest for nutrients po4 17x no3 n 12x nh4 n 84x limited pre fire data followed by k 5x ca and doc 4x and hco3 2 5x fig 12 dissolved analyte lm were highly variable with maxima typically occurring during the initial post fire period and diminishing rapidly thereafter although comparably large lm values were also attained during high flow events at the end of the study period march 2021 these are mainly a function of high discharge volumes rather than elevated concentrations fig 12 annual loads for doc po4 no3 n and nh4 n are shown in table 2 the values estimated here for post fire annual loads of po4 no3 n and nh4 n are of a similar order to those previously reported for burnt catchments bladon et al 2008 lane et al 2008 mast and clow 2008 smith et al 2011 although there were large increases in annual loads of po4 and no3 n during first 12 months after the fires 10x table 2 most of that flux was during the first two months fig 12 while it is clear the combination of extreme drought and severe fires followed by flooding caused a substantial increase in the flux of key nutrients to the macleay river this mainly occurred as a relatively short lived pulse however the potential impacts of this event on aquatic ecosystem function remains unquantified and warrants further attention 4 conclusions the combination of extreme drought and severe fires followed by flooding led to significant changes in aqueous chemistry at a large catchment scale yet there was relatively fast recovery over 3 12 months for most analytes highly distorted cq slopes and inversion of cq hysteresis loop rotation were consistent with short term alteration of hydrological flow paths and increased surface runoff in the post fire period mobilising soluble ions and nutrients from burnt soils and ash materials fire also caused large changes in aquatic n biogeochemistry with a marked dominance of nh4 during early stages of the post fire hydrograph exceeding water quality threshold guidelines followed by rapid nitrification both fire and drought substantially altered fdom characteristics the transient shifts in nutrients tss and doc likely resulted in ecological impacts however the magnitude duration and extent of these perturbations is unknown and requires further investigation the systematic temporal shifts in sediment rating curves indicate that floods closely following fires will have disproportionately large impacts on water quality and serves to highlight the compounding effect of sequential extreme events the large and rapid changes in aqueous chemistry observed here highlight the inadequacy of fixed interval sampling approaches to quantify the compound impacts on

water quality responses after wildfires are highly episodic extremely variable and dynamic over time the many factors which influence post fire water quality including catchment size topography fire

considered conservative 2 7 sediment rating curves tss was used to estimate suspended sediment concentrations and calculate daily suspended sediment loads as per eqn 1 sediment rating curves for selected time intervals hydrograph peaks were based on linear expression of the power law relationship as follows sheridan et al 2011 2 log10 qs log10 a b 1 log10 q where qs is the daily sediment delivery rate expressed in g s 1 q is discharge and a and b are the sediment rating coefficient and exponent respectively 2 8 statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed in origin pro 2021 to aid comparative assessment of fire induced changes in water quality the post fire hydrograph period was divided into discrete intervals based on hydrograph peak timing similarity of hydrograph peak size and the apparent temporal behaviour of analytes as shown in fig 2d to assess the statistical significance of changes in mean median concentrations of analytes designated post fire hydrograph peaks and periods p1 p2 3 p4 6 p7 9 and recovery period see fig 2b c d were compared with corresponding analyte concentrations associated with equivalent q ranges derived from across the entire pre fire period fig 2d concentration c and discharge q relationships for selected intervals were based on the power law relationship 4 c aq b this was transformed into a linear relationship in double logarithmic space as 5 log10 c blog10 q log10 a where log10 a and b are the intercept and slope of the cq relationship respectively slopes close to zero are indicative of chemostatic behaviour whereas negative and positive slopes indicate dilution or mobilisation enrichment type behaviour respectively e g knapp et al 2020 for this study we normalised discharge by the average discharge of the entire monitoring period log10 q qmean as this approach yields intercepts a that better reflect expected concentrations at mean discharge knapp et al 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 aqueous chemistry changes in concentrations of key analytes in relation to the hydrograph and timing of key events are shown in fig 3 during the 3 5 year pre fire period the range of discharge values spanned 5 6 orders of magnitude and relatively stable concentrations of major ions were punctuated by minor excursions during flow events fig 3 in contrast the initial hydrograph peaks during the post fire period displayed distinct statistically significant p 0 01 increases in median values for most major ions as well as doc tss no3 n and po4 fig 4 maximum post fire concentrations exceeded pre fire medians in the order of po4 22x no3 n 21x doc 7 8x k 7 4x ca 5 7x so4 4 7x hco3 3 9x mg 3 6x cl 2 1x na 1 6x and although nh4 was over 104x greater pre fire data are limited most analyte maxima occurred during p1 or p2 3 and significant increases typically persisted for several months fig 4 attribution of the mass fish mortality at bellbrook during p1 to hypoxia is consistent with an excess oxygen demand driven by high tss and carbon rich ash materials similar to that described by dahm et al 2015 during the subsequent hydrograph peaks p2 9 and ensuing recovery period most analyte concentrations decreased monotonically to approximate background pre fire levels fig 4 the rate of decline in mean concentrations of analytes relative to pre fire means over time for the designated periods conform to negative power functions with exponents between 0 23 to 0 40 fig s4 na had notably divergent behaviour to most other cations and did not alter substantially during p1 9 fig 4 and fig s5 major ion chemistry during the pre fire period was a mixed na k hco3 type and underwent a shift towards a ca mg hco3 type during the initial post fire period reflecting increased solubilisation of ca and mg in ash materials p1 3 fig s6 the primary trends and magnitude of changes in post fire aqueous chemistry reported here are largely consistent with prior studies e g smith et al 2011 rust et al 2018 and reflect the behaviour of components known to increase in solubility in burnt soils and ash khanna and raison 1986 earl and blinn 2003 monotonic decreases in analyte concentrations and the reversion to background values within 3 14 months suggest the acute impacts of the fires on water chemistry were relatively short lived similar to some previous studies lane et al 2008 miller et al 2013 rust et al 2018 however other studies e g bladon et al 2008 rhoades et al 2011 murphy et al 2015 suggest potential for more sustained impacts 3 y especially for n and p cycling and thus a longer period of post fire monitoring in the macleay river is warranted 3 1 1 nutrients concentrations of dissolved inorganic n species and po4 were not only highly elevated but also very dynamic during the post fire period fig 5 for example there were three distinct peaks in po4 coincident with the first three p1 3 hydrograph peaks post fire fig 5a phosphate availability in soils can be enhanced by fire schaller et al 2015 and p often strongly associates with suspended sediment in fire impacted aquatic systems son et al 2015 it is therefore unsurprising that dissolved po4 was significantly positively correlated p 0 01 with tss during the post fire period fig s7 and the large increases in po4 likely reflect partial desorption of po4 from entrained ash and fire impacted soil materials post fire changes in inorganic n speciation reveal a complex and dynamic aquatic n cycling regime fig 5b d nh4 n concentrations increased by 2 3 orders of magnitude 105 Î¼m at the initial onset of flow during p1 exceeding the anzecc default guideline values for freshwater ecosystem protection by two fold https www waterquality gov au anz guidelines although this was relatively short lived 6 days fig 5c in contrast substantive increases in no3 n up to 155 Î¼m were delayed and did not occur until p2 3 fig 5b increases in no2 n were not as large up to 30 Î¼m and also relatively short lived 4 weeks fig 5d the net effect was din speciation being overwhelmingly dominated 80 by nh4 n during the first 6 days of the post fire hydrograph fig 6 peak concentrations of no3 reported here were relatively high equivalent to 9 6 mg l 1 as no3 compared to some fire related studies e g bladon et al 2008 mast and clow 2008 although were similar to peak values reported by lane et al 2008 and murphy et al 2015 consequently there were substantial temporary increases from 20 to 60 in the ratio of din dip during the p1 p9 period fig s8 although such shifts typically have implications for aquatic food web dynamics and can influence primary productivity benthic algae and n cycling microbial communities smith 2003 houser et al 2010 the ecological effect of the fire induced changes in nutrient stoichiometry require further investigation in the macleay river generation of ammonia via fire induced reduction of organic matter and soil derived n is a well established process e g khanna and raison 1986 stephens et al 2004 the substantial post fire changes in din speciation recorded here indicate ammonification was clearly an important yet short lived process that generated substantial soluble nh4 that was quickly leached from catchment soils without daily sampling this short term peak in nh4 could easily have been missed subsequent nitrification processes were relatively rapid suggesting that in stream n redox transformations likely had an important influence on the generation of no2 and no3 3 2 cq relationships background pre fire concentration discharge cq relationships for most major ions were relatively chemostatic or displayed mildly diluting type behaviour i e slopes 0 05 for hco3 cl ca mg k na fig 7 and 8 table s1 3 in contrast some analytes i e doc so4 no3 n po4 displayed a background mobilisation type behaviour with slopes 0 1 fig 7 and 8 during the immediate hydrograph peaks following the fires cq relationships for most major ions with exceptions of na and cl were highly distorted relative to both the pre fire and recovery periods fig 7 substantially higher intercepts reflecting higher mean concentrations combined with steeper slopes that indicate mobilisation type behaviour were evident for hco3 doc ca mg k po4 and nh4 n particularly during p1 fig 8 table s1 3 for most analytes there was a progressive reversion in cq relationships over time whereby both intercepts and slopes during the recovery period tended to approximate those of the pre fire period fig 7 and 8 an exception was a notable shift towards more negative cq slopes for ca mg and hco3 during the recovery period fig 7 table s1 3 mainly due to a tendency toward higher concentrations at lower flows this behaviour may reflect increased inputs of groundwater derived solutes from bedrock weathering during low flow during this period due to catchment groundwater recharging post drought or alternatively may be related to weathering of the abundant fine sediment that was deposited on the bed of the trunk channel following the fires the initial post fire cq behaviour of no3 n was distinctive fig 7 with strong dilution behaviour during p1 reflecting delayed onset of higher concentrations as described in section 3 1 1 consistent with prior studies smith et al 2011 din species displayed high variability combined with the greatest distortion in cq relationship slopes reflecting the dynamic changes in n biogeochemical cycling post fire this pattern of temporarily altered cq relationships whereby steeper slopes and mobilisation type behaviour occurred during initial post fire hydrographs is consistent with short term changes in dominant hydrological flow paths e g murphy et al 2018 and increased surface and overland flow favouring dissolution of soluble components abundant in ash materials burnt soil i e ca mg k hco3 doc nh4 po4 khanna and raison 1986 earl and blinn 2003 murphy et al 2018 additionally changes in the rotational direction of event scale concentration discharge hysteresis loops provide further evidence of changes in dominant hydrological flow paths during the initial post fire period for example po4 doc and k from discrete flow events during the pre fire and recovery period display counter clockwise rotation fig s9 which typically indicates higher concentrations of analytes in groundwater and interflow than event based surface water evans and davies 1998 in contrast during p2 in the post fire period the rotational direction inverts and becomes clockwise for po4 doc and k which is consistent with higher analyte concentrations in event based surface water evans and davies 1998 both na and cl displayed the least change in cq relationships which accords with the fact neither are strongly elevated in ash or burnt soils e g murphy et al 2018 3 3 suspended sediment suspended sediment tss increased by several orders of magnitude in the immediate post fire hydrograph period attaining maxima of 5500 mg l 1 fig 3 there was a clear and substantive increase in both the sediment rating curve coefficient a and exponent b during the post fire period when compared to the pre fire period fig 9 a b maximum rating exponent b values occurred during p1 fig 9b indicating the greatest non linearity in the relationship between discharge and sediment transport and thus sensitivity to erosion e g sheridan et al 2011 occurred during the initial hydrograph peaks immediately following the fires negative relationships between log a and the rating exponent b are commonly reported e g asselman 2000 sheridan et al 2011 coefficient and exponent pairs that plot on the same line such as observed for flow events during the pre fire period fig 9c indicate a similar sediment transport regime asselman 2000 although the relatively stable pre fire sediment transport regime of the macleay river was highly disturbed during the post fire period fig 9c both the rating coefficient log a and rating exponent b underwent a systematic and mostly monotonic decline with successive hydrograph peaks until the recovery period whereby coefficient and exponent values approached those of the pre fire period fig 9b c this suggests that within 3 14 months the catchment had largely recovered from the acute effects of the fires enhancing sediment erosion and transport sheridan et al 2011 reported similar systematic shifts in the relationship between the sediment rating coefficient and rating exponent as well as monotonic declines in both over an eight month period following fires in south east australia these systematic shifts likely reflect catchment properties that change over time following fire such as soil erodibility soil water repellency and vegetative ground cover as well as the rapid depletion of fine easily transportable sediments e g desilets et al 2007 sheridan et al 2011 noske et al 2016 the fact that erosion and suspended sediment transport clearly exhibits highest sensitivity to flow events that occur immediately after fire serves to highlight the risk of compounding effects of successive extreme events e g drought and fire followed by floods 3 4 doc characteristics doc spectral characteristics displayed substantial short term shifts during the post fire period e g increases in uv vis254 204 fig s5 analysis of fdom via eem reveals that during the initial post fire hydrograph peaks there was a sharp increase in both the humification index hix and the fluorescence response p i n ratio of region iii fulvic acid like to region i tyrosine like fig 10 these substantive perturbations persisted for 2 6 weeks and had no parallel during the prior or subsequent period of monitoring fig 10 while beyond the scope of the study these shifts in doc composition from labile tyrosine like compounds to more refractory fulvic acid like compounds likely induced changes in the aquatic microbial food web the lack of a similar magnitude shift in either the p iii n p i n ratio or hix during later high flow events in the recovery period 12 months later march 2021 fig 10 indicates these changes in fdom character were strongly associated with the fires yet they were also relatively short lived this is consistent with other recent investigations of wildfire impacts on stream water quality e g uzun et al 2020 that report similar short term increases in both hix and fulvic acid like components region iii during the initial flushing events following fire further analysis of eem data indicates that the sharp initial increase in the p iii n p i n ratio evident in the first 2 weeks after following onset of flow after the fires fig 10 was mainly due to strong attenuation of fluorescence response in region i tyrosine like fig 11 a comparing the excitation emission matrixes for sample a 2 08 2019 pre fire drought and low flow with sample b 13 01 2020 post fire p1 reveals an almost complete absence of a fluorescence response in region i in the post fire sample b fig 10 laboratory and field based investigations of leachate from burnt forest derived organic matter indicates that combustion can produce leachate with lower tyrosine like region i substances especially where there is high oxygen availability wang et al 2015a which is hypothesised as being connected with fire induced protein degradation wang et al 2015b both of the extreme events bracketed here fire and the preceding drought with low river flow influenced fdom characteristics for example fluorescence responses of region v humic acid like relative to region i tyrosine like fall along a distinct central scatter during most of the study period fig 11b however an unusually high fluorescence response occurred in region i during the summer drought low flow period immediately prior to p1 fig 11b region i tyrosine like and amino acid like fluorophores are readily derived microbially from algal biomass mostofa et al 2013 and can vary seasonally miller and mcknight 2010 the elevated region i fluorescence response during the drought low flow period may be related to the fact the macleay river can develop seasonally excessive aquatic algae especially during low flow summer periods ryder et al 2016 johnston et al 2020 3 5 monthly flow weighted mean concentrations and loads substantial increases in monthly flow weighted mean concentrations fwcm and monthly loads lm were evident for select analytes during the initial post fire period fig 12 for example fwcm suspended sediment in the post fire period was up to 108x higher than corresponding pre fire period means monthly suspended sediment export peaked during february 2020 at 1 1 t ha 1 40x higher than largest recorded value during the pre fire period however only 25 of the catchment upstream of the bellbrook monitoring station was burnt during the fires table 1 hence the areal estimates of suspended sediment lm post fire shown in fig 12 also include as the denominator a large proportion of the catchment that was not fire impacted therefore a more refined estimate of sediment yield specifically attributable to the fire effected areas during the february 2020 peak load can be derived as follows assuming the pre fire relationship between monthly discharge qm and monthly sediment load lm remained more or less constant for the unburnt portion of the catchment throughout the entire study period then the regression equation for the pre fire period fig s10 can be used to estimate the sediment load lm attributable to the unburnt portion of the catchment during february 2020 assuming the difference between this estimate and measured sediment yield for february 2020 is primarily attributable to additional fire induced erosion from the catchment area that was actually burnt during the fires then the monthly sediment export for fire impacted parts of the catchment during february 2020 is estimated at 3 7 t ha 1 when expressed on an annual basis sediment yields from the macleay river during the 1st year post fire are reasonably high compared to previously reported values smith et al 2011 for burnt catchments in se australia larger than 100 km2 fig 9d however they are of a similar magnitude to the estimated sediment yields for nsw australia following the 2019 fires reported by robinne et al 2021 and kemter et al 2021 derived from the revised universal soil loss equation rusle model estimates of sediment yield following fires are typically expressed on an annual areal basis however it is clear from this study that such an approach tends to poorly represent the actual scale of temporal heterogeneity for example the vast majority 85 of total sediment yield in the macleay during the entire monitoring period occurred within two separate months following the fires with a large fraction of that load occurring over the span of days fig s11 sharp increases in fwcm of dissolved analytes were mostly confined to the first several months post fire the magnitude by which fwcm during the post fire period exceeded mean fwcm during the pre fire period was greatest for nutrients po4 17x no3 n 12x nh4 n 84x limited pre fire data followed by k 5x ca and doc 4x and hco3 2 5x fig 12 dissolved analyte lm were highly variable with maxima typically occurring during the initial post fire period and diminishing rapidly thereafter although comparably large lm values were also attained during high flow events at the end of the study period march 2021 these are mainly a function of high discharge volumes rather than elevated concentrations fig 12 annual loads for doc po4 no3 n and nh4 n are shown in table 2 the values estimated here for post fire annual loads of po4 no3 n and nh4 n are of a similar order to those previously reported for burnt catchments bladon et al 2008 lane et al 2008 mast and clow 2008 smith et al 2011 although there were large increases in annual loads of po4 and no3 n during first 12 months after the fires 10x table 2 most of that flux was during the first two months fig 12 while it is clear the combination of extreme drought and severe fires followed by flooding caused a substantial increase in the flux of key nutrients to the macleay river this mainly occurred as a relatively short lived pulse however the potential impacts of this event on aquatic ecosystem function remains unquantified and warrants further attention 4 conclusions the combination of extreme drought and severe fires followed by flooding led to significant changes in aqueous chemistry at a large catchment scale yet there was relatively fast recovery over 3 12 months for most analytes highly distorted cq slopes and inversion of cq hysteresis loop rotation were consistent with short term alteration of hydrological flow paths and increased surface runoff in the post fire period mobilising soluble ions and nutrients from burnt soils and ash materials fire also caused large changes in aquatic n biogeochemistry with a marked dominance of nh4 during early stages of the post fire hydrograph exceeding water quality threshold guidelines followed by rapid nitrification both fire and drought substantially altered fdom characteristics the transient shifts in nutrients tss and doc likely resulted in ecological impacts however the magnitude duration and extent of these perturbations is unknown and requires further investigation the systematic temporal shifts in sediment rating curves indicate that floods closely following fires will have disproportionately large impacts on water quality and serves to highlight the compounding effect of sequential extreme events the large and rapid changes in aqueous chemistry observed here highlight the inadequacy of fixed interval sampling approaches to quantify the compound impacts on water quality of megafires followed by floods flow stratified sampling that brackets the critical first flush period is vital to capture the full span of impacts declaration of competing interest the

15978,polychlorinated diphenyl sulfides pcdpss represent an emerging group of constituents that are persistent bioaccumulative and toxic pbt substances of great concern in terms of human health and ecological integrity however little is known about the occurrence environmental behaviour and ecological risks of pcdpss in lake environments in this study the concentrations of 21 pcdpss were determined in surface water suspended particulate matter spm sediments and 8 fish species from chaohu lake china eighteen pcdps congeners were prevalently detected in the samples with concentrations ranging from 0 272 1 69 ng l water 0 477 2 03 ng g d w spm 0 719 4 07 ng g d w sediment and 0 0 131 ng g w w fish respectively medium and high chlorinated pcdpss in spm and sediment were significantly higher than those in water samples increased pcdps concentrations were found in higher trophic level fishes and those with a demersal habitat preference indicating their bioaccumulation and biomagnification potential the logbcfs bssafs and bsafs of pcdps congeners in fishes were determined to be 3 91 5 18 0 0500 2 33 and 0 0360 4 94 l kg respectively the organic carbon normalized partition coefficients logk oc of pcdpss in surface water spm 4 61 5 54 l g and surface water sediment 4 38 5 69 l g systems were determined and it was found that highly chlorinated pcdpss were more prone to migrate from water to sediment and spm the toxic equivalent teq values of pcdpss in the samples lower than 10 1 pg g or pg l and daily intake via fish consumption 0 180 0 340 Î¼g kg day were

sulfides pcdpss are a class of sulfur containing aromatic compounds with structures resembling polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs fig 1 consisting of 209 possible congeners recently pcdpss were classified as persistent bioaccumulative and toxic pbt substances zhang et al 2021a due to their long distance transport potential pcdpss have attracted more attention and are listed as potential priority pollutants mostrag et al 2010 zhang et al 2020 pcdpss are generated through a variety of industrial processes i e papermaking wastewater treatment sinkkonen 1993 waste incineration sinkkonen et al 1993a and metal recovery and smelting processes sinkkonen et al 1993b moreover due to the extensive applications of pcdpss in various materials fungicides and medicines ambrus et al 2005 dorweiler et al 2016 verschuuren et al 1973 they have been inevitably released to the environment table s1 to date pcdpss have been detected in various aquatic environmental matrices for instance 4 4 di cdps was found in sediments from the elbe river and 21 pcdps congeners were detected in surface water and sediment from the nanjing section of the yangtze river at concentrations between 0 180 2 03 ng l and 0 100 6 90 ng g respectively schwarzbauer et al 2000 zhang et al 2014a however data on the levels of pcdpss in freshwater lakes especially in aquatic organisms remain extremely scarce pcdpss have been shown to cause various adverse effects in organisms e g oxidative stress growth inhibition malformations and death in green algae mice or fish after acute exposure fang et al 2018 li et al 2012 zhang et al 2012 in addition due to their pcb like structure pcdpss can activate aryl hydrocarbon receptor 1 ahr1 in rats zebrafish and birds with relative dioxin like potencies that are sometimes comparable to the toxic equivalency factor tef of dioxin like pcbs zhang et al 2014b zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2018a furthermore developmental toxicity tests indicated that the notochordal kinking of zebrafish embryos was triggered by the downregulation of hspb9 and hspb11 following pcdps exposure zhang et al 2018b as the fifth largest freshwater lake in china chaohu lake is an important source of drinking water for hefei city capital of anhui province and chaohu city in recent decades the eutrophication status of chaohu lake as well as pollution with heavy metals and other organic pollutants e g pbdes ocps and pahs have received more attention fang et al 2019 he et al 2015 he et al 2020 huo et al 2017 however studies that focus on emerging pollutants in this important lake ecosystem are scarce recently past studies demonstrated the occurrence of two classes of new organic substances pcdes and pcdts in chaohu lake with concentrations in the ng l and ng g ranges for water and sediment respectively zhang et al 2018c zhu et al 2021 given the existence of pcdpss in the yangtze river and the connection between chaohu lake and the yangtze river via the yuxi river zhang et al 2014a zhang et al 2018c it was hypothesized that pcdpss also existed in chaohu lake the n octanol water partition coefficient logk ow of pcdpss 4 0 suggests that such compounds possess high bioaccumulation potentials shi et al 2012 in fact a previous study confirmed such bioaccumulation via simulated waterborne exposure experiments in which the bcf of 4 4 di cdps was found to be higher than 3 5 103 l kg in anodonta woodiana tissues zhang et al 2018d in addition batch equilibration results indicated that pcdpss possessed strong sorption tendencies towards soil yang et al 2013 although the results of previous laboratory experiments indicated the stronger hydrophobicity and higher bioaccumulation effect of pcdpss the typical environmental behaviour i e partitioning and bioaccumulation of pcdpss in real freshwater lakes e g chaohu lake has not yet been revealed therefore it was also hypothesized that pcdpss tend to accumulate in sediments and organisms in real freshwater lakes in addition their bioaccumulation capacities vary from species to species and ecological habits trophic levels and habitat preferences are significant impact factors therefore the primary goal of the present study was to investigate the environmental behaviour and the health and ecological risks of pcdpss in chaohu lake the specific objectives included 1 to determine the concentrations and distribution patterns of pcdpss in water suspended particulate matter spm sediment and freshwater fish from chaohu lake 2 to reveal the partitioning behaviour of pcdpss in the water spm sediment system of chaohu lake 3 to clarify the bioaccumulation characteristics of pcdpss in different fish species and 4 to assess the potential health and ecological risks of pcdps congeners

using graphpad prism 8 0 software usa graphpad software 3 results and discussion 3 1 pcdpss in water spm and sediment eighteen pcdps congeners were detected in surface water spm and sediment samples from chaohu lake among the sampling sites in chaohu lake s1 s10 the total concentrations of 18 pcdps congeners 18pcdpss in the water samples ranged from 0 272 ng l at s8 to 1 69 ng l at s1 mean value 0 940 ng l fig 3 a table s7 18pcdpss in the spm samples ranged from 0 477 ng g to 2 03 ng g dry weight d w mean value 1 29 ng g d w fig 3b table s8 finally the range of 18pcdpss in sediment was 0 719 to 4 07 ng g d w mean value 2 18 ng g d w fig 3c table s9 the highest 18pcdpss in water and sediments were detected at s1 1 69 ng l and 4 07 ng g d w respectively followed by s2 1 57 ng l and 3 54 ng g d w respectively and s3 1 56 ng l and 3 49 ng g d w respectively additionally sampling site s3 2 21 ng g d w presented the highest 18pcdpss for spm samples followed by s1 1 97 ng g d w and s2 1 84 ng g d w the consistently higher concentrations reported at s1 s2 and s3 were not surprising given the proximity to more polluted tributaries t1 t2 and t3 of chaohu lake i e nanfei river shiwuli river and pai river in fact the 18pcdpss in sediment spm and water samples from these three tributaries t1 t2 and t3 were also relatively higher compared to other tributary sites table s10 for instance 18pcdpss in water from the pai river shiwuli river and nanfei river were 4 02 ng l 3 28 ng l and 3 43 ng l respectively for comparison water concentrations from the remaining 5 sites t4 t8 ranged from 0 672 2 92 ng l electronic manufacturing plants and pharmaceutical companies near the three tributary sites might be potential sources of the higher concentration of pcdpss detected he et al 2020 qi et al 2015 the lowest 18pcdpss in water spm and sediment samples were all observed at s8 followed by s7 and s10 unlike s1 s3 s7 s10 are located towards the middle eastern basin of chaohu lake and based on land use practices near this part of the lake the probability of urban pollution inputs was relatively lower that is compared with the middle and eastern basins of chaohu lake many more sources of pollution exist around the western area of chaohu lake which was reflected in the relatively lower 18pcdpss in tributary sites t4 t8 table s10 moreover previous studies on the spatial distribution of pcdts and pcdes also suggested that the pollution in the western area of chaohu lake was higher than that in the eastern area zhang et al 2018c zhu et al 2021 compared with the levels of pcdpss in the nanjing section of the yangtze river 0 180 2 03 ng l in surface water and 0 100 6 90 ng g d w in sediment 18pcdpss in the samples from chaohu lake were slightly lower zhang et al 2014a in addition the concentrations of pcdpss in chaohu lake were generally comparable to those of pcdes pcdts and perfluoroalkyl substances pfass in sediment and lower than those of pbdes pcbs perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and phthalate esters paes in chaohu lake table s11 he et al 2013 he et al 2019 huo et al 2017 liu et al 2019 qi et al 2015 zhang et al 2018c zhu et al 2021 in terms of individual congeners the largest proportions in water spm and sediment samples were 2 2 3 3 tetra cdps 13 9 2 2 3 3 4 5 6 hepta cdps 15 4 and 2 2 3 3 4 5 6 hepta cdps 13 respectively fig s3 compositional pattern analysis suggested that tetra cdpss were the dominant congeners in water 29 7 43 4 spm 27 7 43 1 and sediment 30 3 45 3 fig 4 a c such results might be due to the following reasons 1 researchers have reported the presence of tetra cdps congeners in waste gas and slag indicating that human made emission sources are likely to exist leading to their ultimate release into the environment around chaohu lake sinkkonen et al 1993a sinkkonen et al 1993b 2 tetra cdps may be generated from the conversion of anthropogenically derived highly chlorinated compounds zhang et al 2014a and 3 the lower standard free energy of formation f g of tetra cdpss indicates that they possess more stable structures zhu et al 2008 lower chlorinated n chlorine atoms 0 1 2 and 3 and medium chlorinated n chlorine atoms 4 congeners were dominant in water samples fig 4a which was different from the individual profile for the spm and sediment samples fig 4b c in addition to tetra cdps pcdpss in the water samples were mainly composed of tri cdps 21 4 29 8 penta cdps 5 9 19 and di cdps 0 13 1 and the proportion of other pcdps congeners was relatively low 10 fig 4a this pattern was roughly consistent with the profiles of pcdpss and pcbs in the yangtze river zhang et al 2014a and resembled the congener profiles of pcdes and pcdts in chaohu lake zhang et al 2011 zhang et al 2018c zhu et al 2021 the other dominant congeners in spm and sediments were penta cdps 19 2 and hepta cdps 16 6 fig 4b c however the proportions of dps mon cdps and di cdps were relatively lower the pcdps congener patterns in spm and sediment samples from chaohu lake were also similar to those in the nanjing section of the yangtze river zhang et al 2014a these findings suggest that the medium and higher chlorinated congeners e g tetra cdps and hepta cdps in the sediment were less prone to degradation and removal than the lower chlorinated congeners in addition the percentages of higher chlorinated n chlorine atoms 5 6 7 pcdps congeners in spm and sediment samples were significantly higher than those in water this may be the result of their larger logk oc values 5 0 which would make them prone to be absorbed by particles and sediment yang et al 2013 3 2 pcdpss in fishes from chaohu lake as wild fish can serve as a good indicator of the status of pollution in the lake environment the levels of pcdpss in fish from chaohu lake were also determined in this work the 18pcdpss in 8 fish species ranged from 0 639 ng g to 1 32 ng g fig 3d table s12 with a species rank order of c alburnus s asotus m anguillicaudatus c auratus c idella p pekinensis c brachygnathus n tangkahkeii taihuensis chen higher levels of 2 2 3 3 tetra cdps 0 053 0 11 ng g and 2 3 4 5 tetra cdps 0 024 0 11 ng g were found in almost all eight fish species while relatively lower levels of dps 0 013 0 059 ng g and 4 mono cdps 0 018 0 071 ng g were recorded the dominant congeners in fishes were tetra cdpss 29 60 followed by penta cdpss 20 45 while the proportion of lower chlorinated congeners was relatively lower 10 fig 4d these results indicated that the medium and higher chlorinated congeners with higher logk ow values were more prone to be accumulated in fish muscle indicating that lipophilicity may be the governing factor that determined the bioaccumulation of pcdpss in aquatic organisms we speculated that higher biotransformation potentials and larger molecular volumes would impede the absorption of these congeners which could explain the lower proportion of hexa and hepta cdpss 9 3 3 relationships between fish ecological habits and 18pcdpss in fish according to their trophic levels the 8 fish species included in the present study were classified as planktivores herbivores omnivores and piscivores in addition their habitat preferences i e pelagic benthopelagic and demersal were also indicated table s3 pcdpss were always found at higher concentrations in higher trophic guilds e g c alburnus and s asotus or demersal fishes e g m anguillicaudatus and s asotus in contrast lower pcdpss levels were observed in pelagic and planktivorous fishes e g c brachygnathus and n tangkahkeii taihuensis chen p 0 05 specifically except for 2 4 5 tri cdps the highest concentrations of lower chlorinated pcdpss were exclusively found in s asotus the highest levels of 2 4 4 5 tetra cdps and 2 3 3 4 5 6 hexa cdps were detected in m anguillicaudatus medium trophic level which may be due to habitat preference and the hydrophobicity of these congeners except for 2 2 3 6 tetra cdps 2 2 4 4 5 penta cdps and 2 3 3 4 5 6 hexa cdps the levels of pcdpss in planktivorous fishes were significantly lower than those in herbivorous omnivorous and piscivorous fishes p 0 05 in general the rank order of 18pcdpss in fishes according to trophic level and habitat preference was demersal benthopelagic pelagic and piscivorous omnivorous herbivorous planktivorous since pcdpss were found to accumulate to a greater extent in fishes with bottom demersal habitat or higher trophic levels the sediment was speculated to be the main reservoir associated with the bioaccumulation of pcdpss in addition benthopelagic and piscivorous fishes should be the key links for the transportation of pcdpss from sediment into aquatic food webs additionally biomagnification of pcdpss was supported based on the higher 18pcdpss detected in omnivorous and piscivorous fishes principal component analysis pca was employed to explore the relationship between fish ecological habits trophic levels and habitat preferences and 18pcdpss in fish approximately 47 6 of the variation in the 18pcdpss among fish samples was explained by pc1 36 5 and pc2 11 1 fig s4 2 2 3 3 tetra cdps and 2 3 4 5 tetra cdps had high loadings along pc1 while pc2 loaded strongly for 2 2 3 4 5 penta cdps an obvious gradient along pc1 in 18pcdpss among different habitat preferences and trophic levels was observed demersal and pelagic species were positioned to the positive and negative ends of pc1 respectively piscivorous species were located at the positive end of pc1 while planktivorous fishes were grouped to the negative end of pc1 the major differences were driven by the concentrations of 2 2 3 3 tetra cdps 2 2 3 3 4 5 6 hepta cdps 2 3 4 5 tetra cdps and 2 3 4 5 6 penta cdps to summarize habitat preference and trophic level of fish can significantly affect the levels of pcdpss 3 4 partitioning of pcdpss in the water spm sediment system the partitioning of pcdpss in the water spm sediment system could have significant impacts on their fates in aquatic environments therefore based on the determined pcdpss concentrations in different environmental matrices from chaohu lake the logk oc values of the 18 detected pcdps congeners were calculated to assess their partitioning behaviour in the water spm sediment system in chaohu lake for the first time k oc 1 and k oc 2 represent the organic carbon normalized partition coefficients of pcdpss for the spm water system and the sediment water system respectively the ranges of logk oc 1 and logk oc 2 of pcdpss ranged from 4 61 0 28 to 5 54 0 12 l g and 4 38 0 31 to 5 69 0 19 l g respectively the values of logk oc 1 and logk oc 2 of pcdpss generally increased with the increasing number of chlorine atoms on the benzene rings fig s5 which was consistent with the sorption properties of pcdpss in yangtze river plain soil observed in the laboratory yang et al 2013 in addition our recent studies found that the average field logk oc values of pcdes and pcdts both of their structures resemble pcdpss also detected in the spm water system of chaohu lake with more chlorine atoms were much higher zhang et al 2018c zhu et al 2021 these results suggested that compounds with more strong hydrophobic groups e g cl atoms might be more prone to migrate from water to sediment and spm thereby resulting in higher logk oc values li et al 2021 zhang et al 2018c compared with the experimental logk oc logk oc exp of pcdpss the values of logk oc 1 and logk oc 2 of lower chlorinated congeners i e dps mon cdps di cdps and tri cdps were higher while the logk oc 1 and logk oc 2 of higher chlorinated congeners penta cdps hexa cdps and hepta cdps were lower yang et al 2013 for example the logk oc 1 logk oc 2 and logk oc exp of 4 4 di cdps were 4 69 4 97 and 4 20 respectively while the values for 2 2 3 3 4 5 6 hepta cdps were 5 34 5 69 and 6 47 respectively such results indicate that the sorption of higher chlorinated pcdps congeners would make it difficult to achieve equilibrium in the water spm sediment system in chaohu lake similar to pcdes and pcdts the higher chlorinated pcdpss may undergo various degradation processes in sediment and particulate matter resulting in a lower logk oc than that determined in a controlled laboratory experiment zhang et al 2018c zhu et al 2021 instead the higher logk oc 1 and logk oc 2 of lower chlorinated congeners in the water spm sediment suggested that the partitioning of lower chlorinated pcdps congeners was in an exceeded equilibrium status which might be partly due to their higher volatility mostrag et al 2010 we also speculate that a portion of lower chlorinated pcdpss in spm and sediment was derived from the degradation of higher chlorinated pcdpss we found that most of the logk oc 1 values of pcdpss except for dps and 4 mono cdps were lower than logk oc 2 such differences may be due to the sorption processes of pcdpss in the water sediment system being closer to achieve final dynamic equilibrium compared to the water spm system a large proportion of the pcdpss in sediment came from the pcdpss absorbed in spm thus pcdpss that enter the aquatic environment would first be absorbed in spm and then settle into sediments under the influence of gravity zhang et al 2014a moreover the easily disturbed characteristics of particulate matter and the mutual exchange and adsorption of pcdpss in the water spm system can partly explain why pcdpss can exist in sediments more stably yang et al 2019 however the sorption of pcdpss in the real water spm sediment system was influenced by many environmental factors including dissolved organic matter dom content salinity temperature and degradation of pcdps in spm and sediment mzoughi and chouba 2011 therefore more in depth research is warranted to elucidate the governing factor s that drive the partitioning of pcdpss in aquatic environments significant correlations r 2 0 5 p 0 05 between the 18pcdpss and particulate organic carbon poc content in spm total organic carbon toc content in sediment and dissolved organic carbon doc content in water were observed indicating that oc has a significant influence on the distribution of pcdpss in chaohu lake fig s6 the original differences between the highest and lowest 18pcdps concentrations in spm and sediment samples were 4 25 and 5 65 fold respectively p 0 05 however the maximum pcdps concentrations in spm and sediment samples following oc standardization were only 1 77 and 1 85 fold respectively p 0 05 fig s7 therefore we speculated that a portion of the pcdpss detected in the middle and eastern areas of chaohu lake may come from the western basin via the transmission of organic carbon neira et al 2018 zhu et al 2021 and oc also plays a key role in the redistribution of pcdpss in the freshwater lake water spm sediment system 3 5 bioaccumulation of pcdpss in different fishes on the basis of the measured concentrations of pcdpss in samples from chaohu lake the bioaccumulation potentials of pcdps congeners in fish relative to water spm and sediment from chaohu lake were quantitatively evaluated by bcfs converted to logarithmic values i e logbcfs bssafs and bsafs respectively the logbcf values of pcdpss in 8 fish species ranged from 3 91 to 5 18 l kg table s13 which were higher than the environmental protection agency epa recommended standard value bcf 5000 l kg i e logbcf 3 70 l kg this suggests that pcdpss have stronger accumulation potential and weaker metabolic activity in these fishes borga et al 2011 compared to lower chlorinated pcdpss higher logbcf values were observed in medium and higher chlorinated congeners in the same species of fish for instance logbcf values of 4 mono cdps in fishes ranged from 3 97 to 4 88 l kg while 2 2 3 3 4 5 6 hepta cdps ranged from 4 21 to 5 05 l kg since the logk ow values of pcdps congeners generally increased with an increasing number of chlorine atoms lipophilicity may be a critical factor in determining the bioaccumulation ability of pcdpss fu et al 2018 another interesting observation is that the maximum logbcfs for the same type of fish were mostly for penta cdpss or hexa cdpss rather than hepta cdpss similar to other typical halogenated aromatics e g pcbs pcdes and dioxins the molecular volumes of pcdpss increase as the number of substituted cl atoms increases however the bioaccumulation abilities of pcdpss first increase and then decrease as their molecular volumes increase which generally appears as a parabolic shape wang et al 2004 wu et al 2009 this may be the result of the larger molecular volumes of hepta cdpss which would obstruct their penetration through the cell membrane thereby resulting in lower bioaccumulation potentials gobas et al 1988 only two studies to date have reported the bcfs of pcdpss in aquatic organisms in laboratory experiments the logbcf values of pcdpss in fish from chaohu lake were significantly higher than those found in zebrafish larvae 2 23 3 18 l kg and comparable to those in the freshwater mussel anodonta woodiana 3 56 5 10 l kg determined in the laboratory fang et al 2018 zhang et al 2018a the bssaf and bsaf values of pcdpss in fishes ranged from 0 05 to 2 33 and 0 0360 to 4 94 respectively tables s14 and s15 dps had the highest bssaf and bsaf among the congeners 2 33 and 4 94 while 2 2 3 3 4 5 6 hepta cdps had the lowest 0 0500 and 0 0360 several studies have suggested that bsaf values of pahs with larger molecular structures were lower kwok et al 2013 which is consistent with our results i e pcdpss with a larger molecular structure possessed lower bioavailability from spm and sediments to fish another factor might be that higher chlorinated pcdpss have a greater probability of being metabolized to lower chlorinated congeners thereby leading to lower bioaccumulation in fish zeng et al 2015 zhang et al 2018d the bssaf values in the 8 fish species were all higher than the bsaf values this may be due to spm being more turbulent than sediment leading to the sorption of pcdpss in spm restricting dynamic equilibrium and thus lower pcdpss concentrations in spm in addition the content and properties of oc were also key factors in the adsorption capacity and bioavailability of organic substances ghosh 2007 and thus the differences in oc content and properties between spm 0 670 1 69 and sediments 0 420 1 78 could have significant impacts on the basf and bassf of pcdpss in fishes the values of logbcf bassf and basf were related to fish species lower bcf bssaf and bsaf values were primarily observed in c brachygnathus n tangkahkeii taihuensis chen p pekinensis and c idella while higher values were observed in the other 4 species i e c auratus m anguillicaudatus c alburnus and s asotus specifically significantly stronger p 0 05 bioaccumulation effects were exhibited in m anguillicaudatus 4 93 l kg 0 878 and 0 662 for logbcf bssaf and bsaf respectively and s asotus 4 91 l kg 0 905 and 0 783 respectively therefore the demersal habitat preference of both m anguillicaudatus and s asotus suggested that habitat preference was an important factor for the accumulation potential of pcdpss in fish interestingly the size of fish was also related to the bioaccumulation potential of pcdpss it became weaker with an increase in fish size for species at the same trophic level the fish body dilution effect was a possible reason in addition the bioaccumulation capacity of organic pollutants was also reported to be related to the feeding rates and metabolic capacity of fish bandowe et al 2014 which should be further evaluated in future studies additionally it was found that the bioaccumulation potential of pcdpss in omnivorous and piscivorous fishes was significantly greater than that in planktivorous and herbivorous fishes indicating that pcdpss may have biomagnification potential via freshwater aquatic food webs with the vertical upwards movement of habitat preference of fish species in the lake the value of logbcf decreased a significant positive correlation between logbcfs and logk ows or logk ocs was observed indicating that pcdpss with greater logk ow or logk oc values possessed higher bioaccumulation potentials in fish fig 5 a negative correlations between bssafs or bsafs and logk ows or logk ocs were observed figs 5b c and s8 suggesting that bssaf and bsaf values increased as the number of chlorine substitutions decreased these results indicated that the bioaccumulation capacity of untested pcdpss could be assessed to a certain degree using basic physicochemical properties 3 6 health and ecological risks of pcdpss first considering the ubiquitous detection of pcdpss in edible fish species from chaohu lake human pcdps intake via fish consumption was estimated using the edi and was in the range of 0 17 0 34 Î¼g kg per day gu et al 2006 additionally based on the rep values of pcdpss zhang et al 2016 the tolerable daily intake tdi of pcdpss was estimated to be 9 58 10 3 2 23 10 2 pg kg teq per day far lower than the oral reference dose 0 7 pg kg per day for tcdd proposed by the u s epa table s16 environmental protection agency 2012 the species specific bioaccumulation of pcdpss in different fish species from chaohu lake suggested the biomagnification potential of pcdpss via the aquatic food web given the limited number of pcdps congeners tested and the potential lifetime exposure of pcdpss in residents living around chaohu lake basin the potential dietary risks should not be neglected even though the edi was very low second based on the reported and ecosar predicted toxicity the calculated cumulative rqs of pcdps congeners tested in surface water from chaohu lake were in the range of 0 00650 066 0 1 for green algae indicating that the pcdps congeners tested might not induce severe ecological risks to organisms in chaohu lake fig s9 and table s17 however considering the limited number of pcdps congeners investigated 21 out of 209 congeners in total and scarce pcdps toxicity data reported to date the total rqs of all pcdps congeners may rise to nearly 1 0 0 065 0 66 after correction with an uncertainty factor of 10 therefore the ecological and health risks of such compounds deserve continued attention third based on the reported rep values of several pcdpss for mammals the teq values of pcdpss in surface water spm sediment and fish samples were calculated as 9 4 10 5 5 2 10 3 pg l 1 6 10 3 1 3 10 2 pg g 3 3 10 3 2 1 10 2 pg g and 2 3 10 3 5 4 10 3 pg g respectively tables s18 and s19 zhang et al 2016 although the teq values of pcdpss were far lower than those of dl pcbs and pcdd fs in typical aquatic matrices pham et al 2019 zhang et al 2021b pcdpss still deserve more attention due to their agonistic activities and potential developmental toxicities at environmentally relevant levels zhang et al 2014b zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2018a finally the total annual input of pcdpss from 8 main tributaries to chaohu lake was quantitatively evaluated as 14 2 kg year tables s10 and s20 which roughly suggests that the main sources of pcdpss may be industrial wastewater discharge and chemical production processes in the chaohu basin however more detailed source identification using new technologies e g stable isotope techniques should be conducted in future studies these results indicated that the environmental concentrations and ecological risks of pcdpss in chaohu lake may continue to increase if no effective action is taken 4 conclusion in summary our study confirmed the prevalent presence of pcdpss in a natural water body chaohu lake including in surface water spm sediment and edible fishes for the first time compared with surface water samples the proportions of medium and high chlorinated pcdpss in spm and sediment were significantly higher larger bcf values of pcdpss in edible fish species were recorded indicating the higher bioaccumulation ability of pcdpss additional higher pcdps concentrations were found in higher trophic level fishes which showed their biomagnification potential in addition the partitioning behaviour of pcdpss in the water spm sediment system was quantitatively clarified for the first time and it was found that oc could have significant impacts on the redistribution of pcdpss in chaohu lake the daily intake of pcdpss via fish consumption was estimated to be 9 58 10 3 2 23 10 2 pg kg teq per day the corrected cumulative rqs of 0 065 0 66 were identified for green algae given the higher bioaccumulation and biomagnification potentials and cumulative rqs close to 1 of pcdpss in aquatic environments as well as their potential toxicities further research to evaluate their impacts on wildlife and human health is warranted overall our findings provide insights into the environmental behaviour and the health and ecological risks of pcdpss in a natural water

15978,polychlorinated diphenyl sulfides pcdpss represent an emerging group of constituents that are persistent bioaccumulative and toxic pbt substances of great concern in terms of human health and ecological integrity however little is known about the occurrence environmental behaviour and ecological risks of pcdpss in lake environments in this study the concentrations of 21 pcdpss were determined in surface water suspended particulate matter spm sediments and 8 fish species from chaohu lake china eighteen pcdps congeners were prevalently detected in the samples with concentrations ranging from 0 272 1 69 ng l water 0 477 2 03 ng g d w spm 0 719 4 07 ng g d w sediment and 0 0 131 ng g w w fish respectively medium and high chlorinated pcdpss in spm and sediment were significantly higher than those in water samples increased pcdps concentrations were found in higher trophic level fishes and those with a demersal habitat preference indicating their bioaccumulation and biomagnification potential the logbcfs bssafs and bsafs of pcdps congeners in fishes were determined to be 3 91 5 18 0 0500 2 33 and 0 0360 4 94 l kg respectively the organic carbon normalized partition coefficients logk oc of pcdpss in surface water spm 4 61 5 54 l g and surface water sediment 4 38 5 69 l g systems were determined and it was found that highly chlorinated pcdpss were more prone to migrate from water to sediment and spm the toxic equivalent teq values of pcdpss in the samples lower than 10 1 pg g or pg l and daily intake via fish consumption 0 180 0 340 Î¼g kg day were

sulfides pcdpss are a class of sulfur containing aromatic compounds with structures resembling polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs fig 1 consisting of 209 possible congeners recently pcdpss were classified as persistent bioaccumulative and toxic pbt substances zhang et al 2021a due to their long distance transport potential pcdpss have attracted more attention and are listed as potential priority pollutants mostrag et al 2010 zhang et al 2020 pcdpss are generated through a variety of industrial processes i e papermaking wastewater treatment sinkkonen 1993 waste incineration sinkkonen et al 1993a and metal recovery and smelting processes sinkkonen et al 1993b moreover due to the extensive applications of pcdpss in various materials fungicides and medicines ambrus et al 2005 dorweiler et al 2016 verschuuren et al 1973 they have been inevitably released to the environment table s1 to date pcdpss have been detected in various aquatic environmental matrices for instance 4 4 di cdps was found in sediments from the elbe river and 21 pcdps congeners were detected in surface water and sediment from the nanjing section of the yangtze river at concentrations between 0 180 2 03 ng l and 0 100 6 90 ng g respectively schwarzbauer et al 2000 zhang et al 2014a however data on the levels of pcdpss in freshwater lakes especially in aquatic organisms remain extremely scarce pcdpss have been shown to cause various adverse effects in organisms e g oxidative stress growth inhibition malformations and death in green algae mice or fish after acute exposure fang et al 2018 li et al 2012 zhang et al 2012 in addition due to their pcb like structure pcdpss can activate aryl hydrocarbon receptor 1 ahr1 in rats zebrafish and birds with relative dioxin like potencies that are sometimes comparable to the toxic equivalency factor tef of dioxin like pcbs zhang et al 2014b zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2018a furthermore developmental toxicity tests indicated that the notochordal kinking of zebrafish embryos was triggered by the downregulation of hspb9 and hspb11 following pcdps exposure zhang et al 2018b as the fifth largest freshwater lake in china chaohu lake is an important source of drinking water for hefei city capital of anhui province and chaohu city in recent decades the eutrophication status of chaohu lake as well as pollution with heavy metals and other organic pollutants e g pbdes ocps and pahs have received more attention fang et al 2019 he et al 2015 he et al 2020 huo et al 2017 however studies that focus on emerging pollutants in this important lake ecosystem are scarce recently past studies demonstrated the occurrence of two classes of new organic substances pcdes and pcdts in chaohu lake with concentrations in the ng l and ng g ranges for water and sediment respectively zhang et al 2018c zhu et al 2021 given the existence of pcdpss in the yangtze river and the connection between chaohu lake and the yangtze river via the yuxi river zhang et al 2014a zhang et al 2018c it was hypothesized that pcdpss also existed in chaohu lake the n octanol water partition coefficient logk ow of pcdpss 4 0 suggests that such compounds possess high bioaccumulation potentials shi et al 2012 in fact a previous study confirmed such bioaccumulation via simulated waterborne exposure experiments in which the bcf of 4 4 di cdps was found to be higher than 3 5 103 l kg in anodonta woodiana tissues zhang et al 2018d in addition batch equilibration results indicated that pcdpss possessed strong sorption tendencies towards soil yang et al 2013 although the results of previous laboratory experiments indicated the stronger hydrophobicity and higher bioaccumulation effect of pcdpss the typical environmental behaviour i e partitioning and bioaccumulation of pcdpss in real freshwater lakes e g chaohu lake has not yet been revealed therefore it was also hypothesized that pcdpss tend to accumulate in sediments and organisms in real freshwater lakes in addition their bioaccumulation capacities vary from species to species and ecological habits trophic levels and habitat preferences are significant impact factors therefore the primary goal of the present study was to investigate the environmental behaviour and the health and ecological risks of pcdpss in chaohu lake the specific objectives included 1 to determine the concentrations and distribution patterns of pcdpss in water suspended particulate matter spm sediment and freshwater fish from chaohu lake 2 to reveal the partitioning behaviour of pcdpss in the water spm sediment system of chaohu lake 3 to clarify the bioaccumulation characteristics of pcdpss in different fish species and 4 to assess the potential health and ecological risks of pcdps congeners

using graphpad prism 8 0 software usa graphpad software 3 results and discussion 3 1 pcdpss in water spm and sediment eighteen pcdps congeners were detected in surface water spm and sediment samples from chaohu lake among the sampling sites in chaohu lake s1 s10 the total concentrations of 18 pcdps congeners 18pcdpss in the water samples ranged from 0 272 ng l at s8 to 1 69 ng l at s1 mean value 0 940 ng l fig 3 a table s7 18pcdpss in the spm samples ranged from 0 477 ng g to 2 03 ng g dry weight d w mean value 1 29 ng g d w fig 3b table s8 finally the range of 18pcdpss in sediment was 0 719 to 4 07 ng g d w mean value 2 18 ng g d w fig 3c table s9 the highest 18pcdpss in water and sediments were detected at s1 1 69 ng l and 4 07 ng g d w respectively followed by s2 1 57 ng l and 3 54 ng g d w respectively and s3 1 56 ng l and 3 49 ng g d w respectively additionally sampling site s3 2 21 ng g d w presented the highest 18pcdpss for spm samples followed by s1 1 97 ng g d w and s2 1 84 ng g d w the consistently higher concentrations reported at s1 s2 and s3 were not surprising given the proximity to more polluted tributaries t1 t2 and t3 of chaohu lake i e nanfei river shiwuli river and pai river in fact the 18pcdpss in sediment spm and water samples from these three tributaries t1 t2 and t3 were also relatively higher compared to other tributary sites table s10 for instance 18pcdpss in water from the pai river shiwuli river and nanfei river were 4 02 ng l 3 28 ng l and 3 43 ng l respectively for comparison water concentrations from the remaining 5 sites t4 t8 ranged from 0 672 2 92 ng l electronic manufacturing plants and pharmaceutical companies near the three tributary sites might be potential sources of the higher concentration of pcdpss detected he et al 2020 qi et al 2015 the lowest 18pcdpss in water spm and sediment samples were all observed at s8 followed by s7 and s10 unlike s1 s3 s7 s10 are located towards the middle eastern basin of chaohu lake and based on land use practices near this part of the lake the probability of urban pollution inputs was relatively lower that is compared with the middle and eastern basins of chaohu lake many more sources of pollution exist around the western area of chaohu lake which was reflected in the relatively lower 18pcdpss in tributary sites t4 t8 table s10 moreover previous studies on the spatial distribution of pcdts and pcdes also suggested that the pollution in the western area of chaohu lake was higher than that in the eastern area zhang et al 2018c zhu et al 2021 compared with the levels of pcdpss in the nanjing section of the yangtze river 0 180 2 03 ng l in surface water and 0 100 6 90 ng g d w in sediment 18pcdpss in the samples from chaohu lake were slightly lower zhang et al 2014a in addition the concentrations of pcdpss in chaohu lake were generally comparable to those of pcdes pcdts and perfluoroalkyl substances pfass in sediment and lower than those of pbdes pcbs perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and phthalate esters paes in chaohu lake table s11 he et al 2013 he et al 2019 huo et al 2017 liu et al 2019 qi et al 2015 zhang et al 2018c zhu et al 2021 in terms of individual congeners the largest proportions in water spm and sediment samples were 2 2 3 3 tetra cdps 13 9 2 2 3 3 4 5 6 hepta cdps 15 4 and 2 2 3 3 4 5 6 hepta cdps 13 respectively fig s3 compositional pattern analysis suggested that tetra cdpss were the dominant congeners in water 29 7 43 4 spm 27 7 43 1 and sediment 30 3 45 3 fig 4 a c such results might be due to the following reasons 1 researchers have reported the presence of tetra cdps congeners in waste gas and slag indicating that human made emission sources are likely to exist leading to their ultimate release into the environment around chaohu lake sinkkonen et al 1993a sinkkonen et al 1993b 2 tetra cdps may be generated from the conversion of anthropogenically derived highly chlorinated compounds zhang et al 2014a and 3 the lower standard free energy of formation f g of tetra cdpss indicates that they possess more stable structures zhu et al 2008 lower chlorinated n chlorine atoms 0 1 2 and 3 and medium chlorinated n chlorine atoms 4 congeners were dominant in water samples fig 4a which was different from the individual profile for the spm and sediment samples fig 4b c in addition to tetra cdps pcdpss in the water samples were mainly composed of tri cdps 21 4 29 8 penta cdps 5 9 19 and di cdps 0 13 1 and the proportion of other pcdps congeners was relatively low 10 fig 4a this pattern was roughly consistent with the profiles of pcdpss and pcbs in the yangtze river zhang et al 2014a and resembled the congener profiles of pcdes and pcdts in chaohu lake zhang et al 2011 zhang et al 2018c zhu et al 2021 the other dominant congeners in spm and sediments were penta cdps 19 2 and hepta cdps 16 6 fig 4b c however the proportions of dps mon cdps and di cdps were relatively lower the pcdps congener patterns in spm and sediment samples from chaohu lake were also similar to those in the nanjing section of the yangtze river zhang et al 2014a these findings suggest that the medium and higher chlorinated congeners e g tetra cdps and hepta cdps in the sediment were less prone to degradation and removal than the lower chlorinated congeners in addition the percentages of higher chlorinated n chlorine atoms 5 6 7 pcdps congeners in spm and sediment samples were significantly higher than those in water this may be the result of their larger logk oc values 5 0 which would make them prone to be absorbed by particles and sediment yang et al 2013 3 2 pcdpss in fishes from chaohu lake as wild fish can serve as a good indicator of the status of pollution in the lake environment the levels of pcdpss in fish from chaohu lake were also determined in this work the 18pcdpss in 8 fish species ranged from 0 639 ng g to 1 32 ng g fig 3d table s12 with a species rank order of c alburnus s asotus m anguillicaudatus c auratus c idella p pekinensis c brachygnathus n tangkahkeii taihuensis chen higher levels of 2 2 3 3 tetra cdps 0 053 0 11 ng g and 2 3 4 5 tetra cdps 0 024 0 11 ng g were found in almost all eight fish species while relatively lower levels of dps 0 013 0 059 ng g and 4 mono cdps 0 018 0 071 ng g were recorded the dominant congeners in fishes were tetra cdpss 29 60 followed by penta cdpss 20 45 while the proportion of lower chlorinated congeners was relatively lower 10 fig 4d these results indicated that the medium and higher chlorinated congeners with higher logk ow values were more prone to be accumulated in fish muscle indicating that lipophilicity may be the governing factor that determined the bioaccumulation of pcdpss in aquatic organisms we speculated that higher biotransformation potentials and larger molecular volumes would impede the absorption of these congeners which could explain the lower proportion of hexa and hepta cdpss 9 3 3 relationships between fish ecological habits and 18pcdpss in fish according to their trophic levels the 8 fish species included in the present study were classified as planktivores herbivores omnivores and piscivores in addition their habitat preferences i e pelagic benthopelagic and demersal were also indicated table s3 pcdpss were always found at higher concentrations in higher trophic guilds e g c alburnus and s asotus or demersal fishes e g m anguillicaudatus and s asotus in contrast lower pcdpss levels were observed in pelagic and planktivorous fishes e g c brachygnathus and n tangkahkeii taihuensis chen p 0 05 specifically except for 2 4 5 tri cdps the highest concentrations of lower chlorinated pcdpss were exclusively found in s asotus the highest levels of 2 4 4 5 tetra cdps and 2 3 3 4 5 6 hexa cdps were detected in m anguillicaudatus medium trophic level which may be due to habitat preference and the hydrophobicity of these congeners except for 2 2 3 6 tetra cdps 2 2 4 4 5 penta cdps and 2 3 3 4 5 6 hexa cdps the levels of pcdpss in planktivorous fishes were significantly lower than those in herbivorous omnivorous and piscivorous fishes p 0 05 in general the rank order of 18pcdpss in fishes according to trophic level and habitat preference was demersal benthopelagic pelagic and piscivorous omnivorous herbivorous planktivorous since pcdpss were found to accumulate to a greater extent in fishes with bottom demersal habitat or higher trophic levels the sediment was speculated to be the main reservoir associated with the bioaccumulation of pcdpss in addition benthopelagic and piscivorous fishes should be the key links for the transportation of pcdpss from sediment into aquatic food webs additionally biomagnification of pcdpss was supported based on the higher 18pcdpss detected in omnivorous and piscivorous fishes principal component analysis pca was employed to explore the relationship between fish ecological habits trophic levels and habitat preferences and 18pcdpss in fish approximately 47 6 of the variation in the 18pcdpss among fish samples was explained by pc1 36 5 and pc2 11 1 fig s4 2 2 3 3 tetra cdps and 2 3 4 5 tetra cdps had high loadings along pc1 while pc2 loaded strongly for 2 2 3 4 5 penta cdps an obvious gradient along pc1 in 18pcdpss among different habitat preferences and trophic levels was observed demersal and pelagic species were positioned to the positive and negative ends of pc1 respectively piscivorous species were located at the positive end of pc1 while planktivorous fishes were grouped to the negative end of pc1 the major differences were driven by the concentrations of 2 2 3 3 tetra cdps 2 2 3 3 4 5 6 hepta cdps 2 3 4 5 tetra cdps and 2 3 4 5 6 penta cdps to summarize habitat preference and trophic level of fish can significantly affect the levels of pcdpss 3 4 partitioning of pcdpss in the water spm sediment system the partitioning of pcdpss in the water spm sediment system could have significant impacts on their fates in aquatic environments therefore based on the determined pcdpss concentrations in different environmental matrices from chaohu lake the logk oc values of the 18 detected pcdps congeners were calculated to assess their partitioning behaviour in the water spm sediment system in chaohu lake for the first time k oc 1 and k oc 2 represent the organic carbon normalized partition coefficients of pcdpss for the spm water system and the sediment water system respectively the ranges of logk oc 1 and logk oc 2 of pcdpss ranged from 4 61 0 28 to 5 54 0 12 l g and 4 38 0 31 to 5 69 0 19 l g respectively the values of logk oc 1 and logk oc 2 of pcdpss generally increased with the increasing number of chlorine atoms on the benzene rings fig s5 which was consistent with the sorption properties of pcdpss in yangtze river plain soil observed in the laboratory yang et al 2013 in addition our recent studies found that the average field logk oc values of pcdes and pcdts both of their structures resemble pcdpss also detected in the spm water system of chaohu lake with more chlorine atoms were much higher zhang et al 2018c zhu et al 2021 these results suggested that compounds with more strong hydrophobic groups e g cl atoms might be more prone to migrate from water to sediment and spm thereby resulting in higher logk oc values li et al 2021 zhang et al 2018c compared with the experimental logk oc logk oc exp of pcdpss the values of logk oc 1 and logk oc 2 of lower chlorinated congeners i e dps mon cdps di cdps and tri cdps were higher while the logk oc 1 and logk oc 2 of higher chlorinated congeners penta cdps hexa cdps and hepta cdps were lower yang et al 2013 for example the logk oc 1 logk oc 2 and logk oc exp of 4 4 di cdps were 4 69 4 97 and 4 20 respectively while the values for 2 2 3 3 4 5 6 hepta cdps were 5 34 5 69 and 6 47 respectively such results indicate that the sorption of higher chlorinated pcdps congeners would make it difficult to achieve equilibrium in the water spm sediment system in chaohu lake similar to pcdes and pcdts the higher chlorinated pcdpss may undergo various degradation processes in sediment and particulate matter resulting in a lower logk oc than that determined in a controlled laboratory experiment zhang et al 2018c zhu et al 2021 instead the higher logk oc 1 and logk oc 2 of lower chlorinated congeners in the water spm sediment suggested that the partitioning of lower chlorinated pcdps congeners was in an exceeded equilibrium status which might be partly due to their higher volatility mostrag et al 2010 we also speculate that a portion of lower chlorinated pcdpss in spm and sediment was derived from the degradation of higher chlorinated pcdpss we found that most of the logk oc 1 values of pcdpss except for dps and 4 mono cdps were lower than logk oc 2 such differences may be due to the sorption processes of pcdpss in the water sediment system being closer to achieve final dynamic equilibrium compared to the water spm system a large proportion of the pcdpss in sediment came from the pcdpss absorbed in spm thus pcdpss that enter the aquatic environment would first be absorbed in spm and then settle into sediments under the influence of gravity zhang et al 2014a moreover the easily disturbed characteristics of particulate matter and the mutual exchange and adsorption of pcdpss in the water spm system can partly explain why pcdpss can exist in sediments more stably yang et al 2019 however the sorption of pcdpss in the real water spm sediment system was influenced by many environmental factors including dissolved organic matter dom content salinity temperature and degradation of pcdps in spm and sediment mzoughi and chouba 2011 therefore more in depth research is warranted to elucidate the governing factor s that drive the partitioning of pcdpss in aquatic environments significant correlations r 2 0 5 p 0 05 between the 18pcdpss and particulate organic carbon poc content in spm total organic carbon toc content in sediment and dissolved organic carbon doc content in water were observed indicating that oc has a significant influence on the distribution of pcdpss in chaohu lake fig s6 the original differences between the highest and lowest 18pcdps concentrations in spm and sediment samples were 4 25 and 5 65 fold respectively p 0 05 however the maximum pcdps concentrations in spm and sediment samples following oc standardization were only 1 77 and 1 85 fold respectively p 0 05 fig s7 therefore we speculated that a portion of the pcdpss detected in the middle and eastern areas of chaohu lake may come from the western basin via the transmission of organic carbon neira et al 2018 zhu et al 2021 and oc also plays a key role in the redistribution of pcdpss in the freshwater lake water spm sediment system 3 5 bioaccumulation of pcdpss in different fishes on the basis of the measured concentrations of pcdpss in samples from chaohu lake the bioaccumulation potentials of pcdps congeners in fish relative to water spm and sediment from chaohu lake were quantitatively evaluated by bcfs converted to logarithmic values i e logbcfs bssafs and bsafs respectively the logbcf values of pcdpss in 8 fish species ranged from 3 91 to 5 18 l kg table s13 which were higher than the environmental protection agency epa recommended standard value bcf 5000 l kg i e logbcf 3 70 l kg this suggests that pcdpss have stronger accumulation potential and weaker metabolic activity in these fishes borga et al 2011 compared to lower chlorinated pcdpss higher logbcf values were observed in medium and higher chlorinated congeners in the same species of fish for instance logbcf values of 4 mono cdps in fishes ranged from 3 97 to 4 88 l kg while 2 2 3 3 4 5 6 hepta cdps ranged from 4 21 to 5 05 l kg since the logk ow values of pcdps congeners generally increased with an increasing number of chlorine atoms lipophilicity may be a critical factor in determining the bioaccumulation ability of pcdpss fu et al 2018 another interesting observation is that the maximum logbcfs for the same type of fish were mostly for penta cdpss or hexa cdpss rather than hepta cdpss similar to other typical halogenated aromatics e g pcbs pcdes and dioxins the molecular volumes of pcdpss increase as the number of substituted cl atoms increases however the bioaccumulation abilities of pcdpss first increase and then decrease as their molecular volumes increase which generally appears as a parabolic shape wang et al 2004 wu et al 2009 this may be the result of the larger molecular volumes of hepta cdpss which would obstruct their penetration through the cell membrane thereby resulting in lower bioaccumulation potentials gobas et al 1988 only two studies to date have reported the bcfs of pcdpss in aquatic organisms in laboratory experiments the logbcf values of pcdpss in fish from chaohu lake were significantly higher than those found in zebrafish larvae 2 23 3 18 l kg and comparable to those in the freshwater mussel anodonta woodiana 3 56 5 10 l kg determined in the laboratory fang et al 2018 zhang et al 2018a the bssaf and bsaf values of pcdpss in fishes ranged from 0 05 to 2 33 and 0 0360 to 4 94 respectively tables s14 and s15 dps had the highest bssaf and bsaf among the congeners 2 33 and 4 94 while 2 2 3 3 4 5 6 hepta cdps had the lowest 0 0500 and 0 0360 several studies have suggested that bsaf values of pahs with larger molecular structures were lower kwok et al 2013 which is consistent with our results i e pcdpss with a larger molecular structure possessed lower bioavailability from spm and sediments to fish another factor might be that higher chlorinated pcdpss have a greater probability of being metabolized to lower chlorinated congeners thereby leading to lower bioaccumulation in fish zeng et al 2015 zhang et al 2018d the bssaf values in the 8 fish species were all higher than the bsaf values this may be due to spm being more turbulent than sediment leading to the sorption of pcdpss in spm restricting dynamic equilibrium and thus lower pcdpss concentrations in spm in addition the content and properties of oc were also key factors in the adsorption capacity and bioavailability of organic substances ghosh 2007 and thus the differences in oc content and properties between spm 0 670 1 69 and sediments 0 420 1 78 could have significant impacts on the basf and bassf of pcdpss in fishes the values of logbcf bassf and basf were related to fish species lower bcf bssaf and bsaf values were primarily observed in c brachygnathus n tangkahkeii taihuensis chen p pekinensis and c idella while higher values were observed in the other 4 species i e c auratus m anguillicaudatus c alburnus and s asotus specifically significantly stronger p 0 05 bioaccumulation effects were exhibited in m anguillicaudatus 4 93 l kg 0 878 and 0 662 for logbcf bssaf and bsaf respectively and s asotus 4 91 l kg 0 905 and 0 783 respectively therefore the demersal habitat preference of both m anguillicaudatus and s asotus suggested that habitat preference was an important factor for the accumulation potential of pcdpss in fish interestingly the size of fish was also related to the bioaccumulation potential of pcdpss it became weaker with an increase in fish size for species at the same trophic level the fish body dilution effect was a possible reason in addition the bioaccumulation capacity of organic pollutants was also reported to be related to the feeding rates and metabolic capacity of fish bandowe et al 2014 which should be further evaluated in future studies additionally it was found that the bioaccumulation potential of pcdpss in omnivorous and piscivorous fishes was significantly greater than that in planktivorous and herbivorous fishes indicating that pcdpss may have biomagnification potential via freshwater aquatic food webs with the vertical upwards movement of habitat preference of fish species in the lake the value of logbcf decreased a significant positive correlation between logbcfs and logk ows or logk ocs was observed indicating that pcdpss with greater logk ow or logk oc values possessed higher bioaccumulation potentials in fish fig 5 a negative correlations between bssafs or bsafs and logk ows or logk ocs were observed figs 5b c and s8 suggesting that bssaf and bsaf values increased as the number of chlorine substitutions decreased these results indicated that the bioaccumulation capacity of untested pcdpss could be assessed to a certain degree using basic physicochemical properties 3 6 health and ecological risks of pcdpss first considering the ubiquitous detection of pcdpss in edible fish species from chaohu lake human pcdps intake via fish consumption was estimated using the edi and was in the range of 0 17 0 34 Î¼g kg per day gu et al 2006 additionally based on the rep values of pcdpss zhang et al 2016 the tolerable daily intake tdi of pcdpss was estimated to be 9 58 10 3 2 23 10 2 pg kg teq per day far lower than the oral reference dose 0 7 pg kg per day for tcdd proposed by the u s epa table s16 environmental protection agency 2012 the species specific bioaccumulation of pcdpss in different fish species from chaohu lake suggested the biomagnification potential of pcdpss via the aquatic food web given the limited number of pcdps congeners tested and the potential lifetime exposure of pcdpss in residents living around chaohu lake basin the potential dietary risks should not be neglected even though the edi was very low second based on the reported and ecosar predicted toxicity the calculated cumulative rqs of pcdps congeners tested in surface water from chaohu lake were in the range of 0 00650 066 0 1 for green algae indicating that the pcdps congeners tested might not induce severe ecological risks to organisms in chaohu lake fig s9 and table s17 however considering the limited number of pcdps congeners investigated 21 out of 209 congeners in total and scarce pcdps toxicity data reported to date the total rqs of all pcdps congeners may rise to nearly 1 0 0 065 0 66 after correction with an uncertainty factor of 10 therefore the ecological and health risks of such compounds deserve continued attention third based on the reported rep values of several pcdpss for mammals the teq values of pcdpss in surface water spm sediment and fish samples were calculated as 9 4 10 5 5 2 10 3 pg l 1 6 10 3 1 3 10 2 pg g 3 3 10 3 2 1 10 2 pg g and 2 3 10 3 5 4 10 3 pg g respectively tables s18 and s19 zhang et al 2016 although the teq values of pcdpss were far lower than those of dl pcbs and pcdd fs in typical aquatic matrices pham et al 2019 zhang et al 2021b pcdpss still deserve more attention due to their agonistic activities and potential developmental toxicities at environmentally relevant levels zhang et al 2014b zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2018a finally the total annual input of pcdpss from 8 main tributaries to chaohu lake was quantitatively evaluated as 14 2 kg year tables s10 and s20 which roughly suggests that the main sources of pcdpss may be industrial wastewater discharge and chemical production processes in the chaohu basin however more detailed source identification using new technologies e g stable isotope techniques should be conducted in future studies these results indicated that the environmental concentrations and ecological risks of pcdpss in chaohu lake may continue to increase if no effective action is taken 4 conclusion in summary our study confirmed the prevalent presence of pcdpss in a natural water body chaohu lake including in surface water spm sediment and edible fishes for the first time compared with surface water samples the proportions of medium and high chlorinated pcdpss in spm and sediment were significantly higher larger bcf values of pcdpss in edible fish species were recorded indicating the higher bioaccumulation ability of pcdpss additional higher pcdps concentrations were found in higher trophic level fishes which showed their biomagnification potential in addition the partitioning behaviour of pcdpss in the water spm sediment system was quantitatively clarified for the first time and it was found that oc could have significant impacts on the redistribution of pcdpss in chaohu lake the daily intake of pcdpss via fish consumption was estimated to be 9 58 10 3 2 23 10 2 pg kg teq per day the corrected cumulative rqs of 0 065 0 66 were identified for green algae given the higher bioaccumulation and biomagnification potentials and cumulative rqs close to 1 of pcdpss in aquatic environments as well as their potential toxicities further research to evaluate their impacts on wildlife and human health is warranted overall our findings provide insights into the environmental behaviour and the health and ecological risks of pcdpss in a natural water

15979,response of aquatic organisms to eutrophication have been well reported while less studies are available for the recovery of eutrophic lakes following a reduction in the external loading especially for systems where nitrogen is reduced but the phosphorus concentration is maintained high due to internal loading diatoms are nitrate no3 n opportunists but can also use ammonium nh4 n they may therefore be more sensitive to nitrogen reduction than other algae that typically prefer nh4 n we document the variations of nutrients and diatoms in subtropical eutrophic lake taihu over 28 yr during which a reduction of the external loading resulted from lake management according to the results of change point analysis data on environmental variables were divided into two periods p1 1992 2006 p2 2007 2019 with two different seasons ws winter spring sa summer autumn respectively compared with p1 ws the concentration of nh4 n decreased significantly whereas no3 n showed no significant change in p2 ws in contrast nh4 n concentrations were low and showed no significant changes in p1 sa and p2 sa and no3 n decreased significantly in the latter period accordingly no3 n nh4 n mass ratios in p1 sa and p2 ws were all significantly higher than those in p2 sa and p1 ws respectively the biomass of ws diatom increased significantly and the timing of the peak biomass shifted from p1 sa to p2 ws since 2007 the sem analysis showed that no3 n was retained as a statistically significant predictor for diatom biomass in p1 sa and significant effects of windspeed zooplankton and nh4 n on diatom biomass in p2 ws windspeed and zooplankton have further changed the biomass of diatoms in the case of declining inorganic nitrogen we conclude that the magnitude of vernal suppression or stimulation of diatom assemblages has increased concomitant with the variations of nh4 n and no3 n nh4 n mass ratios diatoms response to nh4 n or no3 n is apparently changing in response to water temperature in this eutrophic shallow lake thus parallel reductions in external nitrogen loading along with variations in dominant inorganic nitrogen will stimulate the growth of diatom and therefore increase the total biomass of phytoplankton in still high internal phosphorus loading which is should be regarded as a good sign of restoration measures graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrogen reduction nitrate ammonium diatoms winter spring 1 introduction aquatic ecosystems in densely populated areas have been negatively affected by eutrophication many of them driven by increasing external nutrient loading from domestic sewage industrial waste water and agricultural diffuse sources michalak et al 2013 tong et al 2020 common symptoms of eutrophication include turbid water dense algal blooms loss of biodiversity and loss of recreation and esthetic value huisman et al 2018 ho et al 2019 to mitigate these negative effects of eutrophication the chinese government is working to reduce nutrient inputs and restore the functionality of lake ecosystems since 2000 zhou et al 2017 fu et al 2021 however eutrophication remains a major problem either because external loading has not been reduced to sufficiently low levels or because of internal lake mechanisms chemical or biological that prevent or delay recovery sÃ¸ndergaard et al 2007 van meter et al 2018 xu et al 2021 reduction in external loading of phosphorus p and nitrogen n might be accompanied by a delay in lake recovery because internal loading continuously replenishes the p pool in the water column jeppesen et al 2005a b anneville et al 2019 ibÃ¡Ã±ez and peÃ±uelas 2019 based on previous studies a quick response of the total nitrogen tn concentration has been observed in shallow lakes because n loss by denitrification results in negligible internal n loading sÃ¸ndergaard et al 2007 shi et al 2022 there have also been several summaries of biotic responses to reductions in nutrient loading such as the biomass of planktivorous fish declined and the proportion of potential piscivores increased zooplankton biomass decreased secchi transparency increased and therefore submerged macrophytes appeared mitchell and perrow 1997 jeppesen et al 2005a b ibÃ¡Ã±ez and peÃ±uelas 2019 typically the phytoplankton community has responded as well the contribution of non heterocystous cyanobacteria decline substantially while n2 fixing cyanobacteria dinophytes cryptophytes and chlorophytes increased jeppesen et al 2002 2005a b moss et al 2005 an open question is how a delay in the p reduction in lakes but fast response of n will affect the phytoplankton community response n2 fixing cyanobacteria can fix sufficient n to offset a reduction of n inputs schindler et al 2008 shatwell and kÃ¶hler 2019 thus emphasis has been placed on n2 fixing cyanobacteria how it responds to n reduction or low external n concentration whereas other phytoplankton taxa received much less attention anthropogenic activities are altering both total nutrient loads and they are also changing the dominant form of n nutrient delivered to aquatic ecosystems glibert et al 2016 whether different chemical forms of n influence primary producers differentially are well documented in marine and freshwater ecosystems berg et al 2003 donald et al 2011 andersen et al 2020 diatoms are widely distributed in almost all aquatic habitats and have been estimated to contribute approximately 20 of global primary productivity falkowski et al 1998 field et al 1998 kong et al 2021 it has been suggested that diatoms were the only phytoplankton group significantly associated with the uptake of nitrate no3 n because they may have enhanced no3 n handling and assimilatory efficiency relative to other algae lomas and glibert 2000 needoba and harrison 2004 andersen et al 2020 while the classical physiological literatures conclude that ammonium nh4 n is the preferred form of n for phytoplankton mccarthy 1981 raven et al 1992 the favorability for nh4 n by phytoplankton is a function of both the preferential use of nh4 n and its favorable energetics and the repressive effect of nh4 n on no3 n uptake and assimilation dortch 1990 lomas and glibert 1999a 1999b it has also been documented that under conditions of highly elevated nh4 n both the tn taken up and overall growth with nh4 n enrichment can be suppressed rather than enhanced glibert et al 2014 swarbrick et al 2019 lake taihu is the third largest shallow eutrophic lake where non n2 fixing cyanobacteria microcystis spp dominated in summer over the past three decades liu et al 2011 guo et al 2019 until recently the large diatoms e g aulacoseira spp synedra spp and asterionella spp and small cryptophytes cryptomonas spp and chroomonas spp and green algae dictyosphaerium sp increased in spring guo et al 2019 since the highly publicized drinking water crisis in 2007 guo 2007 a variety of restoration measures were implemented to control eutrophication including construction of sewage pipelines and new wastewater treatment plants qin et al 2019 to date tn has declined significantly and total phosphorus tp has slightly increased and cyanobacterial blooms have not decreased in size and frequency as expected from abatement efforts qin et al 2019 qin et al 2020 at the same time the frequency of spring diatom bloom increased in lake taihu liu x unpublished data previous studies have emphasized that the changes in the spring phytoplankton assemblage in the lake are influenced by climate change guo et al 2019 deng et al 2018 2019 2021 in addition diatoms can provide most of the high quality food for zooplankton growth in spring and thus their abundance depend strongly on the reproduction of predators pagano 2008 however it is generally agreed that n and p are linked to core biology process which constrain biotic production of aquatic ecosystems elser et al 2007 conley et al 2009 liang et al 2020 glibert et al 2016 confirmed that diatoms appear to be disproportionately affected by ratios of no3 n with nh4 n in lake taihu the concentration of dissolved inorganic n mainly composed by no3 n and nh4 n gradually decreased since 2007 zhu et al 2020 thus we hypothesized that 1 the effects of n concentration on diatom in the different seasons varied with dominant inorganic n no3 n and nh4 n in lake taihu 2 diatoms as reliable indicators of ecosystem response to n reduction especially to changing of dominant inorganic n in eutrophic lakes here a large long term intensive monitoring data set of nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton for the period 1992 2019 available in the northern part of lake taihu were analyze an investigation of 48 shallow lakes on the yangtze river plain was also utilized to examine these hypotheses 2 methods 2 1 description of the study area the middle lower yangtze plain one of the three largest plains in china contains numerous shallow eutrophic lakes driven by nutrient enrichment yang et al 2008 lake taihu is located in the eastern region of the yangtze river delta 30 56 31 34 n 119 54 120 35 e it is a polymictic lake with a mean depth of 1 95 m a surface area of 2338 km2 a catchment area of 36 500 km2 annual freshwater input to the lake averages 88 108 m3 and the average water retention time is approximately 220 309 days qin et al 2007 meiliang bay is located in the northern part of lake taihu near the suburbs of wuxi city and has an area of 132 km2 the liangxi and lujiang rivers which are connected to meiliang bay discharge effluents from the cities of wuxi and changzhou into the lake in response to heavy industrial and agricultural pollution bloom forming cyanobacteria in meiliang bay have been frequently observed in recent decades the lake basin is influenced by the east asian monsoon and exhibits a typical subtropical climate with four distinct seasons spring march may summer june august autumn september november and winter december february in the present study the biomass of diatom in 48 shallow lakes with different nutrient levels were surveyed in spring 2012 the lake area and mean depth ranged from 1 3 to 80 4 km2 and 0 6 to 7 1 m respectively there were three sampling sites in each lake detailed information on the sample locations and the geographical information can be found in fig s1 and table s1 2 2 sample collection and laboratory analysis data originate from an ongoing long term monitoring program in the taihu laboratory for lake ecosystem research the analysis focuses on the period 1992 2019 during which the physical chemical and biological data have been collected at monthly intervals samples of water quality and diatoms were collected from 2 sites s1 and s2 fig s2 in meiliang bay of northern lake taihu the water samples were collected with a 2 5 l modified patalas bottle sampler at each site water samples were taken by mixing the surface 0 5 m middle and bottom 0 5 m above the bottom layers of the water column monitored water quality parameters included water temperature total nitrogen tn tp nitrate no3 n ammonium nh4 n orthophosphate po4 p silicate si and chlorophyll a chl a water transparency was determined using a secchi disk detailed analytical methods for water quality parameters are described in jin and tu 1990 the radiation network in eastern china comprises three stations shanghai nanjing and hangzhou zhang et al 2004 and mean global radiation values for lake taihu were calculated air temperature and windspeed were obtained from the china meteorological data sharing service system http data cma cn wuxi meteorological station 31 58 n 120 32 e phytoplankton samples 1 l were fixed with lugol s iodine solution 2 final concentration and settled for 48 h then the supernatant was slowly removed by siphoning and 30 ml was retained for measuring cell density cell density was microscopically determined in a 0 1 ml sedgwick rafter counting chamber at 400 magnification olympus bx51 japan the mean cell volume was calculated using appropriate geometric calculations and volume values were converted to biomass assuming that 1 mm3 of volume was equivalent to 1 mg of fresh weight biomass hillebrand et al 1999 in these samples the total biomass of phytoplankton from 2015 to 2019 was calculated by the formula 0 003 chl a 8 76 which was recorded in chen et al 1998 all diatom sample preparations followed standard procedures battarbee et al 2002 nomenclature and taxonomy mainly followed krammer and lange bertalot 1988a b 1991a b 2000 zooplankton samples 7 5 l were concentrated with a 64 Î¼m mesh net and preserved in 4 formaldehyde at a final volume of 50 ml the zooplankton samples were analyzed at 40 magnification with a microscope olympus corporation tokyo japan and identified to species or genus level zhang and huang 1991 the detailed methods for sampling water quality analysis and diatom identification used in 48 shallow lakes were the same as those in lake taihu 2 3 data analysis annual mean air temperature showed a significant increase p 0 05 and water temperature did not correspond to the air temperature in lake taihu fig s3 compared with air temperature the growth of phytoplankton was much more directly influenced by water temperature in lakes anderson 2000 thus water temperature was used in our study the threshold of si concentration was selected as 0 5 mg l this corresponded to the si concentration at which the growth of diatom was limited lund 1964 prior to analysis a range of lakes with si concentrations lower than 0 5 mg l was excluded fig s4 the total diatom biomass mainly covered the samplings from late december to april and june to october thus winter spring ws was defined as late december to april and summer autumn sa as june to october in our analysis we estimated the timing of the seasonal peak throughout the entire year the central tendency t using the month co ordinate of the center of gravity of the area below graphs of monthly means t i 1 12 m x m i 1 12 x m where xm is the mean biomass in month m january 1 december 12 edwards and richardson 2004 we examined whether diatom influence where the thresholds occur responded to changes in tn and tp in the water column using a change point analysis the package strucchange in r of diatom biomass and the timing of the peak in their biomass a function named breakpoints was used to determine the locations of the changes the sequential f statistic was performed to test for a change in the mean and the peak f value indicated a shift the present analysis focuses on the variations of total diatom trends in plankton biomass and abundance were evaluated using the nonparametric mann kendall mk trend test helsel and hirsch 1992 because changes over time did not appear to be linear multiple comparison analysis of anova and box plots were used to test whether significant differences observed in environmental factors between seasons the agricolae and stats packages in r were conducted in this analysis the linear regression was used to estimate the differences between the peak of total diatom in 1992 and 2019 a strong negative difference indicates the peaks are becoming earlier edwards and richardson 2004 theil sen regression was used to robustly explore the effects of no3 n nh4 n mass ratios on total diatom biomass in lake taihu and the 48 other lakes theil sen estimation is a robust method that determines the slope of the regression line via the median of the slopes su et al 2020 the mblm package in r was used to perform this analysis structural equation modeling sem was used to explore the pathways by which windspeeds nutrients and zooplankton affects diatom biomass and to test diatom respond to which forms of inorganic n in different seasons we first constructed a full model that included possible pathways then most of nonsignificant pathways were eliminated to optimize the model sem which involved sets of multiple regression analyses allowed a rigorous estimation of the causal relationship network grace 2006 the standardized path coefficients between two variables represented the relative strength of a relationship we used a chisq test and p values to evaluate the fit of the models e g models were considered to have a good fit when the p values ranged from 0 1 to 1 higher temporal variation of phytoplankton communities than spatial heterogeneity in meiliang bay of lake taihu guo et al 2019 the sem thus was performed based on the spatial average data pooled from the two sampling sites lavaan and semplot packages were used in the sem analysis biological data were log10 x 1 transformed before the theil sen analysis and all the variables were log10 x 1 transformed before the sem analysis we conducted hierarchical partitioning to estimate the percent contribution to the explained variance by the individual predictors examined using the hier part package within r mao et al 2020 3 results 3 1 long term trends in environmental variables from 1992 to 2019 mean ws and sa water temperatures were 9 3 1 2 c and 25 7 0 8 c respectively fig s5 water temperature in lake taihu was generally significantly higher in sa season than in ws season fig 1 no pronounced changes were found in water temperature in any of the seasons p 0 05 table s2 windspeeds declined significantly both in ws and sa seasons mean radiations around lake taihu were 972 96 mj m2 in ws season and 1112 81 mj m2 in sa season it was significantly higher in sa than in ws increasing trends appeared in radiations in ws season concentrations of tp averaged 0 10 0 04 mg l and 0 15 0 04 mg l respectively in lake taihu during ws season and sa season in all years fig s6 tp decreased significantly in ws season whereas it increased significantly in sa season p 0 001 table s2 the seasonal variation of po4 p exhibited the same trends as tp concentrations of tn averaged 3 96 1 40 mg l and 2 37 0 50 mg l respectively in the lake during ws season and sa season in all years fig s6 tn exhibited significant seasonal and interannual variations and the concentration was substantially higher in ws seasons than in sa seasons fig 2 both no3 n and nh4 n concentrations were significantly higher in ws seasons mean no3 n 1 11 0 48 mg l mean nh4 n 1 18 0 91 mg l than in sa seasons 0 40 0 20 mg l 0 29 0 14 mg l decreasing trends appeared in tn and nh4 n in ws season p 0 001 table s2 whereas no clear trend was found in sa season for no3 n decreasing trends appeared in sa season 3 2 change point analysis and comparison of environmental variables in different periods changes in diatom biomass and the timing of the peak in their biomass were detected through change point analysis and sequential f statistic fig s7 results showed that breakpoints of diatom biomass and the timing of peak biomass were in 2008 and 2007 respectively thus data on environmental variables were divided into two periods p1 and p2 for the subsequent analysis p1 refers to the years from 1992 to 2006 and p2 refers to the years from 2007 to 2019 for ws seasons mean windspeed was 2 8 0 2 m s during p1 and significantly lower 2 4 0 3 m s in p2 it was significantly higher in p1 mean value 2 8 0 2 m s than in p2 2 3 0 2 m s for sa seasons windspeeds exhibited no significant difference between ws and sa seasons in the same period fig 1 compared to the ws season in p1 radiation was significantly higher than that in the same season in p2 while there was no significant difference among periods in the sa season there was no significant difference in tp concentration between p1 ws and p1 sa but it showed significantly lower concentration in p2 ws mean value 0 08 0 02 mg l than in p2 sa 0 17 0 03 mg l fig 2 during ws season tp concentration was significantly higher in p1 than that in p2 for sa season it was much lower in p1 than in p2 po4 p concentration showed a similar pattern to that of tp concentration but it was no significant difference between p1 ws and p2 ws during p1 ws the mean value of tn concentration was 4 74 1 17 mg l which was significantly higher than that during p2 ws 3 07 1 06 mg l no significant difference was observed in tn between the two sa seasons no3 n concentration showed significantly higher value during sa season in the p1 mean value 0 52 0 16 mg l than in the p2 0 26 0 14 mg l while there was no significant difference between ws seasons the concentration of nh4 n averaged 1 73 0 81 mg l in the p1 ws which was significantly higher than in the p2 ws and other two sa seasons in sa season nh4 n concentrations showed no significant difference between p1 and p2 mass ratios of no3 n nh4 n were usually much higher in p1 sa and p2 ws than in the other periods fig 2 average values for p1 sa p2 ws p2 sa and p1 ws were 2 3 1 6 2 7 1 8 1 0 0 4 and 1 0 0 8 by weight 3 3 temporal change in plankton biomass and abundance the main genus of diatom asterionella spp aulacoseira spp cyclotella spp synedra spp and nitzschia spp were observed and identified in lake taihu from 1992 to 2019 fig s8 the ws diatom biomass in all years ranged from 0 01 to 7 08 mg l with an average of 1 40 mg l the sa diatom biomass varied from 0 09 to 2 78 mg l with an average of 0 89 mg l seasonal and interannual changes in diatom showed that ws biomass was low from 1992 to 2006 after which an increasing trend was apparent fig 3 a the trends of total phytoplankton biomass followed the same pattern as diatom increasing significantly in the ws season fig 3b no pronounced changes were found in sa season mk trend test p 0 05 the contribution of diatom to total phytoplankton biomass varied from 7 to 62 in ws with no clear trend over time fig 3c significant decline in the proportion of diatom biomass appeared in sa season however during the study period the timing of peak diatom biomass showed a significant advancement fig 4 b it fluctuated widely but generally appeared in sa season prior to 2007 thereafter the timing of the peak biomass advanced from the sa season to the ws season except 2016 and 2018 during p1 the peak diatom biomass appeared in june summer autumn fig 4a but in march winter spring during p2 the peak in p1 sa was significantly lower than in p2 ws f test p 0 001 there was also a slight peak of diatom biomass in august summer autumn during p2 but no significant difference was found in peak biomass between august p2 sa and june p1 sa f test p 0 25 the abundance of zooplankton in ws fluctuated between 100 and 1363 ind l from 1999 to 2019 without showing any clear pattern fig 5 in sa season however the zooplankton abundance decreased significantly p 0 001 3 4 potential drivers of changes in diatom biomass because the timing of the peak diatom biomass appeared in the p1 sa and p2 ws fig 4b they were chosen in the sem analysis which tried to show the effects of n on diatom in different temperature significant effects of windspeed nh4 n concentration and zooplankton abundance on diatom biomass were found for the p2 ws fig 6 only no3 n was retained as a statistically significant predictor for diatom biomass in sa in the sem analysis no3 n nh4 n ratios had significant and positive effects on diatom biomass with biomass advancing linearly with increasing no3 n nh4 n ratios in lake taihu and in the 48 other lakes fig 7 4 discussion globally diatoms are used in biomonitoring to assessing the ecological status of aquatic systems because they have a cosmopolitan nature short life span and quick response to environmental and anthropogenic disturbances malviya et al 2016 pandey et al 2017 here we found that diatom increased greatly in ws season and apparently responded differently to different dominant inorganic n and seasons during the process of the external loading reduction of a eutrophic lake 4 1 diatom responses to the n reduction in different seasons the n but not p concentrations changed markedly in lake taihu after 2007 confirming that tn can respond quickly to nutrient management in the watershed jeppesen et al 2005a 2005b sÃ¸ndergaard et al 2007 the concentrations of tn as well as no3 n and nh4 n declined especially in ws season despite the significant reduction of tn the lake was still eutrophic with the mean value above the hypereutrophic of tn and tp concentration thresholds tn 1 4 mg l tp 0 05 mg l usepa 2009 moss et al 2005 and schindler et al 2008 demonstrated that n2 fixing cyanobacteria appeared in significant abundance within weeks of reducing inputs of tn at constant inputs of tp a recently analysis of data from lake taihu has also shown the biomass proportion of n2 fixing cyanobacteria increased which corresponded to deceased tn tp mass ratios after 2007 zhang et al 2021 klausmeier et al 2004 reported that redfield tn tp ratio of 7 5 is not a universal biochemical optimum and the optimal tn tp stoichiometry of algae ranges from 3 7 20 3 by weight although annual mean tn tp mass ratios reduced to 21 near to optimal tn tp in p2 tn tp mass ratios averaged 39 higher than optimal tn tp in ws season and showed no significant difference between p1 ws averaged 42 and p2 ws averaged 37 p 0 05 fig s9 our results revealed that it was not changes in tn tp that triggered an increase in the biomass of spring diatoms in lake taihu in the early study of diatoms they did not find the significant relationships between diatom proportion of total phytoplankton and tn tp in the lake mccarthy et al 2009 thus we can speculate that a decrease in n loading and the concomitant decrease in nh4 n concentrations in ws season may have driven spring increase in diatoms in lake taihu the lower energetic costs of uptake and assimilation of nh4 n has led to the common assumption that nh4 n is generally used first by phytoplankton especially when n is in low concentrations but the preference for nh4 n is not universal dugdale et al 2012 glibert et al 2016 hence phytoplankton inhibition by nh4 n enrichment has been reported in many aquatic ecosystems such as the delaware estuary in the united states nh4 n 0 18 mg l yoshiyama and sharp 2006 the san francisco bay delta nh4 n 0 02 0 29 mg l wilkerson et al 2006 buffalo pound lake and wascana lake in canada nh4 n ca 1 5 mg l waiser et al 2011 swarbrick et al 2019 and it has been confirmed experimentally parker et al 2012 nh4 n as one of the most important predictors with negative effects on total algae and cyanobacteria which was also suggested in the previous study of lake taihu mao et al 2020 our data indicate a suppression of diatoms at high concentrations of nh4 n 1 73 0 81 mg l during p1 ws being more pronounced than for other phytoplankton including cryptophytes and green algae fig s10 swarbrick et al 2019 exposure to high nh4 n reduce the growth of diatoms by enhancement of energetic costs in cells through photorespiration raven 2011 importantly when the diatom is provided with nh4 n only photorespiration responses to other stress factors such as cold temperatures can increase significantly kangasjÃ¤rvi et al 2012 by contrast diatoms are recognized as being no3 n opportunists they can take up no3 n as nutritional requirement or use it as an oxidant to dissipate the periodic overflow of electron energy and prevent photoinhibitory lomas and glibert 1999a this is attributed to the special n transport and assimilation pathways in diatom cells such as an easily induced nitrate reductase blomqvist et al 1994 higher density of no3 n uptake transporters glibert et al 2016 a capacity to store no3 n in internal vacuoles lomas and glibert 2000 and the ability to respire no3 n under dark or anoxic conditions kamp et al 2011 however the pathway of no3 n uptake and assimilation varies with environmental conditions for example low temperature may contribute to excess in electrons because the light reactions of photosynthesis are relatively temperature insensitive but calvin cycle reactions are temperature sensitive leading to low electron transfer rates in cells lomas and glibert 1999a assimilative no3 n reduction can be used as a protection mechanism to buffer these excess electrons and dissipate high energy from light harvesting glibert et al 2016 under low water temperature 9 3 1 2 c in p1 ws in lake taihu high nh4 n with low no3 n nh4 n may therefore have disfavored the growth of diatoms with the decrease of nh4 n and increase of no3 n nh4 n in p2 ws no3 n use may not have been inhibited by nh4 n and no3 n uptake might have been an important pathway for energy dissipation at low temperatures glibert et al 2016 low nh4 n thus have been used as nutritional requirement instead thus we speculate that the absorption of nh4 n and the protection mechanism of no3 n jointly promoted the increase of diatom biomass in p2 ws under high water temperature 25 7 0 8 c in p1 sa photorespiration increases under conditions of high light and high temperature kangasjÃ¤rvi et al 2012 calvin cycle reactions of photosynthesis are no longer limited by temperature and able to utilize the higher daily light doses for higher photosynthetic productivity smith and platt 1985 descolas gros and de billy 1987 lomas and glibert 1999a it means that electrons from light harvesting can be used promptly in calvin cycle reactions the protection mechanism of no3 n may be no longer needed in cells no3 n use is therefore not expected to be inhibited by low nh4 n concentrations at high no3 n nh4 n under the condition of low n in summer cyanobacteria and chlorophytes were more strongly stimulated by nh4 n whereas diatoms were often equally or more strongly stimulated by no3 n andersen et al 2020 diatoms may have weak competition to utilize nh4 n in summer when the cyanobacteria prevailed in lake taihu no3 n thus have been used as nutritional requirement for diatoms in this period we also found that the increased spring diatoms biomass coincided with the increased no3 n nh4 n mass ratios in 48 shallow lakes in the yangtze river region being concurrent with the findings for lake okeechobee mccarthy et al 2009 our findings on n suppression or stimulation are consistent with results of short term nutrient enrichment studies lomas and glibert 1999 glibert et al 2014 shangguan et al 2017 and month long mesocosm experiments donald et al 2011 swarbrick et al 2019 all of which identify unique effects of n in p rich ecosystems 4 2 other potential drivers of diatom biomass light availability and resources conditions e g p and si potentially control diatom have been well characterized reynolds 1984 diatom can grow at very low irradiances 1 Î¼e m2 s richardson et al 1983 showing physiological advantage in waters with high levels of mixing during our study period the light intensities in spring were always higher than 46 Î¼e m2 s liu x unpublished data implying that the light demand of diatoms was met although light radiation increased in p2 ws and a reduced windspeed may also have increased the light availability in the water column in spring guo et al 2019 deng et al 2021 water transparency indicated as underwater light conditions fleming lehtinen and laamanen 2012 was not significantly improved in lake taihu fig s11 our results confirmed that the conditions of decreased windspeed and increased light radiation could favor the growth of diatoms when the concentration of nh4 n was reduced in lake taihu diatom being a good competitor at low po4 p concentrations 0 001 mg l benefit of low p concentrations tilman and kilham 1976 sommer 1983 interlandi et al 1999 bertrand et al 2003 rÃ¼hland et al 2010 helliwell et al 2021 showed that p limited diatoms use a ca2 dependent signaling pathway to sense and respond to the critical macronutrient p diatom recovery from p limitation requires rapid and substantial increases in n assimilation and this process is dependent on p ca2 signaling p ca2 signaling thus mediates fundamental cross talk between the vital nutrients p and n thamatrakoln 2021 because of p release in sediments jeppesen et al 2005 a b tp has remained stable in the water column and even increased in sa season after external loading reduction since 2007 in lake taihu thus it is not likely that diatom growth was limited by p and inorganic n assimilation was affected in p enriched water column additionally si concentrations were above the growth limiting level for diatoms of 0 5 mg l in the lake lund 1964 the effects of zooplankton grazing on biomass and composition of phytoplankton including diatoms are well established e g winder and schindler 2004 pagano 2008 as also indicated by the sem analysis showing a significant grazing pressure on the diatoms in lake taihu nevertheless compared with inorganic n the effect of zooplankton appeared to be of modest importance having relatively weaker independent effects on ws diatom biomass fig s12 our results indicate that zooplankton was one of the important factors in influencing the biomass of diatom in the case of declining nh4 n in lake taihu 5 conclusion this study investigated the variations of nutrients and diatoms in subtropical eutrophic lake taihu over 28 yr 1992 2019 during a decrease of n and slightly increase of p our results highlighted the onset of increased spring diatoms and the timing of the peak biomass shifted from sa to ws season coincides with the significantly decreased nh4 n concentrations at the winter spring low temperatures we conclude that the magnitude of vernal suppression or stimulation of diatom assemblages has increased concomitant with no3 n nh4 n mass ratios and climatic changes in this eutrophic shallow lake thus the parallel reductions in external n loading along with variations in dominant inorganic n will stimulate the growth of diatoms diatom biomass increase in spring is a valuable indicator during the process of the external loading reduction in eutrophic lakes authors

15979,response of aquatic organisms to eutrophication have been well reported while less studies are available for the recovery of eutrophic lakes following a reduction in the external loading especially for systems where nitrogen is reduced but the phosphorus concentration is maintained high due to internal loading diatoms are nitrate no3 n opportunists but can also use ammonium nh4 n they may therefore be more sensitive to nitrogen reduction than other algae that typically prefer nh4 n we document the variations of nutrients and diatoms in subtropical eutrophic lake taihu over 28 yr during which a reduction of the external loading resulted from lake management according to the results of change point analysis data on environmental variables were divided into two periods p1 1992 2006 p2 2007 2019 with two different seasons ws winter spring sa summer autumn respectively compared with p1 ws the concentration of nh4 n decreased significantly whereas no3 n showed no significant change in p2 ws in contrast nh4 n concentrations were low and showed no significant changes in p1 sa and p2 sa and no3 n decreased significantly in the latter period accordingly no3 n nh4 n mass ratios in p1 sa and p2 ws were all significantly higher than those in p2 sa and p1 ws respectively the biomass of ws diatom increased significantly and the timing of the peak biomass shifted from p1 sa to p2 ws since 2007 the sem analysis showed that no3 n was retained as a statistically significant predictor for diatom biomass in p1 sa and significant effects of windspeed zooplankton and nh4 n on diatom biomass in p2 ws windspeed and zooplankton have further changed the biomass of diatoms in the case of declining inorganic nitrogen we conclude that the magnitude of vernal suppression or stimulation of diatom assemblages has increased concomitant with the variations of nh4 n and no3 n nh4 n mass ratios diatoms response to nh4 n or no3 n is apparently changing in response to water temperature in this eutrophic shallow lake thus parallel reductions in external nitrogen loading along with variations in dominant inorganic nitrogen will stimulate the growth of diatom and therefore increase the total biomass of phytoplankton in still high internal phosphorus loading which is should be regarded as a good sign of restoration measures graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrogen reduction nitrate ammonium diatoms winter spring 1 introduction aquatic ecosystems in densely populated areas have been negatively affected by eutrophication many of them driven by increasing external nutrient loading from domestic sewage industrial waste water and agricultural diffuse sources michalak et al 2013 tong et al 2020 common symptoms of eutrophication include turbid water dense algal blooms loss of biodiversity and loss of recreation and esthetic value huisman et al 2018 ho et al 2019 to mitigate these negative effects of eutrophication the chinese government is working to reduce nutrient inputs and restore the functionality of lake ecosystems since 2000 zhou et al 2017 fu et al 2021 however eutrophication remains a major problem either because external loading has not been reduced to sufficiently low levels or because of internal lake mechanisms chemical or biological that prevent or delay recovery sÃ¸ndergaard et al 2007 van meter et al 2018 xu et al 2021 reduction in external loading of phosphorus p and nitrogen n might be accompanied by a delay in lake recovery because internal loading continuously replenishes the p pool in the water column jeppesen et al 2005a b anneville et al 2019 ibÃ¡Ã±ez and peÃ±uelas 2019 based on previous studies a quick response of the total nitrogen tn concentration has been observed in shallow lakes because n loss by denitrification results in negligible internal n loading sÃ¸ndergaard et al 2007 shi et al 2022 there have also been several summaries of biotic responses to reductions in nutrient loading such as the biomass of planktivorous fish declined and the proportion of potential piscivores increased zooplankton biomass decreased secchi transparency increased and therefore submerged macrophytes appeared mitchell and perrow 1997 jeppesen et al 2005a b ibÃ¡Ã±ez and peÃ±uelas 2019 typically the phytoplankton community has responded as well the contribution of non heterocystous cyanobacteria decline substantially while n2 fixing cyanobacteria dinophytes cryptophytes and chlorophytes increased jeppesen et al 2002 2005a b moss et al 2005 an open question is how a delay in the p reduction in lakes but fast response of n will affect the phytoplankton community response n2 fixing cyanobacteria can fix sufficient n to offset a reduction of n inputs schindler et al 2008 shatwell and kÃ¶hler 2019 thus emphasis has been placed on n2 fixing cyanobacteria how it responds to n reduction or low external n concentration whereas other phytoplankton taxa received much less attention anthropogenic activities are altering both total nutrient loads and they are also changing the dominant form of n nutrient delivered to aquatic ecosystems glibert et al 2016 whether different chemical forms of n influence primary producers differentially are well documented in marine and freshwater ecosystems berg et al 2003 donald et al 2011 andersen et al 2020 diatoms are widely distributed in almost all aquatic habitats and have been estimated to contribute approximately 20 of global primary productivity falkowski et al 1998 field et al 1998 kong et al 2021 it has been suggested that diatoms were the only phytoplankton group significantly associated with the uptake of nitrate no3 n because they may have enhanced no3 n handling and assimilatory efficiency relative to other algae lomas and glibert 2000 needoba and harrison 2004 andersen et al 2020 while the classical physiological literatures conclude that ammonium nh4 n is the preferred form of n for phytoplankton mccarthy 1981 raven et al 1992 the favorability for nh4 n by phytoplankton is a function of both the preferential use of nh4 n and its favorable energetics and the repressive effect of nh4 n on no3 n uptake and assimilation dortch 1990 lomas and glibert 1999a 1999b it has also been documented that under conditions of highly elevated nh4 n both the tn taken up and overall growth with nh4 n enrichment can be suppressed rather than enhanced glibert et al 2014 swarbrick et al 2019 lake taihu is the third largest shallow eutrophic lake where non n2 fixing cyanobacteria microcystis spp dominated in summer over the past three decades liu et al 2011 guo et al 2019 until recently the large diatoms e g aulacoseira spp synedra spp and asterionella spp and small cryptophytes cryptomonas spp and chroomonas spp and green algae dictyosphaerium sp increased in spring guo et al 2019 since the highly publicized drinking water crisis in 2007 guo 2007 a variety of restoration measures were implemented to control eutrophication including construction of sewage pipelines and new wastewater treatment plants qin et al 2019 to date tn has declined significantly and total phosphorus tp has slightly increased and cyanobacterial blooms have not decreased in size and frequency as expected from abatement efforts qin et al 2019 qin et al 2020 at the same time the frequency of spring diatom bloom increased in lake taihu liu x unpublished data previous studies have emphasized that the changes in the spring phytoplankton assemblage in the lake are influenced by climate change guo et al 2019 deng et al 2018 2019 2021 in addition diatoms can provide most of the high quality food for zooplankton growth in spring and thus their abundance depend strongly on the reproduction of predators pagano 2008 however it is generally agreed that n and p are linked to core biology process which constrain biotic production of aquatic ecosystems elser et al 2007 conley et al 2009 liang et al 2020 glibert et al 2016 confirmed that diatoms appear to be disproportionately affected by ratios of no3 n with nh4 n in lake taihu the concentration of dissolved inorganic n mainly composed by no3 n and nh4 n gradually decreased since 2007 zhu et al 2020 thus we hypothesized that 1 the effects of n concentration on diatom in the different seasons varied with dominant inorganic n no3 n and nh4 n in lake taihu 2 diatoms as reliable indicators of ecosystem response to n reduction especially to changing of dominant inorganic n in eutrophic lakes here a large long term intensive monitoring data set of nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton for the period 1992 2019 available in the northern part of lake taihu were analyze an investigation of 48 shallow lakes on the yangtze river plain was also utilized to examine these hypotheses 2 methods 2 1 description of the study area the middle lower yangtze plain one of the three largest plains in china contains numerous shallow eutrophic lakes driven by nutrient enrichment yang et al 2008 lake taihu is located in the eastern region of the yangtze river delta 30 56 31 34 n 119 54 120 35 e it is a polymictic lake with a mean depth of 1 95 m a surface area of 2338 km2 a catchment area of 36 500 km2 annual freshwater input to the lake averages 88 108 m3 and the average water retention time is approximately 220 309 days qin et al 2007 meiliang bay is located in the northern part of lake taihu near the suburbs of wuxi city and has an area of 132 km2 the liangxi and lujiang rivers which are connected to meiliang bay discharge effluents from the cities of wuxi and changzhou into the lake in response to heavy industrial and agricultural pollution bloom forming cyanobacteria in meiliang bay have been frequently observed in recent decades the lake basin is influenced by the east asian monsoon and exhibits a typical subtropical climate with four distinct seasons spring march may summer june august autumn september november and winter december february in the present study the biomass of diatom in 48 shallow lakes with different nutrient levels were surveyed in spring 2012 the lake area and mean depth ranged from 1 3 to 80 4 km2 and 0 6 to 7 1 m respectively there were three sampling sites in each lake detailed information on the sample locations and the geographical information can be found in fig s1 and table s1 2 2 sample collection and laboratory analysis data originate from an ongoing long term monitoring program in the taihu laboratory for lake ecosystem research the analysis focuses on the period 1992 2019 during which the physical chemical and biological data have been collected at monthly intervals samples of water quality and diatoms were collected from 2 sites s1 and s2 fig s2 in meiliang bay of northern lake taihu the water samples were collected with a 2 5 l modified patalas bottle sampler at each site water samples were taken by mixing the surface 0 5 m middle and bottom 0 5 m above the bottom layers of the water column monitored water quality parameters included water temperature total nitrogen tn tp nitrate no3 n ammonium nh4 n orthophosphate po4 p silicate si and chlorophyll a chl a water transparency was determined using a secchi disk detailed analytical methods for water quality parameters are described in jin and tu 1990 the radiation network in eastern china comprises three stations shanghai nanjing and hangzhou zhang et al 2004 and mean global radiation values for lake taihu were calculated air temperature and windspeed were obtained from the china meteorological data sharing service system http data cma cn wuxi meteorological station 31 58 n 120 32 e phytoplankton samples 1 l were fixed with lugol s iodine solution 2 final concentration and settled for 48 h then the supernatant was slowly removed by siphoning and 30 ml was retained for measuring cell density cell density was microscopically determined in a 0 1 ml sedgwick rafter counting chamber at 400 magnification olympus bx51 japan the mean cell volume was calculated using appropriate geometric calculations and volume values were converted to biomass assuming that 1 mm3 of volume was equivalent to 1 mg of fresh weight biomass hillebrand et al 1999 in these samples the total biomass of phytoplankton from 2015 to 2019 was calculated by the formula 0 003 chl a 8 76 which was recorded in chen et al 1998 all diatom sample preparations followed standard procedures battarbee et al 2002 nomenclature and taxonomy mainly followed krammer and lange bertalot 1988a b 1991a b 2000 zooplankton samples 7 5 l were concentrated with a 64 Î¼m mesh net and preserved in 4 formaldehyde at a final volume of 50 ml the zooplankton samples were analyzed at 40 magnification with a microscope olympus corporation tokyo japan and identified to species or genus level zhang and huang 1991 the detailed methods for sampling water quality analysis and diatom identification used in 48 shallow lakes were the same as those in lake taihu 2 3 data analysis annual mean air temperature showed a significant increase p 0 05 and water temperature did not correspond to the air temperature in lake taihu fig s3 compared with air temperature the growth of phytoplankton was much more directly influenced by water temperature in lakes anderson 2000 thus water temperature was used in our study the threshold of si concentration was selected as 0 5 mg l this corresponded to the si concentration at which the growth of diatom was limited lund 1964 prior to analysis a range of lakes with si concentrations lower than 0 5 mg l was excluded fig s4 the total diatom biomass mainly covered the samplings from late december to april and june to october thus winter spring ws was defined as late december to april and summer autumn sa as june to october in our analysis we estimated the timing of the seasonal peak throughout the entire year the central tendency t using the month co ordinate of the center of gravity of the area below graphs of monthly means t i 1 12 m x m i 1 12 x m where xm is the mean biomass in month m january 1 december 12 edwards and richardson 2004 we examined whether diatom influence where the thresholds occur responded to changes in tn and tp in the water column using a change point analysis the package strucchange in r of diatom biomass and the timing of the peak in their biomass a function named breakpoints was used to determine the locations of the changes the sequential f statistic was performed to test for a change in the mean and the peak f value indicated a shift the present analysis focuses on the variations of total diatom trends in plankton biomass and abundance were evaluated using the nonparametric mann kendall mk trend test helsel and hirsch 1992 because changes over time did not appear to be linear multiple comparison analysis of anova and box plots were used to test whether significant differences observed in environmental factors between seasons the agricolae and stats packages in r were conducted in this analysis the linear regression was used to estimate the differences between the peak of total diatom in 1992 and 2019 a strong negative difference indicates the peaks are becoming earlier edwards and richardson 2004 theil sen regression was used to robustly explore the effects of no3 n nh4 n mass ratios on total diatom biomass in lake taihu and the 48 other lakes theil sen estimation is a robust method that determines the slope of the regression line via the median of the slopes su et al 2020 the mblm package in r was used to perform this analysis structural equation modeling sem was used to explore the pathways by which windspeeds nutrients and zooplankton affects diatom biomass and to test diatom respond to which forms of inorganic n in different seasons we first constructed a full model that included possible pathways then most of nonsignificant pathways were eliminated to optimize the model sem which involved sets of multiple regression analyses allowed a rigorous estimation of the causal relationship network grace 2006 the standardized path coefficients between two variables represented the relative strength of a relationship we used a chisq test and p values to evaluate the fit of the models e g models were considered to have a good fit when the p values ranged from 0 1 to 1 higher temporal variation of phytoplankton communities than spatial heterogeneity in meiliang bay of lake taihu guo et al 2019 the sem thus was performed based on the spatial average data pooled from the two sampling sites lavaan and semplot packages were used in the sem analysis biological data were log10 x 1 transformed before the theil sen analysis and all the variables were log10 x 1 transformed before the sem analysis we conducted hierarchical partitioning to estimate the percent contribution to the explained variance by the individual predictors examined using the hier part package within r mao et al 2020 3 results 3 1 long term trends in environmental variables from 1992 to 2019 mean ws and sa water temperatures were 9 3 1 2 c and 25 7 0 8 c respectively fig s5 water temperature in lake taihu was generally significantly higher in sa season than in ws season fig 1 no pronounced changes were found in water temperature in any of the seasons p 0 05 table s2 windspeeds declined significantly both in ws and sa seasons mean radiations around lake taihu were 972 96 mj m2 in ws season and 1112 81 mj m2 in sa season it was significantly higher in sa than in ws increasing trends appeared in radiations in ws season concentrations of tp averaged 0 10 0 04 mg l and 0 15 0 04 mg l respectively in lake taihu during ws season and sa season in all years fig s6 tp decreased significantly in ws season whereas it increased significantly in sa season p 0 001 table s2 the seasonal variation of po4 p exhibited the same trends as tp concentrations of tn averaged 3 96 1 40 mg l and 2 37 0 50 mg l respectively in the lake during ws season and sa season in all years fig s6 tn exhibited significant seasonal and interannual variations and the concentration was substantially higher in ws seasons than in sa seasons fig 2 both no3 n and nh4 n concentrations were significantly higher in ws seasons mean no3 n 1 11 0 48 mg l mean nh4 n 1 18 0 91 mg l than in sa seasons 0 40 0 20 mg l 0 29 0 14 mg l decreasing trends appeared in tn and nh4 n in ws season p 0 001 table s2 whereas no clear trend was found in sa season for no3 n decreasing trends appeared in sa season 3 2 change point analysis and comparison of environmental variables in different periods changes in diatom biomass and the timing of the peak in their biomass were detected through change point analysis and sequential f statistic fig s7 results showed that breakpoints of diatom biomass and the timing of peak biomass were in 2008 and 2007 respectively thus data on environmental variables were divided into two periods p1 and p2 for the subsequent analysis p1 refers to the years from 1992 to 2006 and p2 refers to the years from 2007 to 2019 for ws seasons mean windspeed was 2 8 0 2 m s during p1 and significantly lower 2 4 0 3 m s in p2 it was significantly higher in p1 mean value 2 8 0 2 m s than in p2 2 3 0 2 m s for sa seasons windspeeds exhibited no significant difference between ws and sa seasons in the same period fig 1 compared to the ws season in p1 radiation was significantly higher than that in the same season in p2 while there was no significant difference among periods in the sa season there was no significant difference in tp concentration between p1 ws and p1 sa but it showed significantly lower concentration in p2 ws mean value 0 08 0 02 mg l than in p2 sa 0 17 0 03 mg l fig 2 during ws season tp concentration was significantly higher in p1 than that in p2 for sa season it was much lower in p1 than in p2 po4 p concentration showed a similar pattern to that of tp concentration but it was no significant difference between p1 ws and p2 ws during p1 ws the mean value of tn concentration was 4 74 1 17 mg l which was significantly higher than that during p2 ws 3 07 1 06 mg l no significant difference was observed in tn between the two sa seasons no3 n concentration showed significantly higher value during sa season in the p1 mean value 0 52 0 16 mg l than in the p2 0 26 0 14 mg l while there was no significant difference between ws seasons the concentration of nh4 n averaged 1 73 0 81 mg l in the p1 ws which was significantly higher than in the p2 ws and other two sa seasons in sa season nh4 n concentrations showed no significant difference between p1 and p2 mass ratios of no3 n nh4 n were usually much higher in p1 sa and p2 ws than in the other periods fig 2 average values for p1 sa p2 ws p2 sa and p1 ws were 2 3 1 6 2 7 1 8 1 0 0 4 and 1 0 0 8 by weight 3 3 temporal change in plankton biomass and abundance the main genus of diatom asterionella spp aulacoseira spp cyclotella spp synedra spp and nitzschia spp were observed and identified in lake taihu from 1992 to 2019 fig s8 the ws diatom biomass in all years ranged from 0 01 to 7 08 mg l with an average of 1 40 mg l the sa diatom biomass varied from 0 09 to 2 78 mg l with an average of 0 89 mg l seasonal and interannual changes in diatom showed that ws biomass was low from 1992 to 2006 after which an increasing trend was apparent fig 3 a the trends of total phytoplankton biomass followed the same pattern as diatom increasing significantly in the ws season fig 3b no pronounced changes were found in sa season mk trend test p 0 05 the contribution of diatom to total phytoplankton biomass varied from 7 to 62 in ws with no clear trend over time fig 3c significant decline in the proportion of diatom biomass appeared in sa season however during the study period the timing of peak diatom biomass showed a significant advancement fig 4 b it fluctuated widely but generally appeared in sa season prior to 2007 thereafter the timing of the peak biomass advanced from the sa season to the ws season except 2016 and 2018 during p1 the peak diatom biomass appeared in june summer autumn fig 4a but in march winter spring during p2 the peak in p1 sa was significantly lower than in p2 ws f test p 0 001 there was also a slight peak of diatom biomass in august summer autumn during p2 but no significant difference was found in peak biomass between august p2 sa and june p1 sa f test p 0 25 the abundance of zooplankton in ws fluctuated between 100 and 1363 ind l from 1999 to 2019 without showing any clear pattern fig 5 in sa season however the zooplankton abundance decreased significantly p 0 001 3 4 potential drivers of changes in diatom biomass because the timing of the peak diatom biomass appeared in the p1 sa and p2 ws fig 4b they were chosen in the sem analysis which tried to show the effects of n on diatom in different temperature significant effects of windspeed nh4 n concentration and zooplankton abundance on diatom biomass were found for the p2 ws fig 6 only no3 n was retained as a statistically significant predictor for diatom biomass in sa in the sem analysis no3 n nh4 n ratios had significant and positive effects on diatom biomass with biomass advancing linearly with increasing no3 n nh4 n ratios in lake taihu and in the 48 other lakes fig 7 4 discussion globally diatoms are used in biomonitoring to assessing the ecological status of aquatic systems because they have a cosmopolitan nature short life span and quick response to environmental and anthropogenic disturbances malviya et al 2016 pandey et al 2017 here we found that diatom increased greatly in ws season and apparently responded differently to different dominant inorganic n and seasons during the process of the external loading reduction of a eutrophic lake 4 1 diatom responses to the n reduction in different seasons the n but not p concentrations changed markedly in lake taihu after 2007 confirming that tn can respond quickly to nutrient management in the watershed jeppesen et al 2005a 2005b sÃ¸ndergaard et al 2007 the concentrations of tn as well as no3 n and nh4 n declined especially in ws season despite the significant reduction of tn the lake was still eutrophic with the mean value above the hypereutrophic of tn and tp concentration thresholds tn 1 4 mg l tp 0 05 mg l usepa 2009 moss et al 2005 and schindler et al 2008 demonstrated that n2 fixing cyanobacteria appeared in significant abundance within weeks of reducing inputs of tn at constant inputs of tp a recently analysis of data from lake taihu has also shown the biomass proportion of n2 fixing cyanobacteria increased which corresponded to deceased tn tp mass ratios after 2007 zhang et al 2021 klausmeier et al 2004 reported that redfield tn tp ratio of 7 5 is not a universal biochemical optimum and the optimal tn tp stoichiometry of algae ranges from 3 7 20 3 by weight although annual mean tn tp mass ratios reduced to 21 near to optimal tn tp in p2 tn tp mass ratios averaged 39 higher than optimal tn tp in ws season and showed no significant difference between p1 ws averaged 42 and p2 ws averaged 37 p 0 05 fig s9 our results revealed that it was not changes in tn tp that triggered an increase in the biomass of spring diatoms in lake taihu in the early study of diatoms they did not find the significant relationships between diatom proportion of total phytoplankton and tn tp in the lake mccarthy et al 2009 thus we can speculate that a decrease in n loading and the concomitant decrease in nh4 n concentrations in ws season may have driven spring increase in diatoms in lake taihu the lower energetic costs of uptake and assimilation of nh4 n has led to the common assumption that nh4 n is generally used first by phytoplankton especially when n is in low concentrations but the preference for nh4 n is not universal dugdale et al 2012 glibert et al 2016 hence phytoplankton inhibition by nh4 n enrichment has been reported in many aquatic ecosystems such as the delaware estuary in the united states nh4 n 0 18 mg l yoshiyama and sharp 2006 the san francisco bay delta nh4 n 0 02 0 29 mg l wilkerson et al 2006 buffalo pound lake and wascana lake in canada nh4 n ca 1 5 mg l waiser et al 2011 swarbrick et al 2019 and it has been confirmed experimentally parker et al 2012 nh4 n as one of the most important predictors with negative effects on total algae and cyanobacteria which was also suggested in the previous study of lake taihu mao et al 2020 our data indicate a suppression of diatoms at high concentrations of nh4 n 1 73 0 81 mg l during p1 ws being more pronounced than for other phytoplankton including cryptophytes and green algae fig s10 swarbrick et al 2019 exposure to high nh4 n reduce the growth of diatoms by enhancement of energetic costs in cells through photorespiration raven 2011 importantly when the diatom is provided with nh4 n only photorespiration responses to other stress factors such as cold temperatures can increase significantly kangasjÃ¤rvi et al 2012 by contrast diatoms are recognized as being no3 n opportunists they can take up no3 n as nutritional requirement or use it as an oxidant to dissipate the periodic overflow of electron energy and prevent photoinhibitory lomas and glibert 1999a this is attributed to the special n transport and assimilation pathways in diatom cells such as an easily induced nitrate reductase blomqvist et al 1994 higher density of no3 n uptake transporters glibert et al 2016 a capacity to store no3 n in internal vacuoles lomas and glibert 2000 and the ability to respire no3 n under dark or anoxic conditions kamp et al 2011 however the pathway of no3 n uptake and assimilation varies with environmental conditions for example low temperature may contribute to excess in electrons because the light reactions of photosynthesis are relatively temperature insensitive but calvin cycle reactions are temperature sensitive leading to low electron transfer rates in cells lomas and glibert 1999a assimilative no3 n reduction can be used as a protection mechanism to buffer these excess electrons and dissipate high energy from light harvesting glibert et al 2016 under low water temperature 9 3 1 2 c in p1 ws in lake taihu high nh4 n with low no3 n nh4 n may therefore have disfavored the growth of diatoms with the decrease of nh4 n and increase of no3 n nh4 n in p2 ws no3 n use may not have been inhibited by nh4 n and no3 n uptake might have been an important pathway for energy dissipation at low temperatures glibert et al 2016 low nh4 n thus have been used as nutritional requirement instead thus we speculate that the absorption of nh4 n and the protection mechanism of no3 n jointly promoted the increase of diatom biomass in p2 ws under high water temperature 25 7 0 8 c in p1 sa photorespiration increases under conditions of high light and high temperature kangasjÃ¤rvi et al 2012 calvin cycle reactions of photosynthesis are no longer limited by temperature and able to utilize the higher daily light doses for higher photosynthetic productivity smith and platt 1985 descolas gros and de billy 1987 lomas and glibert 1999a it means that electrons from light harvesting can be used promptly in calvin cycle reactions the protection mechanism of no3 n may be no longer needed in cells no3 n use is therefore not expected to be inhibited by low nh4 n concentrations at high no3 n nh4 n under the condition of low n in summer cyanobacteria and chlorophytes were more strongly stimulated by nh4 n whereas diatoms were often equally or more strongly stimulated by no3 n andersen et al 2020 diatoms may have weak competition to utilize nh4 n in summer when the cyanobacteria prevailed in lake taihu no3 n thus have been used as nutritional requirement for diatoms in this period we also found that the increased spring diatoms biomass coincided with the increased no3 n nh4 n mass ratios in 48 shallow lakes in the yangtze river region being concurrent with the findings for lake okeechobee mccarthy et al 2009 our findings on n suppression or stimulation are consistent with results of short term nutrient enrichment studies lomas and glibert 1999 glibert et al 2014 shangguan et al 2017 and month long mesocosm experiments donald et al 2011 swarbrick et al 2019 all of which identify unique effects of n in p rich ecosystems 4 2 other potential drivers of diatom biomass light availability and resources conditions e g p and si potentially control diatom have been well characterized reynolds 1984 diatom can grow at very low irradiances 1 Î¼e m2 s richardson et al 1983 showing physiological advantage in waters with high levels of mixing during our study period the light intensities in spring were always higher than 46 Î¼e m2 s liu x unpublished data implying that the light demand of diatoms was met although light radiation increased in p2 ws and a reduced windspeed may also have increased the light availability in the water column in spring guo et al 2019 deng et al 2021 water transparency indicated as underwater light conditions fleming lehtinen and laamanen 2012 was not significantly improved in lake taihu fig s11 our results confirmed that the conditions of decreased windspeed and increased light radiation could favor the growth of diatoms when the concentration of nh4 n was reduced in lake taihu diatom being a good competitor at low po4 p concentrations 0 001 mg l benefit of low p concentrations tilman and kilham 1976 sommer 1983 interlandi et al 1999 bertrand et al 2003 rÃ¼hland et al 2010 helliwell et al 2021 showed that p limited diatoms use a ca2 dependent signaling pathway to sense and respond to the critical macronutrient p diatom recovery from p limitation requires rapid and substantial increases in n assimilation and this process is dependent on p ca2 signaling p ca2 signaling thus mediates fundamental cross talk between the vital nutrients p and n thamatrakoln 2021 because of p release in sediments jeppesen et al 2005 a b tp has remained stable in the water column and even increased in sa season after external loading reduction since 2007 in lake taihu thus it is not likely that diatom growth was limited by p and inorganic n assimilation was affected in p enriched water column additionally si concentrations were above the growth limiting level for diatoms of 0 5 mg l in the lake lund 1964 the effects of zooplankton grazing on biomass and composition of phytoplankton including diatoms are well established e g winder and schindler 2004 pagano 2008 as also indicated by the sem analysis showing a significant grazing pressure on the diatoms in lake taihu nevertheless compared with inorganic n the effect of zooplankton appeared to be of modest importance having relatively weaker independent effects on ws diatom biomass fig s12 our results indicate that zooplankton was one of the important factors in influencing the biomass of diatom in the case of declining nh4 n in lake taihu 5 conclusion this study investigated the variations of nutrients and diatoms in subtropical eutrophic lake taihu over 28 yr 1992 2019 during a decrease of n and slightly increase of p our results highlighted the onset of increased spring diatoms and the timing of the peak biomass shifted from sa to ws season coincides with the significantly decreased nh4 n concentrations at the winter spring low temperatures we conclude that the magnitude of vernal suppression or stimulation of diatom assemblages has increased concomitant with no3 n nh4 n mass ratios and climatic changes in this eutrophic shallow lake thus the parallel reductions in external n loading along with variations in dominant inorganic n will stimulate the growth of diatoms diatom biomass increase in spring is a valuable indicator during the process of the external loading reduction in eutrophic lakes authors
