graphene oxide quantum dots gqds are an emerging class of zero dimensional oxygen rich materials with dimensions of less than 20 nm gqds exhibit the phenomena of quantum confinement and edge effects this phenomenon bestows them with exceptional physico chemical properties these features have made gqds suitable materials for application in the catalytic removal of organic pollutants and dyes adsorption of heavy metals filtration of organic pollutants and in the disinfection of microbes however challenges encountered when developing gqds for environmental applications include generating high quality qds and devising large scale synthetic procedures that ensure reproducible size distribution a need exists for theoretical and practical research on the development of novel methods that allows high yields and easy purification of gqds to be achieved in addition despite possible mechanisms having been proposed a lack of an understanding of the photoluminescence pl properties of gqds remains this review focuses on some of the research that was reported on gqds during in the past 20 years the significant findings are summarized with comparative and balanced views the emphasis is placed on the different synthetic routes for accessing gqds and as well as the unique properties which make gqds ideal candidates for the removal of emerging pollutants from wastewater an evaluation of the most used approaches and promising technologies for the removal of emerging pollutants using gqds is also presented further current challenges relating to the use of gqds are addressed and an outlook of gqds as well as recommendations for future work are presented graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords graphene oxide quantum dots gqds wastewater treatment environmental remediation organic pollutants inorganic contaminants pathogenic microbes 1 introduction graphene oxide quantum dots gqds have attracted considerable attention in the field of environmental remediation this is predominantly because gqds are composed of carbon an abundant element on earth and also as a result of their enhanced activity and lack of secondary pollution from metal leaching 1 2 other favourable features of gqds that have made them front runners as potential substitutes for conventional semiconducting quantum dots qds include relative ease of synthesis low toxicity high solubility chemical and photoluminescence pl stability and negligible environmental concerns 3 the existence of quantum confinement effect allows the band gap energy of the gqds to be regulated between 0 and 6 ev and this is achieved by controlling the surface groups or the 2 d size of the gqds 4 the quantum confinement effect in gqds has provided a platform to exploit the novel structural electrical and optical properties of gqds that are not easily attainable in other nanomaterials besides gqds possess selective quenching properties that can be exploited for the detection of ions and various chemical groups the striking energy band of the pl of the gqds observed within the blue green region of the spectrum is responsible for this type of detection 5 due to their unique properties of gqds several research papers have reported that the combining gqds with other nanomaterials results in multi functional nanocomposites with enhanced properties suitable for water treatment application for instance combining gqds with bivo4 g c3n4 z agvo3 tio2 and zno yielded superior photocatalytic activity towards the degradation of pharmaceuticals and organic dyes in water 6 10 209 in terms of the removal of heavy metals pesticides pharmaceuticals and microbes from water gqds based adsorbents thin films and nanofibers have also been reported to possess improved properties when compared with pristine materials 11 13 despite several fascinating properties of gqds drawbacks that limit their practical environmental applications still exist a combination of structural defects poor dispersion and poorly understood photoluminescence properties are some of the challenges hindering large scale production and application of these materials 14 15 fortunately the presence of numerous oxygenated groups has led to an expansion of the structural and chemical diversity of gqds that is achieved through chemical modification or functionalization such an approach provides an effective path for tailoring the physical and chemical properties of gqds to targeted applications therefore gqds have shown great potential in environment protection including water treatment on a larger scale the use of gqds and gqds based nanocomposites can be implemented in wastewater treatment plants wwtps as it stands most of the currently available wwtps were primarily designed to only target the removal of biodegradable compounds and not emerging complex compounds therefore a need exists to modify improve or even couple current wastewater treatment processes to advanced techniques that will enable the removal of emerging pollutants from wastewater before being discharged into receiving dams the increase in pollution levels due to rapid industrialization is considered as one of the major global challenges of the 21st century research on advanced carbonaceous nanomaterials such as gqds has been on an exponential trajectory as potential materials for environmental applications because of their unusual and exotic properties this review seeks to explore and emphasize the role of gqds and gqds based nanocomposites in the removal of emerging pollutants from water specifically the review presents from a critical point of view important features of gqds that are useful for application in environmental remediation this is highlighted through examples of how the functionalization of gqds and their combination with other nanomaterials can impact their environmental applications first the different synthetic routes for gqds which ultimately impact on their structure and morphology are discussed special emphasis is placed on the surface modification and functionalization of the gqds to enhance their degradation or removal properties towards emerging pollutants eps further an evaluation is conducted on the most prevalent or promising technologies that utilise gqds based nanocomposites in advanced oxidative processes aops membrane processes and adsorption for the removal of emerging pollutants microorganisms dyes pesticides and heavy metals finally the review outlines the industrial applications and an outlook of gqds 1 1 graphene oxide quantum dots gqds gqds are zero dimensional 0d oxygen rich hydroxyl epoxy and carboxyl containing carbon based materials characterized by a graphitic plane composed of single or double layers which are typically 2 nm in thickness and have lateral dimensions not exceeding 10 nm 16 21 ideally gqds should strictly contain carbon and have one atomic layer however several of the previously synthesized gqds have multiple layers and contain oxygen and hydrogen 22 23 another prerequisite for gqds to be classified as such is the presence of a graphene lattice while other researchers regard gqds as nothing more than a massive polyaromatic molecule when compared with other polycyclic aromatic molecules such as pyrene gqds have distinct and far more intriguing properties 210 structurally the carbons of the gqds are arranged into a honeycomb like crystal lattice and are organized into rings of six atoms from this arrangement sp 2 hybridized characteristics of gqds are born the arrangement further results in the delocalization of electrons in the π orbitals 24 26 this phenomenon bestows the gqds with outstanding optical and electrical properties the shape of the gqds is determined by the type of edges found in the gqds two different types of edges exist in gqds namely a zig zag and b armchair edges fig 1 a and b while on one hand the zig zag edges also called carbene like edges are characterized by two unshared valence electrons found on every carbon atom at the edge the armchair edges on the other hand have triply bound carbons and this type of edge resembles carbyne molecules 16 27 typically the presence of similar edges zig zag and zig zag or armchair and armchair will result in corners being formed at 120 however 90 corners will be formed when different edges come together a zig zag and armchair come together an occurrence of the same type of edges coupled with the formation of six 120 angles suggests an existence of hexagonal shaped gqds similarly rectangular shaped gqds are characterized by the presence of both zig zag and armchair edges that form four 90 angles fig 1 c oval and round shaped gqds have been reported for instances where the corners are not well developed 27 besides determining the shape the type of edge present also influences the photoluminescence pl behaviour of gqds zig zag edges have a smaller bandgap compared to armchair edges as a result armchair edges yield a notable blue shift in the emission spectrum of the gqds concerned 24 in the case of zig zag edges the luminance of the gqds is affected by changes in ph 29 30 compared to traditional semiconductor qds gqds possess superior properties such as low toxicity good water solubility superior photostability against photobleaching and a stable fluorescence 31 35 the most significant property among all the mentioned is the fluorescence of the gqds while the photoluminescence mechanism of gqds has been previously understood using size shape degree of oxidation the extension of the π conjugated domains doping atoms and surface chemical groups there is no single universally accepted pl mechanism 36 37 however to the most eminent pl mechanism is believed to be a combination of the quantum confinement effect conjugated π domains or a synergistic effect of the surface effects edge effects and conjugated π domains 38 the band gap of gqds can also be modulated from 0 to 6 ev by altering the surface chemical properties or size arising from the quantum confinement effect 3 211 the excitation of gqds is entirely dependent on their emission and the gqds excitation wavelength is in the range 320 480 nm with a corresponding emission range occurring anywhere between 200 and 700 nm 3 34 35 39 41 the most emitted fluorescence is blue and green on one hand blue emission will typically be quenched at higher concentrations and this phenomenon is called aggregation induced concentration quenching essentially this means that the gqds will undergo aggregation at higher concentrations and photoluminescence quenching will take place because of non radiation energy transfer and photon reabsorption on the other hand green emission shows an enhanced fluorescence at higher concentrations henna pramod 42 have demonstrated two photon fluorescence or upconversion photoluminescence by gqds which occur when the emission wavelength is smaller than the excitation wavelength and the gqds simultaneously absorb two photons 1 2 graphene oxide quantum dots vs carbon dots gqds are often classified as carbon dots c dots and this creates confusion when distinguishing between the two the first synthesis of c dots was reported in 2004 43 in contrast gqds were synthesized for the first time in 2008 44 therefore it is important to emphasize that the two nanomaterials differ in morphology and properties 1 2 1 structural properties gqds are structurally distinct from c dots fig 2 a to d c dots are quasi spherical carbon materials that consist of sp 3 carbon some other c dots may be composed of a crystalline sp 2 core that is enveloped by a non crystalline shell additionally several hollow structured c dots have been documented in literature 45 48 gqds are mainly sp 2 carbon based and highly crystalline owing to the presence of a graphene lattice 49 whereas gqds and c dots have an in plane lattice spacing of 0 18 0 25 nm they are also characterized by graphitic inter layer spacing that is between 0 32 and 0 34 nm or larger depending on the heteroatoms or functional groups introduced 17 18 typically the diameter of c dots is 10 nm gqds are anisotropic and are characterized by a layered structure whereas c dots have colloidal features and a nanoparticle structure 1 2 2 absorbance gqds and c dots are capable of efficiently photon harvesting in the short wavelength region as a result of the π π of the phenyl rings and the cc bonds however c dots are often more efficient in absorbing in longer wavelengths both gqds and c dots absorb strongly in the near ultraviolet region nir 260 320 nm of the spectrum and have as shown in fig 3 a and c tails that extend in the visible region 16 50 contrarily gqds tend to have a shoulder peak in region 270 390 nm which is ascribed to the π π transition of the co bonds 53 1 2 3 photoluminescence pl the most fascinating feature of gqds and c dots is their pl gqds and c dots exhibit a clear excitation dependent emission wavelength and intensity fig 3 b and d this means that as the pl maximum redshifts the excitation also increases in the case of gqds this phenomenon is attributed to quantum confinement effect of the conjugated π domains the surface state in gqds as well as the combined effect of both aforementioned factors 55 with c dots it has not yet been fully established whether it is as a result of optical selection of varied size nanoparticles or perhaps due to the various emissive traps found on the surface or entirely through a completely different mechanism 56 conversely excitation independent emission wavelengths have been reported and these were as a result of uniform size and surface states 36 in addition both gqds and c dots have tunable pl properties due to quantum confinement effect gqds generally have a higher pl quantum yield qy in comparison to pristine c dots because gqds have a layered surface and excellent crystallinity 21 pristine c dots typically have 10 pl qy and this is ascribed to emissive traps occurring on the surface of c dots to overcome this challenge surface passivation is necessary 57 additionally the pl of both gqds and c dots can be tuned via modification 1 2 4 electrochemiluminscence and electrochemical properties the major difference between electrochemiluminscence ecl and pl is that ecl is distinguished by surface states while pl is focused on the core state while gqds and c dots are known to exhibit ecl properties compared to c dots gqds have a stable ecl and an onset potential closest to 0 v this is ascribed to the high content of sp 2 hybridization that accelerates the electron transfer in a typical study the ecl emission of c dots was noted when the potential cycle was in the range 1 8 and 1 5 v 58 in another study the ecl emission of gqds coupled with a stable ecl signal and a standard deviation of 1 0 was detected even when the onset potential was 0 4 v 59 gqds and c dots also share a similar ecl mechanism the proposed ecl mechanism suggests that gqds or c dots r in their excited form will be formed by the electron transfer obliteration of the ve charged r and the ve charged r species subsequently this will result in an ecl signal is produced through relaxation to the ground state electrochemical properties of gqds and c dots rely largely on the interaction between doped heteroatoms and the functional groups 60 when oxygenated groups are present at the basal plane the electron transfer emanating from the disturbance of the conductive sp 2 carbon arrangement is affected c dots have poorer electrochemical properties due to their smaller surface area and poor crystallinity in contrast an efficient high speed electron transfer of gqds is afforded by the edge sites present in gqds and their large surface area 1 3 synthesis of graphene quantum dots gqds can be synthesized by a stepwise organic synthetic procedure or expeditiously via the top down or bottom up one step synthetic routes fig 4 a to f various parameters such as surface characteristics size shape and opto electrical properties of gqds depend largely on the choice of the precursor materials and synthetic approach 1 3 1 top down approach the top down synthetic route usually entails cleaving bulk graphene like starting materials such as graphite powder coal graphene oxide graphene carbon black carbon nanotubes carbon nanofibers and recently metal organic frameworks mofs derived carbon into quantum sizes 34 36 57 61 67 69 the precursors are then subjected to different physical chemical or electrochemical treatments under specific reaction conditions to produce gqds processes reported in the literature that use the top down approach include hydrothermal and solvothermal processes acidic oxidation and exfoliation surface catalysed decomposition reaction and controlled chemical oxidation 70 71 the biggest limitation to the top down synthetic approach is the lack of precise control in size distribution and morphology of the gqds which are all important factors when designing and fabricating gqds in addition this approach uses harsh experimental conditions such as strong acidic media high voltage strong oxidising agents or extremely long reaction times that are not ideal for large scale production alternative less harsh non acidic oxidants such as ozone and h2o2 have recently been used for exfoliating gqds 41 72 75 the top down synthetic approaches of dqds are discussed briefly in the next subsections 1 3 1 1 hydrothermal and solvothermal method hydrothermal and solvothermal synthetic approaches are almost similar however solvothermal synthesis makes use of organic solvents while hydrothermal synthesis employs water as a solvent carbon materials such as graphene carbon nanotubes fullerenes etc are exposed to strong oxidants in the preparation process and cut into gqds at high pressure and temperature 76 the mechanism is as follows carbon materials are oxidised using strong oxidants and oxygenated functionalities are as a result introduced onto the carbon lattice at room temperature further oxidation occurs under hydrothermal conditions the gqds are formed as a result of the unstable carbonyl pairs and oxygen atoms located on the epoxy bonds the first solvothermal synthesis of gqds was reported by zhu et al 77 who used go sheets as the carbon source and dmf was used as a solvent in this synthetic approach the go sheets were used as precursors and treated with oxidising agents in order to establish epoxy groups onto the go and the resultant gqds were formed by chemically cutting and employing basic medium such as naoh one of the key factors in hydrothermal and solvothermal synthetic approaches is temperature temperature plays a significant role on the texture of the gqds obtained at lower temperatures poorly ordered gqds are synthesized in contrast higher temperatures lead to the generation of small highly crystalline gqds 78 liu et al 63 64 reported n doped gqds prepared from pan based carbon fiber as shown in fig 5 this was achieved by controlling the hydrothermal time in ammonia solution to obtain 3 nm n gqds on the bond scission strategy using ammonia as a passivation agent 1 3 1 2 microwave assisted method to overcome the limitation of time consuming reactions such as hydrothermal and solvothermal approaches rapid methods have evolved the microwave assisted method offers rapid uniform heating of the reaction vessel and improves the production yield some other advantages of this method include high reproducibility excellent control over experimental parameters and energy saving and environmental friendliness for instance water soluble gqds were synthesized by zhang et al 79 80 using a simple procedure this synthetic procedure involved adding aspartic acid and nh4hco3 to water in reaction flask and heating for 10 min using a 560 w microwave reactor 79 80 with all its merits this synthetic approach unfortunately necessitates advanced and sophisticated equipment zhang and co workers have successfully synthesized gqds following the method depicted in fig 6 1 3 1 3 oxidative cleavage this is the most used method of producing gqds however oxidative cleavage treatment employs strong acids typically nitric acid and mixtures of sulfuric and nitric acids these strong oxidisers may cause burns explosions or require post synthesis processes that may be complex typically the carbon carbon bonds of bulk carbon materials are broken down by h2so4 or hno3 in other instances sonication may be used to break the carbon carbon linkage present in the bulk carbon materials into gqds this is followed by heating and stirring the solution at temperatures of up to 80 c 33 36 81 a facile one pot synthetic route for gqds was developed by lu et al 82 this method does not make use of concentrated acids and does not require post synthesis steps instead carbon black is used as a precursor while the oxidant is h2o2 and the reaction takes only 90 min to synthesize the gqds an easy one step hydrothermal microwave procedure was reported for the fabrication of gqds that possess unusual photoluminescence properties 83 fig 7 the quantum dots were formed through oxidative cleavage of the cc bonds in the presence of strong acids 1 3 1 4 electrochemical oxidation the electrochemical oxidation process involves the electrochemical cleavage of carbon precursors into gqds typically under high redox voltage 84 electrochemical oxidation can occur in one of two ways the first is where cc bonds of the carbon material are cleaved via chemical oxidation and the second occurs when either the oxygen free radical o or hydroxyl free radical oh from water attacks and cleaves the cc bonds to form gqds advantages of using this method include the formation of stable gqds and high quality of gqds produced 84 the major drawback is that it not feasible to mass produce gqds using this method owing to the high costs associated with the method and low production yields further pretreatment and post synthesis purification are time consuming zhang et al 40 carried out a study wherein graphite rods were electrolysed through immersion in 0 1 m naoh solution at 80 200 ma cm 2 alternatively a mwcnts coated working electrode was fractured through the application of an anodic potential of 1 v for 7 11 or 15 h 85 another method is via cyclic voltammetry cv 212 a study on the electrochemical synthesis of gqds with size ranging from 3 to 5 nm in diameter from graphene oxide go was recently reported 86 the synthesis was carried out at room temperature using liclo4 in propylene carbonate as the electrolyte 86 1 3 1 5 laser ablation pulsed laser ablation in liquid plal is being used a lot in the synthesis of gqds owing to its easiness simplicity and environmental friendliness 87 93 the coulomb explosion model is used to describe the ablation mechanism of carbon materials by plal 88 briefly when a laser pulse is injected into the carbon material ionization by multiphoton absorption takes place which in turn results in high temperature and plasma plume being formed the coulomb explosion takes place in the coulomb plume and the carbon materials are subsequently ablated to quantum sizes resulting in the formation of gqds recently kang et al 94 synthesized gqds using mwcnts in high purity ethanol as a carbon source a nd yag laser system was employed for the plal in another study gqds were produced by employing laser ablation that uses a femtosecond laser 800 nm 35 s pulses for a total of 20 min on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite hopg in aqueous media alternatively graphite powder in the presence of benzene can be irradiated with an nd yag laser 1064 nm 10 ns pulses for a total of 30 min 95 96 compared to chemical oxidation plal is a faster and cleaner method and has fewer starting chemicals and by products 97 gqds were synthesized reproducibly by a one step pulsed laser ablation la of nanocarbon onions in deionized water fig 8 98 the laser pulse width at 532 nm was generated for 5 7 ns at a repetition rate of 10 hz the gqds were found to possess an average diameter of 1 8 nm and a thickness comparable to that of single layer of graphene 1 3 2 bottom up approach the bottom up synthetic approach involves turning smaller organic molecules such as citric acid 61 and other graphene related polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pah molecular precursors such as fullerene benzene and glucose into gqds via stepwise chemical reactions to obtain the gqds techniques such as direct pyrolysis carbonization or hydrothermal treatment using autoclave reactors or microwave assisted methods are then employed unlike the top down approach this method is cost effective scalable provides great control over the morphology shape surface state and sizes and results in fewer defects 99 1 3 2 1 catalysed fullerene cage opening fullerene molecules have been employed as gqds precursors gqds are synthesized through oxidation by employing a mixture of sulfuric acid sodium nitrate and potassium permanganate as an oxidising agent the cage opening and subsequently the formation of fluorescent gqds happens as a result of oxidation 100 1 3 2 2 pyrolysis although pyrolysis is the simplest and most used synthetic approach for accessing gqds it has a low quantum yield typically amino acids l glutamic acid glutathione citric acid acetylacetone carbohydrates sucrose or glucose and ethanolamine are carbonized when l glutamic acid is used as a precursor it is heated to 210 c until a brown like liquid is formed thereafter to produce an aqueous dispersion of gqds water is added 101 gqds can also be synthesized by the direct pyrolysis of citric acid ca after heating ca at 200 c until it changes to a dark orange colour a solution of naoh is added 213 it has been reported that using glutathione as precursor yielded gqds that had excellent biocompatibility and are obtained with higher quantum yields 100 some of the advantages of this method include the use of green and low cost materials no complex post synthesis processes are required does not require any strong acids or bases simplicity and does not produce any toxic gases 84 lee et al 102 reported a novel route for the synthesis of high quality graphene quantum dots by hydrogen assisted pyrolysis of silicon carbide fig 9 the fabricated gqds contained a few graphene layers and possessed high crystallinity and high purity with few defects the gqds were also free from oxygen functional groups 102 different other methods have been reported for the fabrication of gqds with various physico chemical properties such as structural electronic optical chemiluminescence and electrochemical properties of the dqds are summarized in table 1 1 4 challenges and opportunities of gqds graphene oxide quantum dots gqds have attracted a lot of research interest in recent years due to their good solubility excellent chemical stability low toxicity ease of chemical modification and photostability however there are huge differences in the sizes shapes and surfaces of gqds prepared through different methods 117 this has presented challenges in understanding the effect of these properties on the application of these novel materials another challenge is that the mechanism of the quantum confinement effect is poorly understood hence difficulties in successfully explaining the shift of the photoluminescence pl at different excitation wavelengths in relation to the size change 118 119 in fact some experimental results demonstrate totally contrary phenomena currently there is no unanimous consensus on the specific surface traps to account for the excitation dependent pl for large scale requirements it is necessary to mass produce gqds at relatively low cost however the product yield of gqds using current preparation methods is still considerably low mostly 10 in addition the reported quantum yields of gqds are very low 2 to 22 9 compared to other traditional semiconductor materials 120 several other challenges of gqds that hinder their widespread application in water treatment are highlighted in fig 10 to overcome some of the challenges more advanced spectroscopic technologies such as single particle spectroscopy and ultrafast spectroscopy may play an important role in understanding the properties of gqds in the future the potential cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of gqds is currently a topical issue in environmental and biomedical application fields recently chong et al 121 reported no apparent in vitro and in vivo toxicity in mice and this was attributed to the small size and high o content of the gqds although numerous gqds toxicology studies have been reported in the past few years more still research still needs to be conducted to understand the toxicity of gqds 19 20 despite all the reported challenges research in gqds continues to grow at an exponential growth thanks to the myriad of opportunities available for chemical modification and engineering of these materials to enhance their properties functionalization methods of gqds include chemical functionalization anchoring reactive groups heteroatom doping and formation of heterojunctions with other nanomaterials functionalization of gqds provides a broad scope of benefits to enhance the physico chemical properties some of the benefits of functionalization of gqds are highlighted below 122 1 oxygen containing groups provide high solubility and facilitate further surface functionalization 2 improve the dispersion in aqueous solution and provides better interfacing with other materials 3 increase the affinity of gqd to the surface of other nanoparticles during conjugation 4 optimizes electronic interaction between gqds and other nanomaterials in heterojunction conjugations 5 improve electron and hole transport in electrolyte and device stability 6 increase photocatalytic activity in photocatalytic reactions due to slowing down of electron hole recombination 7 reduce the size dependent bandgap to cover the whole solar radiation spectrum as the complexity of the gqd modification techniques continue to increase so too is the need to modify and manipulate the inherent chemistry to add functionality impart reactivity and alter optical properties 123 a variety of methods have been used to successfully modify the gqd periphery using both covalent and non covalent means 1 5 modification and functionalization of gqds some properties of gqds can be enhanced by an in situ one pot functionalization of gqds doping or surface modification fig 11 a b and c 51 pristine gqds tend to be limited in their application and thus require modulation to enhance their properties 1 5 1 doping the honeycomb like structure of gqds allows various heteroatoms to make their way into the carbon lattice examples of heteroatoms that gqds have been doped with include b p ag n s and cl 68 124 128 however nitrogen has been used more than any other heteroatom because of the number of electrons in its valence band as well as a size that is comparable to that of carbon 63 64 129 various literature reports have detailed the use of co doping with more than one heteroatom 68 130 131 the shift in the photoluminescence properties of these gqds is attributed to charge transfer between gqds and functional moieties the introduction of different functional groups brings about surface or edge effects which result in band gap and electronic density perturbation and alteration of the total dipole moment 51 various factors such as the functional moiety position of the attached functional moiety and the shape will influence the total dipole moment surface modification theoretically and experimentally enhances optical properties pl emission and fluorescence quantum yield of gqds by reducing the impact of non radiative emissions upon excitation 17 18 the enhancement in pl properties due to doping is ascribed to the formation of new types of surface states particularly n s or s n doping where n or s atoms are introduced into the graphitic core which yields in new surface states 29 30 these newly formed surface states will have emissive traps that will result in a higher yield of recombination 1 5 2 surface modification a wide array of inorganic and organic molecules including diamines thiols ionic liquids glutathione gsh peptides polyethyleneimine pei have been employed in the surface modification functionalization of gqds primary amines have been doped on the edges of gqds to give them tunable photoluminescence properties 132 the pl modification is ascribed to an additional interband that is present within the energy gap as a result of the nh2 groups the interband arises from the hybridization of the p orbitals of the cn atoms on the gqds 133 functionalized gqds show red shifted absorption attributed to charge transfer between the gqds and the functional moieties as well as changes in ph as a result of protonation and deprotonation introducing amino and thiol functional groups on the surface of gqds enable further conjugation to a wide array of molecules 63 64 134 1 5 3 conjugation another method that has been employed in the modulation of the properties of the gqds is conjugating to other functionalities post synthesis the cooh and oh groups on the surface of the gqds allow covalent attachment with various biomolecules and nanoparticles 135 further other π conjugated aromatic molecules can be conjugated to the gqds due to the π π interactions arising from the planar structure made up of delocalized π electrons 136 the controlled post synthesis functionalization of gqds with suitable biomolecules engineered nanoparticles and macrocyclic compounds has resulted in enhanced changes in their photophysical and chemical properties 1 6 effect of surface modification on the properties of the gqds the pl effect caused by modifying the surface of gqds has been previously studied 35 38 nitrogen doped gqds negatively affected the pl properties of gqds and sun et al 129 attributed this to the π π transitions that become dominant between the n of the aromatic ring and the sp 2 of the gqds structure 129 elsewhere dong et al 81 have shown that doping n gqds with s atoms eliminated o states while enhancing of the n state which contribute to an excitation independent emission 81 zhu et al 38 suggested that chemical functionalization resulted in the suppression of the defect state emission thus allowing the pl behaviour to be directed by intrinsic state emission for example functionalizing gqds with epoxy groups leads to more non radiative recombination while carboxyl amide and hydroxyl groups lessen non radiative recombination effects 34 35 38 jin et al 138 observed a red shift upon functionalizing gqds with amine groups gqds decorated with graphene sheets via chemical surface modification enhanced the degradation of methylene blue up to 96 after 40 min 137 the addition of graphene played an essential role since it enhanced the absorption of the dye by inducing the π π stacking with the mb molecules which then facilitated access of photogenerated carriers to the nearby mb 137 1 7 properties and characterization several characterization techniques have been employed to understand the structure of gqds its optical and electrochemical properties a typical uv vis spectrum of gqds see fig 12 a shows the presence of a peak anywhere in the range 230 270 nm which is ascribed to the π π transition of the aromatic cc bonds and therefore the sp 2 hybridization typically a characteristic shoulder peak also appears at 290 320 nm and is attributed to the oxygen group functionality on the surface of the gqds 139 140 fourier transform infrared red ft ir spectroscopy was employed to confirm the reduction of goqds to gqds 127 fig 12 b in another study xps was used to investigate if gqds were successfully functionalized with n atoms 63 64 fig 12 c data obtained from ft ir spectroscopy and x ray photoelectron xps spectroscopy shows that oxygen containing groups such as epoxy carbonyl hydroxyl and carboxyl groups are present in other instances where the oxygen containing groups were removed through chemical reduction processes the results could be confirmed raman spectroscopy is also used for investigating the crystallinity of the gqds through the presence of bands assigned as the d and g bands at nearly 1350 cm 1 and 1600 cm 1 respectively fig 12 d the bands are associated with disorder of the hexagonal lattice and the sp2 bonding on the one hand the g band arises due to the vibrational modes e2g of the gqds and thus relates to the crystallinity of the synthesized gqds on the other hand the d band is assigned to the disorder on the surface of the gqds the extent of sp2 sp3 hybridization is expressed using the ratio of the intensity of the d and g bands id ig the lower the id ig value the more crystalline the gqds become 4 16 the x ray powder diffraction xrd pattern had a broad diffraction peak at 2θ 25 as shown in fig 12 e high resolution transmission electron microscope hrtem allows the visualisation of the gqds and provides information regarding particle shape size distribution and crystallinity and edge types 4 16 24 information obtained from hrtem can be corroborated with xrd data for example the interlayer spacing in plane lattice spacing as well as the level of resolution structure of lattice fringes fig 12 f hrtem images have shown that gqds have a hexagonal symmetrical crystalline structure with an in plane lattice spacing that is similar to that of graphene 36 information regarding the size shape and surface topology of the gqds can be obtained using atomic force microscopy afm fig 12 g any topographical height that is less than 0 5 nm indicates the presence of single layered gqds the functionalization on the basal plane of gqds can also affect their height 141 2 applications of gqds various applications gqds such as advanced oxidative processes membrane technology adsorption and others have been cited before 143 146 many of these applications are based on the exploitation of gqds unique properties these applications are discussed individually in the next section 2 1 advanced oxidation processes advanced oxidation processes aops generate non selective and oxidative species such as the oh and so4 radicals the non selectivity of the aops allow these radicals to attack a wide array of molecules which are subsequently reduced to intermediates that are less toxic and harmful or to mineralised to form harmless by products in the form of co2 or h2o 147 148 the type of interaction between the reactants and catalyst determines whether aops are heterogeneous or homogenous the removal efficiencies of pollutants in heterogeneous processes are dependent on the adsorption of the reactants and desorption that take place on the active sites 149 in homogeneous processes the removal efficiency of pollutants will be driven by the interaction between the chemical reagents and the target molecules owing to its low cost the use of ultraviolet uv light in aops is well documented some aops are not capable of full mineralisation of eps and this can sometimes result in transformation products saggioro et al 150 and teresa et al 214 have identified transformation products formed during aops the concentrations of these transformation products were evaluated and their estrogenic and antimicrobial activities were determined although the results showed that negligible concentrations of the transformation products were detected it was found that additional processes such membrane filtration were necessary to improve the results achieved with aops towards these transformation products of the known aops photocatalysis has proven to be the most effective in the degradation of various organic contaminants such as dyes pesticides phenols pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting compounds ecds from wastewater 215 when uv or visible light was used for irradiation 2 1 1 gqds as photocatalyst gqds are preferred as photocatalysts over other carbon materials because they have basal planes that allow for enhanced contaminant adsorption in addition gqds offer the versatility of being utilised as either electron donors or electron acceptors a feature that promotes the regulation of the photogenerated charge and improves photocatalytic the activity of gqd nanocomposites the enhancement of the photocatalytic efficiency of gqd nanocomposites is attributed to the role of gqds in facilitating the adsorption of organic pollutants 2 1 2 removal of emerging pollutants a gqds mn n tio2 g c3n4 gqds tcn nanocomposite obtained via hydrothermal reaction was used in a combined photodegradation of an organic pollutant and photocatalytic generation of h2 from water splitting 146 interestingly this dual nanocomposite was able to degrade organic pollutants from wastewater and simultaneously generate new energy the photocatalytic activities of the nanocomposite were investigated in the removal of organic compounds such as p nitrophenol ciprofloxacin and diethyl phthalate the optimum composition of the nanocomposite was 5 wt of gqds and 40 g c3n4 s gqds tcn 0 4 and this optimized catalyst gave the highest photodegradation efficiency rate of p nitrophenol 89 and h2 generation rate of 0 87 mmol l 1 g 1 after 2 h of reaction time fig 13 a the reduced photocatalytic activities of the gqds mn n tio2 13 4 and mn n tio2 and 11 8 were ascribed to the fast recombination rate of photogenerated e and h and the respective corresponding h2 evolution rates of 512 mmol l 1 g 1 and 0 441 mmol l 1 g 1 fig 13 b data from density functional theory dft calculations and gc ms analysis showed that electrons were involved in the degradation of p nitrophenol and none for ciprofloxacin and diethyl phthalate a study by lim et al 151 indicates that n gqds deposited on nanocubic tio2 degrade bisphenol a bpa a man made endocrine disrupting chemical ecd to understand the role of the n gqds in n gqds tio2 studies were conducted to evaluate the photocatalytic efficiency of the tio2 before n gqds were incorporated the low photocatalytic performance of pristine tio2 was ascribed to the rapid recombination of e h pairs and limited photoresponse range however complete degradation that is 1 85 more than pristine tio2 was achieved within 30 min following the addition of 0 5 wt n gqds interestingly increasing the wt of n gqds from 0 5 to 2 5 wt resulted in an overall reduction of the number of active radicals generated 152 the decreased production of active radicals is ascribed to the formed oxygen vacancies arising from the increased presence of in n gqds which results in the suppression of e h pairs in the conduction band 151 216 complete degradation of bpa was achieved within 45 min using 1 5 and 1 5 and 2 5 n gqds tio2 this makes 0 5 wt the optimum wt for deposition of n gqds onto tio2 fig 12 c to elucidate the mechanism of degradation of bpa scavenging experiments were conducted using radical scavengers results presented in fig 12 d show the contribution of all the oxidative species contributed to the degradation of bpa as follows oh 77 h 62 and o2 30 phophayu et al 153 demonstrated that the photocatalytic efficiency of zno could be enhanced by 23 when gqds zno were used to degrade commercial glyphosate herbicide antibiotic drugs tetracycline tc oxytetracycline and ciprofloxacin were also degraded using the n gqds bivo4 g c3n4 z scheme heterojunction and 91 5 of tetracycline was degraded within 30 min the high quantum yields and reaction rates are ascribed to n gqds which accelerate the effective charge separation and exhibit both strong oxidation and reduction abilities thus promoting the degradation of the organic pollutants 209 further a novel ag n gqds g g c3n4 was designed by deng et al 154 by initially combining the local surface plasmon resonance lspr effect of the ag nanoparticles the up conversion characteristics of n gqds and finally the visible light response ability of g c3n4 in the degradation of antibiotic drug tetracycline tc the reported data suggests the roles played by both the n gqds and ag nps in the enhancement of photocatalytic activity of the hybrid is quite significant combining the up conversion properties of n gqds and the lspr effect of ag nps enhanced the light transfer and absorption ability of the ag n gqds g g c3n4 hybrid which in turn resulted in increased photogenerated charges and subsequent inhibition of the recombination efficiency the photocatalytic reaction mechanism and photogenerated charge transfer is presented in fig 14 the authors ascribed the improved removal efficiency and photocatalytic activity to be as a result of a improved light absorption and the transformation effect as well as b the acceleration of photoexcited charges and migration effect briefly g c3n4 only absorbs wavelengths that are 460 nm however the composite ag n gqds g c3n4 on the other hand can absorb wavelength 460 nm this is due the presence of n gqds and ag nps in instances where wavelengths are 550 nm ag nps becomes the chief contributor to its absorption due to the lspr effect this also applies in the case of catalysis at wavelengths 550 nm in this case the role of n gqds will be more dominant this is a result of the up conversion effect of n gqds which subsequently leads to the absorption by the ag g c3n4 system to generate photoinduced charges it is noteworthy that the lspr effect of ag nps yields more visible light absorption which in turn improves the light harvesting capacity of n gqds the synergistic effects among the g c3n4 n gqds and ag nps are responsible for the improved properties in the ag n gqds g c3n4 which results in absorption conversion and improved effects of solar light utilisation the generation of photoinduced e h pairs results in the electrons of g c3n4 that readily react with dissolved oxygen which in turn generates o2 or in some instances could react with water and form oh that are responsible for the degradation of tc 154 a co assembly strategy was designed by hao et al 155 to allow the incorporation ultra small gqds into a mesoporous photocatalyst m bm photocatalyst to form a gqds bm hybrid fig 15 a a gqds bm hybrid was used for the elimination of bpa ciprofloxacin cip methylene blue phenol tc and rhb under simulated sunlight irradiation the addition of gqds were shown to enhance the light harvesting performance in the uv to the near infrared region nir which is favourable towards the generation of active e and h on the bi2moo6 furthermore the electronic capturing ability of the gqds allowed the gqds to excel in its role as electron traps which is necessary in the suppression of surface carrier recombination the addition of gqds increased the photocatalytic efficiency because when bare m bm were used only 42 of rhb was decomposed in a 30 min window period compared to 90 when gqds were introduced fig 15 b similar observation was made for bpa where the addition of gqds resulted in decomposition efficiency that is 2 3 higher than that of the bare m bm fig 15 c the decomposition of other pollutants is illustrated in fig 15 d fig 15 provides evidence that the degradation efficiency of the gqds bm hybrid towards the tested pollutants is in the order phenol cip mb tc in the same vein lei et al 8 has studied the degradation of ibuprofen ibp using gqds agvo3 heterojunction so far literature is replete with evidence that shows that the addition of gqds in nanocomposites significantly enhances the photoactivity of the resulting nanocomposites for example the photoactivity of gqds agvo3 heterojunction was found to be higher than that of pure agvo3 nanoribbons fig 16 a the findings emanating from the study by lei et al 8 match what was observed by lim et al 151 that is once the gqds loading reaches a specific level the photoactivity becomes negatively affected in the work by lei et al 8 3 wt gqds agvo3 composite displayed a photodegradation rate exceeding 90 under 120 min the rate constants were calculated from the degradation plots of ln c c0 vs irradiation time and the photocatalytic efficiency of 3 wt gqd agvo3 composite was found to be about 5 times higher than that of the pure agvo3 nanoribbons fig 16 b the toc removal profile of ibp depicted in fig 16 c shows that when the sample had been irradiated for 60 min the toc reduction of ibp was above 80 further near complete mineralisation of ibp achieved after 180 min of irradiation the enhanced photocatalytic performance of the 3 wt gqd agvo3 was accredited to the efficient transfer of electrons in the conduction band of agvo3 nanoribbons to the gqds as well as the improved the interfacial contact between the agvo3 nanoribbons and gqds the composite proved to be photostable after 4 cycles and the degradation rate of ibp was maintained at 98 fig 16 d the improved photostability can also be attributed to the excellent separation of e h pairs of the gqds 217 2 1 3 removal of organic dyes admittedly a lot of researchers have in the past two decades focussed their efforts on the degradation of organic dyes 156 158 while it tempting to assume that work related to dyes have lost its significance and relevance the contrary is true this is largely because new and emerging industrial dyes continue to be released into the environment 159 further these dyes are resistive towards aerobic digestion processes used in conventional wastewater treatment plants 218 therefore this review seeks to highlight the role gqds play in the decomposition of these colourants table 2 presents a detailed summary of the application of gqds in environmental remediation a recent study on the deployment of gqds in photocatalytic environmental remediation i e the environmental degradation of methylene blue showed an enhanced photocatalytic efficiency of tio2 upon the introduction of gqds 7 an inexpensive wet chemical method involving the use of bird charcoal as a precursor was used to fabricate gqds the resultant gqds were coupled with tio2 to form tio2 gqds nanocomposites the gqds were loaded at different wt and the photocatalytic efficiency evaluated data presented in fig 17 a and b shows that the highest activity was recorded for 1 gqds tio2 while tio2 gqds nanocomposites with higher gqds loading resulted in reduced photocatalytic activity the authors attributed the reduced photocatalytic activity to the fact that the tio2 surface was masked by excess gqds nanoparticles therefore affecting the charge transfer from the tio2 catalyst to methylene blue dye 7 160 further increasing the concentration of gqds in the composite also increases the chances of aggregation of gqds thereby reducing the interaction between the surfaces of tio2 and gqds this ultimately results in failure to retard the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers in tio2 in contrast 1 gqds tio2 nanocomposite displayed the highest photocatalytic activity owing to the charge separation occurring at the gqds tio2 interface an illustration of the gqds tio2 heterojunctions is displayed in fig 17 c the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo of the gqds which is positioned slightly above the conduction band bottom 4 2 ev of anatase tio2 results in significant energy difference of 1 1 ev that is responsible for the electron transfer from the gqds conduction band to that of tio2 at the same time the generated h will bombard the valence band of the gqds to form a hole centre which results in the separation of the excited e h pairs thus improving the photocatalytic activity 7 160 similarly phophayu et al 153 have found that the introduction of gqds improved the degradation efficiency of the n gqds tio2 nanocomposite by up to 45 while also degrading methylene blue under visible irradiation introducing s n gqds resulted in the enhancement of the catalytic efficiency of the g c3n4 s n gqds composite thus resulting in 96 of rhodamine b being degraded within 90 min compared to the 76 degradation efficiency achieved with the pure g c3n4 the significant improvement in the photocatalytic efficiency in this nanocomposite emanates from the efficient separation of the photogenerated e h resulting from combining s n gqds and g c3n4 it is worth noting that the photocatalyst remained stable with no reduced photocatalytic activity after nine degradation cycles 6 liu et al 72 73 have synthesized gqds mpg c3n4 composites by utilising electrostatic attraction the effect of the composition of gqds on degradation of rhb dye was evaluated the highest rhb dye removal was recorded at 97 using 0 5 wt gqds mpg c3n4 therefore introducing gqds as electron acceptors enhanced the photocatalytic activity of the nanocomposite recently gqds functionalized with poly 2 methacryloyloxy ethyl trimethylammonium co 3 sulfopropylmethacrylate mps were covalently immobilized in hydrogels at varying gqd loading and hydrogel volume 143 the resultant goqd a50cos50 composite hydrogels was found to possess remarkable peroxidase mimetic activity which was demonstrated by the oxidation 3 3 5 5 tetramethylbenzidine tmb in the presence of h2o2 the composite hydrogels were able to degrade 45 of the rhb dye after 6 h in the darkness the photocatalytic efficiency was significantly increased to 92 in the presence of light the effects of different goqd mps loading on the goqd a50cos50 hydrogels were evaluated an increase in the photocatalytic activity of the neat and composite hydrogels was observed when 2 5 goqd mps was used however no further increment was observed when the loading was increased to 2 5 the authors attributed the increase in the photocatalytic activity to the high rhb accessibility of active catalytic sites in the hydrogel basically by increasing the hydrogel volume that is in contact with the solution enhanced the activity interestingly the photodegradation activity of the hydrogels was still stable even after several months of wet storage and after drying and rehydration tshangana et al 9 10 studied the effect of shape of the zno nanoflakes and nanorods when conjugated to in the degradation of brilliant black dye as a model experiment 9 10 the covalent linkage of the gqds to zno nanoflakes and nanorods was reported to improve the activity of zno nfs or zno nrs by a delaying the rate of recombination of e h pairs because the gqds act as barriers which allowing them to remain active longer and b the enablement to harness sunlight better as a result of the π π transition of gqds it was evident from the results that zno nfs gqds performed better yielding a 80 degradation efficiency compared to than zno nrs gqds that only yielded 18 the larger surface area of the zno nfs gqds was attributed to the enhanced performance as it allowed more absorption of the solar energy black tio2 n doped gqds btng nanocomposite photocatalysts were used in the treatment of industrial sewage wastewater under natural light and the photocatalyst was able to degrade 15 other organic compounds while degrading rhb 161 the photocatalytic performance of pristine tio2 btio2 and btng at varying wt gqds loading towards the degradation of rhb was evaluated fig 18 a pristine tio2 degraded 22 of rhb after 5 min b tio2 nanoparticles degraded 52 of the same dye and the addition of 0 5 wt gqds in the btng nanocomposite yielded 100 decomposition of the dye further the photocatalytic degradation performance of the btng composite was tested against methyl orange mo bromophenol blue bpb phenolphthalein pph fluorescein flu methyl red mr methylene blue mb phenol phe nitrobenzene nbe methylbenzene mbe chlorobenzene chb formaldehyde fd dimethyl o phthalate dop aniline ani and acrylonitrile can all the k values obtained were found to be larger than 0 68 min 1 thus providing evidence of an efficient and durable photocatalyst fig 18 d the value of k for the btng composite was ten times larger than that of b tio2 and significantly higher than most reported catalysts under the same conditions fig 18 c 14 15 90 93 162 reusability and stability tests of the btng photocatalyst were carried out interestingly the btng composite remained effective as a visible light photocatalyst with no obvious deactivation after 15 cycles after 30 cycles the apparent k values remained at 95 of the initial value see fig 18 b the total organic carbon toc of the sewage sample was 370 mg l and was reduced to 57 mg l after purification the values of the toc of the sewage samples are reported in fig 18 e 2 2 gqds in polymer composites mixed matrix nanocomposite membranes mmnms are produced by incorporating engineered nanoparticles enps in the case of this review gqds into the polymer matrix using one of the following techniques electrospinning interfacial polymerization ip physical coating phase inversion self assembly or via layer by layer assembly fig 19 22 101 144 145 178 179 gqds offer better properties that are suitable for water treatment applications such as low cost fast adsorption kinetics increases surface area coupled with thermal mechanical and chemical stability 171 180 181 the incorporation of carbon nanoparticles into polymeric membrane matrix improves the water flux and permeability while reducing the fouling 182 emerging pollutants are removed using nanocomposite membranes in one of three ways adsorption electrostatic repulsion or sieving 183 the gqds add another dimension of imparting antimicrobial properties to the mmnms the removal efficiency of the composite membrane depends on a membrane functioning properties such as transmembrane pressure and water flux b membrane characteristics including the size of the pores size surface charge and hydrophobicity and c the emerging physico chemical features of the pollutant e g polarity charge size and solvency 184 in the next section two of the applications of gqd nanocomposite membranes and their role in antifouling and rejection of organic dyes are discussed 2 2 1 dye rejection in a recent study gqds were used as hydrophilic nanofillers for the enhancement of polyvinyl chloride pvc based membranes the membranes were fabricated using phase inversion filtration results with reactive blue 19 dye rb 19 suggest that various membranes with different gqds loadings 0 05 2 wt had a rejection rate that is higher than 95 the gqds with a loading of 2 wt showed the highest rejection percentage of 97 6 13 in a study undertaken by bi et al 186 introducing gqds via in situ interfacial polymerization with trimesoyl chloride tmc gave rise to membranes that had pore sizes estimated between 1 2 and 1 72 nm and the rejection rate of 92 9 and 98 8 was obtained for alcian blue and congo red respectively interestingly when electrospun gqds polymer films were used for the photodegradation of rhodamine b 97 of the solution was degraded after 210 min such a high photodegradation rate is attributable to the broad optical response range under white light 187 a thin film nanocomposite tfn produced by interfacial polymerization reaction had a rejection rate of 99 8 and 97 6 for congo red and methylene blue respectively the resultant tfn was obtained by reacting gqds with tannic acid ta fabricated by interfacial polymerization reaction 90 93 a physically bound coating of gqds on the tfn polyamide nanofiltration nf membrane was used in the separation of methylene blue and methyl orange dyes 174 175 the addition of gqds coating altered the surface properties resulting in enhanced properties such as the improvement of surface roughness surface hydrophilicity as well as the electronegativity from fig 20 it can be observed that the steady water flux of methylene blue solution decreased from 83 3 lmh to 75 4 lmh when a gqds coated membrane was used similarly a decrease in the dye rejection was observed from 75 4 to 71 0 fig 20 b in contrast for the methyl orange solution there was an increment in the water flux from 106 8 to 124 4 lmh accompanied by a similar trend in dye rejection increasing from 89 2 to 97 0 fig 20 a zhao et al 174 175 ascribed these results to the differences in electrostatic attraction the negatively charged surface of the selective layer on nf membranes allowed the positively charged mb solution to absorb on the membrane surface yielding a decreased steady flux the addition of the gqds coating further decreased the water flux and dye rejection for the negatively charged methyl orange the repulsive interactions yielded poor dye adsorption on the surface of the membrane this led to increased equilibrium water flux and aided in the repulsion of dye molecules thus enhancing the dye rejection pictures of the membranes were taken after dye rejection fig 20 c and d and the nf was fouled by mb the fouling was significantly decreased when the gqds were added however no significant adsorption of methyl orange on the nf surfaces was observed this indicates that the gqds coating can also be used in antifouling applications 2 2 2 antifouling and antimicrobial properties the biggest limitation associated with membrane processes is fouling in pressure driven membranes this tends to increase the energy consumption operating and maintenance costs resulting from premature membrane replacement permeate quality deterioration service time and results in limited recoveries 188 in cases where a biofilm fouling layer caused by a growth of pathogens is formed on the surface of a membrane gqds have been previously added into the polymers due to their excellent antimicrobial properties which stem from their ability to physical pierce bacterial cells and also induce oxidative stress the incorporation of gqds contributed to an improvement of the dispersibility charge transfer and other properties that are important in the generation of reactive oxygen species ros 115 feedwater containing e coli was used in in a filtration study by zeng et al 189 wherein they established that gqds covalently linked to amino functionalized pvdf resulted in the significant inactivation of e coli and s aureus cells compared to 1d swcnts and 2d go sheets tshangana et al 9 10 have also reported on the fabrication of gqds polyether sulfone electrospun membranes and tested the performance of the membrane on e coli s aureus and b cereus using disc diffusion method the zones of inhibition ranged from 9 to 40 mm and the highest zones of inhibition corresponded to the highest loading of gqds at 10 wt further solidifying their role as biocidal agents polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf nf membranes embedded with gqds have been reported to reject more than 98 of bovine serum albumin bsa protein 13 in another investigation using e coli silver phosphate loaded gqds goqd ap were used as nanofillers in the fabrication of a tfn with antibacterial properties the resultant tfn goqd ap showed excellent bactericidal properties i e inactivation of e coli in the dark fig 21 i as well as in the light fig 21 ii 46 47 although very little work has been reported on gqds embedded in membranes several studies have investigated the antibacterial properties of gqds and gqds nanocomposite and each will be discussed in detail zno gqds synthesized via the hydrothermal method have an enhanced antibacterial activity against e coli 105 106 according to the shown images of e coli colonies fig 22 a to h bacterial colonies were significantly reduced after being exposed to uv after 5 min of irradiation the zno gqds composite inactivated 100 of the bacterial cells a comparative analysis of the survival rates of the cells is depicted in fig 22 g it is evident from fig 22 g that the addition of gqds to the zno gqds resulted in a drastic enhancement of bacterial cell inhibition the inhibition was as a result of the interfacial electron transfer from gqds to zno in another study where zno was also used as a photocatalyst gqds were covalently linked to zno nanorods and nanoflakes 9 10 the resultant zno nrs gqds and zno nfs gqds were tested against e coli p aeruginosa b cereus and s aureus the zones of inhibition were measured as shown in fig 22 h zno nrs nanohybrids had an enhanced antimicrobial activity and this was corroborated by the proposed antimicrobial mechanism the zno nrs gqds nanohybrids allowed better internalisation the maximum measured zone of inhibition was as follows for zno nrs gqds against s aureus 40 mm 2 mm zno nrs gqds for e coli 37 mm 2 mm however the least inhibition was observed in the pristine zno nfs when tested against e coli was 11 mm 2 mm elsewhere zhang et al 187 conjugated agnps to gqds and the resultant hybrid gqds agnps was applied simultaneously in pdt photodynamic therapy and bacterial pdt with s aureus and e coli being used as model microorganisms results emanating from this investigation showed that the hybrid gqds agnps significantly increased the ros production by the bare gqds and further enhanced the stability of agnps the changes in morphology of e coli and s aureus before and after exposure to gqds agnps hybrids at 450 nm light are depicted in fig 23 the untreated cells of e coli and s aureus fig 23 a and c showed cell walls that are intact and have a smooth surface after being exposed to 1 0 mg ml of gqds agnps and light illumination conditions for 10 min before incubating the cell wall of the e coli was visibly wrinkled and eventually collapsed fig 23 b similarly the treated s aureus had a rough surface with cytoplasmic leakage of contents owing to the collapsed cellular wall structure zhang et al 187 ascribed the bacterial inactivation to the synergistic effect between the toxic nature of ag in agnps and the enhanced photodynamic and photothermal antibacterial effects of gqds agnps hybrid recently polyethylenimine pei modified gqds and zno were fabricated using a sol gel method 190 to evaluate their antimicrobial activity the resultant zno gqds pei and zno gqds nanocomposites were tested against e coli 190 both zno gqds pei and zno gqds nanocomposites inhibited over 80 of the e coli interestingly to achieve a bacterial inhibition rate of 80 the concentration of zno gqds pei nanocomposite needed to be 0 9 mg ml mic of ca 2 7 mg ml compared to the 1 6 mg ml required for the zno gqd nanocomposite incorporating the pei capping layer enhanced the dispersing capabilities of the zno gqd pei nanocomposites and this facilitated the interactions with e coli thus increasing the bacterial inactivation properties in the pei capped nanocomposite compared to the ones without pei further the effects of pei loadings on the antibacterial activity of zno gqd pei nanocomposites were investigated from the results it was clear that surface modification of zno with cationic pei polymers significantly enhanced the antibacterial activity of zno gqd pei data showed that the zno gqd pei 6 had the highest antibacterial activity this antibacterial activity was attributed to the significant difference of the zeta potentials of 16 67 mv and 25 7 mv for the zno gqd pei 6 nanocomposite and e coli respectively this resulted in an increased stronger absorption of the zno gqd pei 6 onto the e coli 2 3 adsorption adsorption process is a phenomenon where specific components accumulate at the interface of two phases via a mass transfer mechanism typically an adsorbate is the compound that increases its concentration on the surface while adsorbent is the adsorbing surface 191 several factors influence the adsorption process such as the nature concentration and surface area of the adsorbent in addition experimental variables such as ph temperature time of contact and the presence of other contaminants also play a critical role one of the greatest advantages of adsorption lies in its simple structure and operating conditions which do not generate toxic by products therefore to date activated carbon has been the most widely used adsorbent however due the cost of production and regeneration efforts are now directed on finding alternative adsorbents 192 219 in the subsections that follow focus is placed on gqds or gqds nanocomposite used as adsorbents in the adsorption of pharmaceuticals pesticides heavy metals and dyes 2 3 1 gqds or gqds nanocomposites as adsorbents in the removal of pesticides and pharmaceuticals gqds were deployed as adsorbents in the removal of a noxious oxamyl compound 193 the results showed that adsorption was better and more efficient at higher ph ph 8 and when the optimum adsorbent dose was 0 6 g and contact time was less than 25 min the authors found that the nature of this adsorbent fast adsorption and settling of gqds ideal in continuous flow water treatment systems 193 in another study graphene oxide dots gods were used as a coat for two biomatrices in the removal of ranitidine carbamazepine chlorothiazide and prednisolone 220 in this work chitin flask and lignocellulosic jute powder were specifically chosen as biomatrices of choice the four pharmaceuticals were used as model pollutants to get an understanding of their removal efficacy by employing god coated adsorbents fig 24 a shows that all the four drugs could be removed using alkali treated jute god jute biochar alkali treated chitin and god coated chitin used in this study interestingly in both biomatrices the god coated adsorbents had enhanced adsorption capability compared to their corresponding untreated adsorbents 2 3 2 gqds nanocomposites as adsorbents in the removal of dyes the gods coated biomatrices prepared by manna et al 2018 were used in the removal of azo dyes methylene blue dymerin yellow and orange g from the results shown in fig 24 b it is evident that the gods coated biomatrices in all the cases possess far better removal and capturing capabilities of all the adsorbents tested the gods coated chitin was found to possess the best separation properties the results obtained indicate that the gods enhanced the removal capacity by up to 2 3 times more than the uncoated biomatrix 220 in another study a tri nanostructural assembly go fe3o4 gqd hydrogel was designed via the hcl etoh method and used in the removal of cationic pollutants mb rhb the pva cmc b go fe3o4 gqd l nanocomposite hydrogel significantly enhanced the adsorption of the dye the enhancement in the adsorption characteristics emanates from the unique layout of the go gqds and fe3o4 on the sheet the presence of gqds resulted in the surface area being increased as well as the accessibility of oxygen containing groups appears to be the most likely the reason behind improved removal efficiency in addition the positively charged dye molecules may experience hydrogen bonding electrostatic interactions and π π interaction with the gqds and go of the go fe3o4 gqd together with the oh cooh functional groups of the pva cmc b the adsorption followed a langmuir adsorption isotherm the gqds modified graphene synthesized by ying et al 194 was applied in adsorption as well as the separation of a mixture of aromatic dyes from water the modification with gqds significantly improved the stability of gqds in aqueous solution the results showed that graphene that was not modified sunk within an hour of adsorption and after 24 h there was complete precipitation conversely the gqds modified graphene showed no precipitation and remained stable for several months further the gqds modification significantly enhanced the adsorption capacity the rhb adsorption capacity was increased to 497 mg g 1 when compared with the unmodified graphene this enhanced adsorption capacity was ascribed to the accessible surface area the strong π π interactions as well as the anion cation interactions that occur between graphene and the rhb molecule further the adsorption behaviour was evaluated using other water soluble dyes rose bengal rb evans blue eb and methyl orange mo these dyes have different charge properties and structures the adsorption mechanism indicated that electrostatic interaction and π π interactions equally contributed to the adsorption of dyes de la luz asunción et al 11 evaluated the adsorption capacities of reactive red 2 rr2 dye on go and gqds at ph 2 and 5 while go and gqds are similar in structure sp2 hybridization they differ in dimensions and hence the adsorption capabilities are expected to be different results showed that the size of the adsorbents played a role in the removal of rr2 as a result of a larger surface area interestingly for the gqds modified adsorbent the adsorption of the sample continued even after 8 h due to a higher number of active sites present for adsorption the proposed adsorption mechanism between the dye and the go and gqds is illustrated in fig 24 c electrostatic interactions π π interactions as well hydrogen bonding are the chief parameters in the mechanism electrostatic interactions arise from the difference in the surface charges between the dye molecules and the go and gqds the π π interactions result from the interaction between the π electrons of rr2 and the graphitic structure of go and gqds hydrogen bonding emanates from the interaction of the hydrogen atoms present in the go and gqds as well as the n and o atoms in the rr2 dye 2 3 3 gqds nanocomposites as adsorbents in the removal of heavy metals gqds adsorbents were used to eliminate cadmium ii in synthetic wastewater 195 the optimum conditions for the efficient removal of cadmium ii were as follows initial concentration 20 mg ml contact time 30 and ph 7 an optimum adsorption capacity of 40 00 mg g was recorded an inexpensive adsorbent using gqds coated on quartz sand qs was developed for eliminating of hg2 and pb2 in aqueous solutions 196 the choice to coat gqds on solids silica magnetic materials quartz sand and polymers circumvents the drawbacks of using extremely small sized gqds as adsorbents 197 198 extremely small sized gqds are difficult to collect after adsorption and the process is equally time consuming 198 the optimal elimination percentages of hg2 and pb2 using 0 2 g gqds qs adsorbent were found to be 98 6 and 99 7 respectively 196 the pristine qs 0 2 g only achieved removal percentage efficiencies of 5 5 and 7 4 for the hg2 and pb2 respectively the authors attributed the enhanced elimination efficiency of the gqds qs to the increased surface area and subsequent increase in the number of active sites being present which allows the adsorbing ions to attach better on the gqds qs surface 199 further the novel gqds qs adsorbent is economically viable because of the availability and low cost of qs in another study gqds were covalently anchored onto the external layer of magnetic nife2o4 halloysite nanotubes nife2o4 hnts and the resultant nife2o4 hnts gqds composite was used in the elimination of pb2 from water 200 the synergistic impact of ph and contact time on the pb2 elimination was evaluated increasing contact time at constant ph resulted in an increase in the removal efficiency 92 6 of pb2 was removed in 54 min for ph at a constant composite concentration of 50 mg l the elimination efficiency increased until the ph reached 6 concentrations of the composite exceeding 50 mg l reduced the accessibility of the active sites needed for the interaction with the adsorbent to occur it was further noted in addition increasing the amount of nife2o4 hnts gqds at any specified ph also enhanced the elimination efficiency of pb2 the elimination efficiency was further enhanced by increasing the amount of nife2o4 hnts gqds and contact time this was ascribed to the high specified area of the nife2o4 hnts gqds that provided more accessible adsorptive sites 200 mechanistically the adsorption performance was attributed to the complexation interaction occurring between the pb2 ions and the functional moiety a study was conducted in which sustainable precursor materials such as rice husk a by product of the rice milling process was used to synthesize gqds 12 further modification of the rice husk based gqds with barium hydroxide led to the isolation of the gqdos ba nanobiosorbent which was used in the microwave enhanced removal of pb2 and la3 from water 12 the effect of gqdos ba nanobiosorbent dosage on the removal efficiency of the pb2 or la3 ions was evaluated by adding different dosages of gqdos ba 10 50 mg to 1 ml of 0 1 m solutions of pb2 or la3 results show that increasing the dosage of the nanobiosorbent enhanced the removal efficiency of both pb2 and la3 ions the authors are of the view that the correlation between the dosage of the nanobiosorbent and its removal efficiency is due to the increased active sites and the accessibility of commutable sites for the ions 12 the recovery of the gqdos ba nanobiosorbent and its ability to remove pb2 and la3 ions was evaluated in two types of water matrices namely tap water and industrial wastewater the removal efficiency by microwave extraction of pb2 from tap water and industrial wastewater sample were found to be 99 8 and 98 5 respectively for the la3 ion respective removal efficiencies of 96 2 and 94 6 were achieved in another study cr6 was removed from contaminated water using functional ionic liquid il capped gqds 201 ionic liquids are efficient eco friendly solvents that have been used in liquid liquid extraction as well as adsorbing heavy metals owing to their ease of operation tunability and the strong electrostatic characteristics that arise due to polar functional groups 202 203 despite these advantages it is difficult to recover the solvent use or avoid losing the il after use hence the covalent linking of gqds to il to produce il gqds adsorbent with enhanced stability compared to a number of commonly used adsorbents the il gqd adsorbent demonstrated an excellent cr6 adsorption capacity at 934 62 mg g the effect of competing ions on the cr6 adsorption was evaluated in the presence various cations and anions the results presented in fig 25 a indicate that cations did not affect the cr6 adsorption this could be as a result of the adsorption process taking place in a neutral ph solution that is at ph 7 the il gqd adsorbent becomes protonated and this result in repulsive forces being formed between the positively charged surface and other competing cations however cl so4 2 and no3 had a slight negative impact of the cr6 adsorption while il gqd adsorbent demonstrated significantly higher adsorption capabilities compared to the individual adsorbents of gqd il go and go regeneration studies were carried out using a basic medium as an eluting solution fig 25 b the results demonstrated that each of the adsorbents i e go il go gqd and il gqd could be used successfully while maintaining a removal efficiency rate exceeding 80 for up to 5 cycles this type of performance augurs well for the cost of the adsorbents a proposed removal pathway of cr6 is shown in fig 25 c the authors postulate that the il will induce the gqd of imidazolium il amide linkages and hydroxyl functionalities the protonated chain of amine group will then arrange itself with the alkyl moieties that are in the opposite direction and this facilitates the nh moieties to electrostatically interact with hexavalent chromium oxyanion in neutral to low ph the il gqd adsorbent acquires positive charges as a result of the protonated ionic liquid moieties amide linkages and some of the carboxylic groups that have yet reacted the rate of adsorption was enhanced due to excellent electrostatic synergy existing between the oxonium functional group from cr6 and the il gqd 2 4 other methods gqds have also been deployed as solid phase microextraction spme sorbents akbarzade et al 204 developed a magnetic dispersive solid phase microextraction coupled with gc ms and used to preconcentrate and determine five organophosphorus pesticides opps i e sevin fenitrothion malathion parathion and diazinon in real water in this study zero valent fe reduced gqds were used as spme sorbents to extract the opps 204 the efficiency of the rgoqds fe sorbent was investigated against that of magnetic graphene oxide m go and go the results showed that compared to the other two sorbents the rgoqds fe sorbent was highly effective in the extraction of opps the high extraction efficiency can be ascribed to the structure that is not polar as well as the limited number of polar functional moieties found in the analytes of interest especially in the case of malathion it is interesting to note that extraction efficiency was found to be inversely proportional to the number of polar functional moieties such as the carboxyl ethereal and hydroxyl groups occurring on the surface of the sorbent other applications of the gqds have been reported in literature including potential applications in biological and sensing applications for neurotransmitter determination 205 and bioimaging applications 206 due to their ultra small size non toxicity biocompatibility excellent photo stability tunable fluorescence and water solubility 3 conclusion and outlook graphene oxide quantum dots offer a possible solution for tackling emerging pollutants that make their way into drinking water sources treatments plants are supposed to use technologies that are economical sustainable and environmentally friendly all of these characteristics fit gqds perfectly gqds accessed via an array of synthetic strategies and the most used are carbonization and the hydrothermal methods modulation of the surface of gqds conjugation to other nanoparticles and incorporation of gqds into nanoparticles to produce nanocomposites result in the enhancement of the properties of gqds the use of gqds in aops has led to the successful degradation of dyes pesticides pharmaceuticals the degradation process proceeds via a hydroxyl free radical mechanism in which the free radicals react with the complex organic and inorganic compounds to produce less complex and less harmful compounds in a real wastewater plant this minimises sludge formation and such a system would result in a faster wastewater treatment process in some instances additional processes such filtration with membranes may be necessary to improve the results achieved with aops gqds have also been used in membrane technology either by being embedded or covalently linked to polymers incorporation of gqds into the membrane matrix improves the efficiency of the treatment of dyes the membrane characteristics and their antimicrobial properties the antimicrobial properties of gqds could be exploited further in the disinfection of wastewater as an alternative step to chlorination this is mainly because gqds do not produce any toxic transformation by products compared to chlorination which in some instances generates haloacetic acids or trihalomethanes gqds have also been evaluated in the adsorption of heavy metals in wastewater the current challenges limiting the deployment of gqds are that low cost mass production and purification of gqds have not yet been realised further a lack of industry scale methods capable of yielding gqds that are uniform in size and functionality remains a challenge should these limitations be tackled the use of gqds in the treatment of wastewater will be fully realised declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there is no conflict of interest acknowledgements we gratefully

graphene oxide quantum dots gqds are an emerging class of zero dimensional oxygen rich materials with dimensions of less than 20 nm gqds exhibit the phenomena of quantum confinement and edge effects this phenomenon bestows them with exceptional physico chemical properties these features have made gqds suitable materials for application in the catalytic removal of organic pollutants and dyes adsorption of heavy metals filtration of organic pollutants and in the disinfection of microbes however challenges encountered when developing gqds for environmental applications include generating high quality qds and devising large scale synthetic procedures that ensure reproducible size distribution a need exists for theoretical and practical research on the development of novel methods that allows high yields and easy purification of gqds to be achieved in addition despite possible mechanisms having been proposed a lack of an understanding of the photoluminescence pl properties of gqds remains this review focuses on some of the research that was reported on gqds during in the past 20 years the significant findings are summarized with comparative and balanced views the emphasis is placed on the different synthetic routes for accessing gqds and as well as the unique properties which make gqds ideal candidates for the removal of emerging pollutants from wastewater an evaluation of the most used approaches and promising technologies for the removal of emerging pollutants using gqds is also presented further current challenges relating to the use of gqds are addressed and an outlook of gqds as well as recommendations for future work are presented graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords graphene oxide quantum dots gqds wastewater treatment environmental remediation organic pollutants inorganic contaminants pathogenic microbes 1 introduction graphene oxide quantum dots gqds have attracted considerable attention in the field of environmental remediation this is predominantly because gqds are composed of carbon an abundant element on earth and also as a result of their enhanced activity and lack of secondary pollution from metal leaching 1 2 other favourable features of gqds that have made them front runners as potential substitutes for conventional semiconducting quantum dots qds include relative ease of synthesis low toxicity high solubility chemical and photoluminescence pl stability and negligible environmental concerns 3 the existence of quantum confinement effect allows the band gap energy of the gqds to be regulated between 0 and 6 ev and this is achieved by controlling the surface groups or the 2 d size of the gqds 4 the quantum confinement effect in gqds has provided a platform to exploit the novel structural electrical and optical properties of gqds that are not easily attainable in other nanomaterials besides gqds possess selective quenching properties that can be exploited for the detection of ions and various chemical groups the striking energy band of the pl of the gqds observed within the blue green region of the spectrum is responsible for this type of detection 5 due to their unique properties of gqds several research papers have reported that the combining gqds with other nanomaterials results in multi functional nanocomposites with enhanced properties suitable for water treatment application for instance combining gqds with bivo4 g c3n4 z agvo3 tio2 and zno yielded superior photocatalytic activity towards the degradation of pharmaceuticals and organic dyes in water 6 10 209 in terms of the removal of heavy metals pesticides pharmaceuticals and microbes from water gqds based adsorbents thin films and nanofibers have also been reported to possess improved properties when compared with pristine materials 11 13 despite several fascinating properties of gqds drawbacks that limit their practical environmental applications still exist a combination of structural defects poor dispersion and poorly understood photoluminescence properties are some of the challenges hindering large scale production and application of these materials 14 15 fortunately the presence of numerous oxygenated groups has led to an expansion of the structural and chemical diversity of gqds that is achieved through chemical modification or functionalization such an approach provides an effective path for tailoring the physical and chemical properties of gqds to targeted applications therefore gqds have shown great potential in environment protection including water treatment on a larger scale the use of gqds and gqds based nanocomposites can be implemented in wastewater treatment plants wwtps as it stands most of the currently available wwtps were primarily designed to only target the removal of biodegradable compounds and not emerging complex compounds therefore a need exists to modify improve or even couple current wastewater treatment processes to advanced techniques that will enable the removal of emerging pollutants from wastewater before being discharged into receiving dams the increase in pollution levels due to rapid industrialization is considered as one of the major global challenges of the 21st century research on advanced carbonaceous nanomaterials such as gqds has been on an exponential trajectory as potential materials for environmental applications because of their unusual and exotic properties this review seeks to explore and emphasize the role of gqds and gqds based nanocomposites in the removal of emerging pollutants from water specifically the review presents from a critical point of view important features of gqds that are useful for application in environmental remediation this is highlighted through examples of how the functionalization of gqds and their combination with other nanomaterials can impact their environmental applications first the different synthetic routes for gqds which ultimately impact on their structure and morphology are discussed special emphasis is placed on the surface modification and functionalization of the gqds to enhance their degradation or removal properties towards emerging pollutants eps further an evaluation is conducted on the most prevalent or promising technologies that utilise gqds based nanocomposites in advanced oxidative processes aops membrane processes and adsorption for the removal of emerging pollutants microorganisms dyes pesticides and heavy metals finally the review outlines the industrial applications and an outlook of gqds 1 1 graphene oxide quantum dots gqds gqds are zero dimensional 0d oxygen rich hydroxyl epoxy and carboxyl containing carbon based materials characterized by a graphitic plane composed of single or double layers which are typically 2 nm in thickness and have lateral dimensions not exceeding 10 nm 16 21 ideally gqds should strictly contain carbon and have one atomic layer however several of the previously synthesized gqds have multiple layers and contain oxygen and hydrogen 22 23 another prerequisite for gqds to be classified as such is the presence of a graphene lattice while other researchers regard gqds as nothing more than a massive polyaromatic molecule when compared with other polycyclic aromatic molecules such as pyrene gqds have distinct and far more intriguing properties 210 structurally the carbons of the gqds are arranged into a honeycomb like crystal lattice and are organized into rings of six atoms from this arrangement sp 2 hybridized characteristics of gqds are born the arrangement further results in the delocalization of electrons in the π orbitals 24 26 this phenomenon bestows the gqds with outstanding optical and electrical properties the shape of the gqds is determined by the type of edges found in the gqds two different types of edges exist in gqds namely a zig zag and b armchair edges fig 1 a and b while on one hand the zig zag edges also called carbene like edges are characterized by two unshared valence electrons found on every carbon atom at the edge the armchair edges on the other hand have triply bound carbons and this type of edge resembles carbyne molecules 16 27 typically the presence of similar edges zig zag and zig zag or armchair and armchair will result in corners being formed at 120 however 90 corners will be formed when different edges come together a zig zag and armchair come together an occurrence of the same type of edges coupled with the formation of six 120 angles suggests an existence of hexagonal shaped gqds similarly rectangular shaped gqds are characterized by the presence of both zig zag and armchair edges that form four 90 angles fig 1 c oval and round shaped gqds have been reported for instances where the corners are not well developed 27 besides determining the shape the type of edge present also influences the photoluminescence pl behaviour of gqds zig zag edges have a smaller bandgap compared to armchair edges as a result armchair edges yield a notable blue shift in the emission spectrum of the gqds concerned 24 in the case of zig zag edges the luminance of the gqds is affected by changes in ph 29 30 compared to traditional semiconductor qds gqds possess superior properties such as low toxicity good water solubility superior photostability against photobleaching and a stable fluorescence 31 35 the most significant property among all the mentioned is the fluorescence of the gqds while the photoluminescence mechanism of gqds has been previously understood using size shape degree of oxidation the extension of the π conjugated domains doping atoms and surface chemical groups there is no single universally accepted pl mechanism 36 37 however to the most eminent pl mechanism is believed to be a combination of the quantum confinement effect conjugated π domains or a synergistic effect of the surface effects edge effects and conjugated π domains 38 the band gap of gqds can also be modulated from 0 to 6 ev by altering the surface chemical properties or size arising from the quantum confinement effect 3 211 the excitation of gqds is entirely dependent on their emission and the gqds excitation wavelength is in the range 320 480 nm with a corresponding emission range occurring anywhere between 200 and 700 nm 3 34 35 39 41 the most emitted fluorescence is blue and green on one hand blue emission will typically be quenched at higher concentrations and this phenomenon is called aggregation induced concentration quenching essentially this means that the gqds will undergo aggregation at higher concentrations and photoluminescence quenching will take place because of non radiation energy transfer and photon reabsorption on the other hand green emission shows an enhanced fluorescence at higher concentrations henna pramod 42 have demonstrated two photon fluorescence or upconversion photoluminescence by gqds which occur when the emission wavelength is smaller than the excitation wavelength and the gqds simultaneously absorb two photons 1 2 graphene oxide quantum dots vs carbon dots gqds are often classified as carbon dots c dots and this creates confusion when distinguishing between the two the first synthesis of c dots was reported in 2004 43 in contrast gqds were synthesized for the first time in 2008 44 therefore it is important to emphasize that the two nanomaterials differ in morphology and properties 1 2 1 structural properties gqds are structurally distinct from c dots fig 2 a to d c dots are quasi spherical carbon materials that consist of sp 3 carbon some other c dots may be composed of a crystalline sp 2 core that is enveloped by a non crystalline shell additionally several hollow structured c dots have been documented in literature 45 48 gqds are mainly sp 2 carbon based and highly crystalline owing to the presence of a graphene lattice 49 whereas gqds and c dots have an in plane lattice spacing of 0 18 0 25 nm they are also characterized by graphitic inter layer spacing that is between 0 32 and 0 34 nm or larger depending on the heteroatoms or functional groups introduced 17 18 typically the diameter of c dots is 10 nm gqds are anisotropic and are characterized by a layered structure whereas c dots have colloidal features and a nanoparticle structure 1 2 2 absorbance gqds and c dots are capable of efficiently photon harvesting in the short wavelength region as a result of the π π of the phenyl rings and the cc bonds however c dots are often more efficient in absorbing in longer wavelengths both gqds and c dots absorb strongly in the near ultraviolet region nir 260 320 nm of the spectrum and have as shown in fig 3 a and c tails that extend in the visible region 16 50 contrarily gqds tend to have a shoulder peak in region 270 390 nm which is ascribed to the π π transition of the co bonds 53 1 2 3 photoluminescence pl the most fascinating feature of gqds and c dots is their pl gqds and c dots exhibit a clear excitation dependent emission wavelength and intensity fig 3 b and d this means that as the pl maximum redshifts the excitation also increases in the case of gqds this phenomenon is attributed to quantum confinement effect of the conjugated π domains the surface state in gqds as well as the combined effect of both aforementioned factors 55 with c dots it has not yet been fully established whether it is as a result of optical selection of varied size nanoparticles or perhaps due to the various emissive traps found on the surface or entirely through a completely different mechanism 56 conversely excitation independent emission wavelengths have been reported and these were as a result of uniform size and surface states 36 in addition both gqds and c dots have tunable pl properties due to quantum confinement effect gqds generally have a higher pl quantum yield qy in comparison to pristine c dots because gqds have a layered surface and excellent crystallinity 21 pristine c dots typically have 10 pl qy and this is ascribed to emissive traps occurring on the surface of c dots to overcome this challenge surface passivation is necessary 57 additionally the pl of both gqds and c dots can be tuned via modification 1 2 4 electrochemiluminscence and electrochemical properties the major difference between electrochemiluminscence ecl and pl is that ecl is distinguished by surface states while pl is focused on the core state while gqds and c dots are known to exhibit ecl properties compared to c dots gqds have a stable ecl and an onset potential closest to 0 v this is ascribed to the high content of sp 2 hybridization that accelerates the electron transfer in a typical study the ecl emission of c dots was noted when the potential cycle was in the range 1 8 and 1 5 v 58 in another study the ecl emission of gqds coupled with a stable ecl signal and a standard deviation of 1 0 was detected even when the onset potential was 0 4 v 59 gqds and c dots also share a similar ecl mechanism the proposed ecl mechanism suggests that gqds or c dots r in their excited form will be formed by the electron transfer obliteration of the ve charged r and the ve charged r species subsequently this will result in an ecl signal is produced through relaxation to the ground state electrochemical properties of gqds and c dots rely largely on the interaction between doped heteroatoms and the functional groups 60 when oxygenated groups are present at the basal plane the electron transfer emanating from the disturbance of the conductive sp 2 carbon arrangement is affected c dots have poorer electrochemical properties due to their smaller surface area and poor crystallinity in contrast an efficient high speed electron transfer of gqds is afforded by the edge sites present in gqds and their large surface area 1 3 synthesis of graphene quantum dots gqds can be synthesized by a stepwise organic synthetic procedure or expeditiously via the top down or bottom up one step synthetic routes fig 4 a to f various parameters such as surface characteristics size shape and opto electrical properties of gqds depend largely on the choice of the precursor materials and synthetic approach 1 3 1 top down approach the top down synthetic route usually entails cleaving bulk graphene like starting materials such as graphite powder coal graphene oxide graphene carbon black carbon nanotubes carbon nanofibers and recently metal organic frameworks mofs derived carbon into quantum sizes 34 36 57 61 67 69 the precursors are then subjected to different physical chemical or electrochemical treatments under specific reaction conditions to produce gqds processes reported in the literature that use the top down approach include hydrothermal and solvothermal processes acidic oxidation and exfoliation surface catalysed decomposition reaction and controlled chemical oxidation 70 71 the biggest limitation to the top down synthetic approach is the lack of precise control in size distribution and morphology of the gqds which are all important factors when designing and fabricating gqds in addition this approach uses harsh experimental conditions such as strong acidic media high voltage strong oxidising agents or extremely long reaction times that are not ideal for large scale production alternative less harsh non acidic oxidants such as ozone and h2o2 have recently been used for exfoliating gqds 41 72 75 the top down synthetic approaches of dqds are discussed briefly in the next subsections 1 3 1 1 hydrothermal and solvothermal method hydrothermal and solvothermal synthetic approaches are almost similar however solvothermal synthesis makes use of organic solvents while hydrothermal synthesis employs water as a solvent carbon materials such as graphene carbon nanotubes fullerenes etc are exposed to strong oxidants in the preparation process and cut into gqds at high pressure and temperature 76 the mechanism is as follows carbon materials are oxidised using strong oxidants and oxygenated functionalities are as a result introduced onto the carbon lattice at room temperature further oxidation occurs under hydrothermal conditions the gqds are formed as a result of the unstable carbonyl pairs and oxygen atoms located on the epoxy bonds the first solvothermal synthesis of gqds was reported by zhu et al 77 who used go sheets as the carbon source and dmf was used as a solvent in this synthetic approach the go sheets were used as precursors and treated with oxidising agents in order to establish epoxy groups onto the go and the resultant gqds were formed by chemically cutting and employing basic medium such as naoh one of the key factors in hydrothermal and solvothermal synthetic approaches is temperature temperature plays a significant role on the texture of the gqds obtained at lower temperatures poorly ordered gqds are synthesized in contrast higher temperatures lead to the generation of small highly crystalline gqds 78 liu et al 63 64 reported n doped gqds prepared from pan based carbon fiber as shown in fig 5 this was achieved by controlling the hydrothermal time in ammonia solution to obtain 3 nm n gqds on the bond scission strategy using ammonia as a passivation agent 1 3 1 2 microwave assisted method to overcome the limitation of time consuming reactions such as hydrothermal and solvothermal approaches rapid methods have evolved the microwave assisted method offers rapid uniform heating of the reaction vessel and improves the production yield some other advantages of this method include high reproducibility excellent control over experimental parameters and energy saving and environmental friendliness for instance water soluble gqds were synthesized by zhang et al 79 80 using a simple procedure this synthetic procedure involved adding aspartic acid and nh4hco3 to water in reaction flask and heating for 10 min using a 560 w microwave reactor 79 80 with all its merits this synthetic approach unfortunately necessitates advanced and sophisticated equipment zhang and co workers have successfully synthesized gqds following the method depicted in fig 6 1 3 1 3 oxidative cleavage this is the most used method of producing gqds however oxidative cleavage treatment employs strong acids typically nitric acid and mixtures of sulfuric and nitric acids these strong oxidisers may cause burns explosions or require post synthesis processes that may be complex typically the carbon carbon bonds of bulk carbon materials are broken down by h2so4 or hno3 in other instances sonication may be used to break the carbon carbon linkage present in the bulk carbon materials into gqds this is followed by heating and stirring the solution at temperatures of up to 80 c 33 36 81 a facile one pot synthetic route for gqds was developed by lu et al 82 this method does not make use of concentrated acids and does not require post synthesis steps instead carbon black is used as a precursor while the oxidant is h2o2 and the reaction takes only 90 min to synthesize the gqds an easy one step hydrothermal microwave procedure was reported for the fabrication of gqds that possess unusual photoluminescence properties 83 fig 7 the quantum dots were formed through oxidative cleavage of the cc bonds in the presence of strong acids 1 3 1 4 electrochemical oxidation the electrochemical oxidation process involves the electrochemical cleavage of carbon precursors into gqds typically under high redox voltage 84 electrochemical oxidation can occur in one of two ways the first is where cc bonds of the carbon material are cleaved via chemical oxidation and the second occurs when either the oxygen free radical o or hydroxyl free radical oh from water attacks and cleaves the cc bonds to form gqds advantages of using this method include the formation of stable gqds and high quality of gqds produced 84 the major drawback is that it not feasible to mass produce gqds using this method owing to the high costs associated with the method and low production yields further pretreatment and post synthesis purification are time consuming zhang et al 40 carried out a study wherein graphite rods were electrolysed through immersion in 0 1 m naoh solution at 80 200 ma cm 2 alternatively a mwcnts coated working electrode was fractured through the application of an anodic potential of 1 v for 7 11 or 15 h 85 another method is via cyclic voltammetry cv 212 a study on the electrochemical synthesis of gqds with size ranging from 3 to 5 nm in diameter from graphene oxide go was recently reported 86 the synthesis was carried out at room temperature using liclo4 in propylene carbonate as the electrolyte 86 1 3 1 5 laser ablation pulsed laser ablation in liquid plal is being used a lot in the synthesis of gqds owing to its easiness simplicity and environmental friendliness 87 93 the coulomb explosion model is used to describe the ablation mechanism of carbon materials by plal 88 briefly when a laser pulse is injected into the carbon material ionization by multiphoton absorption takes place which in turn results in high temperature and plasma plume being formed the coulomb explosion takes place in the coulomb plume and the carbon materials are subsequently ablated to quantum sizes resulting in the formation of gqds recently kang et al 94 synthesized gqds using mwcnts in high purity ethanol as a carbon source a nd yag laser system was employed for the plal in another study gqds were produced by employing laser ablation that uses a femtosecond laser 800 nm 35 s pulses for a total of 20 min on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite hopg in aqueous media alternatively graphite powder in the presence of benzene can be irradiated with an nd yag laser 1064 nm 10 ns pulses for a total of 30 min 95 96 compared to chemical oxidation plal is a faster and cleaner method and has fewer starting chemicals and by products 97 gqds were synthesized reproducibly by a one step pulsed laser ablation la of nanocarbon onions in deionized water fig 8 98 the laser pulse width at 532 nm was generated for 5 7 ns at a repetition rate of 10 hz the gqds were found to possess an average diameter of 1 8 nm and a thickness comparable to that of single layer of graphene 1 3 2 bottom up approach the bottom up synthetic approach involves turning smaller organic molecules such as citric acid 61 and other graphene related polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pah molecular precursors such as fullerene benzene and glucose into gqds via stepwise chemical reactions to obtain the gqds techniques such as direct pyrolysis carbonization or hydrothermal treatment using autoclave reactors or microwave assisted methods are then employed unlike the top down approach this method is cost effective scalable provides great control over the morphology shape surface state and sizes and results in fewer defects 99 1 3 2 1 catalysed fullerene cage opening fullerene molecules have been employed as gqds precursors gqds are synthesized through oxidation by employing a mixture of sulfuric acid sodium nitrate and potassium permanganate as an oxidising agent the cage opening and subsequently the formation of fluorescent gqds happens as a result of oxidation 100 1 3 2 2 pyrolysis although pyrolysis is the simplest and most used synthetic approach for accessing gqds it has a low quantum yield typically amino acids l glutamic acid glutathione citric acid acetylacetone carbohydrates sucrose or glucose and ethanolamine are carbonized when l glutamic acid is used as a precursor it is heated to 210 c until a brown like liquid is formed thereafter to produce an aqueous dispersion of gqds water is added 101 gqds can also be synthesized by the direct pyrolysis of citric acid ca after heating ca at 200 c until it changes to a dark orange colour a solution of naoh is added 213 it has been reported that using glutathione as precursor yielded gqds that had excellent biocompatibility and are obtained with higher quantum yields 100 some of the advantages of this method include the use of green and low cost materials no complex post synthesis processes are required does not require any strong acids or bases simplicity and does not produce any toxic gases 84 lee et al 102 reported a novel route for the synthesis of high quality graphene quantum dots by hydrogen assisted pyrolysis of silicon carbide fig 9 the fabricated gqds contained a few graphene layers and possessed high crystallinity and high purity with few defects the gqds were also free from oxygen functional groups 102 different other methods have been reported for the fabrication of gqds with various physico chemical properties such as structural electronic optical chemiluminescence and electrochemical properties of the dqds are summarized in table 1 1 4 challenges and opportunities of gqds graphene oxide quantum dots gqds have attracted a lot of research interest in recent years due to their good solubility excellent chemical stability low toxicity ease of chemical modification and photostability however there are huge differences in the sizes shapes and surfaces of gqds prepared through different methods 117 this has presented challenges in understanding the effect of these properties on the application of these novel materials another challenge is that the mechanism of the quantum confinement effect is poorly understood hence difficulties in successfully explaining the shift of the photoluminescence pl at different excitation wavelengths in relation to the size change 118 119 in fact some experimental results demonstrate totally contrary phenomena currently there is no unanimous consensus on the specific surface traps to account for the excitation dependent pl for large scale requirements it is necessary to mass produce gqds at relatively low cost however the product yield of gqds using current preparation methods is still considerably low mostly 10 in addition the reported quantum yields of gqds are very low 2 to 22 9 compared to other traditional semiconductor materials 120 several other challenges of gqds that hinder their widespread application in water treatment are highlighted in fig 10 to overcome some of the challenges more advanced spectroscopic technologies such as single particle spectroscopy and ultrafast spectroscopy may play an important role in understanding the properties of gqds in the future the potential cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of gqds is currently a topical issue in environmental and biomedical application fields recently chong et al 121 reported no apparent in vitro and in vivo toxicity in mice and this was attributed to the small size and high o content of the gqds although numerous gqds toxicology studies have been reported in the past few years more still research still needs to be conducted to understand the toxicity of gqds 19 20 despite all the reported challenges research in gqds continues to grow at an exponential growth thanks to the myriad of opportunities available for chemical modification and engineering of these materials to enhance their properties functionalization methods of gqds include chemical functionalization anchoring reactive groups heteroatom doping and formation of heterojunctions with other nanomaterials functionalization of gqds provides a broad scope of benefits to enhance the physico chemical properties some of the benefits of functionalization of gqds are highlighted below 122 1 oxygen containing groups provide high solubility and facilitate further surface functionalization 2 improve the dispersion in aqueous solution and provides better interfacing with other materials 3 increase the affinity of gqd to the surface of other nanoparticles during conjugation 4 optimizes electronic interaction between gqds and other nanomaterials in heterojunction conjugations 5 improve electron and hole transport in electrolyte and device stability 6 increase photocatalytic activity in photocatalytic reactions due to slowing down of electron hole recombination 7 reduce the size dependent bandgap to cover the whole solar radiation spectrum as the complexity of the gqd modification techniques continue to increase so too is the need to modify and manipulate the inherent chemistry to add functionality impart reactivity and alter optical properties 123 a variety of methods have been used to successfully modify the gqd periphery using both covalent and non covalent means 1 5 modification and functionalization of gqds some properties of gqds can be enhanced by an in situ one pot functionalization of gqds doping or surface modification fig 11 a b and c 51 pristine gqds tend to be limited in their application and thus require modulation to enhance their properties 1 5 1 doping the honeycomb like structure of gqds allows various heteroatoms to make their way into the carbon lattice examples of heteroatoms that gqds have been doped with include b p ag n s and cl 68 124 128 however nitrogen has been used more than any other heteroatom because of the number of electrons in its valence band as well as a size that is comparable to that of carbon 63 64 129 various literature reports have detailed the use of co doping with more than one heteroatom 68 130 131 the shift in the photoluminescence properties of these gqds is attributed to charge transfer between gqds and functional moieties the introduction of different functional groups brings about surface or edge effects which result in band gap and electronic density perturbation and alteration of the total dipole moment 51 various factors such as the functional moiety position of the attached functional moiety and the shape will influence the total dipole moment surface modification theoretically and experimentally enhances optical properties pl emission and fluorescence quantum yield of gqds by reducing the impact of non radiative emissions upon excitation 17 18 the enhancement in pl properties due to doping is ascribed to the formation of new types of surface states particularly n s or s n doping where n or s atoms are introduced into the graphitic core which yields in new surface states 29 30 these newly formed surface states will have emissive traps that will result in a higher yield of recombination 1 5 2 surface modification a wide array of inorganic and organic molecules including diamines thiols ionic liquids glutathione gsh peptides polyethyleneimine pei have been employed in the surface modification functionalization of gqds primary amines have been doped on the edges of gqds to give them tunable photoluminescence properties 132 the pl modification is ascribed to an additional interband that is present within the energy gap as a result of the nh2 groups the interband arises from the hybridization of the p orbitals of the cn atoms on the gqds 133 functionalized gqds show red shifted absorption attributed to charge transfer between the gqds and the functional moieties as well as changes in ph as a result of protonation and deprotonation introducing amino and thiol functional groups on the surface of gqds enable further conjugation to a wide array of molecules 63 64 134 1 5 3 conjugation another method that has been employed in the modulation of the properties of the gqds is conjugating to other functionalities post synthesis the cooh and oh groups on the surface of the gqds allow covalent attachment with various biomolecules and nanoparticles 135 further other π conjugated aromatic molecules can be conjugated to the gqds due to the π π interactions arising from the planar structure made up of delocalized π electrons 136 the controlled post synthesis functionalization of gqds with suitable biomolecules engineered nanoparticles and macrocyclic compounds has resulted in enhanced changes in their photophysical and chemical properties 1 6 effect of surface modification on the properties of the gqds the pl effect caused by modifying the surface of gqds has been previously studied 35 38 nitrogen doped gqds negatively affected the pl properties of gqds and sun et al 129 attributed this to the π π transitions that become dominant between the n of the aromatic ring and the sp 2 of the gqds structure 129 elsewhere dong et al 81 have shown that doping n gqds with s atoms eliminated o states while enhancing of the n state which contribute to an excitation independent emission 81 zhu et al 38 suggested that chemical functionalization resulted in the suppression of the defect state emission thus allowing the pl behaviour to be directed by intrinsic state emission for example functionalizing gqds with epoxy groups leads to more non radiative recombination while carboxyl amide and hydroxyl groups lessen non radiative recombination effects 34 35 38 jin et al 138 observed a red shift upon functionalizing gqds with amine groups gqds decorated with graphene sheets via chemical surface modification enhanced the degradation of methylene blue up to 96 after 40 min 137 the addition of graphene played an essential role since it enhanced the absorption of the dye by inducing the π π stacking with the mb molecules which then facilitated access of photogenerated carriers to the nearby mb 137 1 7 properties and characterization several characterization techniques have been employed to understand the structure of gqds its optical and electrochemical properties a typical uv vis spectrum of gqds see fig 12 a shows the presence of a peak anywhere in the range 230 270 nm which is ascribed to the π π transition of the aromatic cc bonds and therefore the sp 2 hybridization typically a characteristic shoulder peak also appears at 290 320 nm and is attributed to the oxygen group functionality on the surface of the gqds 139 140 fourier transform infrared red ft ir spectroscopy was employed to confirm the reduction of goqds to gqds 127 fig 12 b in another study xps was used to investigate if gqds were successfully functionalized with n atoms 63 64 fig 12 c data obtained from ft ir spectroscopy and x ray photoelectron xps spectroscopy shows that oxygen containing groups such as epoxy carbonyl hydroxyl and carboxyl groups are present in other instances where the oxygen containing groups were removed through chemical reduction processes the results could be confirmed raman spectroscopy is also used for investigating the crystallinity of the gqds through the presence of bands assigned as the d and g bands at nearly 1350 cm 1 and 1600 cm 1 respectively fig 12 d the bands are associated with disorder of the hexagonal lattice and the sp2 bonding on the one hand the g band arises due to the vibrational modes e2g of the gqds and thus relates to the crystallinity of the synthesized gqds on the other hand the d band is assigned to the disorder on the surface of the gqds the extent of sp2 sp3 hybridization is expressed using the ratio of the intensity of the d and g bands id ig the lower the id ig value the more crystalline the gqds become 4 16 the x ray powder diffraction xrd pattern had a broad diffraction peak at 2θ 25 as shown in fig 12 e high resolution transmission electron microscope hrtem allows the visualisation of the gqds and provides information regarding particle shape size distribution and crystallinity and edge types 4 16 24 information obtained from hrtem can be corroborated with xrd data for example the interlayer spacing in plane lattice spacing as well as the level of resolution structure of lattice fringes fig 12 f hrtem images have shown that gqds have a hexagonal symmetrical crystalline structure with an in plane lattice spacing that is similar to that of graphene 36 information regarding the size shape and surface topology of the gqds can be obtained using atomic force microscopy afm fig 12 g any topographical height that is less than 0 5 nm indicates the presence of single layered gqds the functionalization on the basal plane of gqds can also affect their height 141 2 applications of gqds various applications gqds such as advanced oxidative processes membrane technology adsorption and others have been cited before 143 146 many of these applications are based on the exploitation of gqds unique properties these applications are discussed individually in the next section 2 1 advanced oxidation processes advanced oxidation processes aops generate non selective and oxidative species such as the oh and so4 radicals the non selectivity of the aops allow these radicals to attack a wide array of molecules which are subsequently reduced to intermediates that are less toxic and harmful or to mineralised to form harmless by products in the form of co2 or h2o 147 148 the type of interaction between the reactants and catalyst determines whether aops are heterogeneous or homogenous the removal efficiencies of pollutants in heterogeneous processes are dependent on the adsorption of the reactants and desorption that take place on the active sites 149 in homogeneous processes the removal efficiency of pollutants will be driven by the interaction between the chemical reagents and the target molecules owing to its low cost the use of ultraviolet uv light in aops is well documented some aops are not capable of full mineralisation of eps and this can sometimes result in transformation products saggioro et al 150 and teresa et al 214 have identified transformation products formed during aops the concentrations of these transformation products were evaluated and their estrogenic and antimicrobial activities were determined although the results showed that negligible concentrations of the transformation products were detected it was found that additional processes such membrane filtration were necessary to improve the results achieved with aops towards these transformation products of the known aops photocatalysis has proven to be the most effective in the degradation of various organic contaminants such as dyes pesticides phenols pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting compounds ecds from wastewater 215 when uv or visible light was used for irradiation 2 1 1 gqds as photocatalyst gqds are preferred as photocatalysts over other carbon materials because they have basal planes that allow for enhanced contaminant adsorption in addition gqds offer the versatility of being utilised as either electron donors or electron acceptors a feature that promotes the regulation of the photogenerated charge and improves photocatalytic the activity of gqd nanocomposites the enhancement of the photocatalytic efficiency of gqd nanocomposites is attributed to the role of gqds in facilitating the adsorption of organic pollutants 2 1 2 removal of emerging pollutants a gqds mn n tio2 g c3n4 gqds tcn nanocomposite obtained via hydrothermal reaction was used in a combined photodegradation of an organic pollutant and photocatalytic generation of h2 from water splitting 146 interestingly this dual nanocomposite was able to degrade organic pollutants from wastewater and simultaneously generate new energy the photocatalytic activities of the nanocomposite were investigated in the removal of organic compounds such as p nitrophenol ciprofloxacin and diethyl phthalate the optimum composition of the nanocomposite was 5 wt of gqds and 40 g c3n4 s gqds tcn 0 4 and this optimized catalyst gave the highest photodegradation efficiency rate of p nitrophenol 89 and h2 generation rate of 0 87 mmol l 1 g 1 after 2 h of reaction time fig 13 a the reduced photocatalytic activities of the gqds mn n tio2 13 4 and mn n tio2 and 11 8 were ascribed to the fast recombination rate of photogenerated e and h and the respective corresponding h2 evolution rates of 512 mmol l 1 g 1 and 0 441 mmol l 1 g 1 fig 13 b data from density functional theory dft calculations and gc ms analysis showed that electrons were involved in the degradation of p nitrophenol and none for ciprofloxacin and diethyl phthalate a study by lim et al 151 indicates that n gqds deposited on nanocubic tio2 degrade bisphenol a bpa a man made endocrine disrupting chemical ecd to understand the role of the n gqds in n gqds tio2 studies were conducted to evaluate the photocatalytic efficiency of the tio2 before n gqds were incorporated the low photocatalytic performance of pristine tio2 was ascribed to the rapid recombination of e h pairs and limited photoresponse range however complete degradation that is 1 85 more than pristine tio2 was achieved within 30 min following the addition of 0 5 wt n gqds interestingly increasing the wt of n gqds from 0 5 to 2 5 wt resulted in an overall reduction of the number of active radicals generated 152 the decreased production of active radicals is ascribed to the formed oxygen vacancies arising from the increased presence of in n gqds which results in the suppression of e h pairs in the conduction band 151 216 complete degradation of bpa was achieved within 45 min using 1 5 and 1 5 and 2 5 n gqds tio2 this makes 0 5 wt the optimum wt for deposition of n gqds onto tio2 fig 12 c to elucidate the mechanism of degradation of bpa scavenging experiments were conducted using radical scavengers results presented in fig 12 d show the contribution of all the oxidative species contributed to the degradation of bpa as follows oh 77 h 62 and o2 30 phophayu et al 153 demonstrated that the photocatalytic efficiency of zno could be enhanced by 23 when gqds zno were used to degrade commercial glyphosate herbicide antibiotic drugs tetracycline tc oxytetracycline and ciprofloxacin were also degraded using the n gqds bivo4 g c3n4 z scheme heterojunction and 91 5 of tetracycline was degraded within 30 min the high quantum yields and reaction rates are ascribed to n gqds which accelerate the effective charge separation and exhibit both strong oxidation and reduction abilities thus promoting the degradation of the organic pollutants 209 further a novel ag n gqds g g c3n4 was designed by deng et al 154 by initially combining the local surface plasmon resonance lspr effect of the ag nanoparticles the up conversion characteristics of n gqds and finally the visible light response ability of g c3n4 in the degradation of antibiotic drug tetracycline tc the reported data suggests the roles played by both the n gqds and ag nps in the enhancement of photocatalytic activity of the hybrid is quite significant combining the up conversion properties of n gqds and the lspr effect of ag nps enhanced the light transfer and absorption ability of the ag n gqds g g c3n4 hybrid which in turn resulted in increased photogenerated charges and subsequent inhibition of the recombination efficiency the photocatalytic reaction mechanism and photogenerated charge transfer is presented in fig 14 the authors ascribed the improved removal efficiency and photocatalytic activity to be as a result of a improved light absorption and the transformation effect as well as b the acceleration of photoexcited charges and migration effect briefly g c3n4 only absorbs wavelengths that are 460 nm however the composite ag n gqds g c3n4 on the other hand can absorb wavelength 460 nm this is due the presence of n gqds and ag nps in instances where wavelengths are 550 nm ag nps becomes the chief contributor to its absorption due to the lspr effect this also applies in the case of catalysis at wavelengths 550 nm in this case the role of n gqds will be more dominant this is a result of the up conversion effect of n gqds which subsequently leads to the absorption by the ag g c3n4 system to generate photoinduced charges it is noteworthy that the lspr effect of ag nps yields more visible light absorption which in turn improves the light harvesting capacity of n gqds the synergistic effects among the g c3n4 n gqds and ag nps are responsible for the improved properties in the ag n gqds g c3n4 which results in absorption conversion and improved effects of solar light utilisation the generation of photoinduced e h pairs results in the electrons of g c3n4 that readily react with dissolved oxygen which in turn generates o2 or in some instances could react with water and form oh that are responsible for the degradation of tc 154 a co assembly strategy was designed by hao et al 155 to allow the incorporation ultra small gqds into a mesoporous photocatalyst m bm photocatalyst to form a gqds bm hybrid fig 15 a a gqds bm hybrid was used for the elimination of bpa ciprofloxacin cip methylene blue phenol tc and rhb under simulated sunlight irradiation the addition of gqds were shown to enhance the light harvesting performance in the uv to the near infrared region nir which is favourable towards the generation of active e and h on the bi2moo6 furthermore the electronic capturing ability of the gqds allowed the gqds to excel in its role as electron traps which is necessary in the suppression of surface carrier recombination the addition of gqds increased the photocatalytic efficiency because when bare m bm were used only 42 of rhb was decomposed in a 30 min window period compared to 90 when gqds were introduced fig 15 b similar observation was made for bpa where the addition of gqds resulted in decomposition efficiency that is 2 3 higher than that of the bare m bm fig 15 c the decomposition of other pollutants is illustrated in fig 15 d fig 15 provides evidence that the degradation efficiency of the gqds bm hybrid towards the tested pollutants is in the order phenol cip mb tc in the same vein lei et al 8 has studied the degradation of ibuprofen ibp using gqds agvo3 heterojunction so far literature is replete with evidence that shows that the addition of gqds in nanocomposites significantly enhances the photoactivity of the resulting nanocomposites for example the photoactivity of gqds agvo3 heterojunction was found to be higher than that of pure agvo3 nanoribbons fig 16 a the findings emanating from the study by lei et al 8 match what was observed by lim et al 151 that is once the gqds loading reaches a specific level the photoactivity becomes negatively affected in the work by lei et al 8 3 wt gqds agvo3 composite displayed a photodegradation rate exceeding 90 under 120 min the rate constants were calculated from the degradation plots of ln c c0 vs irradiation time and the photocatalytic efficiency of 3 wt gqd agvo3 composite was found to be about 5 times higher than that of the pure agvo3 nanoribbons fig 16 b the toc removal profile of ibp depicted in fig 16 c shows that when the sample had been irradiated for 60 min the toc reduction of ibp was above 80 further near complete mineralisation of ibp achieved after 180 min of irradiation the enhanced photocatalytic performance of the 3 wt gqd agvo3 was accredited to the efficient transfer of electrons in the conduction band of agvo3 nanoribbons to the gqds as well as the improved the interfacial contact between the agvo3 nanoribbons and gqds the composite proved to be photostable after 4 cycles and the degradation rate of ibp was maintained at 98 fig 16 d the improved photostability can also be attributed to the excellent separation of e h pairs of the gqds 217 2 1 3 removal of organic dyes admittedly a lot of researchers have in the past two decades focussed their efforts on the degradation of organic dyes 156 158 while it tempting to assume that work related to dyes have lost its significance and relevance the contrary is true this is largely because new and emerging industrial dyes continue to be released into the environment 159 further these dyes are resistive towards aerobic digestion processes used in conventional wastewater treatment plants 218 therefore this review seeks to highlight the role gqds play in the decomposition of these colourants table 2 presents a detailed summary of the application of gqds in environmental remediation a recent study on the deployment of gqds in photocatalytic environmental remediation i e the environmental degradation of methylene blue showed an enhanced photocatalytic efficiency of tio2 upon the introduction of gqds 7 an inexpensive wet chemical method involving the use of bird charcoal as a precursor was used to fabricate gqds the resultant gqds were coupled with tio2 to form tio2 gqds nanocomposites the gqds were loaded at different wt and the photocatalytic efficiency evaluated data presented in fig 17 a and b shows that the highest activity was recorded for 1 gqds tio2 while tio2 gqds nanocomposites with higher gqds loading resulted in reduced photocatalytic activity the authors attributed the reduced photocatalytic activity to the fact that the tio2 surface was masked by excess gqds nanoparticles therefore affecting the charge transfer from the tio2 catalyst to methylene blue dye 7 160 further increasing the concentration of gqds in the composite also increases the chances of aggregation of gqds thereby reducing the interaction between the surfaces of tio2 and gqds this ultimately results in failure to retard the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers in tio2 in contrast 1 gqds tio2 nanocomposite displayed the highest photocatalytic activity owing to the charge separation occurring at the gqds tio2 interface an illustration of the gqds tio2 heterojunctions is displayed in fig 17 c the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo of the gqds which is positioned slightly above the conduction band bottom 4 2 ev of anatase tio2 results in significant energy difference of 1 1 ev that is responsible for the electron transfer from the gqds conduction band to that of tio2 at the same time the generated h will bombard the valence band of the gqds to form a hole centre which results in the separation of the excited e h pairs thus improving the photocatalytic activity 7 160 similarly phophayu et al 153 have found that the introduction of gqds improved the degradation efficiency of the n gqds tio2 nanocomposite by up to 45 while also degrading methylene blue under visible irradiation introducing s n gqds resulted in the enhancement of the catalytic efficiency of the g c3n4 s n gqds composite thus resulting in 96 of rhodamine b being degraded within 90 min compared to the 76 degradation efficiency achieved with the pure g c3n4 the significant improvement in the photocatalytic efficiency in this nanocomposite emanates from the efficient separation of the photogenerated e h resulting from combining s n gqds and g c3n4 it is worth noting that the photocatalyst remained stable with no reduced photocatalytic activity after nine degradation cycles 6 liu et al 72 73 have synthesized gqds mpg c3n4 composites by utilising electrostatic attraction the effect of the composition of gqds on degradation of rhb dye was evaluated the highest rhb dye removal was recorded at 97 using 0 5 wt gqds mpg c3n4 therefore introducing gqds as electron acceptors enhanced the photocatalytic activity of the nanocomposite recently gqds functionalized with poly 2 methacryloyloxy ethyl trimethylammonium co 3 sulfopropylmethacrylate mps were covalently immobilized in hydrogels at varying gqd loading and hydrogel volume 143 the resultant goqd a50cos50 composite hydrogels was found to possess remarkable peroxidase mimetic activity which was demonstrated by the oxidation 3 3 5 5 tetramethylbenzidine tmb in the presence of h2o2 the composite hydrogels were able to degrade 45 of the rhb dye after 6 h in the darkness the photocatalytic efficiency was significantly increased to 92 in the presence of light the effects of different goqd mps loading on the goqd a50cos50 hydrogels were evaluated an increase in the photocatalytic activity of the neat and composite hydrogels was observed when 2 5 goqd mps was used however no further increment was observed when the loading was increased to 2 5 the authors attributed the increase in the photocatalytic activity to the high rhb accessibility of active catalytic sites in the hydrogel basically by increasing the hydrogel volume that is in contact with the solution enhanced the activity interestingly the photodegradation activity of the hydrogels was still stable even after several months of wet storage and after drying and rehydration tshangana et al 9 10 studied the effect of shape of the zno nanoflakes and nanorods when conjugated to in the degradation of brilliant black dye as a model experiment 9 10 the covalent linkage of the gqds to zno nanoflakes and nanorods was reported to improve the activity of zno nfs or zno nrs by a delaying the rate of recombination of e h pairs because the gqds act as barriers which allowing them to remain active longer and b the enablement to harness sunlight better as a result of the π π transition of gqds it was evident from the results that zno nfs gqds performed better yielding a 80 degradation efficiency compared to than zno nrs gqds that only yielded 18 the larger surface area of the zno nfs gqds was attributed to the enhanced performance as it allowed more absorption of the solar energy black tio2 n doped gqds btng nanocomposite photocatalysts were used in the treatment of industrial sewage wastewater under natural light and the photocatalyst was able to degrade 15 other organic compounds while degrading rhb 161 the photocatalytic performance of pristine tio2 btio2 and btng at varying wt gqds loading towards the degradation of rhb was evaluated fig 18 a pristine tio2 degraded 22 of rhb after 5 min b tio2 nanoparticles degraded 52 of the same dye and the addition of 0 5 wt gqds in the btng nanocomposite yielded 100 decomposition of the dye further the photocatalytic degradation performance of the btng composite was tested against methyl orange mo bromophenol blue bpb phenolphthalein pph fluorescein flu methyl red mr methylene blue mb phenol phe nitrobenzene nbe methylbenzene mbe chlorobenzene chb formaldehyde fd dimethyl o phthalate dop aniline ani and acrylonitrile can all the k values obtained were found to be larger than 0 68 min 1 thus providing evidence of an efficient and durable photocatalyst fig 18 d the value of k for the btng composite was ten times larger than that of b tio2 and significantly higher than most reported catalysts under the same conditions fig 18 c 14 15 90 93 162 reusability and stability tests of the btng photocatalyst were carried out interestingly the btng composite remained effective as a visible light photocatalyst with no obvious deactivation after 15 cycles after 30 cycles the apparent k values remained at 95 of the initial value see fig 18 b the total organic carbon toc of the sewage sample was 370 mg l and was reduced to 57 mg l after purification the values of the toc of the sewage samples are reported in fig 18 e 2 2 gqds in polymer composites mixed matrix nanocomposite membranes mmnms are produced by incorporating engineered nanoparticles enps in the case of this review gqds into the polymer matrix using one of the following techniques electrospinning interfacial polymerization ip physical coating phase inversion self assembly or via layer by layer assembly fig 19 22 101 144 145 178 179 gqds offer better properties that are suitable for water treatment applications such as low cost fast adsorption kinetics increases surface area coupled with thermal mechanical and chemical stability 171 180 181 the incorporation of carbon nanoparticles into polymeric membrane matrix improves the water flux and permeability while reducing the fouling 182 emerging pollutants are removed using nanocomposite membranes in one of three ways adsorption electrostatic repulsion or sieving 183 the gqds add another dimension of imparting antimicrobial properties to the mmnms the removal efficiency of the composite membrane depends on a membrane functioning properties such as transmembrane pressure and water flux b membrane characteristics including the size of the pores size surface charge and hydrophobicity and c the emerging physico chemical features of the pollutant e g polarity charge size and solvency 184 in the next section two of the applications of gqd nanocomposite membranes and their role in antifouling and rejection of organic dyes are discussed 2 2 1 dye rejection in a recent study gqds were used as hydrophilic nanofillers for the enhancement of polyvinyl chloride pvc based membranes the membranes were fabricated using phase inversion filtration results with reactive blue 19 dye rb 19 suggest that various membranes with different gqds loadings 0 05 2 wt had a rejection rate that is higher than 95 the gqds with a loading of 2 wt showed the highest rejection percentage of 97 6 13 in a study undertaken by bi et al 186 introducing gqds via in situ interfacial polymerization with trimesoyl chloride tmc gave rise to membranes that had pore sizes estimated between 1 2 and 1 72 nm and the rejection rate of 92 9 and 98 8 was obtained for alcian blue and congo red respectively interestingly when electrospun gqds polymer films were used for the photodegradation of rhodamine b 97 of the solution was degraded after 210 min such a high photodegradation rate is attributable to the broad optical response range under white light 187 a thin film nanocomposite tfn produced by interfacial polymerization reaction had a rejection rate of 99 8 and 97 6 for congo red and methylene blue respectively the resultant tfn was obtained by reacting gqds with tannic acid ta fabricated by interfacial polymerization reaction 90 93 a physically bound coating of gqds on the tfn polyamide nanofiltration nf membrane was used in the separation of methylene blue and methyl orange dyes 174 175 the addition of gqds coating altered the surface properties resulting in enhanced properties such as the improvement of surface roughness surface hydrophilicity as well as the electronegativity from fig 20 it can be observed that the steady water flux of methylene blue solution decreased from 83 3 lmh to 75 4 lmh when a gqds coated membrane was used similarly a decrease in the dye rejection was observed from 75 4 to 71 0 fig 20 b in contrast for the methyl orange solution there was an increment in the water flux from 106 8 to 124 4 lmh accompanied by a similar trend in dye rejection increasing from 89 2 to 97 0 fig 20 a zhao et al 174 175 ascribed these results to the differences in electrostatic attraction the negatively charged surface of the selective layer on nf membranes allowed the positively charged mb solution to absorb on the membrane surface yielding a decreased steady flux the addition of the gqds coating further decreased the water flux and dye rejection for the negatively charged methyl orange the repulsive interactions yielded poor dye adsorption on the surface of the membrane this led to increased equilibrium water flux and aided in the repulsion of dye molecules thus enhancing the dye rejection pictures of the membranes were taken after dye rejection fig 20 c and d and the nf was fouled by mb the fouling was significantly decreased when the gqds were added however no significant adsorption of methyl orange on the nf surfaces was observed this indicates that the gqds coating can also be used in antifouling applications 2 2 2 antifouling and antimicrobial properties the biggest limitation associated with membrane processes is fouling in pressure driven membranes this tends to increase the energy consumption operating and maintenance costs resulting from premature membrane replacement permeate quality deterioration service time and results in limited recoveries 188 in cases where a biofilm fouling layer caused by a growth of pathogens is formed on the surface of a membrane gqds have been previously added into the polymers due to their excellent antimicrobial properties which stem from their ability to physical pierce bacterial cells and also induce oxidative stress the incorporation of gqds contributed to an improvement of the dispersibility charge transfer and other properties that are important in the generation of reactive oxygen species ros 115 feedwater containing e coli was used in in a filtration study by zeng et al 189 wherein they established that gqds covalently linked to amino functionalized pvdf resulted in the significant inactivation of e coli and s aureus cells compared to 1d swcnts and 2d go sheets tshangana et al 9 10 have also reported on the fabrication of gqds polyether sulfone electrospun membranes and tested the performance of the membrane on e coli s aureus and b cereus using disc diffusion method the zones of inhibition ranged from 9 to 40 mm and the highest zones of inhibition corresponded to the highest loading of gqds at 10 wt further solidifying their role as biocidal agents polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf nf membranes embedded with gqds have been reported to reject more than 98 of bovine serum albumin bsa protein 13 in another investigation using e coli silver phosphate loaded gqds goqd ap were used as nanofillers in the fabrication of a tfn with antibacterial properties the resultant tfn goqd ap showed excellent bactericidal properties i e inactivation of e coli in the dark fig 21 i as well as in the light fig 21 ii 46 47 although very little work has been reported on gqds embedded in membranes several studies have investigated the antibacterial properties of gqds and gqds nanocomposite and each will be discussed in detail zno gqds synthesized via the hydrothermal method have an enhanced antibacterial activity against e coli 105 106 according to the shown images of e coli colonies fig 22 a to h bacterial colonies were significantly reduced after being exposed to uv after 5 min of irradiation the zno gqds composite inactivated 100 of the bacterial cells a comparative analysis of the survival rates of the cells is depicted in fig 22 g it is evident from fig 22 g that the addition of gqds to the zno gqds resulted in a drastic enhancement of bacterial cell inhibition the inhibition was as a result of the interfacial electron transfer from gqds to zno in another study where zno was also used as a photocatalyst gqds were covalently linked to zno nanorods and nanoflakes 9 10 the resultant zno nrs gqds and zno nfs gqds were tested against e coli p aeruginosa b cereus and s aureus the zones of inhibition were measured as shown in fig 22 h zno nrs nanohybrids had an enhanced antimicrobial activity and this was corroborated by the proposed antimicrobial mechanism the zno nrs gqds nanohybrids allowed better internalisation the maximum measured zone of inhibition was as follows for zno nrs gqds against s aureus 40 mm 2 mm zno nrs gqds for e coli 37 mm 2 mm however the least inhibition was observed in the pristine zno nfs when tested against e coli was 11 mm 2 mm elsewhere zhang et al 187 conjugated agnps to gqds and the resultant hybrid gqds agnps was applied simultaneously in pdt photodynamic therapy and bacterial pdt with s aureus and e coli being used as model microorganisms results emanating from this investigation showed that the hybrid gqds agnps significantly increased the ros production by the bare gqds and further enhanced the stability of agnps the changes in morphology of e coli and s aureus before and after exposure to gqds agnps hybrids at 450 nm light are depicted in fig 23 the untreated cells of e coli and s aureus fig 23 a and c showed cell walls that are intact and have a smooth surface after being exposed to 1 0 mg ml of gqds agnps and light illumination conditions for 10 min before incubating the cell wall of the e coli was visibly wrinkled and eventually collapsed fig 23 b similarly the treated s aureus had a rough surface with cytoplasmic leakage of contents owing to the collapsed cellular wall structure zhang et al 187 ascribed the bacterial inactivation to the synergistic effect between the toxic nature of ag in agnps and the enhanced photodynamic and photothermal antibacterial effects of gqds agnps hybrid recently polyethylenimine pei modified gqds and zno were fabricated using a sol gel method 190 to evaluate their antimicrobial activity the resultant zno gqds pei and zno gqds nanocomposites were tested against e coli 190 both zno gqds pei and zno gqds nanocomposites inhibited over 80 of the e coli interestingly to achieve a bacterial inhibition rate of 80 the concentration of zno gqds pei nanocomposite needed to be 0 9 mg ml mic of ca 2 7 mg ml compared to the 1 6 mg ml required for the zno gqd nanocomposite incorporating the pei capping layer enhanced the dispersing capabilities of the zno gqd pei nanocomposites and this facilitated the interactions with e coli thus increasing the bacterial inactivation properties in the pei capped nanocomposite compared to the ones without pei further the effects of pei loadings on the antibacterial activity of zno gqd pei nanocomposites were investigated from the results it was clear that surface modification of zno with cationic pei polymers significantly enhanced the antibacterial activity of zno gqd pei data showed that the zno gqd pei 6 had the highest antibacterial activity this antibacterial activity was attributed to the significant difference of the zeta potentials of 16 67 mv and 25 7 mv for the zno gqd pei 6 nanocomposite and e coli respectively this resulted in an increased stronger absorption of the zno gqd pei 6 onto the e coli 2 3 adsorption adsorption process is a phenomenon where specific components accumulate at the interface of two phases via a mass transfer mechanism typically an adsorbate is the compound that increases its concentration on the surface while adsorbent is the adsorbing surface 191 several factors influence the adsorption process such as the nature concentration and surface area of the adsorbent in addition experimental variables such as ph temperature time of contact and the presence of other contaminants also play a critical role one of the greatest advantages of adsorption lies in its simple structure and operating conditions which do not generate toxic by products therefore to date activated carbon has been the most widely used adsorbent however due the cost of production and regeneration efforts are now directed on finding alternative adsorbents 192 219 in the subsections that follow focus is placed on gqds or gqds nanocomposite used as adsorbents in the adsorption of pharmaceuticals pesticides heavy metals and dyes 2 3 1 gqds or gqds nanocomposites as adsorbents in the removal of pesticides and pharmaceuticals gqds were deployed as adsorbents in the removal of a noxious oxamyl compound 193 the results showed that adsorption was better and more efficient at higher ph ph 8 and when the optimum adsorbent dose was 0 6 g and contact time was less than 25 min the authors found that the nature of this adsorbent fast adsorption and settling of gqds ideal in continuous flow water treatment systems 193 in another study graphene oxide dots gods were used as a coat for two biomatrices in the removal of ranitidine carbamazepine chlorothiazide and prednisolone 220 in this work chitin flask and lignocellulosic jute powder were specifically chosen as biomatrices of choice the four pharmaceuticals were used as model pollutants to get an understanding of their removal efficacy by employing god coated adsorbents fig 24 a shows that all the four drugs could be removed using alkali treated jute god jute biochar alkali treated chitin and god coated chitin used in this study interestingly in both biomatrices the god coated adsorbents had enhanced adsorption capability compared to their corresponding untreated adsorbents 2 3 2 gqds nanocomposites as adsorbents in the removal of dyes the gods coated biomatrices prepared by manna et al 2018 were used in the removal of azo dyes methylene blue dymerin yellow and orange g from the results shown in fig 24 b it is evident that the gods coated biomatrices in all the cases possess far better removal and capturing capabilities of all the adsorbents tested the gods coated chitin was found to possess the best separation properties the results obtained indicate that the gods enhanced the removal capacity by up to 2 3 times more than the uncoated biomatrix 220 in another study a tri nanostructural assembly go fe3o4 gqd hydrogel was designed via the hcl etoh method and used in the removal of cationic pollutants mb rhb the pva cmc b go fe3o4 gqd l nanocomposite hydrogel significantly enhanced the adsorption of the dye the enhancement in the adsorption characteristics emanates from the unique layout of the go gqds and fe3o4 on the sheet the presence of gqds resulted in the surface area being increased as well as the accessibility of oxygen containing groups appears to be the most likely the reason behind improved removal efficiency in addition the positively charged dye molecules may experience hydrogen bonding electrostatic interactions and π π interaction with the gqds and go of the go fe3o4 gqd together with the oh cooh functional groups of the pva cmc b the adsorption followed a langmuir adsorption isotherm the gqds modified graphene synthesized by ying et al 194 was applied in adsorption as well as the separation of a mixture of aromatic dyes from water the modification with gqds significantly improved the stability of gqds in aqueous solution the results showed that graphene that was not modified sunk within an hour of adsorption and after 24 h there was complete precipitation conversely the gqds modified graphene showed no precipitation and remained stable for several months further the gqds modification significantly enhanced the adsorption capacity the rhb adsorption capacity was increased to 497 mg g 1 when compared with the unmodified graphene this enhanced adsorption capacity was ascribed to the accessible surface area the strong π π interactions as well as the anion cation interactions that occur between graphene and the rhb molecule further the adsorption behaviour was evaluated using other water soluble dyes rose bengal rb evans blue eb and methyl orange mo these dyes have different charge properties and structures the adsorption mechanism indicated that electrostatic interaction and π π interactions equally contributed to the adsorption of dyes de la luz asunción et al 11 evaluated the adsorption capacities of reactive red 2 rr2 dye on go and gqds at ph 2 and 5 while go and gqds are similar in structure sp2 hybridization they differ in dimensions and hence the adsorption capabilities are expected to be different results showed that the size of the adsorbents played a role in the removal of rr2 as a result of a larger surface area interestingly for the gqds modified adsorbent the adsorption of the sample continued even after 8 h due to a higher number of active sites present for adsorption the proposed adsorption mechanism between the dye and the go and gqds is illustrated in fig 24 c electrostatic interactions π π interactions as well hydrogen bonding are the chief parameters in the mechanism electrostatic interactions arise from the difference in the surface charges between the dye molecules and the go and gqds the π π interactions result from the interaction between the π electrons of rr2 and the graphitic structure of go and gqds hydrogen bonding emanates from the interaction of the hydrogen atoms present in the go and gqds as well as the n and o atoms in the rr2 dye 2 3 3 gqds nanocomposites as adsorbents in the removal of heavy metals gqds adsorbents were used to eliminate cadmium ii in synthetic wastewater 195 the optimum conditions for the efficient removal of cadmium ii were as follows initial concentration 20 mg ml contact time 30 and ph 7 an optimum adsorption capacity of 40 00 mg g was recorded an inexpensive adsorbent using gqds coated on quartz sand qs was developed for eliminating of hg2 and pb2 in aqueous solutions 196 the choice to coat gqds on solids silica magnetic materials quartz sand and polymers circumvents the drawbacks of using extremely small sized gqds as adsorbents 197 198 extremely small sized gqds are difficult to collect after adsorption and the process is equally time consuming 198 the optimal elimination percentages of hg2 and pb2 using 0 2 g gqds qs adsorbent were found to be 98 6 and 99 7 respectively 196 the pristine qs 0 2 g only achieved removal percentage efficiencies of 5 5 and 7 4 for the hg2 and pb2 respectively the authors attributed the enhanced elimination efficiency of the gqds qs to the increased surface area and subsequent increase in the number of active sites being present which allows the adsorbing ions to attach better on the gqds qs surface 199 further the novel gqds qs adsorbent is economically viable because of the availability and low cost of qs in another study gqds were covalently anchored onto the external layer of magnetic nife2o4 halloysite nanotubes nife2o4 hnts and the resultant nife2o4 hnts gqds composite was used in the elimination of pb2 from water 200 the synergistic impact of ph and contact time on the pb2 elimination was evaluated increasing contact time at constant ph resulted in an increase in the removal efficiency 92 6 of pb2 was removed in 54 min for ph at a constant composite concentration of 50 mg l the elimination efficiency increased until the ph reached 6 concentrations of the composite exceeding 50 mg l reduced the accessibility of the active sites needed for the interaction with the adsorbent to occur it was further noted in addition increasing the amount of nife2o4 hnts gqds at any specified ph also enhanced the elimination efficiency of pb2 the elimination efficiency was further enhanced by increasing the amount of nife2o4 hnts gqds and contact time this was ascribed to the high specified area of the nife2o4 hnts gqds that provided more accessible adsorptive sites 200 mechanistically the adsorption performance was attributed to the complexation interaction occurring between the pb2 ions and the functional moiety a study was conducted in which sustainable precursor materials such as rice husk a by product of the rice milling process was used to synthesize gqds 12 further modification of the rice husk based gqds with barium hydroxide led to the isolation of the gqdos ba nanobiosorbent which was used in the microwave enhanced removal of pb2 and la3 from water 12 the effect of gqdos ba nanobiosorbent dosage on the removal efficiency of the pb2 or la3 ions was evaluated by adding different dosages of gqdos ba 10 50 mg to 1 ml of 0 1 m solutions of pb2 or la3 results show that increasing the dosage of the nanobiosorbent enhanced the removal efficiency of both pb2 and la3 ions the authors are of the view that the correlation between the dosage of the nanobiosorbent and its removal efficiency is due to the increased active sites and the accessibility of commutable sites for the ions 12 the recovery of the gqdos ba nanobiosorbent and its ability to remove pb2 and la3 ions was evaluated in two types of water matrices namely tap water and industrial wastewater the removal efficiency by microwave extraction of pb2 from tap water and industrial wastewater sample were found to be 99 8 and 98 5 respectively for the la3 ion respective removal efficiencies of 96 2 and 94 6 were achieved in another study cr6 was removed from contaminated water using functional ionic liquid il capped gqds 201 ionic liquids are efficient eco friendly solvents that have been used in liquid liquid extraction as well as adsorbing heavy metals owing to their ease of operation tunability and the strong electrostatic characteristics that arise due to polar functional groups 202 203 despite these advantages it is difficult to recover the solvent use or avoid losing the il after use hence the covalent linking of gqds to il to produce il gqds adsorbent with enhanced stability compared to a number of commonly used adsorbents the il gqd adsorbent demonstrated an excellent cr6 adsorption capacity at 934 62 mg g the effect of competing ions on the cr6 adsorption was evaluated in the presence various cations and anions the results presented in fig 25 a indicate that cations did not affect the cr6 adsorption this could be as a result of the adsorption process taking place in a neutral ph solution that is at ph 7 the il gqd adsorbent becomes protonated and this result in repulsive forces being formed between the positively charged surface and other competing cations however cl so4 2 and no3 had a slight negative impact of the cr6 adsorption while il gqd adsorbent demonstrated significantly higher adsorption capabilities compared to the individual adsorbents of gqd il go and go regeneration studies were carried out using a basic medium as an eluting solution fig 25 b the results demonstrated that each of the adsorbents i e go il go gqd and il gqd could be used successfully while maintaining a removal efficiency rate exceeding 80 for up to 5 cycles this type of performance augurs well for the cost of the adsorbents a proposed removal pathway of cr6 is shown in fig 25 c the authors postulate that the il will induce the gqd of imidazolium il amide linkages and hydroxyl functionalities the protonated chain of amine group will then arrange itself with the alkyl moieties that are in the opposite direction and this facilitates the nh moieties to electrostatically interact with hexavalent chromium oxyanion in neutral to low ph the il gqd adsorbent acquires positive charges as a result of the protonated ionic liquid moieties amide linkages and some of the carboxylic groups that have yet reacted the rate of adsorption was enhanced due to excellent electrostatic synergy existing between the oxonium functional group from cr6 and the il gqd 2 4 other methods gqds have also been deployed as solid phase microextraction spme sorbents akbarzade et al 204 developed a magnetic dispersive solid phase microextraction coupled with gc ms and used to preconcentrate and determine five organophosphorus pesticides opps i e sevin fenitrothion malathion parathion and diazinon in real water in this study zero valent fe reduced gqds were used as spme sorbents to extract the opps 204 the efficiency of the rgoqds fe sorbent was investigated against that of magnetic graphene oxide m go and go the results showed that compared to the other two sorbents the rgoqds fe sorbent was highly effective in the extraction of opps the high extraction efficiency can be ascribed to the structure that is not polar as well as the limited number of polar functional moieties found in the analytes of interest especially in the case of malathion it is interesting to note that extraction efficiency was found to be inversely proportional to the number of polar functional moieties such as the carboxyl ethereal and hydroxyl groups occurring on the surface of the sorbent other applications of the gqds have been reported in literature including potential applications in biological and sensing applications for neurotransmitter determination 205 and bioimaging applications 206 due to their ultra small size non toxicity biocompatibility excellent photo stability tunable fluorescence and water solubility 3 conclusion and outlook graphene oxide quantum dots offer a possible solution for tackling emerging pollutants that make their way into drinking water sources treatments plants are supposed to use technologies that are economical sustainable and environmentally friendly all of these characteristics fit gqds perfectly gqds accessed via an array of synthetic strategies and the most used are carbonization and the hydrothermal methods modulation of the surface of gqds conjugation to other nanoparticles and incorporation of gqds into nanoparticles to produce nanocomposites result in the enhancement of the properties of gqds the use of gqds in aops has led to the successful degradation of dyes pesticides pharmaceuticals the degradation process proceeds via a hydroxyl free radical mechanism in which the free radicals react with the complex organic and inorganic compounds to produce less complex and less harmful compounds in a real wastewater plant this minimises sludge formation and such a system would result in a faster wastewater treatment process in some instances additional processes such filtration with membranes may be necessary to improve the results achieved with aops gqds have also been used in membrane technology either by being embedded or covalently linked to polymers incorporation of gqds into the membrane matrix improves the efficiency of the treatment of dyes the membrane characteristics and their antimicrobial properties the antimicrobial properties of gqds could be exploited further in the disinfection of wastewater as an alternative step to chlorination this is mainly because gqds do not produce any toxic transformation by products compared to chlorination which in some instances generates haloacetic acids or trihalomethanes gqds have also been evaluated in the adsorption of heavy metals in wastewater the current challenges limiting the deployment of gqds are that low cost mass production and purification of gqds have not yet been realised further a lack of industry scale methods capable of yielding gqds that are uniform in size and functionality remains a challenge should these limitations be tackled the use of gqds in the treatment of wastewater will be fully realised declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there is no conflict of interest acknowledgements we gratefully

13366,water pollution mainly occurring from manufacturing industries has been a serious environmental issue in the contemporary world dyeing processes produce a massive amount of dye contaminated effluent it is a major culprit for water and soil pollution in developing and underdeveloped countries the azo dye released from industries poses a severe environmental menace by contaminating the aquatic system and adversely impacting human health azo dyes are synthetic macromolecules which are persistent recalcitrant and non biodegradable several physicochemical technologies have been proposed for azo dye mitigation still some limitations are observed such as high operational cost and energy requirement complicated procedures incomplete mineralization and secondary waste generation alternately remediation by microbes is considered a clean effective and safe technology to detoxify azo dyes from wastewater the biological treatment can exploit fungi yeast bacteria and algae which have received attentiveness because of their eco friendliness this review highlights the decolorization and degradation of dyes by various microbes acting as biological tools against azo dyes it also discusses the azo dye degradation mechanism and factors affecting the degradations graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords water pollution microbes azo dyes degradation activity degradation mechanism microbial biomass 1 introduction water is an essential component of life as it is required for our various vital activities it also plays a crucial role in the growth of agriculture and the industrial sector the potable water sources are getting meager day by day due to the increase in population urbanization and industrialization excessive exploitation and contamination of water resources are contemporary environmental issues 1 water pollution may cause direct or indirect health risks to live organisms on earth that are adversely affected by the environment dyes have been utilized in plastic printing pharmaceutical food cosmetic photography and leather industries 2 6 more than ten thousand dyes are commercially available and approximately 7 million metric tons of dye are produced per year 7 the dye market was 33 billion usd in 2019 and is expected to reach around 49 billion usd by 2027 8 textile industries utilize a large quantity of fresh water in the dyeing process of textiles and release contaminated wastewater 9 10 the production of 8000 kg of fabric requires approximately 2 million l of water 11 different types of dye molecules bind with the fabric in different proportions it was reported that 2 50 of pigments 12 had been discharged as effluent during processing polluting nearby soil and water bodies presented in table 1 production of reactive oxygen species has been reported in plants due to the presence of toxic pollutants in water or soil 13 the world bank study found that 17 20 of contaminated wastewater comes from the textile dyeing industry 14 dyes have a high water solubilizing ability making it difficult to extract those using traditional methods 15 16 the release of the untreated effluents overloaded with colors into water bodies is eco destructive 17 organic solvents are used in the dye production process which chelates with metals and releases wastewater with acids alkali salts and nitro compounds 18 the presence of pigment as low as 1 0 mg l resulted in color as a visible contaminant in water the presence of color in effluent indicates that untreated or poorly treated effluent has been discharged in water channels 19 20 dyes are an integral part of human life they are present in household utensils furniture painted wall and various colored foods at the beginning of civilizations the colors were extracted from the natural sources either from plants such as weld madder indigo beetroot red betanin dyer s broom genista tinctorial l cornflower centaurea cyanus l deptford pink dianthus armeria l indian pokeweed phytolacca acinosa roxburgh rose marigold flowers etc or animal sources such as cochineal shellfish sawfly larva snout caterpillar etc with the progress of industrial and knowledge based society the chemicals behind the color were identified further progress in synthetic dyes enables the researchers to identify the functional groups in the molecules responsible for absorbing the electromagnetic energy in the visible range 400 800 nm consequently color appears two types of organic functional groups are found in the dye molecules namely chromophores and auxochromes fig 1 chromophores impart different colors through delocalized pi electron systems with conjugated double bonds and auxochromes intensifying the colors in the dye molecules through electron withdrawing or electron donating groups synthetic dyes can be classified into two broad categories non azo dyes and azo dyes that can be further classified as shown in fig 2 based on chemical behavior chemical constituents and applications almost 3000 different combinations of azo dyes are synthesizing for industrial applications worldwide it can be mono azo di azo tri azo or poly azo compounds the mono azo dyes are mostly used in the dying of different substances azo dyes contain amine diazotized in combination with amine or phenol and azo groups nn 21 22 approximately 80 of dyestuffs are made up of azo dyes 23 azo groups are found in dyes which can absorb light and they may be altered with chloro nitro amino hydroxyl and carboxyl groups 24 the chromophoric azo groups undergo reductive cleavage and form highly toxic aromatic amines due to electron withdrawing groups in azo dyes biodegradation is difficult 25 azo dyes are widely used because of their simple and cost effective synthesis stability long shelf life and availability of various colors compared to natural dyes 26 27 thus azo dye produces an adverse impact by increasing the water pollution indicators such as toc bod and cod 28 moreover the breakdown of azo dyes produces different toxic carcinogenic and mutagenic compounds due to its toxicity european union has prohibited using azo dyes 26 the disposal of untreated textile dye effluent in water resources degraded surface water quality and adversely impacted the environment and human health 29 30 lellis et al 31 investigated the harmful effect of azo dye on soil microbial population affecting germination and plant growth synthetic dyes and their intermediary compounds are carcinogenic leading to health hazards in humans and animals 32 ali 33 stated that azo dye showed its linkage with many types of cancers in the bladder spleen liver and chromosomal abnormalities in human bodies researchers have reported that azo dyes can easily attach to dna molecules 34 the disperse red 1 dye is widely utilized for dyeing showing mutagenic effects 35 the basic red 9 dye used in textile paper and ink production shows toxic impacts on the environment and carcinogenic potential in humans 36 crystal violet dye irritates the skin and digestive tract chemical cystitis and respiratory and renal system failure in humans 37 the azure b dye can easily insinuate nucleic acids such as dna 38 and rna 39 due to these detrimental impacts on the environment and threats to human life removing azo dyes from wastewater is essential the researcher s concern for azo dye mitigation is evident from the number of publications on azo dye degradation per year as shown in fig 3 past 40 years survey on microbial degradation of azo dye showed 523 documents in scopus com out of which 80 421 publications were reported after 2010 data analysis on the literature survey shown that 492 research papers 21 review articles and 20 conference papers were published during this period due to scientific publications public awareness of the toxic effects of dyes and their repercussions on the environment and human health has been increased 40 the regulations by government agencies are compelling industries for the proper treatment of effluents before their release into the environment hence there is an urgent requirement to develop treatment strategies to ensure the sustainability of our environment for upcoming generations 41 several conventional methods were used for dye removal from industrial effluents but bioremediation has been found the most sustainable solution biotechnological procedures can progressively enhance biotreatment through the production of more resistant microbes with high dye degrading ability to the best of our knowledge no review has been compiled on the research findings of the last forty years on the use of microorganisms and modified microorganisms biomass in the decolorization and degradation of azo dyes the azo dye degradation mechanism and factors affecting the microorganism efficiency 2 microorganisms involved in decolorization and degradation of azo dyes the application of microorganisms over physico chemical approaches for dye degradation is accredited due to their environmental benefits such as clean green cost effective and sustainable solutions for the treatment of contaminated effluents with no production of toxic by products as less sludge generation 42 43 2 1 fungi fungi can be considered as either a bio sorbent or bio degrader for dyes they have merits as bio adsorbents because of availability in large quantities of fungi biomass cost effectiveness good mechanical strength and chemical stability in acidic and alkaline conditions the macrofungi have a rigid structure with physical characteristics which enhances biosorption properties the adsorption capacity of fungi increased with the rise of temperature and reaction kinetics of the dye decolorization was inhibited with increasing temperature due to deactivation of the adsorbent surface or a decrease in the number of active sites 44 cunninghamella elegans 45 and trametes versicolor 46 were found efficient in dye removal in comparison to activated carbon also various fungal species can participate in decolorization and degradation as shown in table 2 the filamentous fungi produce phenoloxidase and peroxidase that can degrade azo dyes 47 the fungal mycelia have the edge over unicellular organisms as they solubilize the insoluble substrate by enzymetic action 48 other fungal species like aspergillus ochraceus trametes versicolor pleurotus bjerkandera adusta and phlebia have also received considerable recognition for dye biodegradation the use of fungi for dye decolorization is a desirable approach due to the low cost safe and complete mineralization of dye 49 however the long hydraulic retention time and preservation of fungi in bioreactors for complete decolorization restricts its utilization in the decolorization system 50 2 2 yeast yeast can be used for the decolorization of azo dyes similar to fungi yeasts grow as fast as bacteria and can survive under extreme environmental conditions the de coloration of azo dye through yeast involves both adsorption and enzymatic degradation 69 the genus candida is utilized in dye de coloration via biosorption or biodegradation mechanism or bio augmentation 70 as per table 3 yeast species such as trichosporon beigelii saccharomyces cerevisiae and galactomyces geotrichum can uptake high dye concentrations as bio adsorbents candida tropicalis adsorbed 94 of remazol blue and 44 reactive red 71 while trichosporon akiyoshidainum adsorbed 63 reactive blue and 90 of reactive red dye 72 degradation of dye is related to the growth and metabolism of yeast 73 74 yeast cells require a carbon source of glucose for dye degradation azo dye incites oxidases and reductases production and nadh dcip reductase by yeast 75 2 3 algae the use of algae for effluent treatment has been receiving attention due to cost effective and feasible cultivation at a large scale algae are photosynthetic organisms as they can survive in different habitats interestingly the water bodies contaminated by dyes adversely affect aquatic life and do not inhibit algal growth the mass cultivation of algae is cost effective as they derive energy from sunlight and synthesize food algal cells both live and dead can be used for dye removal or biosorption 85 azoreductase present in algae degrades azo dyes with the production of aromatic amines 86 algae can degrade different dyes these dyes are summarized in table 4 the degradation performances depend on the algal species and structure of dye molecules 87 2 4 bacteria bacteria are commonly included in industrial wastewater treatment as they can adapt to diverse environmental conditions under different oxygen ph or temperature ranges decolorization by bacteria is estimated to be faster than fungi 94 carvalho et al 95 reported aromatic amines formed by bacteria under anaerobic conditions as mentioned above azo dyes are resistant to bacterial attack in the presence of oxygen nevertheless some aerobic bacteria can reduce azo bonds with azoreductases 96 for example micrococcus species decolorized reactive dyes in 24 h in the absence of oxygen but in an aerobic environment the de coloration period was decreased to 6 h 97 grekova vasileva et al 98 revealed complete degradation of amaranth dye lg1 by pseudomonas isolated from the wastewater treatment system the bacterial isolate geobacillus stearothemophilus 99 pseudomonas luteola 96 and sphingomonas paucimobilis 100 decolorized azo dyes up to 90 the shewanella species remove 98 of acid orange 7 with an 80 reduction in cod in membrane aerated biofilm reactor whereas only 58 of the cod was eliminated by conventional anaerobic aerobic process 34 azoreductase was isolated from bacillus badius which was able to degrade azo dyes due to their thermal stability the high mineralization of dyes can result from bacterial degradation 101 in table 5 halomonas application also shows promising results of azo dye degradation 102 2 5 mixed microbial culture consortium the complete degradation of complex dye molecules with a single microbe is impossible but a high mineralization rate can be achieved with the microbial consortium the mixed microbial population shows a high degree of dye decolorization and degradation compared to pure culture due to combined enzymatic reactions of microbes 14 individual strains in consortiums may attack dye molecules at different positions or use metabolites produced by co existing strains for further degradation 131 microbes may acclimatize themselves under toxic conditions and the natural development of new resistant strains converts more toxic chemicals into less harmful forms 132 some cultures can convert dye into intermediates that act as a redox mediator promote the transfer of reducing equivalents and increase the overall decolorization process it was observed that intermediates might reduce the redox potential of the medium which supports the reduction of azo linkage for degradation of azo dye 133 135 consortia can be composed of fungi yeast bacteria or their mixture and biodegradation of dyes can be increased due to their combined effects 136 fungi initiate the degradation of complex dye molecules and then bacteria are required for total organic carbon removal 56 the complete degradation of dye molecules is possible with the enzymatic reactions of microbial consortia 137 the pseudomonas sp suk1 decolorized azo dyes but lbc2 and lbc3 strains of pseudomonas sp could not however their consortia decolorized effluent more efficiently as compared to individual pseudomonas sp suk1 138 the consortia decolorized 99 of red he3b within 12 h whereas single bacteria took longer than 60 h for degradation of 85 89 red he3b 139 phugare et al 140 found that providencia species and pseudomonas aeruginosa consortia showed 97 red he3b de coloration in 1 h while the single strain took 5 48 h for dye decolorization reactive navy blue he2r was 78 decolorized by pseudomonas sp suk1 61 by aspergillus ochraceus ncim 1146 and a maximum of 92 were observed by consortia 141 for the formulation of consortia the proportion of individual microbes plays a vital role in azo dye treatment ayed et al 142 reported that 0 02 0 45 and 0 51 of sphingomonas paucimobilis bacillus species and staphylococcus epidermidis showed complete decolorization of congo red dye an equal fraction of bacillus cereus pseudomonas fluorescens pseudomonas putida and stenotrophomonas acidaminiphila taken from effluent showed a three fold increase in de coloration capacity to other combinations of microbes 143 deive et al 144 exhibited that consortia isolated from high temperature regions caused 70 de coloration of reactive black 5 at 65 c within one day earlier workers have been used fungal bacterial co cultures to benefit from both microbes oxidoreductive enzymes 136 145 moosvi et al 133 identified micrococcus luteus micrococcus sp and paenibacillus polymyxa from a contaminated site that showed decolorization of nine dyes combination however the individual strain could not degrade dye table 6 the combinations of aspergillus and pseudomonas species detoxified rubine gfl dye in 30 h and degraded 98 reactive and disperse azo dye in 35 h 146 bacillus circulans pseudomonas aeruginosa and some unidentified isolates such as nad1 and nad6 consortia were utilized to degrade reactive black 5 147 the consortium decolorized 90 and 70 of 100 mg l and 1000 mg l reactive black 5 after 48 h exposure 2 6 genetically modified microbes synthetic azo dyes are resistant to natural degradation due to this their breakdown by conventional techniques is complex and time consuming despite many microbes available for bioremediation of textile wastewater all are not successfully degrading the dye molecules because some azo dye molecules can deactivate enzymes in microbes depending on wastewater conditions 155 hence there is a need for genetic modification of active microbes to increase the treatment stability and degradation rate genetically modified microbes can enhance dye degradation by applying genetic engineering techniques 156 azoreductase gene azok was isolated from a bacterium klebsiella pneumoniae and expressed in escherichia coli dh5α and recombinant e coli bl21 was utilized to degrade methyl orange dye 157 azoreductase obtained from enterococcus faecalis was expressed in e coli they showed a two to four fold increase in methyl red ponceau bs and orange ii degradation capacity compared to non induced cells 158 recombinant lac gene was synthesized from ganoderma lucidum and it was expressed in p pastoris which exhibited significant degradation of methyl orange 159 the lac like gene lac21 was expressed in e coli which showed dye degradation ability at ph 5 9 160 eslami et al 161 reported that azoreductase gene isolated from halomonas elongata was expressed in e coli dh5 and genetically modified e coli bl21 showed degradation of methyl red and remazol black b dye the azog gene was isolated from halomonas species strain gt and expressed in escherichia coli dh5α and recombinant e coli de3 successfully degraded azo dyes present in wastewater 162 ajaz et al 29 reported remazol red dye degradation in the presence of dissolved oxygen 0 8 mg l by azoreductase which was duplicated from bacillus latrosporus rrk1 and inserted in escherichia coli 3 immobilized microbial cells immobilization of microbes by entrapment or attachment methods has been utilized for dye degradation microbes get inserted in porous or fibrous material where they adhere to the surface the immobilized microbes showed higher stability than free cultures and those were resilient to alteration in temperature ph or exposure to toxic chemicals 163 instead of the microbial cells for immobilization enzymes can be immobilized for dye degradation processes enzyme immobilization is a well known technique and the immobilized enzyme is reusable through easier separation than free enzymes 164 in addition enzyme immobilization is reported as more environmentally friendly than other dye removal technologies 165 ma et al 166 introduced genipin activated chitosan beads as a highly stable laccase biocatalyst from trametes pubescens which showed 77 5 degradation of acid black 172 dye laccase from trametes versicolor was immobilized by preparing carbon nanotube nanocomposites degraded 96 congo red dye within 3 h 167 due to the high potential in the applicability of immobilized enzymes further research is required to establish the method 4 mechanism of biodegradation an aqueous solution of azo dyes can be degraded by enzymatic or electrochemical or photocatalytic or microbial or hyphenated methods 168 chemically reductive cleavage of nn bond is the beginning of the azo dye decolorization in all most all so far developed degradation processes the various methods designed to mitigate the azo dyes through complete degradation in wastewater such as electrochemical degradation anodic and cathodic process photocatalytic degradation by the use of metal and non metallic photocatalysts enzyme mediated degradation involves aerobic activated sludge treatment anoxic degradation and direct enzymatic reduction and anaerobic degradation chemical and redox mediated reduction processes microbial dye degradation involves the use of fungi bacteria algae or their consortia 4 1 enzyme mediated degradation of azo dye typically in an in vivo process the microorganism produces the azo dye degradable enzymes but for the higher concentration of azo dye degradation isolated enzymes were preferred for industrial azo dye degradation commercially available isolated enzymes are azo reductase laccase peroxidase oxidase enzymes etc these enzymes can function in both intracellular and extracellular routes of azo dye degradations 169 it can serve as substrate specific and quickly immobilized on a substrate enhancing the degradation efficiency precisely for the one type of substrate enzymes are self degradable in nature hence they did not create any environmental nausea the by products of the enzyme mediated degradation can be used as a media supplement for microbial culture growth 170 some enzymes function as substrate specific and some are not so their degradation mechanism also follows different routes direct enzyme degradation of dye is supported by the cofactors and redox active coenzyme intermediate such as flavin adenine dinucleotide hydrogen fadh nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen nadph and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrogen nadh these intermediates can help in transfer electrons from an enzyme e g azo reductase to azo dye due to electron transfer to the azo bonds nn in the dye molecules the bonds became weaker and subsequently broken to produce colorless odorless and toxic intermediate of aromatic amines further disintegration of aromatic amines in aerobic conditions produces small molecular weight compounds such as water carbon dioxide and ammonia 171 in brief most of the azo dye degradation starts with reducing double bonds in anaerobic conditions followed by the aerobic process for complete mineralization some auto oxidized by products of the toxic and carcinogenic aromatic compounds also formed during azo dye degradation as shown in fig 4 azo reductase and laccase are commonly used enzyme isolate in azo dye degradation the azo reductase enzyme can be found either in the cytoplasm or in the membrane the cytoplasmic azo reductase is inefficient in the degradation of sulfonated azo dye because of its complex chemical compositions and the poor diffusion ability of the cytoplasmic azo reductase in the cell membrane the water soluble cytoplasmic azo reductase enzymes frequently degrade non sulfonated azo dye molecules the mechanism of azo dye reduction through redox active intermediate dependent cytoplasmic bound and membrane bound azo reductase enzymes follows different routes 172 the azo dye degradation through azo reductase enzyme requires low molecular weight reducing equivalents redox active coenzyme intermediates such as fadh or nadh as the electron donor the chromophore group in azo dye nn cleaved by the transfer of electrons from the azo reductase enzyme as a reducing agent in an anaerobic process the red dye degradation through the azo reductase enzyme is shown in fig 5 the anaerobic process of azo dye degradation is more efficient than the aerobic process because the azo reductase enzyme is oxygen sensitive therefore redox active coenzyme intermediate was reduced in place of an azo dye when azo reductase encountered oxygen the membrane bound azo reductase uses redox active coenzymes e g fadh or nadh as electron shuttle during the anaerobic process in each stage of degradation two electrons were transferred to the azo dye molecules which function as an electron acceptor oxidizing agents and forming a colorless solution of toxic aromatic amines these amines can later mineralize through the aerobic or sometimes micro aerophilic processes 173 the laccase is an extracellular enzyme primarily produced from either fungal or plant culture very few laccases are produced from bacteria the fungal derived laccase is unstable at high temperatures and in an alkaline medium the degradation mechanism of laccase catalyzed dye follows different routes depending on the dye structure anthraquinone dyes are enzyme substrate for laccase therefore it is directly oxidized by the laccase enzyme at the same time non substrate dyes like azo and indigo dye involved some small molecule metabolites in mediating the interaction between the azo dyes and laccase enzyme the azo dye degradation through the laccase enzyme depends on the concentration of medium metabolites rather than enzyme activity in the solution some known mediating metabolites used in azo dye degradation through laccase enzyme are abts 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylthiazoline 6 sulfonate and anthraquinone dye laccase enzyme can be used against the wide range of aromatic and non aromatic azo dye molecules degradation through small molecule mediating metabolites 174 it degrades azo dyes through a highly nonspecific free radical mechanism to form phenolic compounds instead of toxic aromatic amines the degradation mechanism of red dye through the laccase enzyme is shown in fig 6 the laccase substrate oxidizes the phenolic group of the azo dye with the participation of one electron in the reaction chain generating the phenoxy radical the phenoxy radical subsequently oxidized to carbonium ion the nucleophilic attack by oh on carbonium ion of the azo linkage to produce 4 nitrohydrazine and 1 2 naphthaquinone the reaction mechanism suggested that oxygenated free radicals remove the n2 gas from the 4 nitrohydrazine and form nitrobenzene radicals which on acid and base hydrolysis formed nitrobenzene and nitrophenol 4 2 microbial strain modified degradations biological methods that combine anaerobic and aerobic processes have been extensively addressed for complete dye mineralization in wastewater treatment 175 microbes are superior dye degraders as they have a higher capacity to sustain under adverse circumstances due to the synthesis of various metabolites 176 dye degradation by microbes has edges over other techniques 1 being eco friendly 2 less water consumption 3 cost competitive and efficient 4 complete mineralization and 5 no waste production therefore the identification of potent microbes is the most critical variable for optimal treatment various microbes are capable of decolorizing dyes such as bacteria 127 177 fungi 178 microbial consortium and algae 89 91 the biological methods using microbes for dye removal can be a potentially viable option it is a low cost and sustainable wastewater treatment system for industries 48 a large number of microbes are available which can be easily maintained however biotreatment also has some drawbacks as it is a very slow process and its success depends only on optimal conditions microorganisms show a multifaceted ability for pollutant removal from wastewater through various biodegradation mechanisms 179 stated two possible biological processes of dye decolorization 1 biosorption of dyes on the microbes as bio adsorbents and 2 biodegradation of dyes by enzymes released by microbial activities microbes can be utilized in the removal of a broad range of azo dyes through bio adsorption and subsequent degradation by anaerobic and aerobic treatment processes 180 bio adsorption uses microbial surfaces to attract dye compounds for adsorption at the same time various types of enzyme secretion in microbes lead to the de coloration of dyes in the absence of oxygen followed by toxic intermediates degradation under aerobic conditions through enzyme mediated degradation 176 the mechanism of degradation of azo dyes follows the same routes as discussed in the enzyme mediated degradation in enzyme mediated degradation of azo dyes the specific enzymes are synthesized before the degradation reaction however in microbial strain mediated degradation the live microbes produce the enzymes such as azoreductage laccase peroxidase and phenoloxidase during close contact with the dye molecules 5 factors affecting microbial azo dye decolorization and degradation the microbial dye decolorization and degradation are subjected to design and operational factors a variety of conditions are taken from effluent disposal sites as the microbes are acclimated to their own adverse environmental conditions 100 136 different parameters such as ph temperature salinity dye concentration inoculum size nutrients agitation speed anaerobic and aerobic conditions influence the biological degradation of dyes a comprehensive understanding of the effect of factors on microbial decolorization of dyes is required to optimize for relevant treatment processes 5 1 effect of environmental conditions the ph indicates a significant role in dye decolorization 181 and its optimal ranges are different according to biological species fungi and yeast exhibit better dye degradation performance at acidic or neutral ph whereas bacteria show better performance at ph more than 7 48 likewise ligninolytic enzymes produced by fungi show maximum activity at low ph the optimum ph helps in the azo dye molecule s movement via the cell membrane and shows the maximum color removal rate it is a rate determining step for the decolorization process pseudomonas species showed 87 dye decolorization efficiency at ph 6 and 89 at ph 8 182 tripathi and srivastava 183 found that acid orange 10 dye was decolorized by p putida at ph 7 while p aeruginosa exhibited good efficiency in the ph range of 7 9 temperature plays a significant role in microbial activity and it affects the microbial dye degradation process it affects different metabolic activities growth enzyme production reaction mechanism biosorption and biodegradation 184 azo dye de coloration increased with an increase in temperature and then it declines at high temperature due to cellular viability loss or denaturation of an azoreductase 101 wang et al 110 found an increase in decolorization of reactive black 5 by enterobacter sp ec3 in the temperature range of 22 c to 37 c and at temperature 42 c and above the decolorization of azo dye was decreased 5 2 effect of dye characteristics dyes with low molecular weight and simple structure exhibits fast microbial degradation whereas high molecular weight and complex structure containing dyes have a low de coloration rate 113 185 also substitution groups numbers of azo bonds and hydrogen interaction between azo and hydroxyl functional groups significantly affect dye degradation 186 if a substituent is present in the phenyl ring at para position then azo bonds become sensitive for discoloration 113 the higher dye concentration inhibits dye decolorization and degradation 187 color removal was fast during the initial exposure period but decreased later due to the inverse relationship between dye concentration and de coloration time high dye concentration reduces decolorization probably due to toxic impacts of the reduced intermediate products as aromatic amines on the microbes 188 this implies the concentration of intermediate products and dye affect the overall decolorization and degradation process 5 3 effect of nutrients proper levels of microbial inoculum are essential for the dye decolorization process pourbabaee et al 189 found de coloration of terasil black was enhanced with an increase in b cereus inoculum garg et al 190 observed 4 pseudomonas putida skg 1 inoculum was optimum for acid orange 7 decolorization garg and tripathi 191 found a 3 inoculum of b cereus rmlau1 exhibited 68 de coloration of acid orange 7 after three days of exposure bio stimulation through the addition of substrate is used to promote metabolic biodegradation processes carbon and nitrogen presence in substrate play a significant role in maintaining the de coloration process 192 azo dyes accept electrons obtained via carbon oxidation through redox mediators 179 supply of different carbon sources such as yeast extract peptone glucose starch is essential for azo dye decolorization by microbes 143 these sources act as electron donors that help in breaking the azo bond 136 the oxidation of organic substrates produces coenzyme reducing equivalents which also acts as electron donor 193 the addition of peptone urea beef and yeast produces nadh which provides an electron for the reduction of azo dyes 23 ponraj et al 182 reported 88 orange 3 k dye discolorization by bacillus species in the presence of sucrose alalewi and jiang 194 reported decolorization of acid orange 7 and direct blue 75 dye by comamonas acidovorans and burkholderia cepacia in the presence of starch many researchers observed that a significant amount of color was removed by yeast extract supplementation 195 wastewater released from dyeing industries carries substantial amounts of impurities such as acids alkalis and salts anjaneya et al 196 reported the inhibition of most of the microbial activities under saline conditions but halotolerant microbes decolorize azo dyes even in the presence of salts 197 bacillus species decolorized navy blue 2gl in 48 h but time was reduced to 18 h due to enzyme activation by calcium chloride 114 khalid et al 108 found complete decolorization of reactive black 5 acid red 88 and disperse orange 3 in 8 h in the presence of salt nacl 40 g l however these dyes were decolorized 100 53 and 58 respectively in 24 h with nacl concentration 60 g l by shewanella putrefaciens strain as96 5 4 effect of oxygen the aerobic decolorization treatment efficiency is lower than anaerobic due to the presence of the electron withdrawing groups in dyes it has been recommended that anaerobic treatment should be followed by a subsequent aerobic process for the complete deterioration of dyes 198 the decolorization rate of the dye mixture by galactomyces geotrichum was more under aerobic than anaerobic conditions 199 according to research reported by oturkar et al 200 bacillus lentus showed 98 decolorization of reactive red 120 under static conditions and 70 in the presence of oxygen still no decolorization was observed in the absence of oxygen the effect of agitation during the microbial degradation process is debatable some researchers reported that decolorization was enhanced by agitation 178 201 others found that decolorization increased under quiescent conditions 28 48 the agitation improves oxygen transfer between the microbial cells and dye containing solution although reductive enzyme activities prefer static anaerobic conditions partial aeration may be essential for azo dye degradation by oxidative enzymes ghodake et al 202 reported 91 discoloration of amaranth dye under static conditions and 68 color removal was observed with shaking in 48 h exposure period orange ii decolorization with aspergillus niger was marked 84 with agitation as compared to 61 under static conditions 178 the shaking promotes mass and oxygen transfer from the culture medium to microbes promoting fungal growth decolorization was more efficiently observed in aerobic than in anaerobic conditions as shaking speed improved oxygen transfer for degradation of congo red by a niger 203 kaushik and malik 48 reported color removal with agitation due to oxygen and nutrient distribution transfer compared to stationary conditions in contrast kalyani et al 94 observed poor degradation ability of pseudomonas species suk1 against reactive red 2 dye in an agitated state after 24 h of contact time at the same time 96 decolorization was found in 6 h under static conditions 5 5 effect of electron donors and redox mediators the electron donors are required for the color removal process because they induce the dye reduction process by stimulating the enzymatic activity the electron transport process is inhibited due to competition for electrons from donor species bacillus species increased decolorization of reactive orange 16 dye in the presence of electron donors such as sodium acetate sodium formate sodium citrate and sodium pyruvate 204 bacterial anaerobic azo reduction processes oxidize electron donors and transfers electrons via a multi component system joined to the electron transport chain according to van der zee and villaverde 205 electron donor availability is vital for dye removal in bioreactors operated without oxygen redox mediator can enhance reaction rate by transferring an electron from a primary electron donor to a terminal electron acceptor 206 redox mediators can be produced by microbial metabolism or added externally 207 many compounds have been reported as redox mediators such as flavin adenine dinucleotide fad flavin adenine mononucleotide fmn anthraquinone 2 6 disulphonate aqds anthraquinone 2 sulphonate aqs riboflavin cyanocobalamin menadione and lawsone the alternative final electron acceptors such as nitrate and oxygen decrease decolorization under anaerobic conditions because those should compete with the azo dyes to accept electrons in contrast the latter redox mediators can increase reductive decolorization processes in the absence of oxygen quinone based compounds also act as redox mediators in chemical and microbiological reactions by enhancing electron transfer azo dye decolorization depends on the electron density as low electron density in the azo link can increase the dye degradation process the dye degradation rate was high when redox potential reducing or oxidizing capacity of the system was less whereas the removal rate decreased with increasing redox potential 6 challenges and future perspectives industrial effluent is a significant threat to sustainable environmental development and its remediation is a challenging task the first review paper on textile wastewater treatment using various methods was published in 1971 208 much research work has been undertaken during the last fifty years but there are still many challenges to overcome integration of different treatment technologies for dye removal is highly desirable for its effective translation to industries the combination of physical chemical and biological methods should be used to carry out a complete effluent treatment not only for a reduction in dye concentration but also for a reduction in chemical and biological oxygen demand and toxicity the objectives mentioned above can be easily obtained if work is conducted in an interdisciplinary manner by considering scientific procedures engineering dimensions and economic perspectives dye industry wastewater also contains valuable products that can be recovered by using relevant technologies researchers are focusing on technologies for metal recovery and energy from wastewater which can be used as resources further study is needed on scaling up the microbial wastewater treatment processes with cost analysis utilization of treated effluent to reduce the demand for freshwater and developing cost effective strategies for adoption by the industrial sector the toxicity analyses of degraded products is recommended for environmental safety it is essential to ensure that the degraded products have no toxicity on recipient organisms in depth research work is required for the identification of desired microbes limitation of experimental factors bioremediation site dye degradation pathways and re examination of successful bioremediation studies is essential to improve for enhanced efficiency after getting success in laboratory experiments efforts should be made to scale up and apply integrated techniques to treat real industrial effluents earlier investigations have revealed that proper oxygen transfer less operation time operational stability in scale up should be the main parameters to design bioreactors to promote the effectiveness of the biological system for the breakdown of dyes mixed consortia of microbes are more effective and stable as compared to single microbes it has been observed that synthetic dyes have resisted various microbial degradation techniques hence genetic engineering tools can be used to obtain super dye degrader microbes the development of genetically modified microbes with desired properties can degrade highly recalcitrant dyes the application of microbial enzymes are a lucrative option for dye degradation as they can be reused after processing and can reduce operational costs the unsteady and cost intensive nature of enzymes limits their practical utilization under a real effluent treatment system microbial fuel cells have been considered a promising alternative as they can degrade dye molecules as well as generate electricity however low electricity production and high cost are the main obstacles that limit their application at a large scale the economical and efficient treatment of dye contaminated industrial wastewater is an important step in green manufacturing techniques for industries active collaborations among chemical engineers microbiologists biochemists and genetic engineers must understand the dye bioremediation process in terms of kinetics operational procedure and stability to overcome technical obstacles the combined efforts would help in designing advanced bioremediation technologies for the abatement of dye pollution 7 conclusions microbes have been found as the principal decomposer of xenobiotics in the environment the bioremediation techniques may be a sustainable alternative for the treatment of azo dye contaminated wastewater microbes like bacteria fungi and yeast can be effective due to their easy handling and various metabolic processes the microbial system for the degradation of azo dyes is significant as it works under adverse conditions and can solve wastewater treatment problems the aromatic amines and other intermediates produce from azo dyes cannot be adequately degraded in the absence of oxygen but show degradation in the presence of oxygen therefore a combined aerobic anaerobic process for treating azo dye wastewater is recommended for dye degradation bioremediation of dye contaminated wastewater through microbes is an alternative elucidation owing to its cost effectiveness environmentally friendly and sustainable tool moreover recent advances in biochemistry and molecular biology offer a wide range of probabilities for increasing microbial potential for rapid mineralization of aromatic amines and intermediate toxic by products industrial effluent treatment using different physicochemical and biological processes has been implemented but the economical removal of color from effluents remains a big problem bioremediation of industrial effluent is seen as an alluring solution due to its low cost efficient environmentally benign sustainable and acceptable approach further investigations are required to identify efficient microbes bioremediation sites and limitations of experimental conditions and degradation pathways before using microbes in real situations researches should focus on the development of feasible microbial processes with immobilized cells and the study of microbial physiology under the immobilized phase will deepen our knowledge for process escalation application of microbial bioreactor for bioremediation is a very lucrative phenomenon due to the flexibility to design bioreactor it offers controlled environment it can optimize critical parameters very easily for maximum dye degradation more investigations are required in designing bioreactors to carry high biomass proper supply of essential nutrients and continuous removal of waste components from the system a detailed study on the dye degradation pathway would help us to explore the kinetics behind microbial degradation hence the integration of different treatment technologies for dye removal is needed for its effective translation to industries declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they don t have any known financial interests or personal interests that could have influenced the

13366,water pollution mainly occurring from manufacturing industries has been a serious environmental issue in the contemporary world dyeing processes produce a massive amount of dye contaminated effluent it is a major culprit for water and soil pollution in developing and underdeveloped countries the azo dye released from industries poses a severe environmental menace by contaminating the aquatic system and adversely impacting human health azo dyes are synthetic macromolecules which are persistent recalcitrant and non biodegradable several physicochemical technologies have been proposed for azo dye mitigation still some limitations are observed such as high operational cost and energy requirement complicated procedures incomplete mineralization and secondary waste generation alternately remediation by microbes is considered a clean effective and safe technology to detoxify azo dyes from wastewater the biological treatment can exploit fungi yeast bacteria and algae which have received attentiveness because of their eco friendliness this review highlights the decolorization and degradation of dyes by various microbes acting as biological tools against azo dyes it also discusses the azo dye degradation mechanism and factors affecting the degradations graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords water pollution microbes azo dyes degradation activity degradation mechanism microbial biomass 1 introduction water is an essential component of life as it is required for our various vital activities it also plays a crucial role in the growth of agriculture and the industrial sector the potable water sources are getting meager day by day due to the increase in population urbanization and industrialization excessive exploitation and contamination of water resources are contemporary environmental issues 1 water pollution may cause direct or indirect health risks to live organisms on earth that are adversely affected by the environment dyes have been utilized in plastic printing pharmaceutical food cosmetic photography and leather industries 2 6 more than ten thousand dyes are commercially available and approximately 7 million metric tons of dye are produced per year 7 the dye market was 33 billion usd in 2019 and is expected to reach around 49 billion usd by 2027 8 textile industries utilize a large quantity of fresh water in the dyeing process of textiles and release contaminated wastewater 9 10 the production of 8000 kg of fabric requires approximately 2 million l of water 11 different types of dye molecules bind with the fabric in different proportions it was reported that 2 50 of pigments 12 had been discharged as effluent during processing polluting nearby soil and water bodies presented in table 1 production of reactive oxygen species has been reported in plants due to the presence of toxic pollutants in water or soil 13 the world bank study found that 17 20 of contaminated wastewater comes from the textile dyeing industry 14 dyes have a high water solubilizing ability making it difficult to extract those using traditional methods 15 16 the release of the untreated effluents overloaded with colors into water bodies is eco destructive 17 organic solvents are used in the dye production process which chelates with metals and releases wastewater with acids alkali salts and nitro compounds 18 the presence of pigment as low as 1 0 mg l resulted in color as a visible contaminant in water the presence of color in effluent indicates that untreated or poorly treated effluent has been discharged in water channels 19 20 dyes are an integral part of human life they are present in household utensils furniture painted wall and various colored foods at the beginning of civilizations the colors were extracted from the natural sources either from plants such as weld madder indigo beetroot red betanin dyer s broom genista tinctorial l cornflower centaurea cyanus l deptford pink dianthus armeria l indian pokeweed phytolacca acinosa roxburgh rose marigold flowers etc or animal sources such as cochineal shellfish sawfly larva snout caterpillar etc with the progress of industrial and knowledge based society the chemicals behind the color were identified further progress in synthetic dyes enables the researchers to identify the functional groups in the molecules responsible for absorbing the electromagnetic energy in the visible range 400 800 nm consequently color appears two types of organic functional groups are found in the dye molecules namely chromophores and auxochromes fig 1 chromophores impart different colors through delocalized pi electron systems with conjugated double bonds and auxochromes intensifying the colors in the dye molecules through electron withdrawing or electron donating groups synthetic dyes can be classified into two broad categories non azo dyes and azo dyes that can be further classified as shown in fig 2 based on chemical behavior chemical constituents and applications almost 3000 different combinations of azo dyes are synthesizing for industrial applications worldwide it can be mono azo di azo tri azo or poly azo compounds the mono azo dyes are mostly used in the dying of different substances azo dyes contain amine diazotized in combination with amine or phenol and azo groups nn 21 22 approximately 80 of dyestuffs are made up of azo dyes 23 azo groups are found in dyes which can absorb light and they may be altered with chloro nitro amino hydroxyl and carboxyl groups 24 the chromophoric azo groups undergo reductive cleavage and form highly toxic aromatic amines due to electron withdrawing groups in azo dyes biodegradation is difficult 25 azo dyes are widely used because of their simple and cost effective synthesis stability long shelf life and availability of various colors compared to natural dyes 26 27 thus azo dye produces an adverse impact by increasing the water pollution indicators such as toc bod and cod 28 moreover the breakdown of azo dyes produces different toxic carcinogenic and mutagenic compounds due to its toxicity european union has prohibited using azo dyes 26 the disposal of untreated textile dye effluent in water resources degraded surface water quality and adversely impacted the environment and human health 29 30 lellis et al 31 investigated the harmful effect of azo dye on soil microbial population affecting germination and plant growth synthetic dyes and their intermediary compounds are carcinogenic leading to health hazards in humans and animals 32 ali 33 stated that azo dye showed its linkage with many types of cancers in the bladder spleen liver and chromosomal abnormalities in human bodies researchers have reported that azo dyes can easily attach to dna molecules 34 the disperse red 1 dye is widely utilized for dyeing showing mutagenic effects 35 the basic red 9 dye used in textile paper and ink production shows toxic impacts on the environment and carcinogenic potential in humans 36 crystal violet dye irritates the skin and digestive tract chemical cystitis and respiratory and renal system failure in humans 37 the azure b dye can easily insinuate nucleic acids such as dna 38 and rna 39 due to these detrimental impacts on the environment and threats to human life removing azo dyes from wastewater is essential the researcher s concern for azo dye mitigation is evident from the number of publications on azo dye degradation per year as shown in fig 3 past 40 years survey on microbial degradation of azo dye showed 523 documents in scopus com out of which 80 421 publications were reported after 2010 data analysis on the literature survey shown that 492 research papers 21 review articles and 20 conference papers were published during this period due to scientific publications public awareness of the toxic effects of dyes and their repercussions on the environment and human health has been increased 40 the regulations by government agencies are compelling industries for the proper treatment of effluents before their release into the environment hence there is an urgent requirement to develop treatment strategies to ensure the sustainability of our environment for upcoming generations 41 several conventional methods were used for dye removal from industrial effluents but bioremediation has been found the most sustainable solution biotechnological procedures can progressively enhance biotreatment through the production of more resistant microbes with high dye degrading ability to the best of our knowledge no review has been compiled on the research findings of the last forty years on the use of microorganisms and modified microorganisms biomass in the decolorization and degradation of azo dyes the azo dye degradation mechanism and factors affecting the microorganism efficiency 2 microorganisms involved in decolorization and degradation of azo dyes the application of microorganisms over physico chemical approaches for dye degradation is accredited due to their environmental benefits such as clean green cost effective and sustainable solutions for the treatment of contaminated effluents with no production of toxic by products as less sludge generation 42 43 2 1 fungi fungi can be considered as either a bio sorbent or bio degrader for dyes they have merits as bio adsorbents because of availability in large quantities of fungi biomass cost effectiveness good mechanical strength and chemical stability in acidic and alkaline conditions the macrofungi have a rigid structure with physical characteristics which enhances biosorption properties the adsorption capacity of fungi increased with the rise of temperature and reaction kinetics of the dye decolorization was inhibited with increasing temperature due to deactivation of the adsorbent surface or a decrease in the number of active sites 44 cunninghamella elegans 45 and trametes versicolor 46 were found efficient in dye removal in comparison to activated carbon also various fungal species can participate in decolorization and degradation as shown in table 2 the filamentous fungi produce phenoloxidase and peroxidase that can degrade azo dyes 47 the fungal mycelia have the edge over unicellular organisms as they solubilize the insoluble substrate by enzymetic action 48 other fungal species like aspergillus ochraceus trametes versicolor pleurotus bjerkandera adusta and phlebia have also received considerable recognition for dye biodegradation the use of fungi for dye decolorization is a desirable approach due to the low cost safe and complete mineralization of dye 49 however the long hydraulic retention time and preservation of fungi in bioreactors for complete decolorization restricts its utilization in the decolorization system 50 2 2 yeast yeast can be used for the decolorization of azo dyes similar to fungi yeasts grow as fast as bacteria and can survive under extreme environmental conditions the de coloration of azo dye through yeast involves both adsorption and enzymatic degradation 69 the genus candida is utilized in dye de coloration via biosorption or biodegradation mechanism or bio augmentation 70 as per table 3 yeast species such as trichosporon beigelii saccharomyces cerevisiae and galactomyces geotrichum can uptake high dye concentrations as bio adsorbents candida tropicalis adsorbed 94 of remazol blue and 44 reactive red 71 while trichosporon akiyoshidainum adsorbed 63 reactive blue and 90 of reactive red dye 72 degradation of dye is related to the growth and metabolism of yeast 73 74 yeast cells require a carbon source of glucose for dye degradation azo dye incites oxidases and reductases production and nadh dcip reductase by yeast 75 2 3 algae the use of algae for effluent treatment has been receiving attention due to cost effective and feasible cultivation at a large scale algae are photosynthetic organisms as they can survive in different habitats interestingly the water bodies contaminated by dyes adversely affect aquatic life and do not inhibit algal growth the mass cultivation of algae is cost effective as they derive energy from sunlight and synthesize food algal cells both live and dead can be used for dye removal or biosorption 85 azoreductase present in algae degrades azo dyes with the production of aromatic amines 86 algae can degrade different dyes these dyes are summarized in table 4 the degradation performances depend on the algal species and structure of dye molecules 87 2 4 bacteria bacteria are commonly included in industrial wastewater treatment as they can adapt to diverse environmental conditions under different oxygen ph or temperature ranges decolorization by bacteria is estimated to be faster than fungi 94 carvalho et al 95 reported aromatic amines formed by bacteria under anaerobic conditions as mentioned above azo dyes are resistant to bacterial attack in the presence of oxygen nevertheless some aerobic bacteria can reduce azo bonds with azoreductases 96 for example micrococcus species decolorized reactive dyes in 24 h in the absence of oxygen but in an aerobic environment the de coloration period was decreased to 6 h 97 grekova vasileva et al 98 revealed complete degradation of amaranth dye lg1 by pseudomonas isolated from the wastewater treatment system the bacterial isolate geobacillus stearothemophilus 99 pseudomonas luteola 96 and sphingomonas paucimobilis 100 decolorized azo dyes up to 90 the shewanella species remove 98 of acid orange 7 with an 80 reduction in cod in membrane aerated biofilm reactor whereas only 58 of the cod was eliminated by conventional anaerobic aerobic process 34 azoreductase was isolated from bacillus badius which was able to degrade azo dyes due to their thermal stability the high mineralization of dyes can result from bacterial degradation 101 in table 5 halomonas application also shows promising results of azo dye degradation 102 2 5 mixed microbial culture consortium the complete degradation of complex dye molecules with a single microbe is impossible but a high mineralization rate can be achieved with the microbial consortium the mixed microbial population shows a high degree of dye decolorization and degradation compared to pure culture due to combined enzymatic reactions of microbes 14 individual strains in consortiums may attack dye molecules at different positions or use metabolites produced by co existing strains for further degradation 131 microbes may acclimatize themselves under toxic conditions and the natural development of new resistant strains converts more toxic chemicals into less harmful forms 132 some cultures can convert dye into intermediates that act as a redox mediator promote the transfer of reducing equivalents and increase the overall decolorization process it was observed that intermediates might reduce the redox potential of the medium which supports the reduction of azo linkage for degradation of azo dye 133 135 consortia can be composed of fungi yeast bacteria or their mixture and biodegradation of dyes can be increased due to their combined effects 136 fungi initiate the degradation of complex dye molecules and then bacteria are required for total organic carbon removal 56 the complete degradation of dye molecules is possible with the enzymatic reactions of microbial consortia 137 the pseudomonas sp suk1 decolorized azo dyes but lbc2 and lbc3 strains of pseudomonas sp could not however their consortia decolorized effluent more efficiently as compared to individual pseudomonas sp suk1 138 the consortia decolorized 99 of red he3b within 12 h whereas single bacteria took longer than 60 h for degradation of 85 89 red he3b 139 phugare et al 140 found that providencia species and pseudomonas aeruginosa consortia showed 97 red he3b de coloration in 1 h while the single strain took 5 48 h for dye decolorization reactive navy blue he2r was 78 decolorized by pseudomonas sp suk1 61 by aspergillus ochraceus ncim 1146 and a maximum of 92 were observed by consortia 141 for the formulation of consortia the proportion of individual microbes plays a vital role in azo dye treatment ayed et al 142 reported that 0 02 0 45 and 0 51 of sphingomonas paucimobilis bacillus species and staphylococcus epidermidis showed complete decolorization of congo red dye an equal fraction of bacillus cereus pseudomonas fluorescens pseudomonas putida and stenotrophomonas acidaminiphila taken from effluent showed a three fold increase in de coloration capacity to other combinations of microbes 143 deive et al 144 exhibited that consortia isolated from high temperature regions caused 70 de coloration of reactive black 5 at 65 c within one day earlier workers have been used fungal bacterial co cultures to benefit from both microbes oxidoreductive enzymes 136 145 moosvi et al 133 identified micrococcus luteus micrococcus sp and paenibacillus polymyxa from a contaminated site that showed decolorization of nine dyes combination however the individual strain could not degrade dye table 6 the combinations of aspergillus and pseudomonas species detoxified rubine gfl dye in 30 h and degraded 98 reactive and disperse azo dye in 35 h 146 bacillus circulans pseudomonas aeruginosa and some unidentified isolates such as nad1 and nad6 consortia were utilized to degrade reactive black 5 147 the consortium decolorized 90 and 70 of 100 mg l and 1000 mg l reactive black 5 after 48 h exposure 2 6 genetically modified microbes synthetic azo dyes are resistant to natural degradation due to this their breakdown by conventional techniques is complex and time consuming despite many microbes available for bioremediation of textile wastewater all are not successfully degrading the dye molecules because some azo dye molecules can deactivate enzymes in microbes depending on wastewater conditions 155 hence there is a need for genetic modification of active microbes to increase the treatment stability and degradation rate genetically modified microbes can enhance dye degradation by applying genetic engineering techniques 156 azoreductase gene azok was isolated from a bacterium klebsiella pneumoniae and expressed in escherichia coli dh5α and recombinant e coli bl21 was utilized to degrade methyl orange dye 157 azoreductase obtained from enterococcus faecalis was expressed in e coli they showed a two to four fold increase in methyl red ponceau bs and orange ii degradation capacity compared to non induced cells 158 recombinant lac gene was synthesized from ganoderma lucidum and it was expressed in p pastoris which exhibited significant degradation of methyl orange 159 the lac like gene lac21 was expressed in e coli which showed dye degradation ability at ph 5 9 160 eslami et al 161 reported that azoreductase gene isolated from halomonas elongata was expressed in e coli dh5 and genetically modified e coli bl21 showed degradation of methyl red and remazol black b dye the azog gene was isolated from halomonas species strain gt and expressed in escherichia coli dh5α and recombinant e coli de3 successfully degraded azo dyes present in wastewater 162 ajaz et al 29 reported remazol red dye degradation in the presence of dissolved oxygen 0 8 mg l by azoreductase which was duplicated from bacillus latrosporus rrk1 and inserted in escherichia coli 3 immobilized microbial cells immobilization of microbes by entrapment or attachment methods has been utilized for dye degradation microbes get inserted in porous or fibrous material where they adhere to the surface the immobilized microbes showed higher stability than free cultures and those were resilient to alteration in temperature ph or exposure to toxic chemicals 163 instead of the microbial cells for immobilization enzymes can be immobilized for dye degradation processes enzyme immobilization is a well known technique and the immobilized enzyme is reusable through easier separation than free enzymes 164 in addition enzyme immobilization is reported as more environmentally friendly than other dye removal technologies 165 ma et al 166 introduced genipin activated chitosan beads as a highly stable laccase biocatalyst from trametes pubescens which showed 77 5 degradation of acid black 172 dye laccase from trametes versicolor was immobilized by preparing carbon nanotube nanocomposites degraded 96 congo red dye within 3 h 167 due to the high potential in the applicability of immobilized enzymes further research is required to establish the method 4 mechanism of biodegradation an aqueous solution of azo dyes can be degraded by enzymatic or electrochemical or photocatalytic or microbial or hyphenated methods 168 chemically reductive cleavage of nn bond is the beginning of the azo dye decolorization in all most all so far developed degradation processes the various methods designed to mitigate the azo dyes through complete degradation in wastewater such as electrochemical degradation anodic and cathodic process photocatalytic degradation by the use of metal and non metallic photocatalysts enzyme mediated degradation involves aerobic activated sludge treatment anoxic degradation and direct enzymatic reduction and anaerobic degradation chemical and redox mediated reduction processes microbial dye degradation involves the use of fungi bacteria algae or their consortia 4 1 enzyme mediated degradation of azo dye typically in an in vivo process the microorganism produces the azo dye degradable enzymes but for the higher concentration of azo dye degradation isolated enzymes were preferred for industrial azo dye degradation commercially available isolated enzymes are azo reductase laccase peroxidase oxidase enzymes etc these enzymes can function in both intracellular and extracellular routes of azo dye degradations 169 it can serve as substrate specific and quickly immobilized on a substrate enhancing the degradation efficiency precisely for the one type of substrate enzymes are self degradable in nature hence they did not create any environmental nausea the by products of the enzyme mediated degradation can be used as a media supplement for microbial culture growth 170 some enzymes function as substrate specific and some are not so their degradation mechanism also follows different routes direct enzyme degradation of dye is supported by the cofactors and redox active coenzyme intermediate such as flavin adenine dinucleotide hydrogen fadh nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen nadph and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrogen nadh these intermediates can help in transfer electrons from an enzyme e g azo reductase to azo dye due to electron transfer to the azo bonds nn in the dye molecules the bonds became weaker and subsequently broken to produce colorless odorless and toxic intermediate of aromatic amines further disintegration of aromatic amines in aerobic conditions produces small molecular weight compounds such as water carbon dioxide and ammonia 171 in brief most of the azo dye degradation starts with reducing double bonds in anaerobic conditions followed by the aerobic process for complete mineralization some auto oxidized by products of the toxic and carcinogenic aromatic compounds also formed during azo dye degradation as shown in fig 4 azo reductase and laccase are commonly used enzyme isolate in azo dye degradation the azo reductase enzyme can be found either in the cytoplasm or in the membrane the cytoplasmic azo reductase is inefficient in the degradation of sulfonated azo dye because of its complex chemical compositions and the poor diffusion ability of the cytoplasmic azo reductase in the cell membrane the water soluble cytoplasmic azo reductase enzymes frequently degrade non sulfonated azo dye molecules the mechanism of azo dye reduction through redox active intermediate dependent cytoplasmic bound and membrane bound azo reductase enzymes follows different routes 172 the azo dye degradation through azo reductase enzyme requires low molecular weight reducing equivalents redox active coenzyme intermediates such as fadh or nadh as the electron donor the chromophore group in azo dye nn cleaved by the transfer of electrons from the azo reductase enzyme as a reducing agent in an anaerobic process the red dye degradation through the azo reductase enzyme is shown in fig 5 the anaerobic process of azo dye degradation is more efficient than the aerobic process because the azo reductase enzyme is oxygen sensitive therefore redox active coenzyme intermediate was reduced in place of an azo dye when azo reductase encountered oxygen the membrane bound azo reductase uses redox active coenzymes e g fadh or nadh as electron shuttle during the anaerobic process in each stage of degradation two electrons were transferred to the azo dye molecules which function as an electron acceptor oxidizing agents and forming a colorless solution of toxic aromatic amines these amines can later mineralize through the aerobic or sometimes micro aerophilic processes 173 the laccase is an extracellular enzyme primarily produced from either fungal or plant culture very few laccases are produced from bacteria the fungal derived laccase is unstable at high temperatures and in an alkaline medium the degradation mechanism of laccase catalyzed dye follows different routes depending on the dye structure anthraquinone dyes are enzyme substrate for laccase therefore it is directly oxidized by the laccase enzyme at the same time non substrate dyes like azo and indigo dye involved some small molecule metabolites in mediating the interaction between the azo dyes and laccase enzyme the azo dye degradation through the laccase enzyme depends on the concentration of medium metabolites rather than enzyme activity in the solution some known mediating metabolites used in azo dye degradation through laccase enzyme are abts 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylthiazoline 6 sulfonate and anthraquinone dye laccase enzyme can be used against the wide range of aromatic and non aromatic azo dye molecules degradation through small molecule mediating metabolites 174 it degrades azo dyes through a highly nonspecific free radical mechanism to form phenolic compounds instead of toxic aromatic amines the degradation mechanism of red dye through the laccase enzyme is shown in fig 6 the laccase substrate oxidizes the phenolic group of the azo dye with the participation of one electron in the reaction chain generating the phenoxy radical the phenoxy radical subsequently oxidized to carbonium ion the nucleophilic attack by oh on carbonium ion of the azo linkage to produce 4 nitrohydrazine and 1 2 naphthaquinone the reaction mechanism suggested that oxygenated free radicals remove the n2 gas from the 4 nitrohydrazine and form nitrobenzene radicals which on acid and base hydrolysis formed nitrobenzene and nitrophenol 4 2 microbial strain modified degradations biological methods that combine anaerobic and aerobic processes have been extensively addressed for complete dye mineralization in wastewater treatment 175 microbes are superior dye degraders as they have a higher capacity to sustain under adverse circumstances due to the synthesis of various metabolites 176 dye degradation by microbes has edges over other techniques 1 being eco friendly 2 less water consumption 3 cost competitive and efficient 4 complete mineralization and 5 no waste production therefore the identification of potent microbes is the most critical variable for optimal treatment various microbes are capable of decolorizing dyes such as bacteria 127 177 fungi 178 microbial consortium and algae 89 91 the biological methods using microbes for dye removal can be a potentially viable option it is a low cost and sustainable wastewater treatment system for industries 48 a large number of microbes are available which can be easily maintained however biotreatment also has some drawbacks as it is a very slow process and its success depends only on optimal conditions microorganisms show a multifaceted ability for pollutant removal from wastewater through various biodegradation mechanisms 179 stated two possible biological processes of dye decolorization 1 biosorption of dyes on the microbes as bio adsorbents and 2 biodegradation of dyes by enzymes released by microbial activities microbes can be utilized in the removal of a broad range of azo dyes through bio adsorption and subsequent degradation by anaerobic and aerobic treatment processes 180 bio adsorption uses microbial surfaces to attract dye compounds for adsorption at the same time various types of enzyme secretion in microbes lead to the de coloration of dyes in the absence of oxygen followed by toxic intermediates degradation under aerobic conditions through enzyme mediated degradation 176 the mechanism of degradation of azo dyes follows the same routes as discussed in the enzyme mediated degradation in enzyme mediated degradation of azo dyes the specific enzymes are synthesized before the degradation reaction however in microbial strain mediated degradation the live microbes produce the enzymes such as azoreductage laccase peroxidase and phenoloxidase during close contact with the dye molecules 5 factors affecting microbial azo dye decolorization and degradation the microbial dye decolorization and degradation are subjected to design and operational factors a variety of conditions are taken from effluent disposal sites as the microbes are acclimated to their own adverse environmental conditions 100 136 different parameters such as ph temperature salinity dye concentration inoculum size nutrients agitation speed anaerobic and aerobic conditions influence the biological degradation of dyes a comprehensive understanding of the effect of factors on microbial decolorization of dyes is required to optimize for relevant treatment processes 5 1 effect of environmental conditions the ph indicates a significant role in dye decolorization 181 and its optimal ranges are different according to biological species fungi and yeast exhibit better dye degradation performance at acidic or neutral ph whereas bacteria show better performance at ph more than 7 48 likewise ligninolytic enzymes produced by fungi show maximum activity at low ph the optimum ph helps in the azo dye molecule s movement via the cell membrane and shows the maximum color removal rate it is a rate determining step for the decolorization process pseudomonas species showed 87 dye decolorization efficiency at ph 6 and 89 at ph 8 182 tripathi and srivastava 183 found that acid orange 10 dye was decolorized by p putida at ph 7 while p aeruginosa exhibited good efficiency in the ph range of 7 9 temperature plays a significant role in microbial activity and it affects the microbial dye degradation process it affects different metabolic activities growth enzyme production reaction mechanism biosorption and biodegradation 184 azo dye de coloration increased with an increase in temperature and then it declines at high temperature due to cellular viability loss or denaturation of an azoreductase 101 wang et al 110 found an increase in decolorization of reactive black 5 by enterobacter sp ec3 in the temperature range of 22 c to 37 c and at temperature 42 c and above the decolorization of azo dye was decreased 5 2 effect of dye characteristics dyes with low molecular weight and simple structure exhibits fast microbial degradation whereas high molecular weight and complex structure containing dyes have a low de coloration rate 113 185 also substitution groups numbers of azo bonds and hydrogen interaction between azo and hydroxyl functional groups significantly affect dye degradation 186 if a substituent is present in the phenyl ring at para position then azo bonds become sensitive for discoloration 113 the higher dye concentration inhibits dye decolorization and degradation 187 color removal was fast during the initial exposure period but decreased later due to the inverse relationship between dye concentration and de coloration time high dye concentration reduces decolorization probably due to toxic impacts of the reduced intermediate products as aromatic amines on the microbes 188 this implies the concentration of intermediate products and dye affect the overall decolorization and degradation process 5 3 effect of nutrients proper levels of microbial inoculum are essential for the dye decolorization process pourbabaee et al 189 found de coloration of terasil black was enhanced with an increase in b cereus inoculum garg et al 190 observed 4 pseudomonas putida skg 1 inoculum was optimum for acid orange 7 decolorization garg and tripathi 191 found a 3 inoculum of b cereus rmlau1 exhibited 68 de coloration of acid orange 7 after three days of exposure bio stimulation through the addition of substrate is used to promote metabolic biodegradation processes carbon and nitrogen presence in substrate play a significant role in maintaining the de coloration process 192 azo dyes accept electrons obtained via carbon oxidation through redox mediators 179 supply of different carbon sources such as yeast extract peptone glucose starch is essential for azo dye decolorization by microbes 143 these sources act as electron donors that help in breaking the azo bond 136 the oxidation of organic substrates produces coenzyme reducing equivalents which also acts as electron donor 193 the addition of peptone urea beef and yeast produces nadh which provides an electron for the reduction of azo dyes 23 ponraj et al 182 reported 88 orange 3 k dye discolorization by bacillus species in the presence of sucrose alalewi and jiang 194 reported decolorization of acid orange 7 and direct blue 75 dye by comamonas acidovorans and burkholderia cepacia in the presence of starch many researchers observed that a significant amount of color was removed by yeast extract supplementation 195 wastewater released from dyeing industries carries substantial amounts of impurities such as acids alkalis and salts anjaneya et al 196 reported the inhibition of most of the microbial activities under saline conditions but halotolerant microbes decolorize azo dyes even in the presence of salts 197 bacillus species decolorized navy blue 2gl in 48 h but time was reduced to 18 h due to enzyme activation by calcium chloride 114 khalid et al 108 found complete decolorization of reactive black 5 acid red 88 and disperse orange 3 in 8 h in the presence of salt nacl 40 g l however these dyes were decolorized 100 53 and 58 respectively in 24 h with nacl concentration 60 g l by shewanella putrefaciens strain as96 5 4 effect of oxygen the aerobic decolorization treatment efficiency is lower than anaerobic due to the presence of the electron withdrawing groups in dyes it has been recommended that anaerobic treatment should be followed by a subsequent aerobic process for the complete deterioration of dyes 198 the decolorization rate of the dye mixture by galactomyces geotrichum was more under aerobic than anaerobic conditions 199 according to research reported by oturkar et al 200 bacillus lentus showed 98 decolorization of reactive red 120 under static conditions and 70 in the presence of oxygen still no decolorization was observed in the absence of oxygen the effect of agitation during the microbial degradation process is debatable some researchers reported that decolorization was enhanced by agitation 178 201 others found that decolorization increased under quiescent conditions 28 48 the agitation improves oxygen transfer between the microbial cells and dye containing solution although reductive enzyme activities prefer static anaerobic conditions partial aeration may be essential for azo dye degradation by oxidative enzymes ghodake et al 202 reported 91 discoloration of amaranth dye under static conditions and 68 color removal was observed with shaking in 48 h exposure period orange ii decolorization with aspergillus niger was marked 84 with agitation as compared to 61 under static conditions 178 the shaking promotes mass and oxygen transfer from the culture medium to microbes promoting fungal growth decolorization was more efficiently observed in aerobic than in anaerobic conditions as shaking speed improved oxygen transfer for degradation of congo red by a niger 203 kaushik and malik 48 reported color removal with agitation due to oxygen and nutrient distribution transfer compared to stationary conditions in contrast kalyani et al 94 observed poor degradation ability of pseudomonas species suk1 against reactive red 2 dye in an agitated state after 24 h of contact time at the same time 96 decolorization was found in 6 h under static conditions 5 5 effect of electron donors and redox mediators the electron donors are required for the color removal process because they induce the dye reduction process by stimulating the enzymatic activity the electron transport process is inhibited due to competition for electrons from donor species bacillus species increased decolorization of reactive orange 16 dye in the presence of electron donors such as sodium acetate sodium formate sodium citrate and sodium pyruvate 204 bacterial anaerobic azo reduction processes oxidize electron donors and transfers electrons via a multi component system joined to the electron transport chain according to van der zee and villaverde 205 electron donor availability is vital for dye removal in bioreactors operated without oxygen redox mediator can enhance reaction rate by transferring an electron from a primary electron donor to a terminal electron acceptor 206 redox mediators can be produced by microbial metabolism or added externally 207 many compounds have been reported as redox mediators such as flavin adenine dinucleotide fad flavin adenine mononucleotide fmn anthraquinone 2 6 disulphonate aqds anthraquinone 2 sulphonate aqs riboflavin cyanocobalamin menadione and lawsone the alternative final electron acceptors such as nitrate and oxygen decrease decolorization under anaerobic conditions because those should compete with the azo dyes to accept electrons in contrast the latter redox mediators can increase reductive decolorization processes in the absence of oxygen quinone based compounds also act as redox mediators in chemical and microbiological reactions by enhancing electron transfer azo dye decolorization depends on the electron density as low electron density in the azo link can increase the dye degradation process the dye degradation rate was high when redox potential reducing or oxidizing capacity of the system was less whereas the removal rate decreased with increasing redox potential 6 challenges and future perspectives industrial effluent is a significant threat to sustainable environmental development and its remediation is a challenging task the first review paper on textile wastewater treatment using various methods was published in 1971 208 much research work has been undertaken during the last fifty years but there are still many challenges to overcome integration of different treatment technologies for dye removal is highly desirable for its effective translation to industries the combination of physical chemical and biological methods should be used to carry out a complete effluent treatment not only for a reduction in dye concentration but also for a reduction in chemical and biological oxygen demand and toxicity the objectives mentioned above can be easily obtained if work is conducted in an interdisciplinary manner by considering scientific procedures engineering dimensions and economic perspectives dye industry wastewater also contains valuable products that can be recovered by using relevant technologies researchers are focusing on technologies for metal recovery and energy from wastewater which can be used as resources further study is needed on scaling up the microbial wastewater treatment processes with cost analysis utilization of treated effluent to reduce the demand for freshwater and developing cost effective strategies for adoption by the industrial sector the toxicity analyses of degraded products is recommended for environmental safety it is essential to ensure that the degraded products have no toxicity on recipient organisms in depth research work is required for the identification of desired microbes limitation of experimental factors bioremediation site dye degradation pathways and re examination of successful bioremediation studies is essential to improve for enhanced efficiency after getting success in laboratory experiments efforts should be made to scale up and apply integrated techniques to treat real industrial effluents earlier investigations have revealed that proper oxygen transfer less operation time operational stability in scale up should be the main parameters to design bioreactors to promote the effectiveness of the biological system for the breakdown of dyes mixed consortia of microbes are more effective and stable as compared to single microbes it has been observed that synthetic dyes have resisted various microbial degradation techniques hence genetic engineering tools can be used to obtain super dye degrader microbes the development of genetically modified microbes with desired properties can degrade highly recalcitrant dyes the application of microbial enzymes are a lucrative option for dye degradation as they can be reused after processing and can reduce operational costs the unsteady and cost intensive nature of enzymes limits their practical utilization under a real effluent treatment system microbial fuel cells have been considered a promising alternative as they can degrade dye molecules as well as generate electricity however low electricity production and high cost are the main obstacles that limit their application at a large scale the economical and efficient treatment of dye contaminated industrial wastewater is an important step in green manufacturing techniques for industries active collaborations among chemical engineers microbiologists biochemists and genetic engineers must understand the dye bioremediation process in terms of kinetics operational procedure and stability to overcome technical obstacles the combined efforts would help in designing advanced bioremediation technologies for the abatement of dye pollution 7 conclusions microbes have been found as the principal decomposer of xenobiotics in the environment the bioremediation techniques may be a sustainable alternative for the treatment of azo dye contaminated wastewater microbes like bacteria fungi and yeast can be effective due to their easy handling and various metabolic processes the microbial system for the degradation of azo dyes is significant as it works under adverse conditions and can solve wastewater treatment problems the aromatic amines and other intermediates produce from azo dyes cannot be adequately degraded in the absence of oxygen but show degradation in the presence of oxygen therefore a combined aerobic anaerobic process for treating azo dye wastewater is recommended for dye degradation bioremediation of dye contaminated wastewater through microbes is an alternative elucidation owing to its cost effectiveness environmentally friendly and sustainable tool moreover recent advances in biochemistry and molecular biology offer a wide range of probabilities for increasing microbial potential for rapid mineralization of aromatic amines and intermediate toxic by products industrial effluent treatment using different physicochemical and biological processes has been implemented but the economical removal of color from effluents remains a big problem bioremediation of industrial effluent is seen as an alluring solution due to its low cost efficient environmentally benign sustainable and acceptable approach further investigations are required to identify efficient microbes bioremediation sites and limitations of experimental conditions and degradation pathways before using microbes in real situations researches should focus on the development of feasible microbial processes with immobilized cells and the study of microbial physiology under the immobilized phase will deepen our knowledge for process escalation application of microbial bioreactor for bioremediation is a very lucrative phenomenon due to the flexibility to design bioreactor it offers controlled environment it can optimize critical parameters very easily for maximum dye degradation more investigations are required in designing bioreactors to carry high biomass proper supply of essential nutrients and continuous removal of waste components from the system a detailed study on the dye degradation pathway would help us to explore the kinetics behind microbial degradation hence the integration of different treatment technologies for dye removal is needed for

13367,sulfur containing polymers such as those with polysulfide linkages in their backbone have attracted strong interest due to the ease of modifying the structure and properties of these materials electrospun fiber membranes have large specific surface areas adjustable microstructures and chemical properties and recovery consequently these materials are promising candidates for applications as sorbents for heavy metal enrichment and water remediation herein polymeric sulfur monoterpene pst was loaded into a polyvinylidene poly methyl methacrylate pvdf pmma polymer matrix by electrospinning technology to obtain a uniform and continuous fiber based membrane it was found that treatment with a reducing agent increased the thiol group content in pst then by using the coordination and binding effect between sulfhydryl groups and metal ions it was found that the adsorption of cd ii cr iii ni ii and hg ii ions onto the membrane was enhanced under the stimulation of reduction the results indicated that the reduction responsive adsorption of hg ii and cd ii was the best with maximum adsorption values of 58 and 34 mg g 1 for each of these respective ions in addition the presence of sodium ions did not interfere with the adsorption of hg ii or cd ii ions the adsorption kinetics of hg ii and cd ii ions on the reduced membrane at different times were also studied the results revealed that the adsorption of hg ii and cd ii ions onto the reduced membrane conforms to the pseudo second order kinetic model these results indicated that pst can removal of heavy metal ions from wastewater via a convenient and reusable adsorption process graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords sulfur electrospun membranes reduction mercury ions 1 introduction pollution is becoming a pressing issue as the development of industrial technology progresses in particular water and soil pollution poses a direct threat to human health and safety soil and water have vital roles in supporting human life and are key components of ecosystems therefore the accumulation of heavy metal pollution in soil and water presents a serious problem and the removal of these heavy metals is one of the important challenges of environmental governance 1 4 according to the directive 2008 105 ec of the european union parliament and the european council heavy metals such as lead pb cadmium cd and mercury hg are considered as benchmarks for the evaluation of water quality on the basis of their concentrations mercury ions are one of the most toxic and harmful pollutants in aqueous environments and thus mercury is still toxic at low doses 5 a variety of methods are typically used to remove heavy metal ions from wastewater such as chemical precipitation ion exchange membrane separation electrochemical treatment and adsorption 6 7 35 38 among them the adsorption method is one of the most promising strategies as it offers the advantages of simple operation high efficiency and low operating costs 8 mercury is a soft lewis acid and consequently sulfur can have a high binding affinity with hg 9 therefore sulfur based materials are considered to be highly effective sorbents for mercury in addition the choice of adsorbent is the main consumption cost of membrane adsorption of heavy metal ions because of its low cost if sulfur based materials can be used as adsorbents the cost of heavy metal removal will be reduced in recent years more and more attention has been paid to the utilization of a large number of industrial by products sulfur 10 12 as an industrial waste sulfur has the advantages of large output low cost and easy access sulfur has been used as polysulfide rubber in traditional applications but this rubber can decompose into small molecules at elevated temperatures 13 however the stability of sulfur based polymer chains can be improved when they are combined with carbon based polymers previously pyun et al had introduced an inverse vulcanization method for copolymerizing sulfur with divinylic comonomers diisopropenylbenzene to afford high sulfur content cs copolymers 14 17 in our previous work the polymeric sulfur monoterpene pst was synthesized from sulfur and monoterpenes with good yields high sulfur content and excellent solubility characterization of pst revealed that it contained cs ss and sh bonds 18 considering the properties of these chemical bonds various applications of these copolymers can be envisioned for examples the disulfide bond can be oxidized or reduced to sulfone and sulfoxide or sulfhydryl groups which can then coordinate with metal ions to enable the adsorption of heavy metal ions from wastewater solution 19 20 we used two kinds of polysulfide synthesized before as adsorbent to compare the adsorption effect of the two adsorbents because of the difference of sulfhydryl content between the two polysulfides the adsorption effect may be affected electrospun fiber membranes have large specific surface areas controllable microstructures and chemical properties and are easy to recycle and reuse and thus they have strong potential for use in the preparation of sorbents for heavy metal ions 6 21 22 there are two main mechanisms for the adsorption of heavy metal ions in aqueous solution physical adsorption and chemical adsorption 23 24 due to the porous structures of fiber based membranes the contact area between a membrane and a solution can be increased when a fiber membrane comes into contact with the solution physical adsorption occurs at the interface generally physical adsorption is achieved via van der waals forces or intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions which are relatively weak and offer low adsorption capacities meanwhile the main forces involved with chemisorption are coordination binding chemical bonding forces and electrostatic forces among which the formation of coordination complexes is the most common in the study of heavy metal ion adsorption as carriers of adsorbents polymers with good chemical and physical stability and spinnability are generally selected for polymer co spinning fiber membrane 25 27 in this study polyvinylidene pvdf and poly methyl methacrylate pmma were selected as a co spinning system to generate fiber based membranes as described herein electrospinning technology was used to spin pst into membranes which were used to adsorb heavy metal ions after reduction stimulation so as to achieve an enhanced adsorption performance electro spun fiber membranes have a variety of desirable characteristics such as large specific surface areas high porosities and facile recovery 21 28 39 42 therefore the loading of pst onto electro spun fibers can increase the contact area between metal ions and sulfur based materials thus enhancing the adsorption efficiency octakis methacryloxypropyl silsesquioxane masq was also employed in this work and connected with pst via thiol ene click chemistry 29 30 this not only increased the load of pst but also increased the specific surface area of the membrane with regard to the adsorption of heavy metal ions onto the fiber membrane the effect of reduction pst was first studied and then the reduction stimulation of the composite fiber membrane loaded with pst was studied finally we investigated the adsorption effect of the membrane on specific heavy metal ions in aqueous solutions 2 experimental section 2 1 materials n n dimethylacetamide benzophenone tetrahydrofuran ethanol dichloromethane sodium thiosulfate iodine soluble starch potassium iodide sodium carbonate tris 2 carboxyethyl phosphine hydrochloride tcep hcl chromium iii trichloride hexahydrate nickel sulfate hexahydrate mercuric sulfate and cadmium sulfate 8 3

as received octakis methacryloxypropyl silsesquioxane masq and polymeric sulfur monoterpene pst were synthesized via procedures described in previous work 18 29 pst l40 and pst β p40 mean that monoterpenes account for 40 of the total mass of sulfur and monoterpenes distilled water was used in the experiment thread dispensing syringe stainless steel needle guangzhou rui jian instrument co ltd 2 2 characterization fourier transform infrared ft ir spectra were measured with a bruker tensor 27 infrared spectrophotometer elemental analysis was performed with a perkin elmer 2400 ea analyzer

temperature up to 250 c at a heating rate of 10 c min 1 under nitrogen atmosphere contact angle measurements were performed with the use of a dataphysics oca20 goniometer scanning electron microscopy sem images were recorded with a s 4800 system hitachi japan size exclusion chromatography sec measurements were performed in thf on a breeze system following universal calibration with poly styrene standards atomic absorption spectrometry aas characterization was performed with a za3000 system that was operated in the blaze mode atomic fluorescence spectrometry afs measurements were performed with a afs 9710 system haiguang instrument analytical quality assurance quality control qa qc were conducted with standard curves method blanks solvent and reagent blanks as well as 10 replicate samples in each sample batch 2 3 preparation of the electrospun fiber membrane first pmma and pvdf were added into a mixed solution denoted as a and the mass ratio of pvdf pmma was 3 1 subsequently the pst was added into solution b the solutions a and b were mixed evenly and masq and benzophenone were then added to this combined solution this solution then underwent electrospinning at a rate of 1 3 ml h 1 a working voltage between 12 and 16 kv and a drum rate of 30 r min 1 a light yellow membrane was obtained by post treatment a series of different membranes were obtained by changing the mass ratio between pst and pvdf pmma 2 4 reductive stimulus response experiment pst was weighed and dissolved in a small amount of thf and then dissolved in water with a certain mass ratio of tcep hcl after magnetic stirring at room temperature for several hours the reduced product was obtained after post treatment is denoted as pst r the reduction response of membrane was similar to the former 2 5 adsorption of heavy metals on spinning membrane the electrospun membrane was cut into 3 cm2 square section and weighed to determine its mass m and then soaked in an aqueous solution containing a reducing agent after this solution containing the membrane samples had been stirred for 1 3 h each sample was washed multiple times with ethanol and distilled water finally the electrospun film that had underwent reduction was obtained after drying treatment with the respective samples being named p1 r p2 r and p3 r as well as l1 r l2 r and l3 r see table 1 in addition by changing the reducing agent concentration the membranes with different degrees of reduction stimulation were obtained the reducing agent concentrations were 1 wt 3 wt and 5 wt of pst and the resultant membranes were thus denoted l r1 l r2 l r3 or p r1 p r2 and p r3 respectively detailed named was shown in table s1 si aqueous solutions of various heavy metals were respectively prepared a certain initial concentration c 0 the adsorption experiments were then performed by soaking each membrane sample in 10 ml of the aforementioned heavy metal aqueous solution under stirring for a designated length of time v represents the volume of membrane immersion the experiment was immersed in 10 ml solution when the designated adsorption time was reached the concentration of the heavy metal aqueous solution was measure and then the adsorption capacity of the membrane q was calculated via eq 1 31 1 q c 0 c m v 3 results and discussion 3 1 properties of pst after reduction disulfide bonds have redox activity and can be reduced to form sulfhydryl group the analysis of polymeric sulfur monoterpenes pst synthesized in the laboratory revealed that it contains numerous sulfur chains although it is not a single disulfide bond the fracture activation energy of a sulfur sulfur bond is still lower than that of a carbon sulfur bond so pst can potentially form more thiol groups under the action of a reducing agent fig 1 shows the ft ir spectra that were recorded before and after the reduction of pst from these spectra it could be seen that the peak shape of pst remains essentially unchanged after the reduction stimulation which indicated that the reduction will not affect the basic structure of pst however sulfhydryl groups do not exhibit readily discernible signals in the infrared spectrum so the reduction effect can only be verified by other methods as shown in fig 2 it was the uv vis curves before and after the reduction of pst by analyzing the absorbance values of the tested samples at the same concentration it was found that the absorbance value of pst decreases after reduction which may have been due to the cleavage of the ss bond so that the conjugation sulfur content decreases therefore it can be inferred that more sulfhydryl groups were generated after the reduction of pst the absorbance value of pst decreased more when the reducing agent concentration was increased but the extent of this decrease did not change further after the reducing agent concentration had exceeded 5 wt the thiol group content in each pst sample was quantified by chemical titration and the corresponding values are shown in table 2 from the changes in the sulfhydryl group content before and after reduction of pst it was evident that the pst samples possessed more thiol groups after reduction and the extent to which the thiol group content had increased was similar to that determined via uv vis spectroscopy analysis in summary pst could form more thiol groups in response to chemical reduction although its basic structure remained unchanged the formation of these thiol groups which can readily coordinate with heavy metal ions provided a basis for our subsequent research on the adsorption of metal ions onto pst loaded electrospun fiber membranes which had been treated with a reducing agent 3 2 properties of the electrospun fiber membrane fig 3 shows the ft ir spectra of a pure electrospun pvdf pmma membrane o and an electrospun pvdf pmma membrane that had been coated with pst before and after reduction first of all the infrared spectrum of the membrane coated with pst exhibited a characteristic peak at 1728 cm 1 corresponding to the co stretching vibration of an ester group peak a band at 1401 cm 1 corresponding to the hydrocarbon deformation vibration in cf2 ch2 and a signal at 1183 cm 1 representing the stretching vibration peak of cf2 which indicated that the co spinning matrix comprised of pst and pvdf pmma formed a uniform and continuous fiber membrane secondly the characteristic peaks exhibited by the mixtures still existed after the reduction of the membrane which showed that the structure of the membranes had not been destroyed in addition it could be inferred that pst was indeed loaded on the electrospun fiber membrane from the yellow color of the membrane fig s1 in the supplementary information si shows the dsc curves of o and of the pvdf pmma electrospun membrane coated with pst before and after reduction the results illustrated that the thermal deformation temperature of the membranes was about 133 c and the characteristics of the heat flux curve were similar which indicated that the thermal properties of the pst loaded membranes remained almost unchanged after reduction pvdf and pmma are hydrophobic polymers and the pst is also insoluble in aqueous solution and thus the fiber membrane obtained by their co spinning would be a hydrophobic membrane in order to increase the contact between the membrane and aqueous solution so as to enhance the adsorption efficiency it is important to improve the hydrophilicity of the membrane with this in mind it is expected that the amount of hydrophilic groups can be increased via reduction to improve the hydrophilicity the hydrophilicity of the membrane can be evaluated by measuring the contact angle the water contact angles exhibited by o and the pst loaded electrospun pvdf pmma membrane before and after reduction are shown in fig s2 si the contact angles of pst loaded pvdf pmma membranes decreased after reduction and with an increasing reducing agent concentration the contact angle decreased to a greater degree these results demonstrated that the hydrophilicity of the membranes could be increased and the contact between the membrane and aqueous solution could be promoted by reducing stimulation which was beneficial to the adsorption of heavy metal ions sem images displaying the morphology of the pst loaded electrospun pvdf pmma membrane before and after reduction are shown in fig 4 and it can be seen that the fiber based structure of the reduced spinning membranes were not broken from the small resolution sem images it is evident that pst molecules were evenly distributed throughout the pvdf pmma materials and there was no pst aggregation phenomenon indicating that the obtained fiber membranes had a continuous and uniform structure the eds analysis data are provided in fig s3 si the sulfur content of the pst loaded pvdf pmma electrospun membranes was relatively high and there was a slight change before and after reduction this illustrated that although the sulfur sulfur bonds may have been reduced to sulfhydryl groups the pst molecules were not reduced to small molecules and separated from the composite membranes it turned out that the structure and morphology of the pst containing membranes did not change after reduction and reduction did not result in a loss of sulfur atoms from the membrane in summary through studying the changes in the structure and properties of the membranes before and after reduction it was demonstrated that the uniform and continuous fiber membranes were obtained and after reduction stimulation the surface morphology and structure properties of the membranes remained essentially unchanged but the thiol content and hydrophilicity were increased which were conducive to the adsorption of heavy metal ions in aqueous solution during the subsequent experiments 3 3 adsorption of heavy metal ions on electrospun fiber membrane electrospun fiber membranes possess porous nanostructures increasing the porosity of a membrane can promote the physical adsorption of metal ions at the same time the higher porosity increases the contact between the adsorbent and heavy metal ions and thus the chemical adsorption performance also increases therefore we introduced masq which possesses a porous structure to improve the porosity of the membranes the structure of masq is shown in fig s4 si in addition masq contains numerous double bonds and it can react with the sulfhydryl groups of pst under uv irradiation which can increase the content of the adsorbent pst in the membrane in this way the physical and chemical adsorption capacity of pst containing electrospun membranes can be increased simultaneously it was found that the hydrophilicity and thiol content of the membrane coated with pst increased after the reduction response stimulation which can further improve the adsorption capacity we used sulfur based materials as a new adsorbents and improve their adsorption efficiency under the stimulation of reduction the adsorbent had the advantages of simple preparation cheap raw materials low adsorption cost and high performance price ratio four metal ions including cd ii cr iii ni ii and hg ii were selected for the adsorption experiments the effects of different reduction degrees and adsorption times on the adsorption of metal ions onto pst coated membranes before and after reduction were studied in aqueous solutions which each had an of initial metal ions concentration of 100 ppm 3 4 adsorption effect of membrane on different heavy metal ions before and after reduction firstly different membranes were treated with a reducing agent tcep hcl and then the membranes with the same size were respectively soaked in aqueous solutions with four kinds of metal ions with an initial concentration of 100 ppm in each case after soaking for the same length of time the membranes were retrieved from these solutions the changes in the ion concentration before and after adsorption were tested by aas and afs and the adsorption capacity was calculated via eq 1 which is shown in section 2 5 the adsorption capacities of a blank control group a pure pvdf pmma co spinning membrane also denoted as o and those of an l2 membrane for four metal ions before and after reduction are shown in fig 5 according to the changes in the adsorption capacities it could be inferred that the addition of pst enhanced the adsorption effect of the membrane for these four ions and the adsorption effect was also improved after reduction stimulation for the ni ii ion the adsorption capacities of the l2 membrane observed before and after reduction were very similar which indicated that the adsorbent in this membrane has a weak coordination affinity for ni ii ion with regard to the cr iii ion although the adsorption capacity of the l2 membrane increases greatly after reduction the adsorption capacity was still small relatively speaking the adsorption capacities of the l2 membrane for cd ii and hg ii ions were higher than the adsorption capacities for ni ii and cr iii ions and these adsorption effects were also significantly increased after reduction with this in mind the adsorption behavior of these two metal ions was studied next 3 4 1 effect of different reduction degrees of a membrane on adsorption of heavy metal ions the results obtained from an investigation of the effect of the reducing agent tcep hcl concentration on heavy metal ion adsorption by the membrane are shown in fig 6 when the effect of different membrane reduction degrees on cd ii and hg ii adsorption was studied it was evident that increasing the reducing agent concentration up to 3 wt imparted the l2 membrane with a higher adsorption capacity but this capacity diminished when the reducing agent was increased further to 5 wt this loss of adsorption capacity in the latter case may be due to the excessive reduction of pst which caused a small amount of s chain segment of the pst to fall off from the membrane thus weakening the ion coordination between the adsorbent and metal ions for cd ii and hg ii the l2 r2 membrane treated with 3 wt reducing agent thus had the best adsorption effect however the adsorption capacity of the membrane l2 r1 that was stimulated by 1 wt reducing agent tcep hcl was only slightly lower than that stimulated by 3 wt reducing agent considering the cost of the reducing agent tcep hcl a reducing agent concentration of 1 wt was still used to stimulate the membrane in subsequent experiments 3 4 2 effect of different membranes on mercury ion adsorption the effects of the pst content on the adsorption capacities of various membranes were also investigated the adsorption capacities of l and p membranes with the same reduction degree for hg ii ions with an initial concentration of 100 ppm in aqueous solution are shown in fig 7 it was found that a better adsorption effect was achieved when the addition ratio of pst was 100 wt compared with the mass of pvdf pmma in comparison with that achieved with lower ratios this may be due to the fact that as the ratio of pst increased the thiol group content would also be increased and thus the coordination ability with metal ions would be stronger however when the pst content exceeded 100 wt the compatibility between pst and pvdf pmma became poor consequently the content of pst in the electro spun membrane decreased and the adsorption capacity diminished 3 4 3 effect of sodium ions interference on adsorption of heavy metal ions the interference of sodium ions on the adsorption of heavy metal ions was also studied as shown in fig 8 a and 8b when a 10 ppm sodium chloride was added the adsorption of hg ii ions was not affected after reduction the adsorption effects of the l and p membranes were still significantly increased and they was not weaker than those observed prior to the addition of sodium ions as shown in fig 7 in fig 8c and 8d the adsorption of cd ii ions was not influenced by the presence of 10 ppm sodium chloride as was the case with hg ii ions the adsorption effects of the l and p membranes for cd ii ions were strengthened after reduction treatment and the absorption performance was not weakened from that observed prior to the addition of sodium ions as shown in fig 6 the comprehensive analysis results indicated that the addition of sodium ions in aqueous solution did not affect the adsorption effect of the pst containing membrane toward hg ii and cd ii ions 3 4 4 effect of different adsorption times on adsorption of heavy metal ions the change of adsorption capacity for metal ions with soaking time was studied and the kinetic model of the ion adsorption was established after reduction the electrospun membranes coated with pst were soaked in aqueous solutions containing hg ii or cd ii ions at an initial concentration of 100 ppm and then the corresponding ion concentration was detected at different time points and the adsorption values at these different times were calculated the adsorption data obtained for hg ii ions are shown in fig 9 a and c while the adsorption data obtained for cd ii ions are shown in fig 9b and d it can be seen from fig 9 that with the passage of adsorption time the adsorption capacity gradually increased until an equilibrium was reached the adsorption of hg ii ions reached the peak after 24 h and the adsorption of cd ii ions reached the peak after 10 h for the l2 membrane the highest hg ii ions adsorption was 58 mg g 1 and the highest cd ii ions adsorption was 34 mg g 1 meanwhile the p2 membrane exhibited a maximum hg ii ions adsorption of 45 mg g 1 and a maximum cd ii ions adsorption of 31 mg g 1 according to the time curve data for the adsorption capacities of the membranes for hg ii and cd ii ions shown in fig 9 the kinetic models of the adsorption of heavy metal ions onto electrospun membrane were studied pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion models were used to study the adsorption capacities of l2 and p2 membranes for hg ii and cd ii ions after reduction these three models are shown in eqs 2 4 32 34 2 1 q t k 1 q e t 1 q e 3 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e 4 q t k ip t 0 5 c where q t is the adsorption value mg g 1 corresponding to time t q e is the saturated adsorption value mg g 1 meanwhile k 1 k 2 and k ip are the adsorption rate constants of the pseudo first order kinetic model pseudo second order kinetic model and intraparticle diffusion model respectively 43 44 fig 10 and figs s5 s7 si described the three kinetic models of the adsorption of hg ii and cd ii ions onto l2 and p2 membranes respectively 45 47 the calculation parameters were shown in tables s2 and s3 si comparing the linear relationship of the three curves it could be inferred that the r 2 value of the pseudo second order kinetic model was larger than that of the other two models meanwhile the saturated adsorption value calculated by the pseudo second order kinetic model was quite close to the maximum adsorption value measured these results showed that the pseudo second order kinetic model was more suitable for describing the membrane adsorption process the adsorption of the metal ions onto the pst loaded reduced fiber membrane was primarily achieved via a combination of physical and chemical processes at the beginning physical adsorption was the main process as the adsorption process proceeded a certain amount of metal ions were adsorbed onto the membrane surface and the concentration of ions in the solution decreased and thus the adsorption rate was diminished consequently chemical adsorption became the dominant factor during the later stages of the adsorption process 4 conclusion we studied the reduction products of polymeric sulfur monoterpene pst with different reducing agent concentrations and determined that the sulfhydryl content in pst could be increased under the action of tris 2 carboxyethyl phosphine hydrochloride tcep hcl in this paper pst pvdf and pmma were co spun into a uniform and continuous fiber membrane by electrospinning technology in addition the hydrophilicity of the membrane was increased under the stimulation of reduction and the basic structure of the membrane was not destroyed finally the effects of pst on cd ii cr iii ni ii and hg ii adsorption by the membrane were studied by using the coordination effect of thiol groups on metal ions the adsorption effect of four metal ions with an initial concentration of 100 ppm in aqueous solutions were respectively studied the experimental results showed that the best adsorption effect was observed for cd ii and hg ii ions when the pst loaded fiber membrane was stimulated by reduction the adsorption effect was also significantly enhanced the best adsorption effect was achieved following stimulation by the reductant at a concentration of 3 wt weight proportion of pst and this enhancement effect was most notable for hg ii ions the maximum adsorption of hg ii and cd ii were 58 and 34 mg g 1 respectively when the amount of pst added to the spinning membrane was 100 wt the proportion of the total mass of pvdf and pmma the effect of pst on cd ii and hg ii was the best after reduction meanwhile the addition of sodium ions did not interfere with the adsorption of cd ii and hg ii by the pst containing electrospun membrane the pseudo second order kinetic model was used to describe the adsorption of cd ii and hg ii onto the membrane this indicated that the adsorption of the heavy metals onto the pst loaded electrospun membrane proceeded via a combination of physical adsorption and chemical adsorption processes these results indicated that the pst could generate more thiol groups under the stimulation of reduction after the pst was loaded on pvdf pmma the adsorption of heavy metal ions increased significantly under the stimulation of reduction the preparation method of adsorbent pst used in this experiment is simple and sulfur as raw material was cheap and easy to obtain however it is still necessary to study how to treat the adsorbed membrane materials and improve

13367,sulfur containing polymers such as those with polysulfide linkages in their backbone have attracted strong interest due to the ease of modifying the structure and properties of these materials electrospun fiber membranes have large specific surface areas adjustable microstructures and chemical properties and recovery consequently these materials are promising candidates for applications as sorbents for heavy metal enrichment and water remediation herein polymeric sulfur monoterpene pst was loaded into a polyvinylidene poly methyl methacrylate pvdf pmma polymer matrix by electrospinning technology to obtain a uniform and continuous fiber based membrane it was found that treatment with a reducing agent increased the thiol group content in pst then by using the coordination and binding effect between sulfhydryl groups and metal ions it was found that the adsorption of cd ii cr iii ni ii and hg ii ions onto the membrane was enhanced under the stimulation of reduction the results indicated that the reduction responsive adsorption of hg ii and cd ii was the best with maximum adsorption values of 58 and 34 mg g 1 for each of these respective ions in addition the presence of sodium ions did not interfere with the adsorption of hg ii or cd ii ions the adsorption kinetics of hg ii and cd ii ions on the reduced membrane at different times were also studied the results revealed that the adsorption of hg ii and cd ii ions onto the reduced membrane conforms to the pseudo second order kinetic model these results indicated that pst can removal of heavy metal ions from wastewater via a convenient and reusable adsorption process graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords sulfur electrospun membranes reduction mercury ions 1 introduction pollution is becoming a pressing issue as the development of industrial technology progresses in particular water and soil pollution poses a direct threat to human health and safety soil and water have vital roles in supporting human life and are key components of ecosystems therefore the accumulation of heavy metal pollution in soil and water presents a serious problem and the removal of these heavy metals is one of the important challenges of environmental governance 1 4 according to the directive 2008 105 ec of the european union parliament and the european council heavy metals such as lead pb cadmium cd and mercury hg are considered as benchmarks for the evaluation of water quality on the basis of their concentrations mercury ions are one of the most toxic and harmful pollutants in aqueous environments and thus mercury is still toxic at low doses 5 a variety of methods are typically used to remove heavy metal ions from wastewater such as chemical precipitation ion exchange membrane separation electrochemical treatment and adsorption 6 7 35 38 among them the adsorption method is one of the most promising strategies as it offers the advantages of simple operation high efficiency and low operating costs 8 mercury is a soft lewis acid and consequently sulfur can have a high binding affinity with hg 9 therefore sulfur based materials are considered to be highly effective sorbents for mercury in addition the choice of adsorbent is the main consumption cost of membrane adsorption of heavy metal ions because of its low cost if sulfur based materials can be used as adsorbents the cost of heavy metal removal will be reduced in recent years more and more attention has been paid to the utilization of a large number of industrial by products sulfur 10 12 as an industrial waste sulfur has the advantages of large output low cost and easy access sulfur has been used as polysulfide rubber in traditional applications but this rubber can decompose into small molecules at elevated temperatures 13 however the stability of sulfur based polymer chains can be improved when they are combined with carbon based polymers previously pyun et al had introduced an inverse vulcanization method for copolymerizing sulfur with divinylic comonomers diisopropenylbenzene to afford high sulfur content cs copolymers 14 17 in our previous work the polymeric sulfur monoterpene pst was synthesized from sulfur and monoterpenes with good yields high sulfur content and excellent solubility characterization of pst revealed that it contained cs ss and sh bonds 18 considering the properties of these chemical bonds various applications of these copolymers can be envisioned for examples the disulfide bond can be oxidized or reduced to sulfone and sulfoxide or sulfhydryl groups which can then coordinate with metal ions to enable the adsorption of heavy metal ions from wastewater solution 19 20 we used two kinds of polysulfide synthesized before as adsorbent to compare the adsorption effect of the two adsorbents because of the difference of sulfhydryl content between the two polysulfides the adsorption effect may be affected electrospun fiber membranes have large specific surface areas controllable microstructures and chemical properties and are easy to recycle and reuse and thus they have strong potential for use in the preparation of sorbents for heavy metal ions 6 21 22 there are two main mechanisms for the adsorption of heavy metal ions in aqueous solution physical adsorption and chemical adsorption 23 24 due to the porous structures of fiber based membranes the contact area between a membrane and a solution can be increased when a fiber membrane comes into contact with the solution physical adsorption occurs at the interface generally physical adsorption is achieved via van der waals forces or intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions which are relatively weak and offer low adsorption capacities meanwhile the main forces involved with chemisorption are coordination binding chemical bonding forces and electrostatic forces among which the formation of coordination complexes is the most common in the study of heavy metal ion adsorption as carriers of adsorbents polymers with good chemical and physical stability and spinnability are generally selected for polymer co spinning fiber membrane 25 27 in this study polyvinylidene pvdf and poly methyl methacrylate pmma were selected as a co spinning system to generate fiber based membranes as described herein electrospinning technology was used to spin pst into membranes which were used to adsorb heavy metal ions after reduction stimulation so as to achieve an enhanced adsorption performance electro spun fiber membranes have a variety of desirable characteristics such as large specific surface areas high porosities and facile recovery 21 28 39 42 therefore the loading of pst onto electro spun fibers can increase the contact area between metal ions and sulfur based materials thus enhancing the adsorption efficiency octakis methacryloxypropyl silsesquioxane masq was also employed in this work and connected with pst via thiol ene click chemistry 29 30 this not only increased the load of pst but also increased the specific surface area of the membrane with regard to the adsorption of heavy metal ions onto the fiber membrane the effect of reduction pst was first studied and then the reduction stimulation of the composite fiber membrane loaded with pst was studied finally we investigated the adsorption effect of the membrane on specific heavy metal ions in aqueous solutions 2 experimental section 2 1 materials n n dimethylacetamide benzophenone tetrahydrofuran ethanol dichloromethane sodium thiosulfate iodine soluble

monoterpenes account for 40 of the total mass of sulfur and monoterpenes distilled water was used in the experiment thread dispensing syringe stainless steel needle guangzhou rui jian instrument co ltd 2 2 characterization fourier transform infrared ft ir spectra were measured with a bruker tensor 27 infrared spectrophotometer elemental analysis was performed with a perkin elmer 2400 ea analyzer

temperature up to 250 c at a heating rate of 10 c min 1 under nitrogen atmosphere contact angle measurements were performed with the use of a dataphysics oca20 goniometer scanning electron microscopy sem images were recorded with a s 4800 system hitachi japan size exclusion chromatography sec measurements were performed in thf on a breeze system following universal calibration with poly styrene standards atomic absorption spectrometry aas characterization was performed with a za3000 system that was operated in the blaze mode atomic fluorescence spectrometry afs measurements were performed with a afs 9710 system haiguang instrument analytical quality assurance quality control qa qc were conducted with standard curves method blanks solvent and reagent blanks as well as 10 replicate samples in each sample batch 2 3 preparation of the electrospun fiber membrane first pmma and pvdf were added into a mixed solution denoted as a and the mass ratio of pvdf pmma was 3 1 subsequently the pst was added into solution b the solutions a and b were mixed evenly and masq and benzophenone were then added to this combined solution this solution then underwent electrospinning at a rate of 1 3 ml h 1 a working voltage between 12 and 16 kv and a drum rate of 30 r min 1 a light yellow membrane was obtained by post treatment a series of different membranes were obtained by changing the mass ratio between pst and pvdf pmma 2 4 reductive stimulus response experiment pst was weighed and dissolved in a small amount of thf and then dissolved in water with a certain mass ratio of tcep hcl after magnetic stirring at room temperature for several hours the reduced product was obtained after post treatment is denoted as pst r the reduction response of membrane was similar to the former 2 5 adsorption of heavy metals on spinning membrane the electrospun membrane was cut into 3 cm2 square section and weighed to determine its mass m and then soaked in an aqueous solution containing a reducing agent after this solution containing the membrane samples had been stirred for 1 3 h each sample was washed multiple times with ethanol and distilled water finally the electrospun film that had underwent reduction was obtained after drying treatment with the respective samples being named p1 r p2 r and p3 r as well as l1 r l2 r and l3 r see table 1 in addition by changing the reducing agent concentration the membranes with different degrees of reduction stimulation were obtained the reducing agent concentrations were 1 wt 3 wt and 5 wt of pst and the resultant membranes were thus denoted l r1 l r2 l r3 or p r1 p r2 and p r3 respectively detailed named was shown in table s1 si aqueous solutions of various heavy metals were respectively prepared a certain initial concentration c 0 the adsorption experiments were then performed by soaking each membrane sample in 10 ml of the aforementioned heavy metal aqueous solution under stirring for a designated length of time v represents the volume of membrane immersion the experiment was immersed in 10 ml solution when the designated adsorption time was reached the concentration of the heavy metal aqueous solution was measure and then the adsorption capacity of the membrane q was calculated via eq 1 31 1 q c 0 c m v 3 results and discussion 3 1 properties of pst after reduction disulfide bonds have redox activity and can be reduced to form sulfhydryl group the analysis of polymeric sulfur monoterpenes pst synthesized in the laboratory revealed that it contains numerous sulfur chains although it is not a single disulfide bond the fracture activation energy of a sulfur sulfur bond is still lower than that of a carbon sulfur bond so pst can potentially form more thiol groups under the action of a reducing agent fig 1 shows the ft ir spectra that were recorded before and after the reduction of pst from these spectra it could be seen that the peak shape of pst remains essentially unchanged after the reduction stimulation which indicated that the reduction will not affect the basic structure of pst however sulfhydryl groups do not exhibit readily discernible signals in the infrared spectrum so the reduction effect can only be verified by other methods as shown in fig 2 it was the uv vis curves before and after the reduction of pst by analyzing the absorbance values of the tested samples at the same concentration it was found that the absorbance value of pst decreases after reduction which may have been due to the cleavage of the ss bond so that the conjugation sulfur content decreases therefore it can be inferred that more sulfhydryl groups were generated after the reduction of pst the absorbance value of pst decreased more when the reducing agent concentration was increased but the extent of this decrease did not change further after the reducing agent concentration had exceeded 5 wt the thiol group content in each pst sample was quantified by chemical titration and the corresponding values are shown in table 2 from the changes in the sulfhydryl group content before and after reduction of pst it was evident that the pst samples possessed more thiol groups after reduction and the extent to which the thiol group content had increased was similar to that determined via uv vis spectroscopy analysis in summary pst could form more thiol groups in response to chemical reduction although its basic structure remained unchanged the formation of these thiol groups which can readily coordinate with heavy metal ions provided a basis for our subsequent research on the adsorption of metal ions onto pst loaded electrospun fiber membranes which had been treated with a reducing agent 3 2 properties of the electrospun fiber membrane fig 3 shows the ft ir spectra of a pure electrospun pvdf pmma membrane o and an electrospun pvdf pmma membrane that had been coated with pst before and after reduction first of all the infrared spectrum of the membrane coated with pst exhibited a characteristic peak at 1728 cm 1 corresponding to the co stretching vibration of an ester group peak a band at 1401 cm 1 corresponding to the hydrocarbon deformation vibration in cf2 ch2 and a signal at 1183 cm 1 representing the stretching vibration peak of cf2 which indicated that the co spinning matrix comprised of pst and pvdf pmma formed a uniform and continuous fiber membrane secondly the characteristic peaks exhibited by the mixtures still existed after the reduction of the membrane which showed that the structure of the membranes had not been destroyed in addition it could be inferred that pst was indeed loaded on the electrospun fiber membrane from the yellow color of the membrane fig s1 in the supplementary information si shows the dsc curves of o and of the pvdf pmma electrospun membrane coated with pst before and after reduction the results illustrated that the thermal deformation temperature of the membranes was about 133 c and the characteristics of the heat flux curve were similar which indicated that the thermal properties of the pst loaded membranes remained almost unchanged after reduction pvdf and pmma are hydrophobic polymers and the pst is also insoluble in aqueous solution and thus the fiber membrane obtained by their co spinning would be a hydrophobic membrane in order to increase the contact between the membrane and aqueous solution so as to enhance the adsorption efficiency it is important to improve the hydrophilicity of the membrane with this in mind it is expected that the amount of hydrophilic groups can be increased via reduction to improve the hydrophilicity the hydrophilicity of the membrane can be evaluated by measuring the contact angle the water contact angles exhibited by o and the pst loaded electrospun pvdf pmma membrane before and after reduction are shown in fig s2 si the contact angles of pst loaded pvdf pmma membranes decreased after reduction and with an increasing reducing agent concentration the contact angle decreased to a greater degree these results demonstrated that the hydrophilicity of the membranes could be increased and the contact between the membrane and aqueous solution could be promoted by reducing stimulation which was beneficial to the adsorption of heavy metal ions sem images displaying the morphology of the pst loaded electrospun pvdf pmma membrane before and after reduction are shown in fig 4 and it can be seen that the fiber based structure of the reduced spinning membranes were not broken from the small resolution sem images it is evident that pst molecules were evenly distributed throughout the pvdf pmma materials and there was no pst aggregation phenomenon indicating that the obtained fiber membranes had a continuous and uniform structure the eds analysis data are provided in fig s3 si the sulfur content of the pst loaded pvdf pmma electrospun membranes was relatively high and there was a slight change before and after reduction this illustrated that although the sulfur sulfur bonds may have been reduced to sulfhydryl groups the pst molecules were not reduced to small molecules and separated from the composite membranes it turned out that the structure and morphology of the pst containing membranes did not change after reduction and reduction did not result in a loss of sulfur atoms from the membrane in summary through studying the changes in the structure and properties of the membranes before and after reduction it was demonstrated that the uniform and continuous fiber membranes were obtained and after reduction stimulation the surface morphology and structure properties of the membranes remained essentially unchanged but the thiol content and hydrophilicity were increased which were conducive to the adsorption of heavy metal ions in aqueous solution during the subsequent experiments 3 3 adsorption of heavy metal ions on electrospun fiber membrane electrospun fiber membranes possess porous nanostructures increasing the porosity of a membrane can promote the physical adsorption of metal ions at the same time the higher porosity increases the contact between the adsorbent and heavy metal ions and thus the chemical adsorption performance also increases therefore we introduced masq which possesses a porous structure to improve the porosity of the membranes the structure of masq is shown in fig s4 si in addition masq contains numerous double bonds and it can react with the sulfhydryl groups of pst under uv irradiation which can increase the content of the adsorbent pst in the membrane in this way the physical and chemical adsorption capacity of pst containing electrospun membranes can be increased simultaneously it was found that the hydrophilicity and thiol content of the membrane coated with pst increased after the reduction response stimulation which can further improve the adsorption capacity we used sulfur based materials as a new adsorbents and improve their adsorption efficiency under the stimulation of reduction the adsorbent had the advantages of simple preparation cheap raw materials low adsorption cost and high performance price ratio four metal ions including cd ii cr iii ni ii and hg ii were selected for the adsorption experiments the effects of different reduction degrees and adsorption times on the adsorption of metal ions onto pst coated membranes before and after reduction were studied in aqueous solutions which each had an of initial metal ions concentration of 100 ppm 3 4 adsorption effect of membrane on different heavy metal ions before and after reduction firstly different membranes were treated with a reducing agent tcep hcl and then the membranes with the same size were respectively soaked in aqueous solutions with four kinds of metal ions with an initial concentration of 100 ppm in each case after soaking for the same length of time the membranes were retrieved from these solutions the changes in the ion concentration before and after adsorption were tested by aas and afs and the adsorption capacity was calculated via eq 1 which is shown in section 2 5 the adsorption capacities of a blank control group a pure pvdf pmma co spinning membrane also denoted as o and those of an l2 membrane for four metal ions before and after reduction are shown in fig 5 according to the changes in the adsorption capacities it could be inferred that the addition of pst enhanced the adsorption effect of the membrane for these four ions and the adsorption effect was also improved after reduction stimulation for the ni ii ion the adsorption capacities of the l2 membrane observed before and after reduction were very similar which indicated that the adsorbent in this membrane has a weak coordination affinity for ni ii ion with regard to the cr iii ion although the adsorption capacity of the l2 membrane increases greatly after reduction the adsorption capacity was still small relatively speaking the adsorption capacities of the l2 membrane for cd ii and hg ii ions were higher than the adsorption capacities for ni ii and cr iii ions and these adsorption effects were also significantly increased after reduction with this in mind the adsorption behavior of these two metal ions was studied next 3 4 1 effect of different reduction degrees of a membrane on adsorption of heavy metal ions the results obtained from an investigation of the effect of the reducing agent tcep hcl concentration on heavy metal ion adsorption by the membrane are shown in fig 6 when the effect of different membrane reduction degrees on cd ii and hg ii adsorption was studied it was evident that increasing the reducing agent concentration up to 3 wt imparted the l2 membrane with a higher adsorption capacity but this capacity diminished when the reducing agent was increased further to 5 wt this loss of adsorption capacity in the latter case may be due to the excessive reduction of pst which caused a small amount of s chain segment of the pst to fall off from the membrane thus weakening the ion coordination between the adsorbent and metal ions for cd ii and hg ii the l2 r2 membrane treated with 3 wt reducing agent thus had the best adsorption effect however the adsorption capacity of the membrane l2 r1 that was stimulated by 1 wt reducing agent tcep hcl was only slightly lower than that stimulated by 3 wt reducing agent considering the cost of the reducing agent tcep hcl a reducing agent concentration of 1 wt was still used to stimulate the membrane in subsequent experiments 3 4 2 effect of different membranes on mercury ion adsorption the effects of the pst content on the adsorption capacities of various membranes were also investigated the adsorption capacities of l and p membranes with the same reduction degree for hg ii ions with an initial concentration of 100 ppm in aqueous solution are shown in fig 7 it was found that a better adsorption effect was achieved when the addition ratio of pst was 100 wt compared with the mass of pvdf pmma in comparison with that achieved with lower ratios this may be due to the fact that as the ratio of pst increased the thiol group content would also be increased and thus the coordination ability with metal ions would be stronger however when the pst content exceeded 100 wt the compatibility between pst and pvdf pmma became poor consequently the content of pst in the electro spun membrane decreased and the adsorption capacity diminished 3 4 3 effect of sodium ions interference on adsorption of heavy metal ions the interference of sodium ions on the adsorption of heavy metal ions was also studied as shown in fig 8 a and 8b when a 10 ppm sodium chloride was added the adsorption of hg ii ions was not affected after reduction the adsorption effects of the l and p membranes were still significantly increased and they was not weaker than those observed prior to the addition of sodium ions as shown in fig 7 in fig 8c and 8d the adsorption of cd ii ions was not influenced by the presence of 10 ppm sodium chloride as was the case with hg ii ions the adsorption effects of the l and p membranes for cd ii ions were strengthened after reduction treatment and the absorption performance was not weakened from that observed prior to the addition of sodium ions as shown in fig 6 the comprehensive analysis results indicated that the addition of sodium ions in aqueous solution did not affect the adsorption effect of the pst containing membrane toward hg ii and cd ii ions 3 4 4 effect of different adsorption times on adsorption of heavy metal ions the change of adsorption capacity for metal ions with soaking time was studied and the kinetic model of the ion adsorption was established after reduction the electrospun membranes coated with pst were soaked in aqueous solutions containing hg ii or cd ii ions at an initial concentration of 100 ppm and then the corresponding ion concentration was detected at different time points and the adsorption values at these different times were calculated the adsorption data obtained for hg ii ions are shown in fig 9 a and c while the adsorption data obtained for cd ii ions are shown in fig 9b and d it can be seen from fig 9 that with the passage of adsorption time the adsorption capacity gradually increased until an equilibrium was reached the adsorption of hg ii ions reached the peak after 24 h and the adsorption of cd ii ions reached the peak after 10 h for the l2 membrane the highest hg ii ions adsorption was 58 mg g 1 and the highest cd ii ions adsorption was 34 mg g 1 meanwhile the p2 membrane exhibited a maximum hg ii ions adsorption of 45 mg g 1 and a maximum cd ii ions adsorption of 31 mg g 1 according to the time curve data for the adsorption capacities of the membranes for hg ii and cd ii ions shown in fig 9 the kinetic models of the adsorption of heavy metal ions onto electrospun membrane were studied pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion models were used to study the adsorption capacities of l2 and p2 membranes for hg ii and cd ii ions after reduction these three models are shown in eqs 2 4 32 34 2 1 q t k 1 q e t 1 q e 3 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e 4 q t k ip t 0 5 c where q t is the adsorption value mg g 1 corresponding to time t q e is the saturated adsorption value mg g 1 meanwhile k 1 k 2 and k ip are the adsorption rate constants of the pseudo first order kinetic model pseudo second order kinetic model and intraparticle diffusion model respectively 43 44 fig 10 and figs s5 s7 si described the three kinetic models of the adsorption of hg ii and cd ii ions onto l2 and p2 membranes respectively 45 47 the calculation parameters were shown in tables s2 and s3 si comparing the linear relationship of the three curves it could be inferred that the r 2 value of the pseudo second order kinetic model was larger than that of the other two models meanwhile the saturated adsorption value calculated by the pseudo second order kinetic model was quite close to the maximum adsorption value measured these results showed that the pseudo second order kinetic model was more suitable for describing the membrane adsorption process the adsorption of the metal ions onto the pst loaded reduced fiber membrane was primarily achieved via a combination of physical and chemical processes at the beginning physical adsorption was the main process as the adsorption process proceeded a certain amount of metal ions were adsorbed onto the membrane surface and the concentration of ions in the solution decreased and thus the adsorption rate was diminished consequently chemical adsorption became the dominant factor during the later stages of the adsorption process 4 conclusion we studied the reduction products of polymeric sulfur monoterpene pst with different reducing agent concentrations and determined that the sulfhydryl content in pst could be increased under the action of tris 2 carboxyethyl phosphine hydrochloride tcep hcl in this paper pst pvdf and pmma were co spun into a uniform and continuous fiber membrane by electrospinning technology in addition the hydrophilicity of the membrane was increased under the stimulation of reduction and the basic structure of the membrane was not destroyed finally the effects of pst on cd ii cr iii ni ii and hg ii adsorption by the membrane were studied by using the coordination effect of thiol groups on metal ions the adsorption effect of four metal ions with an initial concentration of 100 ppm in aqueous solutions were respectively studied the experimental results showed that the best adsorption effect was observed for cd ii and hg ii ions when the pst loaded fiber membrane was stimulated by reduction the adsorption effect was also significantly enhanced the best adsorption effect was achieved following stimulation by the reductant at a concentration of 3 wt weight proportion of pst and this enhancement effect was most notable for hg ii ions the maximum adsorption of hg ii and cd ii were 58 and 34 mg g 1 respectively when the amount of pst added to the spinning membrane was 100 wt the proportion of the total mass of pvdf and pmma the effect of pst on cd ii and hg ii was the best after reduction meanwhile the addition of sodium ions did not interfere with the adsorption of cd ii and hg ii by the pst containing electrospun membrane the pseudo second order kinetic model was used to describe the adsorption of cd ii and hg ii onto the membrane this indicated that the adsorption of the heavy metals onto the pst loaded electrospun membrane proceeded via a combination of physical adsorption and chemical adsorption processes these results indicated that the pst could generate more thiol groups under the stimulation of reduction after the pst was loaded on pvdf pmma the adsorption of heavy metal ions increased significantly under the stimulation of reduction the preparation method of adsorbent pst used in this experiment is simple and sulfur as raw material was cheap and easy to obtain however it is still necessary to study how to treat the adsorbed membrane materials and improve the adsorption efficiency this study on the adsorption effect of heavy metals onto pst loaded electrospun fiber membranes which had been treated with a reducing agent tcep hcl provides valuable new insight into the behavior and roles of sulfur based materials which may lead to new applications for polymeric sulfur monoterpene pst in areas such as materials science biomedicine water remediation

13368,dissolved organic matter dom originated from livestock manure often co exists with cadmium ion cd in livestock effluent however the effects of dom on removal efficiency of cd by adsorbent remain unknown this study investigated the effects of dom originated from cattle manure on adsorption behaviors of cd by periphyton and the possible mechanisms were also explored through desorption analyses fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir determination and histochemical staining the adsorption kinetics and isotherm of cd by periphyton could be explained by pseudo second order model and freundlich model respectively dom addition did not change the adsorption kinetics and isotherm of periphyton toward cd but it decreased the adsorption capacity of cd by periphyton ion exchange and complexation were the main binding forces for the adsorption of cd by periphyton while the adsorption of cd by dom mainly through complexation amide and hydroxyl in the dom were involved in its adsorption toward cd and may contribute to the competition for cd with periphyton thus the decrease of dom concentration in livestock effluent is helpful to remove cd by periphyton adsorption keywords periphyton dissolved organic matter cadmium competitive adsorption desorption 1 introduction with development of livestock farming huge quantities of livestock manure annually are produced for example there is more than 1 5 billion tons of livestock manure annually produced in china 1 livestock manure may contain high level of heavy metals due to feed heavy metals containing feeds 2 cd in livestock manure would result in cd contamination in livestock effluents many approaches such as ion exchange precipitation and membrane separation are used to remove heavy metals from waste water 3 4 however most of these approaches are high energy consumption and or high costs and some of them may cause secondary pollution to environment 5 apart from these approaches adsorption is regarded as an environmentally friendly and low cost approach for heavy metals removal from waste waters 6 periphyton is a kind of microbial aggregates on the surface of matrices in water body it contains heterotrophic and autotrophic microorganisms including algae fungi bacteria protozoa and micrometazoa 7 periphyton is the most important primary producer in running waters 8 under heavy metals stress sensitive species in periphyton would be replaced by tolerant ones which increases the tolerance of periphyton to heavy metal stress 9 in addition the extracellular polymeric substances eps produced by periphyton contain polysaccharides and proteins which enrich hydroxyl carboxyl acetylated amino and some non carbohydrate constituents such as phosphate and sulfate 10 these anions could effectively bind with heavy metal ions 11 making periphyton to be a kind of good bio adsorbent toward heavy metals 12 livestock manure contains undissolved components such as lignin cellulose and dissolved components like dissolved organic matter dom nitrogen phosphorus and other dissolved mineral salts 13 14 the components of dom in livestock manure are very complex previous studies showed that dom enriched negative charged groups such as hydroxyl carboxylic acetylated amino which also had high affinities toward heavy metals 15 16 although the adsorption of cd by periphyton was investigated by previous study 17 the removal efficacy of cd by periphyton in the presence of dom are still obscure which may inhibit the application of periphyton in the management of cd containing livestock effluents to this knowledge gap the effects of dom on the adsorption characteristics of cd by periphyton were investigated in this study and also the possible mechanisms were explored through desorption analyses and ftir determination 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of dom cattle manures were obtained from cattle farm of hunan institute of animal husbandry veterinary

classifier v 2 2 with a confidence threshold of 0 7 2 3 adsorption process batch adsorption experiments were carried out in plastic vessels to study the effects of dom on adsorption characteristics of cd by periphyton the adsorption system contained 10 g fresh weight l periphyton and aliquot volumes of cd and dom stock solutions to study the adsorption of cd by periphyton under different dom concentrations dom stock solution was added into adsorption system at the levels of 5 10 and 20 v v which corresponded to a final dom concentration of 118 61 237 23 and 474 45 mg toc l respectively it

out on a shaker at 25 c with a rotation speed of 200 r min the adsorption process lasted 2 h our previous study showed that the adsorption reached equilibrium within 2 h the adsorption solution was then centrifuged at 12 000 g for 10 min the supernatant was transferred into a clean plastic vessel the concentration of cd in the supernatant was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas hitachi tokyo jp two models langmuir and freundlich were used to fit adsorption data to investigate adsorption isotherms of cd by periphyton with or without dom the equations of these models were

fitted by pseudo first order model seq 3 and pseudo second order model seq 4 2 4 desorption experiments after batch adsorption process in the adsorption system containing 5 mg l cd 10 g l periphyton and 237 23 mg toc l dom or without dom as the control treatment the adsorption solutions were then centrifuged at 12 000 g for 10 min the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was used to analyze desorption of cd from periphyton with or without dom treatments according to the method described by kuang et al 19 three desorbents viz deionized h2o or 2 mol l nh4no3 or 0 1 mol l edta 2na were used to desorb cd from periphyton respectively cd concentration in desorption solution was analyzed using aas as described above the ratio of desorbed cd to total adsorbed cd was regarded as desorption rate in addition desorption of cd from dom was also investigated adsorption of cd by dom was firstly carried out in plastic vessel the adsorption system contained 5 mg l cd and 237 23 mg toc l dom the ph of adsorption system was 7 0 adsorption process was carried out under the conditions as described above section 2 3 after equilibrium fifteen milliliters of each sample were placed in a dialysis bag with a molecular weight cut off of 500 1000 d and then placed into desorption solution for desorption process using deionized h2o or 2 mol l of nh4no3 or 0 1 mol l of edta 2na the desorption process lasted 2 h reached equilibrium the cd in the dialysis bag was regarded as un desorbed fraction and determined using aas 2 5 histochemical staining dithizone was dissolved in a mixture of acetone and distilled water 3 1 v v to obtain staining solution 20 the concentration of dithizone in staining solution was 0 5 mg ml the complex compound of dithizone with cd is red the periphyton before and after cd adsorption were sampled and placed into 6 ml fresh staining solution after staining for 3 4 h in darkness the solution on the surface of periphyton was rinsed with distilled h2o

freeze dried and then were ground in an agate mortar with potassium bromide spectral purity the infrared spectrums of the samples were scanned from 4000 to 400 cm 1 with a resolution of 4 cm 1 on an infrared spectrometer perkin elmer spectrum 65 ct usa 2 7 statistical analyses the significance of difference was analyzed by one way anova lsd after error variance equality check using levene s test difference was regarded as significant at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 bacterial community structure in periphyton based on microscope observation the main microorganisms in periphyton belonged to the domain of bacteria mainly as leptolyngbya spp cyanobacteria fig 1a thus bacterial community structure in periphyton was determined using pyrosequencing as shown in fig 1b the dominant prokaryotic phylum in periphyton was cyanobacteria accounting for 47 21 of total prokaryotes and then followed by proteobacteria accounting for 25 90 of total prokaryotes planctomycetes and bacteroidetes also highly presented in periphyton with the proportion of 7 47 and 5 61 respectively 3 2 effects of different dom concentrations the adsorptions of cd by periphyton under different dom concentrations are shown in fig 2 after dom addition the uptake of cd by periphyton was lower than that without dom addition with the increase of dom concentration the uptake of cd by periphyton decreased the negative effect of dom on the uptake of cd by periphyton reached plateau at a concentration of 237 23 mg l dom decreased approximately 30 of adsorption capacity of cd by periphyton at plateau stage 3 3 effects of dom on adsorption kinetics of cd by periphyton the adsorption kinetics of cd by periphyton or periphyton dom are shown in fig 3 the uptake of cd by periphyton or periphyton dom was quite fast during the first 30 min and then as time went on the adsorptional speed slowed down and eventually reached equilibrium within 120 min the amount of cd adsorbed by periphyton was higher than that by periphyton dom after adsorption equilibrium two adsorption kinetic models were used to fit adsorption data as shown in table 1 pseudo second order model was more suitable to explain the adsorption kinetics of cd by either periphyton or periphyton dom 3 4 different initial cd concentration and adsorption isotherm as shown in fig 4 the uptake of cd by periphyton or periphyton dom increased along with the rise of initial cd concentration at a same initial cd concentration the amount of cd adsorbed by periphyton dom was lower than that by pure periphyton two adsorption isothermal models the langmuir model and the freundlich model were used to fit the adsorption data the parameters originated from fitting are shown in table 2 for pure periphyton treatment the regression coefficient r 2 for freundlich model was higher than that for langmuir model in the treatment of periphyton dom the r 2 was 99 for either langmuir model or freundlich model 3 5 effect of ph on adsorption characteristics as shown in fig 5 ph had significant effects on the uptake of cd by periphyton or periphyton dom the uptake of cd by pure periphyton rapidly increased along with the increase of ph from 5 0 to 7 0 while it maintained stable levels at ph ranged from 4 0 to 5 0 and 7 0 to 8 0 for the periphyton dom treatment the amount of adsorbed cd increased at ph ranged from 4 0 to 7 0 but it showed no obvious variation at ph 7 0 8 0 3 6 desorption characteristics fig 6a shows the desorption rate of cd from periphyton or periphyton dom with different desorbents deionized h2o desorbed 1 23 and 2 65 of cd from periphyton and periphyton dom respectively the amount of cd desorbed from periphyton and periphyton dom by nh4no3 was 47 99 and 21 71 respectively the percentage of cd desorbed from periphyton by edta 2na was 89 23 and it was 67 96 for periphyton dom fig 6b shows the desorption rate of cd from dom by different desorbents the desorbents nh4no3 and edta 2na desorbed 11 49 and 56 26 of cd from dom respectively deionized h2o only removed 2 40 of cd from dom 3 7 histochemical detection of cd distributed on the periphyton cd can form reddish compound with dithizone no reddish spot presented on the surface of cd free periphyton fig 7a for the treatment of periphyton without dom intensive reddish spots distributed on the surface of algal trichome and reddish zone was observed in the matrix of periphyton after cd adsorption fig 7b reddish zone or dots were observed in the solution after shaking fig 7c the intensity of reddish spots decreased in the periphyton dom treatment fig 7d 3 8 characteristics of ftir fig 8 shows the vibrational spectra of periphyton and dom before and after cd adsorption the main frequency bands on periphyton were corresponding to stretching vibration of oh and nh 3388 3480 cm 1 formation vibration of amide i and ii 1602 1650 cm 1 stretching vibration of cn from purines and pyrimidines 1520 cm 1 formation vibration of oh 1392 cm 1 po of phosphodiester 1070 cm 1 after cd adsorption the frequency band 1650 cm 1 shifted to 1640 cm 1 and the frequency band 1602 cm 1 disappeared another frequency band at 1392 cm 1 shifted to 1382 cm 1 the frequency bands at 1602 cm 1 1520 cm 1 and 1070 cm 1 were weakened by cd adsorption for dom the main frequency bands were corresponding to stretching vibration of oh and nh 3388 3480 cm 1 formation vibration of amide ii 1620 1650 cm 1 formation vibration of oh 1392 cm 1 po of phosphodiester cd adsorption caused the shifting of the frequency bands from 1620 1650 cm 1 to 1576 1640 cm 1 another frequency band shifted from 1392 cm 1 to 1382 cm 1 a new frequency band corresponded to vibration of cdo 828 1 cm appeared in dom after cd adsorption 4 discussion periphyton is a kind of microbial aggregates the microorganisms in periphyton assemble and form aggregates through eps according to the binding intensity and physical structure eps could be divided into three groups sheath capsule and slime 21 the eps enrich anion groups which could effectively bind with heavy metal ions 21 the results of microscope observation and pyrosequencing showed that the dominant microorganisms in the periphyton in this study belonged to cyanobacteria mainly composed by an unclassified cyanobacterium and leptolyngbya species of leptolyngbya have the characteristic of obvious sheath on the surface of trichome 22 as shown in fig 7 the adsorbed cd indicated as reddish compound mainly distributed on the surface of algal trichome fig 7b after shaking some of which were released into water while some others still attached with algal trichome fig 7c these results indicated that both sheath and slime contributed for the adsorption of cd by periphyton yang et al 17 reported that the adsorption capacity of cd by periphyton was 101 75 236 29 mg kg under an initial cd concentration of 10 mg l the result presented in this study showed that the adsorption capacity of cd by periphyton at the same initial cd concentration was 448 67 mg kg slightly higher than that reported by yang et al 17 different community structure of periphyton may contribute for the different adsorption capacity langmuir model and freundlich model are used to explain monolayer adsorption and multilayer adsorption respectively 23 the results of adsorption isotherm fitting in this study showed that the freundlich model had a higher correlation coefficient than the langmuir model for the adsorption of cd by periphyton suggesting that this kind of adsorption belonged to multilayer adsorption although both langmuir model and freundlich model had high regression coefficient 99 after dom addition the q max deduced form langmuir model was much higher than that of experimental data thus langmuir model was not fit the adsorption of cd by periphyton dom generally k f is interpreted as an index of adsorption capacity higher k f value means higher adsorption capacity 24 according to the k f value shown in table 2 we concluded that the adsorption capacity of periphyton toward cd was weakened by dom the parameter n in freundlich model reflects the affinity between adsorbent and adsorbate 25 the n value in the treatment of pure periphyton was higher than that in the periphyton dom treatment implying that dom addition decreased the affinity between cd and periphyton in this study the adsorption process of cd by periphyton or periphyton dom was more suitable to be explained by the kinetics of pseud second order model which is used to explain chemisorption process 26 thus we conclude that the adsorption process of cd by periphyton or periphyton dom mainly controlled by chemisorption the results of desorption also confirmed this the fraction of cd desorbed by deionized h2o corresponds to physical adsorption 19 the fractions of cd desorbed by deionized h2o from periphyton or periphyton dom were less than 3 fig 6 indicating that rather than physical adsorption chemical adsorption was the main binding force between cd and periphyton in the treatments of with or without dom addition the desorbent nh4no3 releases the fractions of cd bound through physical adsorption and ion exchange while edta 2na desorbs the fractions of cd bound through physical adsorption ion exchange and complexation 19 our results showed that periphyton bound with cd mainly through ion exchange and complexation fig 6 while dom bound with cd mainly through complexation thus we deduce that dom decreased the adsorption of cd by periphyton through complexation compared the proportion of desorbed cd by nh4no3 and edta 2na the difference between periphyton and periphyton dom in edta 2na treatment was close to that in nh4no3 treatment which indirectly supports the hypothesis that dom decreased the adsorption of cd by periphyton mainly through complexation the results of ftir showed that the dom derived from cattle manure contained amide hydroxyl and other anion groups similar results were also observed in the dom originated from other sources 27 28 suggesting that these groups extensively exist in dom the groups of carboxyl hydroxyl carbonyl and amino in dom can form binary complexes with cd which does not continue to form ternary complexes with the surface of algae 29 therefore we speculate that dom derived from cattle manure competed with periphyton for adsorption of cd resulting in decrease of cd adsorption by periphyton 5 conclusion the effects and possible mechanisms of dom originated from cattle manure on adsorption of cd by periphyton were investigated in this study ion exchange and complexation were the main binding forces for the adsorption of cd by periphyton dom addition did not change the adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherm of periphyton toward cd but it decreased the adsorption capacity of cd by periphyton the amide and hydroxyl in the dom were the main functional groups involved in the competition for cd with periphyton declaration of competing interest the

13368,dissolved organic matter dom originated from livestock manure often co exists with cadmium ion cd in livestock effluent however the effects of dom on removal efficiency of cd by adsorbent remain unknown this study investigated the effects of dom originated from cattle manure on adsorption behaviors of cd by periphyton and the possible mechanisms were also explored through desorption analyses fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir determination and histochemical staining the adsorption kinetics and isotherm of cd by periphyton could be explained by pseudo second order model and freundlich model respectively dom addition did not change the adsorption kinetics and isotherm of periphyton toward cd but it decreased the adsorption capacity of cd by periphyton ion exchange and complexation were the main binding forces for the adsorption of cd by periphyton while the adsorption of cd by dom mainly through complexation amide and hydroxyl in the dom were involved in its adsorption toward cd and may contribute to the competition for cd with periphyton thus the decrease of dom concentration in livestock effluent is helpful to remove cd by periphyton adsorption keywords periphyton dissolved organic matter cadmium competitive adsorption desorption 1 introduction with development of livestock farming huge quantities of livestock manure annually are produced for example there is more than 1 5 billion tons of livestock manure annually produced in china 1 livestock manure may contain high level of heavy metals due to feed heavy metals containing feeds 2 cd in livestock manure would result in cd contamination in livestock effluents many approaches such as ion exchange precipitation and membrane separation are used to remove heavy metals from waste water 3 4 however most of these approaches are high energy consumption and or high costs and some of them may cause secondary pollution to environment 5 apart from these approaches adsorption is regarded as an environmentally friendly and low cost approach for heavy metals removal from waste waters 6 periphyton is a kind of microbial aggregates on the surface of matrices in water body it contains heterotrophic and autotrophic microorganisms including algae fungi bacteria protozoa and micrometazoa 7 periphyton is the most important primary producer in running waters 8 under heavy metals stress sensitive species in periphyton would be replaced by tolerant ones which increases the tolerance of periphyton to heavy metal stress 9 in addition the extracellular polymeric substances eps produced by periphyton contain polysaccharides and proteins which enrich hydroxyl carboxyl acetylated amino and some non carbohydrate constituents such as phosphate and sulfate 10 these anions could effectively bind with heavy metal ions 11 making periphyton to be a kind of good bio adsorbent toward heavy metals 12 livestock manure contains undissolved components such as lignin cellulose and dissolved components like dissolved organic matter dom nitrogen phosphorus and other dissolved mineral salts 13 14 the components of dom in livestock manure are very complex previous studies showed that dom enriched negative charged groups such as hydroxyl carboxylic acetylated amino which also had high affinities toward heavy metals 15 16 although the adsorption of cd by periphyton was investigated by previous study 17 the removal efficacy of cd by periphyton in the presence of dom are still obscure which may inhibit the application of periphyton in the management of cd containing livestock effluents to this knowledge gap the effects of dom on the adsorption characteristics of cd by periphyton were investigated in this study and also the possible mechanisms were explored through desorption analyses and ftir determination 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of dom cattle manures were obtained from cattle farm of hunan institute of animal husbandry veterinary

desorption of cd from periphyton with or without dom treatments according to the method described by kuang et al 19 three desorbents viz deionized h2o or 2 mol l nh4no3 or 0 1 mol l edta 2na were used to desorb cd from periphyton respectively cd concentration in desorption solution was analyzed using aas as described above the ratio of desorbed cd to total adsorbed cd was regarded as desorption

difference was regarded as significant at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 bacterial community structure in periphyton based on microscope observation the main microorganisms in periphyton belonged to the domain of bacteria mainly as leptolyngbya spp cyanobacteria fig 1a thus bacterial community structure in periphyton was determined using pyrosequencing as shown in fig 1b the dominant prokaryotic phylum in periphyton was cyanobacteria accounting for 47 21 of total prokaryotes and then followed by proteobacteria accounting for 25 90 of total prokaryotes planctomycetes and bacteroidetes also highly presented in periphyton with the proportion of 7 47 and 5 61 respectively 3 2 effects of different dom concentrations the adsorptions of cd by periphyton under different dom concentrations are shown in fig 2 after dom addition the uptake of cd by periphyton was lower than that without dom addition with the increase of dom concentration the uptake of cd by periphyton decreased the negative effect of dom on the uptake of cd by periphyton reached plateau at a concentration of 237 23 mg l dom decreased approximately 30 of adsorption capacity of cd by periphyton at plateau stage 3 3 effects of dom on adsorption kinetics of cd by periphyton the adsorption kinetics of cd by periphyton or periphyton dom are shown in fig 3 the uptake of cd by periphyton or periphyton dom was quite fast during the first 30 min and then as time went on the adsorptional speed slowed down and eventually reached equilibrium within 120 min the amount of cd adsorbed by periphyton was higher than that by periphyton dom after adsorption equilibrium two adsorption kinetic models were used to fit adsorption data as shown in table 1 pseudo second order model was more suitable to explain the adsorption kinetics of cd by either periphyton or periphyton dom 3 4 different initial cd concentration and adsorption isotherm as shown in fig 4 the uptake of cd by periphyton or periphyton dom increased along with the rise of initial cd concentration at a same initial cd concentration the amount of cd adsorbed by periphyton dom was lower than that by pure periphyton two adsorption isothermal models the langmuir model and the freundlich model were used to fit the adsorption data the parameters originated from fitting are shown in table 2 for pure periphyton treatment the regression coefficient r 2 for freundlich model was higher than that for langmuir model in the treatment of periphyton dom the r 2 was 99 for either langmuir model or freundlich model 3 5 effect of ph on adsorption characteristics as shown in fig 5 ph had significant effects on the uptake of cd by periphyton or periphyton dom the uptake of cd by pure periphyton rapidly increased along with the increase of ph from 5 0 to 7 0 while it maintained stable levels at ph ranged from 4 0 to 5 0 and 7 0 to 8 0 for the periphyton dom treatment the amount of adsorbed cd increased at ph ranged from 4 0 to 7 0 but it showed no obvious variation at ph 7 0 8 0 3 6 desorption characteristics fig 6a shows the desorption rate of cd from periphyton or periphyton dom with different desorbents deionized h2o desorbed 1 23 and 2 65 of cd from periphyton and periphyton dom respectively the amount of cd desorbed from periphyton and periphyton dom by nh4no3 was 47 99 and 21 71 respectively the percentage of cd desorbed from periphyton by edta 2na was 89 23 and it was 67 96 for periphyton dom fig 6b shows the desorption rate of cd from dom by different desorbents the desorbents nh4no3 and edta 2na desorbed 11 49 and 56 26 of cd from

the surface of cd free periphyton fig 7a for the treatment of periphyton without dom intensive reddish spots distributed on the surface of algal trichome and reddish zone was observed in the matrix of periphyton after cd adsorption fig 7b reddish zone or dots were observed in the solution after shaking fig 7c the intensity of reddish spots decreased in the periphyton dom treatment fig 7d 3 8 characteristics of ftir fig 8 shows the vibrational spectra of periphyton and dom before and after cd adsorption the main frequency bands on periphyton were corresponding to stretching vibration of oh and nh 3388 3480 cm 1 formation vibration of amide i and ii 1602 1650 cm 1 stretching vibration of cn from purines and pyrimidines 1520 cm 1 formation vibration of oh 1392 cm 1 po of phosphodiester 1070 cm 1 after cd adsorption the frequency band 1650 cm 1 shifted to 1640 cm 1 and the frequency band 1602 cm 1 disappeared another frequency band at 1392 cm 1 shifted to 1382 cm 1 the frequency bands at 1602 cm 1 1520 cm 1 and 1070 cm 1 were weakened by cd adsorption for dom the main frequency bands were corresponding to stretching vibration of oh and nh 3388 3480 cm 1 formation vibration of amide ii 1620 1650 cm 1 formation vibration of oh 1392 cm 1 po of phosphodiester cd adsorption caused the shifting of the frequency bands from 1620 1650 cm 1 to 1576 1640 cm 1 another frequency band shifted from 1392 cm 1 to 1382 cm 1 a new frequency band corresponded to vibration of cdo 828 1 cm appeared in dom after cd adsorption 4 discussion periphyton is a kind of microbial aggregates the microorganisms in periphyton assemble and form aggregates through eps according to the binding intensity and physical structure eps could be divided into three groups sheath capsule and slime 21 the eps enrich anion groups which could effectively bind with heavy metal ions 21 the results of microscope observation and pyrosequencing showed that the dominant microorganisms in the periphyton in this study belonged to cyanobacteria mainly composed by an unclassified cyanobacterium and leptolyngbya species of leptolyngbya have the characteristic of obvious sheath on the surface of trichome 22 as shown in fig 7 the adsorbed cd indicated as reddish compound mainly distributed on the surface of algal trichome fig 7b after shaking some of which were released into water while some others still attached with algal trichome fig 7c these results indicated that both sheath and slime contributed for the adsorption of cd by periphyton yang et al 17 reported that the adsorption capacity of cd by periphyton was 101 75 236 29 mg kg under an initial cd concentration of 10 mg l the result presented in this study showed that the adsorption capacity of cd by periphyton at the same initial cd concentration was 448 67 mg kg slightly higher than that reported by yang et al 17 different community structure of periphyton may contribute for the different adsorption capacity langmuir model and freundlich model are used to explain monolayer adsorption and multilayer adsorption respectively 23 the results of adsorption isotherm fitting in this study showed that the freundlich model had a higher correlation coefficient than the langmuir model for the adsorption of cd by periphyton suggesting that this kind of adsorption belonged to multilayer adsorption although both langmuir model and freundlich model had high regression coefficient 99 after dom addition the q max deduced form langmuir model was much higher than that of experimental data thus langmuir model was not fit the adsorption of cd by periphyton dom generally k f is interpreted as an index of adsorption capacity higher k f value means higher adsorption capacity 24 according to the k f value shown in table 2 we concluded that the adsorption capacity of periphyton toward cd was weakened by dom the parameter n in freundlich model reflects the affinity between adsorbent and adsorbate 25 the n value in the treatment of pure periphyton was higher than that in the periphyton dom treatment implying that dom addition decreased the affinity between cd and periphyton in this study the adsorption process of cd by periphyton or periphyton dom was more suitable to be explained by the kinetics of pseud second order model which is used to explain chemisorption process 26 thus we conclude that the adsorption process of cd by periphyton or periphyton dom mainly controlled by chemisorption the results of desorption also confirmed this the fraction of cd desorbed by deionized h2o corresponds to physical adsorption 19 the fractions of cd desorbed by deionized h2o from periphyton or periphyton dom were less than 3 fig 6 indicating that rather than physical adsorption chemical adsorption was the main binding force between cd and periphyton in the treatments of with or without dom addition the desorbent nh4no3 releases the fractions of cd bound through physical adsorption and ion exchange while edta 2na desorbs the fractions of cd bound through physical adsorption ion exchange and complexation 19 our results showed that periphyton bound with cd mainly through ion exchange and complexation fig 6 while dom bound with cd mainly through complexation thus we deduce that dom decreased the adsorption of cd by periphyton through complexation compared the proportion of desorbed cd by nh4no3 and edta 2na the difference between periphyton and periphyton dom in edta 2na treatment was close to that in nh4no3 treatment which indirectly supports the hypothesis that dom decreased the adsorption of cd by periphyton mainly through complexation the results of ftir showed that the dom derived from cattle manure contained amide hydroxyl and other anion groups similar results were also observed in the dom originated from other sources 27 28 suggesting that these groups extensively exist in dom the groups of carboxyl hydroxyl carbonyl and amino in dom can form binary complexes with cd which does not continue to form ternary complexes with the surface of algae 29 therefore we speculate that dom derived from cattle manure competed with periphyton for adsorption of cd resulting in decrease of cd adsorption by periphyton 5 conclusion the effects and possible mechanisms of dom originated from cattle manure on adsorption of cd by periphyton were investigated in this study ion exchange and complexation were the main binding forces for the adsorption of cd by periphyton dom addition did not change the adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherm of periphyton toward cd but it decreased the adsorption capacity of cd by periphyton the amide and hydroxyl in the dom were the main functional groups involved in the competition for cd with periphyton declaration of competing interest the

metabolic properties played important role in bioflocs however the function of microalgae as a primary producer in the bft system has rarely been studied in this study microalga platymonas sp was applied to bft system under different carbon nitrogen c n ratio the physiology characteristics of the microalgae water quality parameters and bacterial communities were monitored in seven days at the

nitrogen compounds is essentially the efficacy of heterotrophic and nitrobacteria grown in flocs 12 heterotrophic metabolism removes inorganic nitrogen by assimilating such nitrogenous compounds into the bacterial biomass as proteins 13 this incorporation is achieved by controlling the carbon to nitrogen c n ratio in the bft system by adding exogenous carbon sources 14 this approach allows an effective and rapid removal of inorganic nitrogen thus reducing the inorganic nitrogen concentration in water during chemoautotrophy a small amount of bacterial biomass is produced mainly due to the slow growth of nitrobacteria which oxidize nh4 n to no2 n ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and later oxidize no2 n to nitrate nitrogen no3 n by nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob 15 the conversion of ammonium to microbial proteins requires less dissolved oxygen than the oxygen required for nitrification suggesting that the bft system prefers heterotrophic communities to nitrobacteria in addition

250 ml in 500 ml sterilized erlenmeyer flasks and sealed with sealing film algae groups were added with platymonas sp concentration 1 105 cfu ml and the control groups as blank without algae due to the limited depth of the water sample the dissolved oxygen can be maintained under the condition of 150 rpm in a shaker without additional aeration double parallel repetitions were performed in the

according to manufacturer s protocols the hypervariable 16s v3 v4 regions of the ribosomal rna gene were amplified by the barcode primers 341f and 806r purified amplicons were pooled in equimolar and paired end sequenced pe250 on an illumina platform according to the standard protocols by gene denovo biotechnology co guangzhou china to obtain high quality clean reads raw reads were further

keuls snk test 3 results and discussion 3 1 water quality during the whole experiment the dynamic change of the dissolved inorganic nitrogen tan no2 n and no3 n is shown in fig 1 for tan content each group basically showed a trend of first decreasing and then ascending by the 168th hour despite scarcely removal effect on tan of c0 the other seven groups have a certain effect on tan content removal the removal efficiency from highest to lowest are a10 87 5 c10 83 3 a6 76 0 c6 61 0 a4 60 7 c4 44 9 a0 30 7 and c0 1 4 the no2 n content alteration is shown in fig 1 b the four groups of c0 c4 c6 and a0 had no significant changes in no2 n content from 0 to 24 h then showed a gradual increase trend during 24 168 h and growing rapidly as the experiment proceeded in contrast the no2 n content of a4 a6 and a10 had good removal effect from 24 to 96 h and the no2 n content of all three groups was close to 0 except for a6 did not increase from 96 to 168 h the no2 n content of a4 and a10 had an increasing trend during this period especially the a4 increased more obviously the no2 n content of c10 group basically showed a tendency to decrease first and then increase from 8 to 168 h while the no2 n content removal effect was not obvious in the entire process and the no2 n content showed a significant increase after 96 h the no3 n content of a0 c0 c4 and c6 was not significantly removed from 0 to 96 h and these four groups showed a certain increasing trend from 96 to 168 h the no3 n content of c0 was the highest at 168 h the best removal effect showed within 24 96 h in three algal groups a4 a6 and a10 despite no3 n content of these three groups was close to 0 afterwards all three groups showed an increasing trend from 96 to 168 h the no3 n content of c10 showed a decreasing trend from 8 to 48 h and then in steady state from 48 to 168 h the rapid development of the aquaculture industry has also brought increasing pollution to the water environment 30 farmed animals usually assimilate only 20 25 of the protein in their feed the rest is discharged into the water as nh3 n food residues and feces leading to the deterioration of water quality 15 31 the metabolism of nitrogen wastes and the improvement of water quality reflect the microbial activity of bioflocs in the present experiment a6 a10 and c10 in both algal and control groups showed a superior removal efficiency of tan in all algal groups the higher the c n ratio the more it contributed to tan removal which is consistent with the previous studies 17 and suggest that increasing the c n ratio does promote the growth of heterotrophic bacteria leads to a faster reduction of tan concentration in the water 14 the tan concentrations in the algal groups were all lower than those in the corresponding control group at the same c n ratio indicating that the addition of algae was beneficial for tan removal and it has been suggested that tan uptake by phytoplankton led to the reduction of tan concentrations in the water 32 the synergistic effect between microalgae and bacteria can improve the inorganic nitrogen removal efficiency which is consistent with the previous studies 33 34 as shown in table 1 the alkalinity mg caco3 l 1 ph and do mg l 1 of the algal and the control groups were maintained in a stable range during the experimental period from 0 to 168 h and temperature with salinity are maintained in a stable range at the same time provide a stable growth environment can help reduce the stress of aquatic animals to the maximum extent according to the results of two way anova test algae addition had significant impacts on alkalinity p 0 01 and do p 0 05 meanwhile the c n ratio significantly affected p 0 01 the ph and do in groups 3 2 microalgae activity in supernatant and flocs the concentration of algae in the supernatant reflected the flocculation effect of algae and the photosynthetic efficiency parameter fv fm reflected the photosynthetic capacity of algae the concentration of algae in the supernatant of the algal groups is shown in fig 2 a during the whole experimental period the concentration of algae in a0 first increased and then gradually decreased in a4 algal count first slightly increased and then gradually decreased however the concentration of algae in a6 and a10 groups kept decreasing and at the 7th day the concentration of algae in a4 a6 and a10 and in the supernatant of a0 was close to 0 the changes in the concentration of algae in the supernatant of the algal groups indicated that the flocculation and sedimentation of algae were related to the c n ratio and the higher the c n ratio the lower the concentration of algae in the supernatant the fv fm of all four groups showed a consistent decreasing trend throughout the experimental period and the fv fm of a10 decreased to 0 at day 5 and the other three groups decreased to 0 at day 7 under the premise of adding algae fv fm decreased gradually with time and dropped to 0 in all four groups finally accompany with c n ratio ascending fv fm decreased more rapidly and the photosynthetic capacity was subsequently reduced after algae were captured by flocs the biofloc morphology of algal and control groups were observed using an optical microscope and results are shown in fig 3 during the experimental period no microalgae were found in the c6 floc while in the algal group it was observed from the beginning that the algae were captured by the biofloc and algal flocculation occurred at the 7th day the algae could still be observed inside the floc and no large scale rupture of microalgal cells was found indicating that the algae remain survive even though they were captured by the floc by comparing fig 3 c and d it was found that as the experiment proceeded algae gradually moved toward the interior of flocs after being captured by the floc surface the maximal quantum yield of photosystem ps ii fv fm is an important indicator for studying the effects of photoinhibition or environmental stresses on photosynthesis which is used to characterize the conversion efficiency of light energy in the ps ii reaction center and its numerical changes have a special significance and can effectively reflect the degree of stress to the plant 35 in non stressed environmental conditions fv fm is very stable however exposure to stressful conditions enhances the accumulation of reactive oxygen species ros in plant tissues and causes oxidative stress suppresses ps ii activity resulting in a decrement stress conditions and cause a decrease in fv fm 36 as in fig 2 the fv fm of the four groups showed a decreasing trend with time indicating that the four groups of algae were under severe environmental stress throughout the experiment where the higher the c n ratio the more severe the stress and the faster the photosynthetic rate decreased in general the variation of algae concentration in the supernatant and the fv fm drop down in all groups suggested that elevation of the c n ratio accelerate the algal flocculation the flocculation and sedimentation of algae was positively correlated with the increase in c n ratio after all the algae in the supernatant were captured by flocs the ability of inorganic nitrogen removal was reduced and the inorganic nitrogen then began to accumulate gradually in the water although the algae were captured by the flocs they still survive and did not disrupted fig 3 nor did they become a new source of pollution 3 3 microbiota compositions and structure performance to determine the effects of on bft microbial diversity the types and relative abundance of the biofloc microbiota at the phyla and genera levels were analyzed the results suggested that proteobacteria bacteroidetes planctomycetes cyanobacteria and chloroflexi were the predominant microflora in all treatment groups in phylum level and the relative abundance of proteobacteria was the highest accounting for more than 60 on average fig 4 at the genus level of bacteria the relative abundance and types of bacteria in algal groups and control groups were different the top 10 genera and their relative abundances are shown on fig 4 the structure of bacteria was differed significantly p 0 05 between the algal and control groups at the genus level is shown in fig 5 the algal group had significantly higher levels of alteromonas 5 22 phaeodactylibacter 0 40 citreicella 1 52 arenibacter 0 93 aestuariibact 0 31 amaricoccus 0 12 and echinicola 0 08 than that in the control group while salinisphaera 0 35 francisella 0 20 leptolyngbya pcc 6406 0 28 mycobacterium 0 11 spongiibacter 0 09 and turneriella 0 07 were significantly lower in the algal group than in the control group the algal group had different dominant bacteria and different community structure than the control group presumably due to the addition of algae and the difference in c n ratio so it caused the microbial community to change in succession bacterial richness was calculated by the method of chao and sobs based on the numbers of otus at the 97 dissimilarity level bacterial community diversity was measured using the method of simpson and shannon table 2 for the algal group the richness and diversity of a4 reached the highest for the control group the two groups of c4 and c6 had higher richness and the two groups of c0 and c4 have higher biodiversity based on the two way anova test result algae addition had a significantly impact p 0 05 on the bacterial community diversity indicated by simpson s index different c n ratio significantly affected bacterial community diversity p 0 01 and richness p 0 05 to investigate the bacterial community structure of bft at genus level principal coordinates analysis pca was performed for bacterial profiles in the water samples the results showed that the cumulative variance contribution of pc1 62 70 and pc2 16 31 was 79 01 which can effectively reflect the main information of the samples the samples from the control group and blank group were clustered on the left hand side of the graph during different c n ratio treatment along the first principal component axis pc1 fig 6 a0 and c0 were close to the original flocs on pc1 with the increase of c n ratio the two groups of experimental and control groups gradually moved to the right side and the algal group was always on the right side of the control group under the same c n ratio which is consist with the trends of c n ratio ascending imply that addition of algae was consistent with the increase of c n ratio in terms of trend i e introducing platymonas achieved the effect of increasing c n ratio to a certain extent the groups showed a trend of decreasing and then increasing on pc2 and the group c4 reached the lowest value on pc2 at the phylum level fig 5a proteobacteria in the algal group increased whereas cyanobacteria and other phyla decreased which may be due to the addition of platymonas and the c n ratio increase on the genus level alteromonas was significantly higher in the algal group than the control group probably because of the degradation effect of alteromonas on the microalgae especially the algal polysaccharide 37 which is a potential reason for the lower demand of c n ratio in algae groups arenibacter has been reported a wide spectrum of glycosidases with highly active β n acetylglucosaminidases and α n acetylgalactosaminidases 38 arenibacter may plays a role of algicidal bacterium in seawater of red tide 39 thus possibly the reason why this bacterium significantly increased in the algal group francisella is a kind of aerobic gram negative bacteria pathogens capable of penetrating intact skin or via skin injury to elicit disease and infect human and aquatic animals through water 40 41 francisella in the algal group is significantly decreased than that in the control group fig 5 indicating that the addition of algae can inhibit francisella in the water thereby providing a more suitable growth environment for aquaculture animals the addition of carbon sources to the bioflocs improved the diversity stability and buffering capacity of the microbial community 41 the present study demonstrate that carbon sources and algal supplementation has a significant effect on the improvement of the aquacultural environment not only slow down tan build up but also altered the structural composition of the microbial community as the c n ratio under control 4 conclusions the relationship of carbon and nitrogen ratio is crucial for effective nitrogen removal in the biofloc culture system maintain the water quality by manipulate the c n ratio is feasible in the biofloc based system although supplemental carbon sources are still needed the input of microalgae can effectively enhance the degradation of nitrogen metabolites in bioflocs which greatly saves the addition of exogenous carbohydrates and improves economic efficiency but it is required to maintain the input c n ratio above 6 also microalgae work with microorganisms to recycle and regenerate excreted waste into useful natural diet thus maintaining a cleaner environment moreover both the increased c n ratio and the microalgae supplementation significantly affected p 0 05 the microbial alpha diversity of the biofloc and the increase of flora associated with polysaccharide metabolism and the decrease of pathogenic bacteria in the community possibly indicated that microalgae replaced part of the carbon source and also reduced the chance of morbidity providing better conditions for healthy aquaculture declaration of competing interest the authors declare there is no conflict of interest in this study acknowledgement this work was financially supported by the

keuls snk test 3 results and discussion 3 1 water quality during the whole experiment the dynamic change of the dissolved inorganic nitrogen tan no2 n and no3 n is shown in fig 1 for tan content each group basically showed a trend of first decreasing and then ascending by the 168th hour despite scarcely removal effect on tan of c0 the other seven groups have a certain effect on tan content removal the removal efficiency from highest to lowest are a10 87 5 c10 83 3 a6 76 0 c6 61 0 a4 60 7 c4 44 9 a0 30 7 and c0 1 4 the no2 n content alteration is shown in fig 1 b the four groups of c0 c4 c6 and a0 had no significant changes in no2 n content from 0 to 24 h then showed a gradual increase trend during 24 168 h and growing rapidly as the experiment proceeded in contrast the no2 n content of a4 a6 and a10 had good removal effect from 24 to 96 h and the no2 n content of all three groups was close to 0 except for a6 did not increase from 96 to 168 h the no2 n content of a4 and a10 had an increasing trend during this period especially the a4 increased more obviously the no2 n content of c10 group basically showed a tendency to decrease first and then increase from 8 to 168 h while the no2 n content removal effect was not obvious in the entire process and the no2 n content showed a significant increase after 96 h the no3 n content of a0 c0 c4 and c6 was not significantly removed from 0 to 96 h and these four groups showed a certain increasing trend from 96 to 168 h the no3 n content of c0 was the highest at 168 h the best removal effect showed within 24 96 h in three algal groups a4 a6 and a10 despite no3 n content of these three groups was close to 0 afterwards all three groups showed an increasing trend from 96 to 168 h the no3 n content of c10 showed a decreasing trend from 8 to 48 h and then in steady state from 48 to 168 h the rapid development of the aquaculture industry has also brought increasing pollution to the water environment 30 farmed animals usually assimilate only 20 25 of the protein in their feed the rest is discharged into the water as nh3 n food residues and feces leading to the deterioration of water quality 15 31 the metabolism of nitrogen wastes and the improvement of water quality reflect the microbial activity of bioflocs in the present experiment a6 a10 and c10 in both algal and control groups showed a superior removal efficiency of tan in all algal groups the higher the c n ratio the more it contributed to tan removal which is consistent with the previous studies 17 and suggest that increasing the c n ratio does promote the growth of heterotrophic bacteria leads to a faster reduction of tan concentration in the water 14 the tan concentrations in the algal groups were all lower than those in the corresponding control group at the same c n ratio indicating that the addition of algae was beneficial for tan removal and it has been suggested that tan uptake by phytoplankton led to the reduction of tan concentrations in the water 32 the synergistic effect between microalgae and bacteria can improve the inorganic nitrogen removal efficiency which is consistent with the previous studies 33 34 as shown in table 1 the alkalinity mg caco3 l 1 ph and do mg l 1 of the algal and the control groups were maintained in a stable range during the experimental period from 0 to 168 h and temperature with salinity are maintained in a stable range at the same time provide a stable growth environment can help reduce the stress of aquatic animals to the maximum extent according to the results of two way anova test algae addition had significant impacts on alkalinity p 0 01 and do p 0 05 meanwhile the c n ratio significantly affected p 0 01 the ph and do in groups 3 2 microalgae activity in supernatant and flocs the concentration of algae in the supernatant reflected the flocculation effect of algae and the photosynthetic efficiency parameter fv fm reflected the photosynthetic capacity of algae the concentration of algae in the supernatant of the algal groups is shown in fig 2 a during the whole experimental period the concentration of algae in a0 first increased and then gradually decreased in a4 algal count first slightly increased and then gradually decreased however the concentration of algae in a6 and a10 groups kept decreasing and at the 7th day the concentration of algae in a4 a6 and a10 and in the supernatant of a0 was close to 0 the changes in the concentration of algae in the supernatant of the algal groups indicated that the flocculation and sedimentation of algae were related to the c n ratio and the higher the c n ratio the lower the concentration of algae in the supernatant the fv fm of all four groups showed a consistent decreasing trend throughout the experimental period and the fv fm of a10 decreased to 0 at day 5 and the other three groups decreased to 0 at day 7 under the premise of adding algae fv fm decreased gradually with time and dropped to 0 in all four groups finally accompany with c n ratio ascending fv fm decreased more rapidly and the photosynthetic capacity was subsequently reduced after algae were captured by flocs the biofloc morphology of algal and control groups were observed using an optical microscope and results are shown in fig 3 during the experimental period no microalgae were found in the c6 floc while in the algal group it was observed from the beginning that the algae were captured by the biofloc and algal flocculation occurred at the 7th day the algae could still be observed inside the floc and no large scale rupture of microalgal cells was found indicating that the algae remain survive even though they were captured by the floc by comparing fig 3 c and d it was found that as the experiment proceeded algae gradually moved toward the interior of flocs after being captured by the floc surface the maximal quantum yield of photosystem ps ii fv fm is an important indicator for studying the effects of photoinhibition or environmental stresses on photosynthesis which is used to characterize the conversion efficiency of light energy in the ps ii reaction center and its numerical changes have a special significance and can effectively reflect the degree of stress to the plant 35 in non stressed environmental conditions fv fm is very stable however exposure to stressful conditions enhances the accumulation of reactive oxygen species ros in plant tissues and causes oxidative stress suppresses ps ii activity resulting in a decrement stress conditions and cause a decrease in fv fm 36 as in fig 2 the fv fm of the four groups showed a decreasing trend with time indicating that the four groups of algae were under severe environmental stress throughout the experiment where the higher the c n ratio the more severe the stress and the faster the photosynthetic rate decreased in general the variation of algae concentration in the supernatant and the fv fm drop down in all groups suggested that elevation of the c n ratio accelerate the algal flocculation the flocculation and sedimentation of algae was positively correlated with the increase in c n ratio after all the algae in the supernatant were captured by flocs the ability of inorganic nitrogen removal was reduced and the inorganic nitrogen then began to accumulate gradually in the water although the algae were captured by the flocs they still survive and did not disrupted fig 3 nor did they become a new source of pollution 3 3 microbiota compositions and structure performance to determine the effects of on bft microbial diversity the types and relative abundance of the biofloc microbiota at the phyla and genera levels were analyzed the results suggested that proteobacteria bacteroidetes planctomycetes cyanobacteria and chloroflexi were the predominant microflora in all treatment groups in phylum level and the relative abundance of proteobacteria was the highest accounting for more than 60 on average fig 4 at the genus level of bacteria the relative abundance and types of bacteria in algal groups and control groups were different the top 10 genera and their relative abundances are shown on fig 4 the structure of bacteria was differed significantly p 0 05 between the algal and control groups at the genus level is shown in fig 5 the algal group had significantly higher levels of alteromonas 5 22 phaeodactylibacter 0 40 citreicella 1 52 arenibacter 0 93 aestuariibact 0 31 amaricoccus 0 12 and echinicola 0 08 than that in the control group while salinisphaera 0 35 francisella 0 20 leptolyngbya pcc 6406 0 28 mycobacterium 0 11 spongiibacter 0 09 and turneriella 0 07 were significantly lower in the algal group than in the control group the algal group had different dominant bacteria and different community structure than the control group presumably due to the addition of algae and the difference in c n ratio so it caused the microbial community to change in succession bacterial richness was calculated by the method of chao and sobs based on the numbers of otus at the 97 dissimilarity level bacterial community diversity was measured using the method of simpson and shannon table 2 for the algal group the richness and diversity of a4 reached the highest for the control group the two groups of c4 and c6 had higher richness and the two groups of c0 and c4 have higher biodiversity based on the two way anova test result algae addition had a significantly impact p 0 05 on the bacterial community diversity indicated by simpson s index different c n ratio significantly affected bacterial community diversity p 0 01 and richness p 0 05 to investigate the bacterial community structure of bft at genus level principal coordinates analysis pca was performed for bacterial profiles in the water samples the results showed that the cumulative variance contribution of pc1 62 70 and pc2 16 31 was 79 01 which can effectively reflect the main information of the samples the samples from the control group and blank group were clustered on the left hand side of the graph during different c n ratio treatment along the first principal component axis pc1 fig 6 a0 and c0 were close to the original flocs on pc1 with the increase of c n ratio the two groups of experimental and control groups gradually moved to the right side and the algal group was always on the right side of the control group under the same c n ratio which is consist with the trends of c n ratio ascending imply that addition of algae was consistent with the increase of c n ratio in terms of trend i e introducing platymonas achieved the effect of increasing c n ratio to a certain extent the groups showed a trend of decreasing and then increasing on pc2 and the group c4 reached the lowest value on pc2 at the phylum level fig 5a proteobacteria in the algal group increased whereas cyanobacteria and other phyla decreased which may be due to the addition of platymonas and the c n ratio increase on the genus level alteromonas was significantly higher in the algal group than the control group probably because of the degradation effect of alteromonas on the microalgae especially the algal polysaccharide 37 which is a potential reason for the lower demand of c n ratio in algae groups arenibacter has been reported a wide spectrum of glycosidases with highly active β n acetylglucosaminidases and α n acetylgalactosaminidases 38 arenibacter may plays a role of algicidal bacterium in seawater of red tide 39 thus possibly the reason why this bacterium significantly increased in the algal group francisella is a kind of aerobic gram negative bacteria pathogens capable of penetrating intact skin or via skin injury to elicit disease and infect human and aquatic animals through water 40 41 francisella in the algal group is significantly decreased than that in the control group fig 5 indicating that the addition of algae can inhibit francisella in the water thereby providing a more suitable growth environment for aquaculture animals the addition of carbon sources to the bioflocs improved the diversity stability and buffering capacity of the microbial community 41 the present study demonstrate that carbon sources and algal supplementation has a significant effect on the improvement of the aquacultural environment not only slow down tan build up but also altered the structural composition of the microbial community as the c n ratio under control 4 conclusions the relationship of carbon and nitrogen ratio is crucial for effective nitrogen removal in the biofloc culture system maintain the water quality by manipulate the c n ratio is feasible in the biofloc based system although supplemental carbon sources are still needed the input of microalgae can effectively enhance the degradation of nitrogen metabolites in bioflocs which greatly saves the addition of exogenous carbohydrates and improves economic efficiency but it is required to maintain the input c n ratio above 6 also microalgae work with microorganisms to recycle and regenerate excreted waste into useful natural diet thus maintaining a cleaner environment moreover both the increased c n ratio and the microalgae supplementation significantly affected p 0 05 the microbial alpha diversity of the biofloc and the increase of flora associated with polysaccharide metabolism and the decrease of pathogenic bacteria in the community possibly indicated that microalgae replaced part of the carbon source and also reduced the chance of morbidity providing better
