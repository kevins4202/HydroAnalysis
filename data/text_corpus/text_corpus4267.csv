21335,cellular automata ca model is one of effective models in geographic simulation due to its self organization and bottom up approach in this paper logistic regression method is used to obtain parameter values and logistic regression ca model is constructed for simulating oil slick after that parameter values are calibrated using sampling ratios spatial scales and neighborhood structures finally the model is applied to the simulation of oil slick in deepspill project experiments showed that 1 higher sampling ratio will help to obtain better parameter values however when sampling ratio exceeds 10 improvement is small in overall accuracy in addition suitable proportion of oil areas in training sample can help to get better results it can be seen from parameter values that distance is the most important factor followed by currents wind salinity and temperature 2 overall accuracy of simulation results has fluctuation characteristics in different spatial scales in experiments of extended neighborhood accuracy first increases and then decreases with increase of neighborhood size this model yields the best simulation result in 7 7 moore neighborhood which can reach 97 40 3 two simulation results are obtained by using 3 3 moore neighborhood in spatial resolution of 2m result a and 7 7 moore neighborhood in spatial resolution of 6m result b after comparison both results have characteristics of diffusion and drift center point of verification image drifted 23 152m toward 92 8967 in result a center point only drifted 7 087m toward 86 3767 it has obvious deviation in the east and west because of short drift distance however center point drifted 18 599m toward 97 2276 in result b it has better performance in shape and indices overall accuracy kappa and fom keywords cellular automata oil spill logistic regression deepspill 1 introduction oil pollution is an important marine problem for many countries and regions lu 2003 ferraro et al 2009 according to surveys and statistics at least 6 million tons of oil pours into oceans each year hoff 1993 it will seriously threaten marine ecological environment palenzuela et al 2006 therefore people take effort to control oil pollution and protect ecological environment some institutions organizations concentrate their attention on simulation of oil spill johansen et al 2003 wang et al 2005 studies have shown that movement of spilled oil can be simulated and predicted and simulation results can help to locate potentially vulnerable areas for priority protection they also can help to control oil spill and reduce economic and environmental losses yapa and chen 2004 senga et al 2009 fattal et al 2010 ivanov 2010 when oil is spilled into a sea a thin film oil slick can be seen in the surface it will be affected by different factors such as gravity currents wave wind temperature and salinity these factors and their functions force oil slick into different processes such as diffusion spread advection evaporation dissolution emulsification and sedimentation fang and johnston 2001 garo et al 2004 abascal et al 2010 researchers used kinds of methods to simulate processes of oil slick such as fay 2003 developed classic theory of oil diffusion which considers gravity surface tension and viscous force law of mass conservation is usually included in building models spaulding 2017 on a calm sea surface an oil slick will form a film with circular shape it will become elliptical under the influence of wind reed et al 1999 it is noted that oil diffusion happens at different depths researchers analyzed and simulated oil movements of surface and subsurface shay et al 2011 guo et al 2014 experiments show that evaporation should be considered when oil is exposed in a long time especially for light oils fingas 1997 kotzakoulakis and george 2018 however dissolution may be important in low evaporation conditions such as under ice covered surfaces subsurface dissolution is significant in lacking exposure to atmospheric fingas 1997 when oil density and viscosity are relatively high entrainment process should not be ignored kotzakoulakis and george 2018 effects of emulsification and biodegradation are also considered in a long simulation process jiang and ellis 2010 li et al 2017 these processes can be simulated by using numerical models with parameters and initial values these models play important role in studying mechanism of oil slick spill karafyllidis 1997 johansen et al 2003 gamzaev 2009 in recent years some scholars have tried to use cellular automata ca models to simulate oil slick ca models can simulate complex and global phenomenon by using local rules and parameters li and yeh 2002 besides data structure of ca model is highly consistent with raster data model raster data is a commonly used data in geographic information system gis which can visually display oil slick areas palenzuela et al 2006 karafyllidis 1997 firstly proposed ca model to simulate diffusion of oil slick the model includes impact factors such as wind currents evaporation and boundaries his experiments showed that simulation results are consistent with real situations of oil slick rusinovic and bogunovic 2006 proposed an improved oil slick ca model which focused on processes of sediment dissolution and emulsification based on previous researcher s results shyue et al 2007 considered oil transportation and law of mass conservation they developed a new ca model to simulate processes of diffusion evaporation and convection glug and was 2018 modeled spreading process of oil spill by combining langrangian discrete particle algorithm with ca model simulation results are then verified by using experimental data and other theoretical outcomes ca models have become attractive to simulation of oil spill the core of ca is how to obtain parameters in transition rules which has impact on simulation process and results however existing ca models may have some problems in obtaining parameters such as evaporation coefficient conversion coefficient between wind and currents therefore this paper combines logistic regression with ca model to simulate oil slick before applied into real situation the model is calibrated by analyzing sampling ratios spatial scales and neighborhood structures finally it is applied and verified by using experimental data of deepspill project 2 material and methods 2 1 data processing in june 2000 johansen norwegian scientist was responsible for deepspill project experimental area is located in helland hansen 65 00 n 4 50 e in north sea in the project different oils such as diesel and natural gas mixtures were released the whole process was recorded by a variety of equipment the record can be used to test performance and accuracy of oil slick models johansen et al 2003 this paper uses data at 8 34 06 and 8 39 47 on june 27th oil area at 8 34 06 is defined as initial image oil area at 8 40 47 is defined as verification image which is used to verify simulation results fig 1 it can be seen that oil areas diffuse from center to periphery by comparing initial image and verification image fig 2 a therefore euclidean distance to center point is obtained by using gis software it is used as an impact factor in this paper fig 2b the information of currents and wind is also collected the wind blew at a speed of 10 4 m s with direction of 294 7 north is 0 clockwise the currents had a speed of 8 5 cm s toward 251 6 projection of currents and wind are obtained as impact factors fig 2c and fig 2d temperature and salinity are also collected at sea surface in study area fig 2e and fig 2f in order to speed up convergence in training process and facilitate comparison among factors normalization is adopted to regulate their values into 0 1 these five impact factors distance currents wind salinity and temperature and two images initial image and verification image are converted into raster format the raster data is easy to obtain training samples besides it is highly consistent with ca models 2 2 logistic regression ca model ca model is an effective model in geographical simulation because of its advantages in self organization high resolution and feedback wu 2002 liu et al 2008 a geographical ca model usually contains different spatial variables li and yeh 2004 li et al 2012 chen et al 2014 these variables may include distance wind currents salinity and temperature in simulating oil slick zhang and qiao 2017 in logistic regression ca model a cell i j state can be addressed as 1 s i j t 1 f s i j t p d i j t f s i j t p g i j t ω i j t r a where s t s t 1 are states at time t and t 1 p d i j t is change probability p g i j t is suitability probability ω i j t is neighborhood function and r a is a stochastic item change probability is a probability value from a non oil cell i j to an oil cell which can be expressed as 2 p d i j t p g i j t ω i j t r a suitability probability p g i j t can be presented as 3 p g i j t 1 1 exp z i j where z i j is composite evaluation score which is calculated by 4 z i j b c k b k x k where b c is a constant b k is parameter value of spatial variables b c and b k can be obtained by using training samples and logistic regression method x k is spatial variables representing impact factors such as distance wind currents salinity and temperature of oil slick neighborhood function ω i j t is total number of oil cells in neighborhood around center cell detail information about neighborhood structures can be found in section 3 3 5 ω i j t c o n s i j t o i l n e i g h b o r c o u n t stochastic term ra is defined as 6 r a 1 ln r a where r is a stochastic factor between 0 and 1 and a is a parameter controlling stochastic factor at each iteration p d i j t 1 is compared with a threshold value to determine whether a non oil cell is converted into an oil cell if p d i j t 1 threshold and cell i j is non oil cell then state of cell i j will be converted into oil cell after establishing logistic regression ca model it is easy to simulate oil slick using initial image and parameters at a bottom up approach 2 3 model validation many indices are calculated based on confusion matrix among them overall accuracy p is the most commonly used li and yeh 2004 7 p s u m s r i g h t s where s r i g h t is the area where simulation result is consistent with real situation and s is the area of study area overall accuracy only calculates values on the diagonal in confusion matrix which only reflects correct situation therefore some scholars used kappa coefficient which includes all values in confusion matrix liu et al 2008 8 k a p p a p p e 1 p e where p is overall accuracy p e a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 a n b n s s n is number of categories a 1 a 2 a n is the area of each class in real situation b 1 b 2 b n is the area of each class in simulation result the areas which do not change usually have large proportion in simulation result however percentage of changed areas is low both of overall accuracy and kappa coefficient include unchanged areas making their values high some scholars use figure of merit fom to avoid this problem liu et al 2017 9 f o m b a b c d where a is the area changed into oil area in actual situation while simulation results remain unchanged b is the area changed into oil area in both actual situation and simulation results c is the area changed into non oil area in actual situation while simulation results have other different changed results d is the area changed into oil area in simulation results while actual situation remains unchanged 3 results and discussion 3 1 training samples studies have shown that ca models need parameter calibration before being applied to simulation prediction of study area wu 2002 chen et al 2014 parameter calibration is a process of finding the best parameters this process often requires kinds of samples li and yeh 2002 size of training samples or sampling ratio has a great impact on parameters which determines simulation performance in order to obtain better simulation results sensitivity analysis of training samples was proposed on sampling ratio in this section five impact factors distance currents wind salinity and temperature and two images are firstly collected with format of raster data after that monte carlo method was used to obtain locations randomly in training process each location has six values five impact factors and one change state the change state is a mark which reflects changes between initial image and verification image for example if a cell is non oil cell in initial image and it changes into oil cell in verification image then the cell has a changed state marked by 1 for convenience and then logistic regression method of spss software is used to obtain parameter values in the method the first five columns in sample values of impact factors are used as independent variables the last column change state is used as dependent variable in order to obtain reasonable parameter values samples are randomly selected for ten times each sample will yield a combination of parameter values the mean values are used as the final parameter values in order to study ratio or size of training samples on simulation results sampling ratios are set to 2 6 10 14 18 22 26 30 36 and 40 table 1 previous researches show that if fewer samples are used in training process it will yield parameter values with large deviation higher sampling ratio will help to obtain better parameters meanwhile computation increase in training process li and yeh 1998 in our experiment it can be found that parameter values become stable with increase of sampling ratio that is parameter values deviate from mean values when sampling ratio is 2 and 6 if sampling ratio is over 10 parameter changes become small it can also be seen that simulation accuracy is relatively low in sampling ratios of 2 and 6 however simulation results are better for other ratios according to accuracy besides they also have similar parameter values since each impact factor is normalized before being sampled and trained parameter values can reflect their contribution parameter value of distance is 8 643 mean value that is distance has the most important influence on simulation results its parameter value is negative meaning the closer to oil center the more likely it becomes an oil slick area parameter values of currents and wind are 0 869 and 0 827 respectively they are the key factors which can be used to simulate drift characteristic of oil slick the least important variables are salinity 0 202 and temperature 0 124 mainly because of short simulation process it can be found that difference in overall accuracy is relatively small between 96 30 and 96 39 in different sampling ratios besides parameter changes are relatively small the mean values are firstly obtained for comparing deviation and fluctuation ranges fluctuation ranges of distance currents wind salinity and temperature are 0 481 0 084 0 041 0 333 and 0 264 respectively besides simulation accuracy fluctuates only about 0 09 it can be found that their ranges are even smaller only 0 109 0 031 0 027 0 078 and 0 118 respectively when sampling ratio is larger than 10 fluctuation range of simulation accuracy is also smaller 0 07 the standard deviation was also used to measure deviation range of parameters standard deviations of distance currents wind salinity and temperature are 0 130 0 028 0 013 0 094 and 0 088 respectively it is also found that the best accuracy cab be obtained at sampling ratio of 22 the parameter values are also compared with mean values their deviations are only 0 18 1 01 38 10 and 70 16 respectively since best accuracy can be obtained at sampling ratio of 22 following sections will discuss simulation performance under this pre condition existing experiments have shown that samples should have enough information in training process however both types should have a suitable ratio in logistic regression model li and yeh 1998 this paper classifies study area into two categories oil and non oil areas proportions of oil areas in samples are set to be 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 and 40 table 2 and total number of samples oil and non oil areas is equal to 22 of study area it can be seen that when proportion increased from 5 to 15 accuracy has an upward trend from 96 26 to 96 40 however accuracy decreases to 96 32 as proportion increases to 40 this is because many oil areas are involved into samples as proportion increases the samples become more different from real situation thus accuracy decreases with increase of oil proportion it can also be found that parameter values of distance change obviously from 14 014 to 5 854 as proportion increases it is indicated that average distance to center point becomes short and contribution of distance becomes small some scholars believed that categories proportion in samples should be similar to their proportion in study area li and yeh 2002 after calculation it is found that oil areas accounted for 12 61 of study area according to this proportion a new sample and its parameter values table 2 can be obtained this parameter combination yields a better simulation result with 96 41 it is consistent with previous researches 3 2 spatial scale and neighborhood structure spatial scale is an inevitable problem when ca model are applied into a real geographic phenomenon it will directly affect performance of simulation results li et al 2012 in this paper original data is resampled into 2m 4m 6m 8m 10m respectively logistic regression ca model was used to simulate oil slick at these five different spatial scales fig 3 it also can be found that boundaries of simulation results become rough due to downscale drift distances are short in scales of 2m and 4m however it is obvious that simulation results drift to east and south in 6m and 10m these two simulation results are in accord with real situation besides their accuracies are higher than 97 when spatial scale increases from 2m to 6m accuracy increases from 96 41 to 97 32 it has the best performance at 6m as spatial scale increases 8m accuracy decreases 96 46 and then increases to 97 11 at 10m spatial scales and neighborhood structure are often combined to discuss their influence on simulation results zhang et al 2020 in ca model standard moore neighborhood is the most commonly used with spatial range of 3 3 in this neighborhood center cell black has 8 neighbor cells fig 4 some researchers used another neighborhood structure named von neumann neighborhood there are only 4 neighbor cells around center cell which are up down left and right cell the ca model is applied by using these two different neighborhood structures and five spatial scales overall accuracy of results is shown in table 3 it can be seen that accuracy fluctuates with spatial scales by comparing two neighborhood structures it can be found that difference of accuracy is small 0 01 0 03 it is hard to tell which kind of neighborhood structure is much better however it can be found that simulation results of both neighborhood structures perform well in spatial scale of 6m therefore following part will discuss simulation performance of ca model in spatial scale of 6m see table 4 in standard neighborhood structure center cell is only affected by its nearest neighbor some scholars believe that extended neighborhood should be considered such as 5 5 neighborhood and 9 9 neighborhood fig 4 li and yeh 2002 the ca model was applied to test performance of different neighborhood sizes in spatial scale of 6m on the whole inverted u shaped curve is found in accuracy of moore neighborhood when neighborhood size increases from 3 3 to 7 7 accuracy increases from 97 32 to 97 40 and then accuracy drops to 97 26 in 9 9 neighborhood finally it rises to 97 34 at 13 13 in experiments of von neumann neighborhood accuracy increases from 97 30 to 97 34 and then slightly dropped to 97 33 when neighborhood size increases 3 3 to 7 7 at 9 9 and 11 11 neighborhood size this model has the best simulation performance with accuracy of 97 34 after that it goes down to 97 26 at neighborhood size of 13 13 in general ca model performs best 97 40 in 7 7 moore neighborhood structure 3 3 visualization of simulation results this paper selects two results to compare performance before and after sensitivity analysis fig 5 one is the simulation result use 3 3 moore neighborhood at spatial scale of 2m result a the other is the simulation result using 7 7 moore neighborhood at spatial scale of 6m result b it can be found that boundary of result a 2m is smooth while result b 6m is relatively rough for lower spatial resolution in result a it is much straighter on the eastern side than the other sides fig 5a comparing with result a result b is like an ellipse in shape fig 5d by overlapping initial image and simulation results it is found that both results diffuse from center to periphery and drift toward east and south fig 5b and e besides result b drifts further than result a in order to facilitate quantitative comparison drift direction and distance are obtained for result a result b and verification image in verification image center point drifted 23 152m toward 92 8967 center point of result a drifted 7 087m toward 86 3767 which deviated from real situation about 6 52 besides drift characteristic is not obvious for short drift distance in result b its center point drifted 18 599m toward 97 2276 its drift direction deviated from real situation about 4 3309 which is better than result a from fig 5c and fig 5f it can be found that two simulation results are consistent with verification image in northern and southern however result a has obvious simulation errors in the eastern and western for short drift distance compared with result a result b has a better performance in shape a longer term verification image ultraviolet uv image black line in fig 6 is obtained from deepspill project it can be found that oil slick is large in the north and small in the south it is like a tail which is mainly affected by currents and wind the logistic regression ca model is also used to simulate oil slick it can be seen that simulation result gray in fig 6 has a drift tendency to northwest the drift tendency of simulation result is consistent with that of uv image however there are differences in the south and north from morphological view this is mainly because importance of factors had changed during simulation process meanwhile their parameter values changed accordingly therefore parameters change of impact factors need to be considered in a long term simulation especially for the key factors such as wind and currents three different point to point indices are used for quantitative comparison including overall accuracy kappa coefficient and fom table 5 it can be found that result a and result b have high simulation accuracy which are 96 41 and 97 40 respectively simulation accuracy of result b is higher 0 99 than that of result a it is believed that simulation result has a high agreement with actual situation when kappa coefficient is greater than 0 8 liu et al 2008 in our experimental results result a 0 891 and result b 0 928 have high values of kappa coefficient overall accuracy and kappa coefficient are closely related to the size of study area fom can be used to avoid the problem it only evaluates the accuracy of changed type in simulation result it is found that fom of result a and result b are 0 745 and 0 823 respectively which are high by comparing others researches liu et al 2017 it indicates that simulation results fit well with verification image from view of overall accuracy kappa and fom it also can be found that result b is have better performance than result a it means that ca model will perform better after sensitivity analysis 4 discussion in this paper sensitivity analysis is performed by designing experiments of sampling ratios spatial scales and neighborhood structures experiments showed that logistic regression ca model can help to obtain a better result after sensitivity analysis this model is different from numerical models numerical models clearly distinguish stages of oil spills such as diffusion evaporation dissolution emulsification biodegradation and sedimentation in each stage there are obvious physical or chemical processes involving many parameters that need to be determined and calibrated zheng et al 2003 chen et al 2015 spaulding 2017 this is an explicit expression which is popular in numerical models however implicit way is used in this model logistic regression is adopted to obtain parameter values of impact factors in logistic regression each impact factor has one corresponding parameter value the size of parameter value can be used to reflect its contribution on oil slick compared with numerical models the proposed model is relatively simple with a few parameters moreover the model can be calibrated easily in other research fields such as land use changes some scholars have successfully used logistic regression to obtain transition rules parameter values in ca model wu 2002 zhang et al 2020 besides kinds of algorithm can be used to calibrate parameter values liu et al 2008 previous ca models mainly focus on selection of impact factors principal component analysis of factors and acquisition of parameter values in simulating oil spill zhang and qiao 2017 while this paper focuses on neighborhood structures neighborhood sizes spatial scales and application the aims are to build a suitable model for specified application scenarios and discuss impact of structures on simulation results however some issues should be considered in further studies in experiments each cell around center cell is considered to be the same in calculating neighborhood function equation 5 it is different from some researches four adjacent cells up down left and right cells are more important than diagonal cells in experiments of karafyllidis 1997 it should be noted that if wind and currents are included influence of neighborhood cells will be much more different neighborhood structures become complicated in this condition besides dissolution and sedimentation should be considered in a longer term simulation process shyue et al 2007 glug and was 2018 in experiments the proposed ca model has a good performance at spatial scale of 6m however this model outputs poor simulation results at a higher resolution such as 2m it is different from others research fields such as urban expansion zhang et al 2020 therefore it is necessary to consider how to improve simulation performance at a higher resolution in study field of remote sensing some scholars used fusion methods to integrate low and high resolution images to obtain better results gallaudet and simpson 1991 hu and xu 2018 in addition existing ca models for oil slick are mostly based on two dimension space we should pay more attention to three dimension ca models these models is easy to analyze the interaction between surface and subsurface they also can help to analyze processes of emulsification and sedimentation wei et al 2015 paiva et al 2017 in addition some scholars have carried out tentative work on finding optimal model parameters such as genetic algorithms and data assimilation algorithms gomez et al 2011 wang et al 2013 these inspiring work will help to obtain a result with high resolution in time and space therefore combination with optimization algorithm and ca model may be a solution for complex multi stage and long term process of oil spill 5 conclusion oil spill is an important marine problem for many countries and regions in the world it comes from different ways among them oil spill from ships and oil fields is the most commonly concerned it will pour a lot of oil in a short time taking a long time for ecological restoration it is necessary to carry out emergency strategies to control this kind of oil spill the base of emergency strategy is an accurate simulation of oil spill in this paper logistic regression method is used to obtain parameter values after that a logistic regression ca model is constructed for simulating oil slick in order to obtain a better simulation result the model was calibrated by using sampling ratios spatial scales and neighborhood structures it was verified by being applied into experiments of deepspill project some important conclusions were obtained as follows 1 better parameters values higher accuracy can be obtained with increase of sampling ratio when sampling ratio is higher than 10 improvement of overall accuracy is not obvious after analyzing proportion of oil areas in samples it was found that the best parameter values can be obtained at 12 61 this proportion is consistent with proportion of oil slick area in study area it is also found that distance is the key factor followed by currents and wind the least important factors are salinity and temperature 2 overall accuracy fluctuates with changes of spatial scales in standard moore neighborhood and von neumann neighborhood these two neighborhood structures only have small difference about 0 01 0 03 in accuracy after analyzing extended neighborhood it is found that accuracy firstly increases and then decreases with increase of neighborhood size the model yields the best result 97 40 using 7 7 moore neighborhood and spatial scale of 6m 3 this paper compares simulation results of 3 3 moore neighborhood at spatial scale of 2m result a and 7 7 moore neighborhood at spatial scale of 6m result b center point of result a drifted 7 087m toward 86 3767 drift distance is short and its direction deviates 6 52 however result b only deviated from real situation about 4 3309 it also has a long drift distance 18 599m approaching 23 152m of verification image 4 by overlapping verification image simulation results are in good agreement with verification image especially in north and south but result a has obvious errors in the east and west for short drift distance compared with result a result b only has a few errors in the northwest and northeast after calculating overall accuracy kappa or fom it is found that result b have better performance meaning the proposed model can obtain better results after sensitivity analysis declaration of competing interest the authors

and accuracy of oil slick models johansen et al 2003 this paper uses data at 8 34 06 and 8 39 47 on june 27th oil area at 8 34 06 is defined as initial image oil area at 8 40 47 is defined as verification image which is used to verify simulation results fig 1 it can be seen that oil areas diffuse from center to periphery by comparing initial image and verification image fig 2 a therefore euclidean distance to center point is obtained by using gis software it is used as an impact factor in this paper fig 2b the information of currents and wind is also collected the wind blew at a speed of 10 4 m s with direction of 294 7 north is 0 clockwise the currents had a speed of 8 5 cm s toward 251 6 projection of currents and wind are obtained as impact factors fig 2c and fig 2d temperature and salinity are also collected at sea surface in study area fig 2e and fig 2f in order to speed up convergence in training process and facilitate comparison among factors normalization is adopted to regulate their values into 0 1 these five impact factors distance currents wind salinity and temperature and two images initial image and verification image are converted into raster format the raster data is easy to obtain training samples besides it is highly consistent with ca models 2 2 logistic regression ca model ca model is an effective model in geographical simulation because of its advantages in self organization high resolution and feedback wu 2002 liu et al 2008 a geographical ca model usually contains different spatial variables li and yeh 2004 li et al 2012 chen et al 2014 these variables may include distance wind currents salinity and temperature in simulating oil slick zhang and qiao 2017 in logistic regression ca model a cell i j state can be addressed as 1 s i j t 1 f s i j t p d i j t f s i j t p g i j t ω i j t r a where s t s t 1 are states at time t and t 1 p d i j t is change probability p g i j t is suitability probability ω i j t is neighborhood function and r a is a stochastic item change probability is a probability value from a non oil cell i j to an oil cell which can be expressed as 2 p d i j t p g i j t ω i j t r a suitability probability p g i j t can be presented as 3 p g i j t 1 1 exp z i j where z i j is composite evaluation score which is calculated by 4 z i j b c k b k x k where b c is a constant b k is parameter value of spatial variables b c and b k can be obtained by using training samples and logistic regression method x k is spatial variables representing impact factors such as distance wind currents salinity and temperature of oil slick neighborhood function ω i j t is total number of oil cells in neighborhood around center cell detail information about neighborhood structures can be found in section 3 3 5 ω i j t c o n s i j t o i l n e i g h b o r c o u n t stochastic term ra is defined as 6 r a 1 ln r a where r is a stochastic factor between 0 and 1 and a is a parameter controlling stochastic factor at each iteration p d i j t 1 is compared with a threshold value to determine whether a non oil cell is converted into an oil cell if p d i j t 1 threshold and cell i j is non oil cell then state of cell i j will be converted into oil cell after establishing logistic regression ca model it is easy to simulate oil slick using initial image and parameters at a bottom up approach 2 3 model validation many indices are calculated based on confusion matrix among them overall accuracy p is the most commonly used li and yeh 2004 7 p s u m s r i g h t s where s r i g h t is the area where simulation result is consistent with real situation and s is the area of study area overall accuracy only calculates values on the diagonal in confusion matrix which only reflects correct situation therefore some scholars used kappa coefficient which includes all values in confusion matrix liu et al 2008 8 k a p p a p p e 1 p e where p is overall accuracy p e a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 a n b n s s n is number of categories a 1 a 2 a n is the area of each class in real situation b 1 b 2 b n is the area of each class in simulation result the areas which do not change usually have large proportion in simulation result however percentage of changed areas is low both of overall accuracy and kappa coefficient include unchanged areas making their values high some scholars use figure of merit fom to avoid this problem liu et al 2017 9 f o m b a b c d where a is the area changed into oil area in actual situation while simulation results remain unchanged b is the area changed into oil area in both actual situation and simulation results c is the area changed into non oil area in actual situation while simulation results have other different changed results d is the area changed into oil area in simulation results while actual situation remains unchanged 3 results and discussion 3 1 training samples studies have shown that ca models need parameter calibration before being applied to simulation prediction of study area wu 2002 chen et al 2014 parameter calibration is a process of finding the best parameters this process often requires kinds of samples li and yeh 2002 size of training samples or sampling ratio has a great impact on parameters which determines simulation performance in order to obtain better simulation results sensitivity analysis of training samples was proposed on sampling ratio in this section five impact factors distance currents wind salinity and temperature and two images are firstly collected with format of raster data after that monte carlo method was used to obtain locations randomly in training process each location has six values five impact factors and one change state the change state is a mark which reflects changes between initial image and verification image for example if a cell is non oil cell in initial image and it changes into oil cell in verification image then the cell has a changed state marked by 1 for convenience and then logistic regression method of spss software is used to obtain parameter values in the method the first five columns in sample values of impact factors are used as independent variables the last column change state is used as dependent variable in order to obtain reasonable parameter values samples are randomly selected for ten times each sample will yield a combination of parameter values the mean values are used as the final parameter values in order to study ratio or size of training samples on simulation results sampling ratios are set to 2 6 10 14 18 22 26 30 36 and 40 table 1 previous researches show that if fewer samples are used in training process it will yield parameter values with large deviation higher sampling ratio will help to obtain better parameters meanwhile computation increase in training process li and yeh 1998 in our experiment it can be found that parameter values become stable with increase of sampling ratio that is parameter values deviate from mean values when sampling ratio is 2 and 6 if sampling ratio is over 10 parameter changes become small it can also be seen that simulation accuracy is relatively low in sampling ratios of 2 and 6 however simulation results are better for other ratios according to accuracy besides they also have similar parameter values since each impact factor is normalized before being sampled and trained parameter values can reflect their contribution parameter value of distance is 8 643 mean value that is distance has the most important influence on simulation results its parameter value is negative meaning the closer to oil center the more likely it becomes an oil slick area parameter values of currents and wind are 0 869 and 0 827 respectively they are the key factors which can be used to simulate drift characteristic of oil slick the least important variables are salinity 0 202 and temperature 0 124 mainly because of short simulation process it can be found that difference in overall accuracy is relatively small between 96 30 and 96 39 in different sampling ratios besides parameter changes are relatively small the mean values are firstly obtained for comparing deviation and fluctuation ranges fluctuation ranges of distance currents wind salinity and temperature are 0 481 0 084 0 041 0 333 and 0 264 respectively besides simulation accuracy fluctuates only about 0 09 it can be found that their ranges are even smaller only 0 109 0 031 0 027 0 078 and 0 118 respectively when sampling ratio is larger than 10 fluctuation range of simulation accuracy is also smaller 0 07 the standard deviation was also used to measure deviation range of parameters standard deviations of distance currents wind salinity and temperature are 0 130 0 028 0 013 0 094 and 0 088 respectively it is also found that the best accuracy cab be obtained at sampling ratio of 22 the parameter values are also compared with mean values their deviations are only 0 18 1 01 38 10 and 70 16 respectively since best accuracy can be obtained at sampling ratio of 22 following sections will discuss simulation performance under this pre condition existing experiments have shown that samples should have enough information in training process however both types should have a suitable ratio in logistic regression model li and yeh 1998 this paper classifies study area into two categories oil and non oil areas proportions of oil areas in samples are set to be 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 and 40 table 2 and total number of samples oil and non oil areas is equal to 22 of study area it can be seen that when proportion increased from 5 to 15 accuracy has an upward trend from 96 26 to 96 40 however accuracy decreases to 96 32 as proportion increases to 40 this is because many oil areas are involved into samples as proportion increases the samples become more different from real situation thus accuracy decreases with increase of oil proportion it can also be found that parameter values of distance change obviously from 14 014 to 5 854 as proportion increases it is indicated that average distance to center point becomes short and contribution of distance becomes small some scholars believed that categories proportion in samples should be similar to their proportion in study area li and yeh 2002 after calculation it is found that oil areas accounted for 12 61 of study area according to this proportion a new sample and its parameter values table 2 can be obtained this parameter combination yields a better simulation result with 96 41 it is consistent with previous researches 3 2 spatial scale and neighborhood structure spatial scale is an inevitable problem when ca model are applied into a real geographic phenomenon it will directly affect performance of simulation results li et al 2012 in this paper original data is resampled into 2m 4m 6m 8m 10m respectively logistic regression ca model was used to simulate oil slick at these five different spatial scales fig 3 it also can be found that boundaries of simulation results become rough due to downscale drift distances are short in scales of 2m and 4m however it is obvious that simulation results drift to east and south in 6m and 10m these two simulation results are in accord with real situation besides their accuracies are higher than 97 when spatial scale increases from 2m to 6m accuracy increases from 96 41 to 97 32 it has the best performance at 6m as spatial scale increases 8m accuracy decreases 96 46 and then increases to 97 11 at 10m spatial scales and neighborhood structure are often combined to discuss their influence on simulation results zhang et al 2020 in ca model standard moore neighborhood is the most commonly used with spatial range of 3 3 in this neighborhood center cell black has 8 neighbor cells fig 4 some researchers used another neighborhood structure named von neumann neighborhood there are only 4 neighbor cells around center cell which are up down left and right cell the ca model is applied by using these two different neighborhood structures and five spatial scales overall accuracy of results is shown in table 3 it can be seen that accuracy fluctuates with spatial scales by comparing two neighborhood structures it can be found that difference of accuracy is small 0 01 0 03 it is hard to tell which kind of neighborhood structure is much better however it can be found that simulation results of both neighborhood structures perform well in spatial scale of 6m therefore following part will discuss simulation performance of ca model in spatial scale of 6m see table 4 in standard neighborhood structure center cell is only affected by its nearest neighbor some scholars believe that extended neighborhood should be considered such as 5 5 neighborhood and 9 9 neighborhood fig 4 li and yeh 2002 the ca model was applied to test performance of different neighborhood sizes in spatial scale of 6m on the whole inverted u shaped curve is found in accuracy of moore neighborhood when neighborhood size increases from 3 3 to 7 7 accuracy increases from 97 32 to 97 40 and then accuracy drops to 97 26 in 9 9 neighborhood finally it rises to 97 34 at 13 13 in experiments of von neumann neighborhood accuracy increases from 97 30 to 97 34 and then slightly dropped to 97 33 when neighborhood size increases 3 3 to 7 7 at 9 9 and 11 11 neighborhood size this model has the best simulation performance with accuracy of 97 34 after that it goes down to 97 26 at neighborhood size of 13 13 in general ca model performs best 97 40 in 7 7 moore neighborhood structure 3 3 visualization of simulation results this paper selects two results to compare performance before and after sensitivity analysis fig 5 one is the simulation result use 3 3 moore neighborhood at spatial scale of 2m result a the other is the simulation result using 7 7 moore neighborhood at spatial scale of 6m result b it can be found that boundary of result a 2m is smooth while result b 6m is relatively rough for lower spatial resolution in result a it is much straighter on the eastern side than the other sides fig 5a comparing with result a result b is like an ellipse in shape fig 5d by overlapping initial image and simulation results it is found that both results diffuse from center to periphery and drift toward east and south fig 5b and e besides result b drifts further than result a in order to facilitate quantitative comparison drift direction and distance are obtained for result a result b and verification image in verification image center point drifted 23 152m toward 92 8967 center point of result a drifted 7 087m toward 86 3767 which deviated from real situation about 6 52 besides drift characteristic is not obvious for short drift distance in result b its center point drifted 18 599m toward 97 2276 its drift direction deviated from real situation about 4 3309 which is better than result a from fig 5c and fig 5f it can be found that two simulation results are consistent with verification image in northern and southern however result a has obvious simulation errors in the eastern and western for short drift distance compared with result a result b has a better performance in shape a longer term verification image ultraviolet uv image black line in fig 6 is obtained from deepspill project it can be found that oil slick is large in the north and small in the south it is like a tail which is mainly affected by currents and wind the logistic regression ca model is also used to simulate oil slick it can be seen that simulation result gray in fig 6 has a drift tendency to northwest the drift tendency of simulation result is consistent with that of uv image however there are differences in the south and north from morphological view this is mainly because importance of factors had changed during simulation process meanwhile their parameter values changed accordingly therefore parameters change of impact factors need to be considered in a long term simulation especially for the key factors such as wind and currents three different point to point indices are used for quantitative comparison including overall accuracy kappa coefficient and fom table 5 it can be found that result a and result b have high simulation accuracy which are 96 41 and 97 40 respectively simulation accuracy of result b is higher 0 99 than that of result a it is believed that simulation result has a high agreement with actual situation when kappa coefficient is greater than 0 8 liu et al 2008 in our experimental results result a 0 891 and result b 0 928 have high values of kappa coefficient overall accuracy and kappa coefficient are closely related to the size of study area fom can be used to avoid the problem it only evaluates the accuracy of changed type in simulation result it is found that fom of result a and result b are 0 745 and 0 823 respectively which are high by comparing others researches liu et al 2017 it indicates that simulation results fit well with verification image from view of overall accuracy kappa and fom it also can be found that result b is have better performance than result a it means that ca model will perform better after sensitivity analysis 4 discussion in this paper sensitivity analysis is performed by designing experiments of sampling ratios spatial scales and neighborhood structures experiments showed that logistic regression ca model can help to obtain a better result after sensitivity analysis this model is different from numerical models numerical models clearly distinguish stages of oil spills such as diffusion evaporation dissolution emulsification biodegradation and sedimentation in each stage there are obvious physical or chemical processes involving many parameters that need to be determined and calibrated zheng et al 2003 chen et al 2015 spaulding 2017 this is an explicit expression which is popular in numerical models however implicit way is used in this model logistic regression is adopted to obtain parameter values of impact factors in logistic regression each impact factor has one corresponding parameter value the size of parameter value can be used to reflect its contribution on oil slick compared with numerical models the proposed model is relatively simple with a few parameters moreover the model can be calibrated easily in other research fields such as land use changes some scholars have successfully used logistic regression to obtain transition rules parameter values in ca model wu 2002 zhang et al 2020 besides kinds of algorithm can be used to calibrate parameter values liu et al 2008 previous ca models mainly focus on selection of impact factors principal component analysis of factors and acquisition of parameter values in simulating oil spill zhang and qiao 2017 while this paper focuses on neighborhood structures neighborhood sizes spatial scales and application the aims are to build a suitable model for specified application scenarios and discuss impact of structures on simulation results however some issues should be considered in further studies in experiments each cell around center cell is considered to be the same in calculating neighborhood function equation 5 it is different from some researches four adjacent cells up down left and right cells are more important than diagonal cells in experiments of karafyllidis 1997 it should be noted that if wind and currents are included influence of neighborhood cells will be much more different neighborhood structures become complicated in this condition besides dissolution and sedimentation should be considered in a longer term simulation process shyue et al 2007 glug and was 2018 in experiments the proposed ca model has a good performance at spatial scale of 6m however this model outputs poor simulation results at a higher resolution such as 2m it is different from others research fields such as urban expansion zhang et al 2020 therefore it is necessary to consider how to improve simulation performance at a higher resolution in study field of remote sensing some scholars used fusion methods to integrate low and high resolution images to obtain better results gallaudet and simpson 1991 hu and xu 2018 in addition existing ca models for oil slick are mostly based on two dimension space we should pay more attention to three dimension ca models these models is easy to analyze the interaction between surface and subsurface they also can help to analyze processes of emulsification and sedimentation wei et al 2015 paiva et al 2017 in addition some scholars have carried out tentative work on finding optimal model parameters such as genetic algorithms and data assimilation algorithms gomez et al 2011 wang et al 2013 these inspiring work will help to obtain a result with high resolution in time and space therefore combination with optimization algorithm and ca model may be a solution for complex multi stage and long term process of oil spill 5 conclusion oil spill is an important marine problem for many countries and regions in the world it comes from different ways among them oil spill from ships and oil fields is the most commonly concerned it will pour a lot of oil in a short time taking a long time for ecological restoration it is necessary to carry out emergency strategies to control this kind of oil spill the base of emergency strategy is an accurate simulation of oil spill in this paper logistic regression method is used to obtain parameter values after that a logistic regression ca model is constructed for simulating oil slick in order to obtain a better simulation result the model was calibrated by using sampling ratios spatial scales and neighborhood structures it was verified by being applied into experiments of deepspill project some important conclusions were obtained as follows 1 better parameters values higher accuracy can be obtained with increase of sampling ratio when sampling ratio is higher than 10 improvement of overall accuracy is not obvious after analyzing proportion of oil areas in samples it was found that the best parameter values can be obtained at 12 61 this proportion is consistent with proportion of oil slick area in study area it is also found that distance is the key factor followed by currents and wind the least important factors are salinity and temperature 2 overall accuracy fluctuates with changes of spatial scales in standard moore neighborhood and von neumann neighborhood these two neighborhood structures only have small difference about 0 01 0 03 in accuracy after analyzing extended neighborhood it is found that accuracy firstly increases and then decreases with increase of neighborhood size the model yields the best result 97 40 using 7 7 moore neighborhood and spatial scale of 6m 3 this paper compares simulation results of 3 3 moore neighborhood at spatial scale of 2m result a and 7 7 moore neighborhood at spatial scale of 6m result b center point of result a drifted 7 087m toward 86 3767 drift distance is short and its direction deviates 6 52 however result b only deviated from real situation about 4 3309 it also has a long drift distance 18 599m approaching 23 152m of verification image 4 by overlapping verification image simulation results are in good agreement with verification image especially in north and south but result a has obvious errors in the east and west for short drift distance compared with result a result b only has a few errors in the northwest and northeast after calculating overall accuracy kappa or fom it is found that result b have better performance meaning the proposed model can obtain better results after sensitivity analysis declaration of competing interest the authors

21336,in the present study regular water wave interaction with rubble mound offshore breakwaters rmob is investigated the porosity of the rmob is uniform and the breakwaters are placed on the uniform seabed three different types of breakwaters such as i rmob with still water level at the crest ii emerged rmob and iii submerged rmob are considered for the present analysis the associated boundary value problem is handled for the solution using the boundary element method further model tests are conducted and the experimental results are compared with the numerical solutions quantitative analysis is carried out to show the effect of wave height and the height of rmob s on the wave reflection wave transmission and wave energy dissipation an emerged rmob can effectively reduce the wave transmission compared to the submerged rmob and rmob with crest level at swl still water level the results indicate that the minimum transmission coefficient 0 2 can be achieved in the short wave regime this study also suggests that 90 incident wave energy can be dissipated by emerged rmob with 46 porosity keywords porous breakwater boundary element method model test wave transmission wave dissipation 1 introduction permeable structures such as rubble mound offshore breakwaters rmob are generally constructed to protect the shoreline from the incident wave action and also to create tranquility zone within the ports and harbors for safe anchorage of ships and boats often to reduce the soil erosion in coastal zones breakwaters of different structural configurations are used in this regard rmob can act as an effective breakwater system to analyze the performance effectiveness of these rmob a detailed study of the physical parameters such as wave reflection transmission and energy dissipation are of utmost importance the main parameters which control the hydrodynamic performance of rmob are its height porosity water depth incident wave height crest width the slope of the breakwaters and wave period etc dick and brebner 1969 and dattatri et al 1978 studied the effectiveness of using submerged permeable and solid breakwaters with various shapes and configurations in these studies the reflection and transmission coefficients were evaluated as a function of the relative depth of submergence of the breakwaters it was shown that the incident wave energy dissipation occurred due to the creation of turbulence and wave breaking on the crest of the breakwater khader and rai 1980 studied the effect of incident wave steepness and relative height of the rectangular submerged breakwater on the wave energy dissipation and transmission coefficient in general when water waves interact with low crested and surface piercing breakwaters there are two ways in which wave transmission occurs such as i wave transmission through the structure ii wave transmission by overtopping phenomenon powell and allsop 1985 studied the stability of low crested breakwaters using hudson s and spectral stability number they analyzed the performance of the breakwater by considering the effects of breakwater porosity and crest width on the wave transmission the stability analysis of low crested breakwaters was also done by van der meer 1988 van der meer and pilarczyk 1991 and van der meer and daemen 1994 kobayashi and wurjanto 1989 developed a numerical model to study the hydrodynamic processes such as wave reflection and transmission wave breaking etc when monochromatic incident waves impinge on the impermeable breakwater rojanakamthorn et al 1989 used a mild slope equation based mathematical model to study the wave past a submerged porous structure they observed that the magnitude of the dissipated wave energy depends highly on the breakwater crown width losada et al 1992 elucidated the effect of submergence depth on the armor stability of submerged breakwaters and overtopped breakwaters isaacson et al 1996 performed an experimental investigation to study the wave reflection by rubble mound breakwater for an obliquely incident wave in this study the reflection coefficient was calculated for both regular and irregular water waves it was found that the value of the reflection coefficient for irregular water waves was higher than the regular water waves at the same angular frequencies of the incident waves further they observed that the directional spreading for the reflected wavefield is more compared to that of the incident wave field further model tests were conducted by many researchers see chasten et al 1993 gu and wang 1993 hattori and sakai 1995 seabrook and hall 1999 loveless et al 1999 jeon and cho 2006 muttray et al 2012 and cao et al 2012 to study the wave reflection and transmission wave energy dissipation and stability of submerged breakwaters in all the aforementioned papers model tests were performed to analyze the water waves scattering by breakwaters coming back to the theoretical developments to understand the waves interaction with porous breakwaters dalrymple et al 1991 used an eigenfunction expansion method based solution technique to estimate the wave reflection and transmission by a rectangular homogeneous porous structure under oblique incident waves twu et al 2001 studied the wave reflection and transmission characteristics of the submerged multislice porous breakwaters it was observed that the breakwater structures with more slices are more effective in reducing the wave transmission requejo et al 2002 derived the analytical expressions for the reflection and transmission coefficients wave energy dissipation and the wave forces acting on the vertical permeable breakwaters they analyzed the role of the non dimensional parameters such as structural width stone size structural porosity and various wave parameters on the stability and performance of the surface piercing porous breakwater rambabu and mani 2005 used green s function based numerical technique to study the effect of submergence depth material properties incident wave characteristics and crest width on the transmission coefficient for wave past submerged porous breakwaters they found that when the submergence depth is more than half of the water depth porous breakwaters have less influence on controlling the transmission coefficient lee and cheng 2007 developed an analytical solution for the problem of wave scattering by submerged porous structures having multiple regions they have studied the effect of water depth and incident wave steepness within the limit of linearized water wave theory on the reflection coefficient and the dynamic pressure acting on the porous structure lara et al 2008 analyzed the overtopping phenomena when water waves interact with low mound porous breakwater under regular and irregular incident waves for the solution purpose a numerical model based on volume averaged reynolds average navier stokes equations was used and further the results were validated using model tests using the rans based numerical model lin and karunarathna 2007 investigated the solitary wave interaction with a porous breakwater this model is applicable to laminar transitional and turbulent porous flow regimes it was reported that the reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients significantly vary when the incoming waves cross the breaking limits further the reflection coefficient was shown to decrease with an increase in the porosity and the transmission coefficient followed the reverse pattern using the sollitt and cross model for wave past a thick porous structure koley et al 2015a studied the oblique waves scattering by surface piercing and bottom standing thick rectangular porous structure placed near a rigid seawall they analyzed the effect of friction coefficient structural width and the width of the confined zone between the porous structure and the rigid wall to create a tranquility zone in the lee side of the breakwater this work was extended by koley et al 2015b to study the water waves scattering and trapping by a submerged trapezoidal porous breakwater placed on the sloping bottom it was reported that the permeable outer layers of the breakwater help to reduce the wave forces acting on the rigid inner core of the breakwater subsequently behera et al 2015 studied the gravity wave interaction with a thick porous breakwater in a two layered fluid system having a free surface and an interface in this work it was shown that the internal wave and the density ratio have a significant impact on wave scattering and the wave forces acting on the breakwater and the rigid wall placed in the downstream a detailed review of various works related to water wave interaction with porous breakwaters is provided by losada et al 2016 koley and sahoo 2017 used the bem based numerical solution technique to study the interaction of surface waves by a semicircular porous breakwater placed on an undulated porous sea bed they have also considered the case when the semicircular breakwater is placed on a rubble mound foundation and a sloping porous seawall is placed on the lee side of the breakwater the study reveals that for certain combinations of wave parameters 70 90 incoming wave energy can be dissipated by the porous semicircular breakwater with appropriate configurations further it was shown that the radius of the semicircular breakwater plays a significant role in reducing the wave reflection and the wave forces acting on the breakwater this will enhance the stability of the breakwater zhao et al 2018 investigated the role of currents and poroelastic bottom foundations when gravity waves interact with a submerged rubble mound breakwater it was observed that liquefaction around the breakwater occurs mostly when the incident wave and current have the same direction whilst the opposing current can prevent the seabed from liquefaction recently koley 2019 studied the surface gravity wave interaction with multilayered trapezoidal porous breakwater under the action of irregular waves it was concluded that multilayered porous breakwaters could act as an effective wave barrier system from the aforementioned studies it is observed that the wave steepness time period of the incident wave slope and shape of the breakwater the porosity of the breakwater relative water depth are important parameters influencing the wave reflection transmission and wave energy dissipation however these parameters have less influence compared to the relative height and crest width of the breakwaters in the present study water wave interaction with porous rubble mound offshore breakwaters rmob is investigated the porosity of the rmob is uniform in nature and the breakwaters are placed on a uniform bottom three different types of breakwaters such as i rmob with still water level at the crest ii emerged rmob and iii submerged rmob are considered the study is carried out for regular incident waves the flow through the porous rmob is modeled using the well known sollitt and cross model see sollitt and cross 1973 for details the overall structure of the present manuscript is the following in section 2 the mathematical formulation of the problem is provided in section 3 the detailed solution methodology based on the boundary element method bem is presented section 4 contains a detailed experimental set up the numerical and experimental results associated with the reflection coefficient transmission coefficient and wave energy dissipation for various values of the wave and structural parameters are provided in section 5 finally the conclusions for the present study are provided in section 6 it is to be noted that the present breakwater cross section contains only two layers the outer armor and a single inner layer the weight of armor units is higher than the inner layer but both of them have the same porosity normally such breakwater contains more layers the weight of stones in each layer and the porosity of each layer will be different quality assurance in the construction of such breakwater in the open sea is difficult on the other hand if the present concept is used then it will help in ease of construction 2 mathematical formulation in this section the governing equation and boundary conditions associated with the water wave interaction with three different types of porous rmob as mentioned above are provided firstly the formulation is given for rmob with still water level at the crest and emerged rmob subsequently the submerged rmob case is discussed the schematic diagrams for the rmob with still water level at the crest and emerged rmob are provided in figs 1 and 2 respectively the associated boundary value problems are studied in a two dimensional cartesian coordinate system with the x axis being taken in the horizontal direction and the z axis is considered in a vertically upward direction the water depth is d and the mean free surface still water level coincides with z 0 the slopes of the rubble mound breakwaters are 1 1 5 on both the left and right sides of the breakwater these two sided slopes are the same for all three types of rmob further it is assumed that the height of the breakwater is h and the top crest width of the breakwater is c moreover the width of the breakwater along the bottom boundary is b as seen in 1 and 2 the incident wave is propagating from x to x direction in the presence of the breakwater the total fluid domain is divided into three regions r j for j 1 2 3 here r 1 is the left sided open water region of the breakwater r 2 is the region within the breakwater and r 3 is the right sided open water region of the breakwater the water is treated as incompressible and inviscid in nature further the water motion is assumed to be irrotational and simple harmonic in time with angular frequency ω so that the velocity potential can be expressed as 1 φ j x z t ℜ ϕ j x z e i ω t j 1 2 3 where ℜ denotes the real part of the complex velocity potential ϕ j x z for j 1 2 3 and ω is the angular frequency in each of the regions r j the spatial velocity potential ϕ j x z satisfies the

impermeable solid bottom the bottom boundary condition is given by 4 ϕ j n 0 on γ b j for j 1 2 3 where n represents the normal derivative here k ω 2 g with g being the gravitational acceleration the interface boundary conditions are given by 5 ϕ j m i f ϕ 2 on γ p 2 j for j 1 3 ϕ j n ϵ ϕ 2 n on γ p 2 j for j 1 3 where m and f are the inertial and frictional coefficients respectively and ϵ is the porosity of the rmob see sollitt and cross 1973 and koley and sahoo 2017 for detailed derivations assuming the two auxiliary boundaries γ l and γ r are situated three times away from the rmob so that the effect of the local evanescent wave modes will vanish on the auxiliary boundaries therefore the far field boundary conditions are given by 6 ϕ 1 x z e i k 0 x f 0 k 0 z r 0 e i k 0 x f 0 k 0 z as

f 0 k 0 z represents the complex conjugate of f 0 k 0 z for the submerged rmob case the schematic diagram is provided in fig 3 unlike the case of rmob with still water level at crest and emerged rmob as shown in figs 1 and 2 the total water domain is divided into two regions r 1 and r 2 for this submerged rmob case the governing equation and the boundary conditions on γ f 1 γ b j and γ p 21 remain same as presented in eqs 2 5 further the far field condition on γ l remains the same as written in eq 7 whilst the far field boundary condition on γ r is modified as the following 9 ϕ 1 n i k 0 ϕ 1 0

technique firstly the solution procedure is provided for rmob with still water level at the crest and emerged rmob subsequently the solution procedure for the submerged rmob case is discussed in the present solution procedure the boundary value problems as discussed above are converted firstly into a system of fredholm integral equations of the second kind thereafter the bem based solution methodology is applied to discretize the system of integral equations and converted the integral equations into a system of linear algebraic equations in the bem solution technique generally free space green s function is used the free space green s function g x z x 0 z 0 for the present problem satisfies the following differential equation 10 2 g x z x 0 z 0 δ x x 0 δ z z 0 where x z and x 0 z 0 are the field and source points respectively the form of the green s function g x z x 0 z 0 is the following 11 g x z x 0 z 0 1 2 π ln r r x x 0 2 z z 0 2 now the normal derivative of the green s

reflection coefficient is expressed as the following 26 k r r 0 1 i ω g a a 0 e i k 0 l n 1 n l ϕ 1 l z n z n z n 1 cosh k 0 d z d z where a 0 2 k 0 h sinh 2 k 0 d 4 k 0 cosh k 0 d in a similar manner the transmission coefficient is calculated using the formulae 27 k t t 0 ω g a a 0 n 1 n r ϕ j r z n z n z n 1 cosh k 0 d z d z where j 1 for submerged rmob and j 2 for other two cases according to the law of the conservation of energy the incident wave energy must be equal to the sum of transmitted wave energy reflected wave energy and wave energy loss hence the equation representing the law of conservation of energy can be used as follows 28 e i e t e r e l where e i is the incident wave energy e t is the transmitted wave energy e r is the reflected wave energy and e l represents the energy loss using eq 28 the energy loss coefficient k l can be obtained as the following 29 k l 1 k r 2 k t 2 1 2 in the next section the detailed model tests of the porous breakwater is provided 4 experimental setup to validate the numerical model as discussed in section 2 a physical model study is carried out in 54 5 m long 0 6 m wide glass wave flume at kuwait institute for scientific research kuwait the schematic diagram for the experimental arrangement for measuring incident reflected and transmitted wave fields in the wave flume is provided in fig 4 for the present study the following three rmob configurations are selected see table 1 the breakwater is designed for a significant wave height of 15 cm the stability coefficient k d 2 2 is used and the specific gravity of the stones used is 3 04 the stones are rough angular and armor stones of 0 7 to 1 2 kg are used one hundred armor stones are randomly selected and weighed the average weight of the stones is 0 88 kg and the standard deviation is 0 134 kg about 0 4 kg to 0 7 kg stones are used as inner stones and core the average weight of the inner stones is 0 53 kg and the standard deviation is 0 073 kg the other important properties of the armor and inner stones are provided in table 2 it is to be noted that the average porosity of the rmob is 46 05 the volume of stone required for the submerged rmob is 0 66 m 3 m run the volume of stone required for the rmob with crest level at swl is 0 875 m 3 m run and the volume of stone required for the emerged rmob is 1 12 m 3 m run with reference to the rmob with the crest at swl the submerged breakwater consumes about 24 6 less material whereas the emerged rmob consumes 28 more material in general the emerged rmob has better wave transmission characteristics than submerged rmob but at the expense of consuming more materials for its construction the experimental investigation is carried out with regular waves having a wide range of wave heights and periods the wave transmission and reflection are measured for the present model the scale ratio for the arabian gulf type marine environment is about 1 10 for open sea conditions the scale ratio is about 1 20 for the above scale ratio the wave periods say peak period in the fields for arabian gulf type are in the range of 3 s to 15 s and for the open sea it is from 4 5 s to 24 s the basic input parameters for the regular waves are as follows incident wave height h i wave period t water depth d d 70 cm for all of the tests wave length l the normalized input parameters related to this study are the relative wave height h i d incident wave steepness h i l relative water depth d l or k d where k is the wave number with k 2 π l and the ursell parameter u r u r h l 2 d 3 the values of the normalized input parameters are listed in table 3 the last two rows depict the minimum and maximum values of the normalized parameters it can be seen from the table that the relative wave height h i d ranges from 0 071 to 0 214 it can also be assured from the range of incident wave steepness h i l 0 004 to 0 107 that the work can be used for a wide range of field conditions the relative water depth d l is varied from 0 05 to 0 5 and k d is varied from 0 314 to 3 14 which indicates that the study covers the entire intermediate water depth conditions the range of ursell parameter u r is from 0 286 to 85 714 so that the wave interaction covers linear to the nonlinear range the field application conditions of the present study are clear from these normalized input parameter ranges it is to be noted that the wave periods are derived to suit d l in the range of 0 05 to 0 5 with a constant increment of 0 05 this will help in a better representation of the effect of relative water depth on output parameters it was not possible to generate waves for d l smaller than 0 05 because of the mechanical conditions of the wavemaker 4 1 instrumentation wave probes are used for measuring the incident transmitted and reflected wave histories conductivity type wave probes are used for measuring the wave climate at different locations inside the wave flume the wave probes are 60 cm long its resolution is 0 01 mm and the accuracy is 2 4 2 wave data collection details the waves are generated using the piston type wavemaker purchased from dhi denmark the speed of travel or celerity of short period waves is lower than long period waves for example waves with a wave period of 0 949 s reach the model section after 30 s whereas waves with 5 428 s period reach after 15 s hence it is not required to collect the data immediately after the wavemaker started operating data are collected with a data acquisition speed of 40 samples s for all regular wave runs the data are collected for a span of 30 s the starting time for data acquisition is selected such that the wave s height reaches a steady state at the model location a clean incident wave condition without any reflection effect is needed for normalizing the outputs such as transmitted wave height for that purpose experimental runs are carried out without the model in the wave flume each configuration had 30 regular wave runs the configuration arrangements are rubble mound submerged rubble mound with the crest at swl and rubble mound emerged hence the total number of runs is 90 4 3 data analysis the dhi wave synthesizer analysis software mikezero is used for the analysis the method of analysis for regular waves and for wave transmission and reflection is explained the wave data from wave probe wp1 measured in the absence of the wave barrier model in the flume are used as incident wave input for the tests the incident wave height h i is determined from these data the wave up crossing analysis is used for regular wave runs and the average value of all of the wave heights within the 30 s span is used as the measured incident wave height the same procedures are adopted for estimating the transmitted wave height data measured using wave probe wp6 are used to estimate the transmitted wave height h t the coefficient of transmission k t is estimated using the formula k t h t h i data from wave probes wp2 wp3 and wp4 are used to estimate the reflected wave height and coefficient of reflection k r which is defined as k r h r h i with h r being the reflected wave height the reflection analysis software in mikezero is based on the method described by mansard and funke 1987 and extended by zelt and skjelbreia 1992 the distance between wave probes wp2 and wp3 is 60 cm and the distance between wave probes wp2 and wp4 is 100 cm these distances are used as inputs for the reflection analysis using three wave probes is preferred over using two wave probes to avoid singularity problems during reflection analysis 5 results and discussions the results of the study are discussed in this section typical wave transmission time series are presented then the effects of wave height on wave transmission reflection and dissipation are presented for all of the three different rmobs thereafter the effects of the crest level of the rmob on wave transmission reflection and dissipation are explored 5 1 typical wave time series typical incident and transmitted wave time series for all of the three different rmobs for h i 10 cm and t 2 014 s are presented in figs 5 8 here the target wave height is h i 10 cm but it is seen in fig 5 that the measured wave height is slightly different we have used the measured wave heights for normalization and for obtaining transmission and reflection coefficients the wave maker generates signal for h i 10 cm but the actual wave height generated always bit different from the intended wave height due to linear transfer functions of the wave maker systems this issue is always rectified by using the measured wave height for all analysis purpose for example to assess the wave transmission coefficient we always use the measured transmitted wave height and measured incident wave height same principle is used for assessing reflection and dissipation coefficients it is clear that the wave transmission is high for submerged offshore breakwater when compared to the rmob with the crest at swl as well as the emerged rmob the minimum wave transmission is for emerged rmob because of the emergence which prevents wave transmission it is to be noted that more volume of stones is needed for emerged rmob than submerged rmob to validate the present numerical solutions a number of results obtained by present bem based solution technique are compared with the analytical results available in losada et al 1996 fig 9 a shows the variation of the reflection coefficient k r versus the relative depth k 0 d for a submerged porous rectangular rmob with h d 0 3 and b d 2 0 similarly in fig 9 b the variation of reflection coefficient k r transmission coefficient k t and dissipation coefficient k l are plotted as a function of non dimensional crest width k 0 b with friction coefficient f 1 0 on the other hand fig 9 c shows the variation of friction coefficient f as a function of ursell number u r for a submerged rmob with h d 0 2 and b d 1 0 the remaining wave and structural parameters are taken same as mentioned in losada et al 1996 it is observed from fig 9 a c that the present numerical solutions are matching quite well with the analytical solutions provided in losada et al 1996 this demonstrates the accuracy of the present numerical solutions some advantages of present bem based numerical method over other analytical solution techniques i e eigenfunction expansion method are the following in the eigenfunction expansion method see sollitt and cross 1973 roots of the dispersion relation in the porous region are required however finding the roots are difficult as all the roots of the dispersion relation in the porous region are complex numbers on the other hand these complex roots are not required in the present bem based solution technique analytical solution techniques are only applicable to breakwaters with regular shapes on the other hand the present bem based numerical technique is applicable to breakwaters having irregular shapes and complex structural configurations in the following sections the effect of wave height and height of the rmob on the wave reflection transmission and wave energy dissipation are discussed for a wide range of wave and structural parameters in a detailed manner 5 2 effect of wave height on k t k r k l on the rmob with crest level at swl in fig 10 a c the variation of transmission coefficient k t reflection coefficient k r and wave energy dissipation k l are plotted as a function of relative water depth d l for different values of relative wave height h i d it is to be noted that the relative water depth d l also takes care of the effect of the wave period smaller values of d l corresponds to the long period waves and larger values of d l corresponds to the small period waves fig 10 a shows that the transmission coefficient k t decreases with an increase in the relative wave height d l this is due to the fact that long waves pass through the breakwater uninterruptedly compared to the short waves moreover it is observed that the transmission coefficient k t reduces with an increase in relative wave height h i d in the short wave regime fig 10 b depicts that the reflection coefficient k r initially decreases with an increase in d l in the long wave regime however for higher values of h i d the reflection coefficient k r increases in an oscillatory manner with an increase in d l in the short wave regime further the reflection coefficient k r increases with an increase in h i d fig 10 c shows that the wave energy dissipation k l increases with an increase in d l the reason behind the same is that long waves do not interact much with rmob further it is seen that the dissipation coefficient k l increases up to a small extent with an increase in h i d 5 3 effect of wave height on k t k r k l on the emerged surface piercing rmob in fig 11 a c the variation of transmission coefficient k t reflection coefficient k r and wave energy dissipation k l are plotted as a function of relative water depth d l for different values of relative wave height h i d it is to be noted that since the breakwater is porous with 46 porosity the wave energy interacting with the breakwater partially emerges through the stones even without any wave overtopping this is the main reason for some wave energy transmission for the emerged breakwater fig 11 a shows that the transmission coefficient k t decreases with an increase in the relative wave height d l further it is observed that the effect of relative water depth d l on the variation of the transmission coefficient k t is insignificant in the short wave regime moreover it is seen that the transmission coefficient k t reduces with an increase in relative wave height h i d at this point it is to be noted that in real project the rmob in real environment is strong enough and the transmission phenomenon of wave will be less fig 11 b depicts that the reflection coefficient k r reduces with an increase in d l in the long wave regime whereas for higher values of h i d the reflection coefficient k r increases in an oscillatory manner with an increase in d l in the short wave regime this oscillatory pattern of the wave reflection is due to the interaction between the incident and reflected waves fig 11 c shows that the wave energy dissipation k l increases with an increase in relative water depth d l the reason behind this phenomenon has already highlighted in fig 10 c in fig 11 d the variation of transmission coefficient k t is plotted as a function of relative water depth d l for various porosity ϵ of the emerged rmob it is seen that with an increase in porosity ϵ the transmission coefficient k t increases however for higher values of structural porosity 46 of the rmob the transmission coefficient k t becomes lower this happens as a part of the incident wave energy is dissipated due to the structural porosity as seen in fig 11 c 5 4 effect of wave height on k t k r k l on the submerged rmob fig 12 a c show the variation of k t k r and k l as a function of relative water depth d l for three different relative wave heights h i d fig 12 a shows that the change in the wave period has a significant effect on the wave transmission over submerged rmob moreover the change in the wave height has a significant effect on wave transmission it is seen that the transmission coefficient k t decreases with an increase in the relative wave height h i d fig 12 b shows that the reflection coefficient k r decreases with an increase in the relative water depth d l in the long wave regime however the reflection coefficient k r increases in an oscillatory manner for higher values of d l in the short wave regime moreover it is observed that the amplitude of oscillation in the reflection coefficient k r increases with an increase in the relative wave heights h i d fig 12 c depicts that the wave energy dissipation k l becomes higher for higher values of relative wave height h i d the reason behind the same is that the incident wave contains more amount of wave energy as the wave height increases 5 5 effect of height of rmob on k t it is important to investigate the effect of the relative height h d of the rmob on the wave transmission for different wave heights h i d in fig 13 a c the variation of the transmission coefficient k t for submerged rmob h d 0 86 rmob with crest at swl h d 1 0 and emerged rmob h d 1 14 are plotted as a function of non dimensional water depth d l for the a mild wave environment h i d 0 071 b moderate wave environment h i d 0 142 and c strong wave environment h i d 0 214 respectively it is to be noted that the effect of wave period is taken care by the variation of the relative water depth d l fig 13 a shows that the transmission coefficient k t decreases with an increase in the relative height of the rmob h d further it is noted that in the case of the submerged rmob h d 0 86 the effect of relative water depth d l on the transmission coefficient k t is insignificant however the transmission coefficient k t for rmob with crest at swl h d 1 0 and emerged rmob h d 1 14 strongly depend on the relative water depth d l it is seen that for rmob with crest at swl h d 1 0 and emerged rmob h d 1 14 the transmission coefficient k t decreases with an increase in the relative water depth d l this is due to the fact that in the long wave regime the wave action on the porous structure is smooth and slow and hence pushes the energy through the pores of the structure easily however in a short wave regime the wave action on the structure is turbulent and agile which causes more dissipation and hence less wave energy is available for transmission the value of the transmission coefficient k t for rmob with crest at swl h d 1 0 is in between the transmission coefficients of submerged rmob h d 0 86 and emerged rmob h d 1 14 similar results can be seen in fig 13 b and c from the above discussion it is clear that the submerged rmob h d 0 86 yields the highest transmission coefficient k t and the emerged rmob h d 1 0 gives the lowest wave transmission coefficient k t for rmob with the crest at swl h d 1 14 the wave transmission is between the former two cases by comparing fig 13 a c it is found that rmobs are more effective in reducing the wave transmission when the relative wave height h i d is increasing from 0 071 to 0 214 5 6 effect of height of rmob on k r it is also important to study the effect of the relative height h d of the rmob on the wave reflection for different wave heights h i d in fig 14 a c the variation of the reflection coefficient k r for submerged rmob h d 0 86 rmob with crest at swl h d 1 0 and emerged rmob h d 1 14 are plotted as a function of non dimensional water depth d l for the a mild wave environment h i d 0 071 b moderate wave environment h i d 0 142 and c strong wave environment h i d 0 214 respectively fig 14 a c show that the reflection coefficient k r decreases with an increase in the relative water depth d l for smaller values of relative wave height h i d however for higher values of h i d the pattern of the reflection coefficient k r is oscillatory in nature with the variation in d l it is observed that the reflection coefficient k r increases with an increase in relative height of rmob h d irrespective of the variation in relative wave height h i d this observation demonstrates that among the three rmobs the wave reflection is minimum for submerged rmob and maximum for emerged rmob 5 7 effect of height of rmob on k l the effects of the height of rmob on the dissipation coefficient k l as a function of relative water depth d l are presented in fig 15 a c it is seen from fig 15 a c that the dissipation coefficient k l increases noticeably with an increase in d l for higher values of h d among the three rmobs the wave dissipation is minimum for submerged rmob h d 0 86 and maximum for emerged rmob h d 1 14 the main reason is that more waves interact with emerged rmob more material volume than the submerged rmob less material volume further it is noticed that for smaller wave height h i d 0 071 there is a noticeable difference in wave dissipation due to change in the height of rmob however for the higher wave height h i d 0 214 there is less difference in wave dissipation due to the change in the height of rmob h d it is concluded from the above discussions that the emerged breakwater higher relative water depth d l is the best wave energy dissipater with a dissipation coefficient of more than 0 9 for intermediate and short waves on the other hand the submerged breakwater lower relative water depth d l does not dissipate more wave energy especially for smaller wave height h i d 5 8 comparison between numerical and experimental results in figs 10 15 certain discrepancies between the numerical and experimental results are observed the reasons for the same are the following though the porosity of the breakwater is 46 assessed based on the tests the actual porosity of the model built may vary to the extent of 2 to 3 because of the way the individual stone arrange itself during model building also as the waves pass through the breakwater it may encounter porosities which may be slightly higher or lower than 46 the numerical model assumes an irrotational flow condition in reality the fluid may be irrotational well away from the breakwater section however due to the turbulence and dominant vortex shedding effects around the armor units the fluid becomes rotational around the breakwater cross sections this is one of the reasons for the difference between the numerical and experimental data points 6 conclusions the water wave transmission reflection and dissipation characteristics of rmob with three different structural heights and three different wave heights are investigated numerically and experimentally the associated boundary value problem is handled for the solution using a boundary element method based numerical solution technique a number of physical results involving wave transmission wave reflection and wave energy dissipation characteristics of rmob are analyzed based on the linear water wave theory further a series of physical model tests are conducted and the experimental results are compared with the numerical solutions for validation purposes it is observed that the relative wave height h i d has significant effects in reducing the wave transmission by rmobs however change in relative wave height does not significantly affect the wave reflection by the rmob with the crest level at swl and emerged rmob it is also observed that for smaller wave height h i d 0 071 the changes in the heights of rmobs d h have a significant effect on the wave energy dissipation however for higher wave heights h i d 0 214 there is less difference in wave energy dissipation due to change in the height of rmobs d h moreover the emerged rmob is more effective in reducing wave transmission but needs more volume of rubbles for the construction purpose the wave transmission is high for submerged rmob but the volume of material needed to construct is low the wave transmission by the submerged rmob is almost independent of relative water depth d l whereas it is a strong function of d l for emerged rmob the wave transmission coefficient of less than 0 2 is possible for d l 0 3 by an emerged rmob with h d 1 143 for a wide range of wave heights the results also suggest that 90 incident wave energy can be dissipated by an emerged rmob with 46 porosity in the intermediate and short wave regimes the comparison between the numerical and experimental results of transmission reflection and dissipation

21336,in the present study regular water wave interaction with rubble mound offshore breakwaters rmob is investigated the porosity of the rmob is uniform and the breakwaters are placed on the uniform seabed three different types of breakwaters such as i rmob with still water level at the crest ii emerged rmob and iii submerged rmob are considered for the present analysis the associated boundary value problem is handled for the solution using the boundary element method further model tests are conducted and the experimental results are compared with the numerical solutions quantitative analysis is carried out to show the effect of wave height and the height of rmob s on the wave reflection wave transmission and wave energy dissipation an emerged rmob can effectively reduce the wave transmission compared to the submerged rmob and rmob with crest level at swl still water level the results indicate that the minimum transmission coefficient 0 2 can be achieved in the short wave regime this study also suggests that 90 incident wave energy can be dissipated by emerged rmob with 46 porosity keywords porous breakwater boundary element method model test wave transmission wave dissipation 1 introduction permeable structures such as rubble mound offshore breakwaters rmob are generally constructed to protect the shoreline from the incident wave action and also to create tranquility zone within the ports and harbors for safe anchorage of ships and boats often to reduce the soil erosion in coastal zones breakwaters of different structural configurations are used in this regard rmob can act as an effective breakwater system to analyze the performance effectiveness of these rmob a detailed study of the physical parameters such as wave reflection transmission and energy dissipation are of utmost importance the main parameters which control the hydrodynamic performance of rmob are its height porosity water depth incident wave height crest width the slope of the breakwaters and wave period etc dick and brebner 1969 and dattatri et al 1978 studied the effectiveness of using submerged permeable and solid breakwaters with various shapes and configurations in these studies the reflection and transmission coefficients were evaluated as a function of the relative depth of submergence of the breakwaters it was shown that the incident wave energy dissipation occurred due to the creation of turbulence and wave breaking on the crest of the breakwater khader and rai 1980 studied the effect of incident wave steepness and relative height of the rectangular submerged breakwater on the wave energy dissipation and transmission coefficient in general when water waves interact with low crested and surface piercing breakwaters there are two ways in which wave transmission occurs such as i wave transmission through the structure ii wave transmission by overtopping phenomenon powell and allsop 1985 studied the stability of low crested breakwaters using hudson s and spectral stability number they analyzed the performance of the breakwater by considering the effects of breakwater porosity and crest width on the wave transmission the stability analysis of low crested breakwaters was also done by van der meer 1988 van der meer and pilarczyk 1991 and van der meer and daemen 1994 kobayashi and wurjanto 1989 developed a numerical model to study the hydrodynamic processes such as wave reflection and transmission wave breaking etc when monochromatic incident waves impinge on the impermeable breakwater rojanakamthorn et al 1989 used a mild slope equation based mathematical model to study the wave past a submerged porous structure they observed that the magnitude of the dissipated wave energy depends highly on the breakwater crown width losada et al 1992 elucidated the effect of submergence depth on the armor stability of submerged breakwaters and overtopped breakwaters isaacson et al 1996 performed an experimental investigation to study the wave reflection by rubble mound breakwater for an obliquely incident wave in this study the reflection coefficient was calculated for both regular and irregular water waves it was found that the value of the reflection coefficient for irregular water waves was higher than the regular water waves at the same angular frequencies of the incident waves further they observed that the directional spreading for the reflected wavefield is more compared to that of the incident wave field further model tests were conducted by many researchers see chasten et al 1993 gu and wang 1993 hattori and sakai 1995 seabrook and hall 1999 loveless et al 1999 jeon and cho 2006 muttray et al 2012 and cao et al 2012 to study the wave reflection and transmission wave energy dissipation and stability of submerged breakwaters in all the aforementioned papers model tests were performed to analyze the water waves scattering by breakwaters coming back to the theoretical developments to understand the waves interaction with porous breakwaters dalrymple et al 1991 used an eigenfunction expansion method based solution technique to estimate the wave reflection and transmission by a rectangular homogeneous porous structure under oblique incident waves twu et al 2001 studied the wave reflection and transmission characteristics of the submerged multislice porous breakwaters it was observed that the breakwater structures with more slices are more effective in reducing the wave transmission requejo et al 2002 derived the analytical expressions for the reflection and transmission coefficients wave energy dissipation and the wave forces acting on the vertical permeable breakwaters they analyzed the role of the non dimensional parameters such as structural width stone size structural porosity and various wave parameters on the stability and performance of the surface piercing porous breakwater rambabu and mani 2005 used green s function based numerical technique to study the effect of submergence depth material properties incident wave characteristics and crest width on the transmission coefficient for wave past submerged porous breakwaters they found that when the submergence depth is more than half of the water depth porous breakwaters have less influence on controlling the transmission coefficient lee and cheng 2007 developed an analytical solution for the problem of wave scattering by submerged porous structures having multiple regions they have studied the effect of water depth and incident wave steepness within the limit of linearized water wave theory on the reflection coefficient and the dynamic pressure acting on the porous structure lara et al 2008 analyzed the overtopping phenomena when water waves interact with low mound porous breakwater under regular and irregular incident waves for the solution purpose a numerical model based on volume averaged reynolds average navier stokes equations was used and further the results were validated using model tests using the rans based numerical model lin and karunarathna 2007 investigated the solitary wave interaction with a porous breakwater this model is applicable to laminar transitional and turbulent porous flow regimes it was reported that the reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients significantly vary when the incoming waves cross the breaking limits further the reflection coefficient was shown to decrease with an increase in the porosity and the transmission coefficient followed the reverse pattern using the sollitt and cross model for wave past a thick porous structure koley et al 2015a studied the oblique waves scattering by surface piercing and bottom standing thick rectangular porous structure placed near a rigid seawall they analyzed the effect of friction coefficient structural width and the width of the confined zone between the porous structure and the rigid wall to create a tranquility zone in the lee side of the breakwater this work was extended by koley et al 2015b to study the water waves scattering and trapping by a submerged trapezoidal porous breakwater placed on the sloping bottom it was reported that the permeable outer layers of the breakwater help to reduce the wave forces acting on the rigid inner core of the breakwater subsequently behera et al 2015 studied the gravity wave interaction with a thick porous breakwater in a two layered fluid system having a free surface and an interface in this work it was shown that the internal wave and the density ratio have a significant impact on wave scattering and the wave forces acting on the breakwater and the rigid wall placed in the downstream a detailed review of various works related to water wave interaction with porous breakwaters is provided by losada et al 2016 koley and sahoo 2017 used the bem based numerical solution technique to study the interaction of surface waves by a semicircular porous breakwater placed on an undulated porous sea bed they have also considered the case when the semicircular breakwater is placed on a rubble mound foundation and a sloping porous seawall is placed on the lee side of the breakwater the study reveals that for certain combinations of wave parameters 70 90 incoming wave energy can be dissipated by the porous semicircular breakwater with appropriate configurations further it was shown that the radius of the semicircular breakwater plays a significant role in reducing the wave reflection and the wave forces acting on the breakwater this will enhance the stability of the breakwater zhao et al 2018 investigated the role of currents and poroelastic bottom foundations when gravity waves interact with a submerged rubble mound breakwater it was observed that liquefaction around the breakwater occurs mostly when the incident wave and current have the same direction whilst the opposing current can prevent the seabed from liquefaction recently koley 2019 studied the surface gravity wave interaction with multilayered trapezoidal porous breakwater under the action of irregular waves it was concluded that multilayered porous breakwaters could act as an effective wave barrier system from the aforementioned studies it is observed that the wave steepness time period of the incident wave slope and shape of the breakwater the porosity of the breakwater relative water depth are important parameters influencing the wave reflection transmission and wave energy dissipation however these parameters have less influence compared to the relative height and crest width of the breakwaters in the present study water wave interaction with porous rubble mound offshore breakwaters rmob is investigated the porosity of the rmob is uniform in nature and the breakwaters are placed on a uniform bottom three different types of breakwaters such as i rmob with still water level at the crest ii emerged rmob and iii submerged rmob are considered the study is carried out for regular incident waves the flow through the porous rmob is modeled using the well known sollitt and cross model see sollitt and cross 1973 for details the overall structure of the present manuscript is the following in section 2 the mathematical formulation of the problem is provided in section 3 the detailed solution methodology based on the boundary element method bem is presented section 4 contains a detailed experimental set up the numerical and experimental results associated with the reflection coefficient transmission coefficient and wave energy dissipation for various values of the wave and structural parameters are provided in section 5 finally the conclusions for the present study are provided in section 6 it is to be noted that the present breakwater cross section contains only two layers the outer armor and a single inner layer the weight of armor units is higher than the inner layer but both of them have the same porosity normally such breakwater contains more layers the weight of stones in each layer and the porosity of each layer will be different quality assurance in the construction of such breakwater in the open sea is difficult on the other hand if the present concept is used then it will help in ease of construction 2 mathematical formulation in this section the governing equation and boundary conditions associated with the water wave interaction with three different types of porous rmob as mentioned above are provided firstly the formulation is given for rmob with still water level at the crest and emerged rmob subsequently the submerged rmob case is discussed the schematic diagrams for the rmob with still water level at the crest and emerged rmob are provided in figs 1 and 2 respectively the associated boundary value problems are studied in a two dimensional cartesian coordinate system with the x axis being taken in the horizontal direction and the z axis is considered in a vertically upward direction the water depth is d and the mean free surface still water level coincides with z 0 the slopes of the rubble mound breakwaters are 1 1 5 on both the left and right sides of the breakwater these two sided slopes are the same for all three types of rmob further it is assumed that the height of the breakwater is h and the top crest width of the breakwater is c moreover the width of the breakwater along the bottom boundary is b as seen in 1 and 2 the incident wave is propagating from x to x direction in the presence of the breakwater the total fluid domain is divided into three regions r j for j 1 2 3 here r 1 is the left sided open water region of the breakwater r 2 is the region within the breakwater and r 3 is the right sided open water region of the breakwater the water is treated as incompressible and inviscid in nature further the water motion is assumed to be irrotational and simple harmonic in time with angular frequency ω so that the velocity potential can be expressed as 1 φ j x z t ℜ ϕ j x z e i ω t j 1 2 3 where ℜ denotes the real part of the complex velocity potential ϕ j x z for j 1 2 3 and ω is the angular frequency in each of the regions r j the spatial velocity potential ϕ j x z satisfies the laplace equation 2 2 ϕ j 0 j 1 2 3 2 2 x 2 2 z 2 the linearized boundary conditions on the free surface are given by 3 ϕ j n k ϕ j 0 on γ f j for j 1 3 ϕ 2 n k m i f ϕ 2 0 on γ f 2 due to the impermeable solid bottom the bottom boundary condition is given by 4 ϕ j n 0 on γ b j for j 1 2 3 where n represents the normal derivative here k ω 2 g with g being the gravitational acceleration the interface boundary conditions are given by 5 ϕ j m i f ϕ 2 on γ p 2 j for j 1 3 ϕ j n ϵ ϕ 2 n on γ p 2 j for j 1 3 where m and f are the inertial and frictional coefficients respectively and ϵ is the porosity of the rmob see sollitt and cross 1973 and koley and sahoo 2017 for detailed derivations assuming the two auxiliary boundaries γ l and γ r are situated three times away from the rmob so that the effect of the local evanescent wave modes will vanish on the auxiliary boundaries therefore the far field boundary conditions are given by 6 ϕ 1 x z e i k 0 x f 0 k 0 z r 0 e i k 0 x f 0 k 0 z as x ϕ 3 x z t 0 e i k 0 x f 0 k 0 z as x where r 0 and t 0 are the unknown coefficients associated with the wave reflection and transmission eq 6 can be rewritten as 7 ϕ 1 ϕ 0 n i k 0 ϕ 1 ϕ 0 0 on γ l ϕ 3 n i k 0 ϕ 3 0 on γ r where ϕ 0 e i k 0 x f 0 k 0 z is the velocity potential of the incident wave with f 0 k 0 z i g a ω cosh k 0 z d cosh k 0 d here k 0 is the positive real root of the dispersion relation k k tanh k d it is to be noted that the vertical eigenfunction f 0 satisfies the following property 8 d 0 f 0 k 0 z f 0 k 0 z d z a a g 2 a 2 ω 2 2 k 0 d sinh 2 k 0 d 4 k 0 cosh 2 k 0 d where f 0 k 0 z represents the complex conjugate of f 0 k 0 z for the submerged rmob case the schematic diagram is provided in fig 3 unlike the case of rmob with still water level at crest and emerged rmob as shown in figs 1 and 2 the total water domain is divided into two regions r 1 and r 2 for this submerged rmob case the governing equation and the boundary conditions on γ f 1 γ b j and γ p 21 remain same as presented in eqs 2 5 further the far field condition on γ l remains the same as written in eq 7 whilst the far field boundary condition on γ r is modified as the following 9 ϕ 1 n i k 0 ϕ 1 0 on γ r 3 numerical solution based on the boundary element method bem in this section the boundary value problems as discussed in section 2 are handled for the solution using the bem based solution technique firstly the solution procedure is provided for rmob with still water level at the crest and emerged rmob subsequently the solution procedure for the submerged rmob case is discussed in the present solution procedure the boundary value problems as discussed above are converted firstly into a system of fredholm integral equations of the second kind thereafter the bem based solution methodology is applied to discretize the system of integral equations and converted the integral equations into a system of linear algebraic equations in the bem solution technique generally free space green s function is used the free space green s function g x z x 0 z 0 for the present problem satisfies the following differential equation 10 2 g x z x 0 z 0 δ x x 0 δ z z 0 where x z and x 0 z 0 are the field and source points respectively the form of the green s function g x z x 0 z 0 is the following 11 g x z x 0 z 0 1 2 π ln r r x x 0 2 z z 0 2 now the normal derivative of the green s function is given by 12 g n 1 2 π r r n 1 2 π r n x r x n z r z where n x and n z are the components of the unit normal vector along the x and z directions respectively to formulate the integral equation the green s second identity is applied to the velocity potential ϕ x z and the green s function g x z x 0 z 0 and the resulting integral equation is of the form see brebbia and dominguez 1994

g n k g ϕ 3 d γ 0 to solve integral eqs 14 16 the entire boundaries of the regions r j for j 1 2 3 are discretized into a finite number of elements and the values of ϕ and ϕ n are assumed to be constants over each element see lee 1970 brebbia and dominguez 1994 and koley 2019 for details further point collocation method is used to generate a system of equations the discretized form of the integral eqs 14 16 are written as the following 17 j 1 n l h i j i k 0 g i j ϕ 1 j γ l j 1 n b 1 h i j ϕ 1 j γ b 1 j 1 n p 21 ϕ 1 j h i j g i j ϕ 1 j n γ p 21 j 1 n f 1 h i j k g i j ϕ 1 j γ f 1 j 1 n

total number of boundary elements on the corresponding boundaries in eqs 17 19 the form of the influence coefficients h i j and g i j are the following 20 h i j 1 2 δ i j γ j g n d γ g i j γ j g d γ where δ i j 1 for i j 0 for i j it is to be noted that the influence coefficients h i j and g i j are evaluated using the gauss legendre quadrature for the case when i j on the other hand h i j and g i j are evaluated analytically for i j the details are deferred here and can be found in brebbia and dominguez 1994 the system of eqs 17 19 can be expressed in the following matrix form as 21 h i k 0 g ϕ 1 γ l h ϕ 1 γ b 1 ϕ 1 h g ϕ 1 n γ p 21 h k g ϕ 1 γ f 1 ϕ 0 n i k 0 ϕ 0 g γ l 22 1 m i f h ϕ 1 1 ϵ g ϕ 1 n γ p 21 h ϕ 2 γ b 2 1 m i f h ϕ 3 1 ϵ g ϕ 3 n γ p 23 h k m i f g ϕ 2 γ f 2 0 23 h ϕ 3 g ϕ 3

3 7 and 9 into 13 the following integral equations are obtained 24 1 2 ϕ 1 x 0 z 0 γ l g n i k 0 g ϕ 1 d γ γ b 1 ϕ 1 g n d γ γ p 21 ϕ 1 g n g ϕ 1 n d γ γ r g n i k 0 g ϕ 1 d γ γ f 1 g n k g ϕ 1 d γ γ

equations and solved to get the unknowns ϕ and ϕ n over each boundary elements once the values of ϕ and ϕ n are evaluated various physical parameters of interests can be easily determined the reflection coefficient is expressed as the following 26 k r r 0 1 i ω g a a 0 e i k 0 l n 1 n l ϕ 1 l z n z n z n 1 cosh k 0 d z d z where a 0 2 k 0 h sinh 2 k 0 d 4 k 0 cosh k 0 d in a similar manner the transmission coefficient is calculated using the formulae 27 k t t 0 ω g a a 0 n 1 n r ϕ j r z n z n z n 1 cosh k 0 d z d z where j 1 for submerged rmob and j 2 for other two cases according to the law of the conservation of energy the incident wave energy must be equal to the sum of transmitted wave energy reflected wave energy and wave energy loss hence the equation representing the law of conservation of energy can be used as follows 28 e i e t e r e l where e i is the incident wave energy e t is the transmitted wave energy e r is the reflected wave energy and e l represents the energy loss using eq 28 the energy loss coefficient k l can be obtained as the following 29 k l 1 k r 2 k t 2 1 2 in the next section the detailed model tests of the porous breakwater is provided 4 experimental setup to validate the numerical model as discussed in section 2 a physical model study is carried out in 54 5 m long 0 6 m wide glass wave flume at kuwait institute for scientific research kuwait the schematic diagram for the experimental arrangement for measuring incident reflected and transmitted wave fields in the wave flume is provided in fig 4 for the present study the following three rmob configurations are selected see table 1 the breakwater is designed for a significant wave height of 15 cm the stability coefficient k d 2 2 is used and the specific gravity of the stones used is 3 04 the stones are rough angular and armor stones of 0 7 to 1 2 kg are used one hundred armor stones are randomly selected and weighed the average weight of the stones is 0 88 kg and the standard deviation is 0 134 kg about 0 4 kg to 0 7 kg stones are used as inner stones and core the average weight of the inner stones is 0 53 kg and the standard deviation is 0 073 kg the other important properties of the armor and inner stones are provided in table 2 it is to be noted that the average porosity of the rmob is 46 05 the volume of stone required for the submerged rmob is 0 66 m 3 m run the volume of stone required for the rmob with crest level at swl is 0 875 m 3 m run and the volume of stone required for the emerged rmob is 1 12 m 3 m run with reference to the rmob with the crest at swl the submerged breakwater consumes about 24 6 less material whereas the emerged rmob consumes 28 more material in general the emerged rmob has better wave transmission characteristics than submerged rmob but at the expense of consuming more materials for its construction the experimental investigation is carried out with regular waves having a wide range of wave heights and periods the wave transmission and reflection are measured for the present model the scale ratio for the arabian gulf type marine environment is about 1 10 for open sea conditions the scale ratio is about 1 20 for the above scale ratio the wave periods say peak period in the fields for arabian gulf type are in the range of 3 s to 15 s and for the open sea it is from 4 5 s to 24 s the basic input parameters for the regular waves are as follows incident wave height h i wave period t water depth d d 70 cm for all of the tests wave length l the normalized input parameters related to this study are the relative wave height h i d incident wave steepness h i l relative water depth d l or k d where k is the wave number with k 2 π l and the ursell parameter u r u r h l 2 d 3 the values of the normalized input parameters are listed in table 3 the last two rows depict the minimum and maximum values of the normalized parameters it can be seen from the table that the relative wave height h i d ranges from 0 071 to 0 214 it can also be assured from the range of incident wave steepness h i l 0 004 to 0 107 that the work can be used for a wide range of field conditions the relative water depth d l is varied from 0 05 to 0 5 and k d is varied from 0 314 to 3 14 which indicates that the study covers the entire intermediate water depth conditions the range of ursell parameter u r is from 0 286 to 85 714 so that the wave interaction covers linear to the nonlinear range the field application conditions of the present study are clear from these normalized input parameter ranges it is to be noted that the wave periods are derived to suit d l in the range of 0 05 to 0 5 with a constant increment of 0 05 this will help in a better representation of the effect of relative water depth on output parameters it was not possible to generate waves for d l smaller than 0 05 because of the mechanical conditions of the wavemaker 4 1 instrumentation wave probes are used for measuring the incident transmitted and reflected wave histories conductivity type wave probes are used for measuring the wave climate at different locations inside the wave flume the wave probes are 60 cm long its resolution is 0 01 mm and the accuracy is 2 4 2 wave data collection details the waves are generated using the piston type wavemaker purchased from dhi denmark the speed of travel or celerity of short period waves is lower than long period waves for example waves with a wave period of 0 949 s reach the model section after 30 s whereas waves with 5 428 s period reach after 15 s hence it is not required to collect the data immediately after the wavemaker started operating data are collected with a data acquisition speed of 40 samples s for all regular wave runs the data are collected for a span of 30 s the starting time for data acquisition is selected such that the wave s height reaches a steady state at the model location a clean incident wave condition without any reflection effect is needed for normalizing the outputs such as transmitted wave height for that purpose experimental runs are carried out without the model in the wave flume each configuration had 30 regular wave runs the configuration arrangements are rubble mound submerged rubble mound with the crest at swl and rubble mound emerged hence the total number of runs is 90 4 3 data analysis the dhi wave synthesizer analysis software mikezero is used for the analysis the method of analysis for regular waves and for wave transmission and reflection is explained the wave data from wave probe wp1 measured in the absence of the wave barrier model in the flume are used as incident wave input for the tests the incident wave height h i is determined from these data the wave up crossing analysis is used for regular wave runs and the average value of all of the wave heights within the 30 s span is used as the measured incident wave height the same procedures are adopted for estimating the transmitted wave height data measured using wave probe wp6 are used to estimate the transmitted wave height h t the coefficient of transmission k t is estimated using the formula k t h t h i data from wave probes wp2 wp3 and wp4 are used to estimate the reflected wave height and coefficient of reflection k r which is defined as k r h r h i with h r being the reflected wave height the reflection analysis software in mikezero is based on the method described by mansard and funke 1987 and extended by zelt and skjelbreia 1992 the distance between wave probes wp2 and wp3 is 60 cm and the distance between wave probes wp2 and wp4 is 100 cm these distances are used as inputs for the reflection analysis using three wave probes is preferred over using two wave probes to avoid singularity problems during reflection analysis 5 results and discussions the results of the study are discussed in this section typical wave transmission time series are presented then the effects of wave height on wave transmission reflection and dissipation are presented for all of the three different rmobs thereafter the effects of the crest level of the rmob on wave transmission reflection and dissipation are explored 5 1 typical wave time series typical incident and transmitted wave time series for all of the three different rmobs for h i 10 cm and t 2 014 s are presented in figs 5 8 here the target wave height is h i 10 cm but it is seen in fig 5 that the measured wave height is slightly different we have used the measured wave heights for normalization and for obtaining transmission and reflection coefficients the wave maker generates signal for h i 10 cm but the actual wave height generated always bit different from the intended wave height due to linear transfer functions of the wave maker systems this issue is always rectified by using the measured wave height for all analysis purpose for example to assess the wave transmission coefficient we always use the measured transmitted wave height and measured incident wave height same principle is used for assessing reflection and dissipation coefficients it is clear that the wave transmission is high for submerged offshore breakwater when compared to the rmob with the crest at swl as well as the emerged rmob the minimum wave transmission is for emerged rmob because of the emergence which prevents wave transmission it is to be noted that more volume of stones is needed for emerged rmob than submerged rmob to validate the present numerical solutions a number of results obtained by present bem based solution technique are compared with the analytical results available in losada et al 1996 fig 9 a shows the variation of the reflection coefficient k r versus the relative depth k 0 d for a submerged porous rectangular rmob with h d 0 3 and b d 2 0 similarly in fig 9 b the variation of reflection coefficient k r transmission coefficient k t and dissipation coefficient k l are plotted as a function of non dimensional crest width k 0 b with friction coefficient f 1 0 on the other hand fig 9 c shows the variation of friction coefficient f as a function of ursell number u r for a submerged rmob with h d 0 2 and b d 1 0 the remaining wave and structural parameters are taken same as mentioned in losada et al 1996 it is observed from fig 9 a c that the present numerical solutions are matching quite well with the analytical solutions provided in losada et al 1996 this demonstrates the accuracy of the present numerical solutions some advantages of present bem based numerical method over other analytical solution techniques i e eigenfunction expansion method are the following in the eigenfunction expansion method see sollitt and cross 1973 roots of the dispersion relation in the porous region are required however finding the roots are difficult as all the roots of the dispersion relation in the porous region are complex numbers on the other hand these complex roots are not required in the present bem based solution technique analytical solution techniques are only applicable to breakwaters with regular shapes on the other hand the present bem based numerical technique is applicable to breakwaters having irregular shapes and complex structural configurations in the following sections the effect of wave height and height of the rmob on the wave reflection transmission and wave energy dissipation are discussed for a wide range of wave and structural parameters in a detailed manner 5 2 effect of wave height on k t k r k l on the rmob with crest level at swl in fig 10 a c the variation of transmission coefficient k t reflection coefficient k r and wave energy dissipation k l are plotted as a function of relative water depth d l for different values of relative wave height h i d it is to be noted that the relative water depth d l also takes care of the effect of the wave period smaller values of d l corresponds to the long period waves and larger values of d l corresponds to the small period waves fig 10 a shows that the transmission coefficient k t decreases with an increase in the relative wave height d l this is due to the fact that long waves pass through the breakwater uninterruptedly compared to the short waves moreover it is observed that the transmission coefficient k t reduces with an increase in relative wave height h i d in the short wave regime fig 10 b depicts that the reflection coefficient k r initially decreases with an increase in d l in the long wave regime however for higher values of h i d the reflection coefficient k r increases in an oscillatory manner with an increase in d l in the short wave regime further the reflection coefficient k r increases with an increase in h i d fig 10 c shows that the wave energy dissipation k l increases with an increase in d l the reason behind the same is that long waves do not interact much with rmob further it is seen that the dissipation coefficient k l increases up to a small extent with an increase in h i d 5 3 effect of wave height on k t k r k l on the emerged surface piercing rmob in fig 11 a c the variation of transmission coefficient k t reflection coefficient k r and wave energy dissipation k l are plotted as a function of relative water depth d l for different values of relative wave height h i d it is to be noted that since the breakwater is porous with 46 porosity the wave energy interacting with the breakwater partially emerges through the stones even without any wave overtopping this is the main reason for some wave energy transmission for the emerged breakwater fig 11 a shows that the transmission coefficient k t decreases with an increase in the relative wave height d l further it is observed that the effect of relative water depth d l on the variation of the transmission coefficient k t is insignificant in the short wave regime moreover it is seen that the transmission coefficient k t reduces with an increase in relative wave height h i d at this point it is to be noted that in real project the rmob in real environment is strong enough and the transmission phenomenon of wave will be less fig 11 b depicts that the reflection coefficient k r reduces with an increase in d l in the long wave regime whereas for higher values of h i d the reflection coefficient k r increases in an oscillatory manner with an increase in d l in the short wave regime this oscillatory pattern of the wave reflection is due to the interaction between the incident and reflected waves fig 11 c shows that the wave energy dissipation k l increases with an increase in relative water depth d l the reason behind this phenomenon has already highlighted in fig 10 c in fig 11 d the variation of transmission coefficient k t is plotted as a function of relative water depth d l for various porosity ϵ of the emerged rmob it is seen that with an increase in porosity ϵ the transmission coefficient k t increases however for higher values of structural porosity 46 of the rmob the transmission coefficient k t becomes lower this happens as a part of the incident wave energy is dissipated due to the structural porosity as seen in fig 11 c 5 4 effect of wave height on k t k r k l on the submerged rmob fig 12 a c show the variation of k t k r and k l as a function of relative water depth d l for three different relative wave heights h i d fig 12 a shows that the change in the wave period has a significant effect on the wave transmission over submerged rmob moreover the change in the wave height has a significant effect on wave transmission it is seen that the transmission coefficient k t decreases with an increase in the relative wave height h i d fig 12 b shows that the reflection coefficient k r decreases with an increase in the relative water depth d l in the long wave regime however the reflection coefficient k r increases in an oscillatory manner for higher values of d l in the short wave regime moreover it is observed that the amplitude of oscillation in the reflection coefficient k r increases with an increase in the relative wave heights h i d fig 12 c depicts that the wave energy dissipation k l becomes higher for higher values of relative wave height h i d the reason behind the same is that the incident wave contains more amount of wave energy as the wave height increases 5 5 effect of height of rmob on k t it is important to investigate the effect of the relative height h d of the rmob on the wave transmission for different wave heights h i d in fig 13 a c the variation of the transmission coefficient k t for submerged rmob h d 0 86 rmob with crest at swl h d 1 0 and emerged rmob h d 1 14 are plotted as a function of non dimensional water depth d l for the a mild wave environment h i d 0 071 b moderate wave environment h i d 0 142 and c strong wave environment h i d 0 214 respectively it is to be noted that the effect of wave period is taken care by the variation of the relative water depth d l fig 13 a shows that the transmission coefficient k t decreases with an increase in the relative height of the rmob h d further it is noted that in the case of the submerged rmob h d 0 86 the effect of relative water depth d l on the transmission coefficient k t is insignificant however the transmission coefficient k t for rmob with crest at swl h d 1 0 and emerged rmob h d 1 14 strongly depend on the relative water depth d l it is seen that for rmob with crest at swl h d 1 0 and emerged rmob h d 1 14 the transmission coefficient k t decreases with an increase in the relative water depth d l this is due to the fact that in the long wave regime the wave action on the porous structure is smooth and slow and hence pushes the energy through the pores of the structure easily however in a short wave regime the wave action on the structure is turbulent and agile which causes more dissipation and hence less wave energy is available for transmission the value of the transmission coefficient k t for rmob with crest at swl h d 1 0 is in between the transmission coefficients of submerged rmob h d 0 86 and emerged rmob h d 1 14 similar results can be seen in fig 13 b and c from the above discussion it is clear that the submerged rmob h d 0 86 yields the highest transmission coefficient k t and the emerged rmob h d 1 0 gives the lowest wave transmission coefficient k t for rmob with the crest at swl h d 1 14 the wave transmission is between the former two cases by comparing fig 13 a c it is found that rmobs are more effective in reducing the wave transmission when the relative wave height h i d is increasing from 0 071 to 0 214 5 6 effect of height of rmob on k r it is also important to study the effect of the relative height h d of the rmob on the wave reflection for different wave heights h i d in fig 14 a c the variation of the reflection coefficient k r for submerged rmob h d 0 86 rmob with crest at swl h d 1 0 and emerged rmob h d 1 14 are plotted as a function of non dimensional water depth d l for the a mild wave environment h i d 0 071 b moderate wave environment h i d 0 142 and c strong wave environment h i d 0 214 respectively fig 14 a c show that the reflection coefficient k r decreases with an increase in the relative water depth d l for smaller values of relative wave height h i d however for higher values of h i d the pattern of the reflection coefficient k r is oscillatory in nature with the variation in d l it is observed that the reflection coefficient k r increases with an increase in relative height of rmob h d irrespective of the variation in relative wave height h i d this observation demonstrates that among the three rmobs the wave reflection is minimum for submerged rmob and maximum for emerged rmob 5 7 effect of height of rmob on k l the effects of the height of rmob on the dissipation coefficient k l as a function of relative water depth d l are presented in fig 15 a c it is seen from fig 15 a c that the dissipation coefficient k l increases noticeably with an increase in d l for higher values of h d among the three rmobs the wave dissipation is minimum for submerged rmob h d 0 86 and maximum for emerged rmob h d 1 14 the main reason is that more waves interact with emerged rmob more material volume than the submerged rmob less material volume further it is noticed that for smaller wave height h i d 0 071 there is a noticeable difference in wave dissipation due to change in the height of rmob however for the higher wave height h i d 0 214 there is less difference in wave dissipation due to the change in the height of rmob h d it is concluded from the above discussions that the emerged breakwater higher relative water depth d l is the best wave energy dissipater with a dissipation coefficient of more than 0 9 for intermediate and short waves on the other hand the submerged breakwater lower relative water depth d l does not dissipate more wave energy especially for smaller wave height h i d 5 8 comparison between numerical and experimental results in figs 10 15 certain discrepancies between the numerical and experimental results are observed the reasons for the same are the following though the porosity of the breakwater is 46 assessed based on the tests the actual porosity of the model built may vary to the extent of 2 to 3 because of the way the individual stone arrange itself during model building also as the waves pass through the breakwater it may encounter porosities which may be slightly higher or lower than 46 the numerical model assumes an irrotational flow condition in reality the fluid may be irrotational well away from the breakwater section however due to the turbulence and dominant vortex shedding effects around the armor units the fluid becomes rotational around the breakwater cross sections this is one of the reasons for the difference between the numerical and experimental data points 6 conclusions the water wave transmission reflection and dissipation characteristics of rmob with three different structural heights and three different wave heights are investigated numerically and experimentally the associated boundary value problem is handled for the solution using a boundary element method based numerical solution technique a number of physical results involving wave transmission wave reflection and wave energy dissipation characteristics of rmob are analyzed based on the linear water wave theory further a series of physical model tests are conducted and the experimental results are compared with the numerical solutions for validation purposes it is observed that the relative wave height h i d has significant effects in reducing the wave transmission by rmobs however change in relative wave height does not significantly affect the wave reflection by the rmob with the crest level at swl and emerged rmob it is also observed that for smaller wave height h i d 0 071 the changes in the heights of rmobs d h have a significant effect on the wave energy dissipation however for higher wave heights h i d 0 214 there is less difference in wave energy dissipation due to change in the height of rmobs d h moreover the emerged rmob is more effective in reducing wave transmission but needs more volume of rubbles for the construction purpose the wave transmission is high for submerged rmob but the volume of material needed to construct is low the wave transmission by the submerged rmob is almost independent of relative water depth d l whereas it is a strong function of d l for emerged rmob the wave transmission coefficient of less than 0 2 is possible for d l 0 3 by an emerged rmob with h d 1 143 for a wide range of wave heights the results also suggest that 90 incident wave energy can be dissipated by an emerged rmob with 46 porosity in the intermediate and short wave regimes the comparison between the numerical and experimental results of transmission reflection and dissipation coefficients shows good agreement these comparisons demonstrate that the present bem based numerical model is able to account adequately for wave transmission wave reflection and wave energy dissipation by the porous rmobs of different configurations for moderate values of the incident wave amplitudes credit authorship contribution statement santanu koley conceptualization methodology

21337,the energy generated by vortex induced vibrations is studied through numerical simulation and the vibration characteristics of the energy harvesting device are studied using a bidirectional coupled fluid structure simulation the energy collector consists of an elastic cylinder with symmetrical grooves which can effectively improve the energy extraction performance the studied range of reynolds numbers is 15 000 to 100 000 1 86 u water 11 63 the performance of the energy collector can be significantly affected by modifying various parameters of the grooved structure moreover changing the damping ratio ζ n will also affect the energy harvesting the results show that the grooves affect the dynamic response of the structure the structure will gallop when the angle between the grooves and the inflow direction is α 30 for a grooved cylinder with α 30 or 60 the effective power p harn of the system can be effectively increased and the grooves can also effectively increase the energy conversion rate η viv especially in the case of structure galloping more energy can be collected and p harn and η viv can be dramatically increased immediately after the structure has entered the lock in region η viv reaches its maximum varying ζ n has little effect on the amplitude of the conductor but it can effectively enhance energy harvesting and energy conversion keywords vortex induced vibration grooved cylinder energy harvesting 1 introduction fluid energy harvesting has always been a fundamental research problem specifically fluid energy harvesting refers to the continuous harvesting storage and utilization of energy contained in moving media and the most common types of such energy harvesting are associated with water and wind among conventional energy generation methods the flow induced vibration approach in particular has been widely studied in recent years ding et al 2020 ma et al 2020 wang et al 2019a wang et al 2020a hu et al 2019 wang et al 2019b zhang et al 2017 when a fluid passes around a blunt body the blunt body structure is subjected to an oscillatory fluid force which results in vibratory motion of the structure this phenomenon is called flow induced vibration in particular vortex induced vibration viv is a kind of vibration with high frequency and low amplitude that is stable and easy to excite the energy characteristics of viv are based on these two features galloping and flutter are both self excited vibrations flutter is a kind of self excited vibration of an elastic structure in a uniform air flow that is caused by the coupling of aerodynamic elastic and inertial forces eugeni et al 2019 galloping refers to a negative aerodynamic damping component caused by flow separation and vortex shedding which leads to unstable vibration of a slender structure notably the cross section that causes galloping is generally noncircular it is very difficult to maintain energy collection under galloping conditions vivs are vibrations perpendicular to the incoming flow direction when the vibration frequency of a structure is near its natural frequency the vibrations are the most violent and the lock in phenomenon occurs in other words within a certain range of fluid velocity the vibration frequency of the structure remains unchanged and identical to the natural frequency of the structure and the amplitude is maximal griffin and koopmann 1977 griffin 1985 zhu and yao 2015 toebes 1969 wang et al 2018 khalak and williamson 1999 stansby 1976 xu et al 2019 zhu et al 2020a akaydın et al 2010 because it is easy to excite such vibrations and they last for a long time the application of vivs for energy harvesting has been a focus of scholars worldwide in recent years the energy harvesting characteristics of vivs have been extensively studied allen and taylor taylor et al 2001 designed an eel device with a polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf device on its surface this device can generate vibrations by means of the whirlpool effect in a kármán vortex street resulting in optimal resonance conditions gao et al 2013 and mehmood et al 2013 designed a piezoelectric cantilever beam structure that generates electric charge through the vibration of a cylinder at the end of the cantilever beam and subsequently collects energy bernitsas et al lee and bernitsas 2011 effectively increased the vibration amplitude of the cylinder by adding a set of rough bands to the surface of the cylinder and expanded the frequency locking range of the energy collector thereby improving the viv energy harvesting characteristics hongrae park et al 2013 applied passive turbulence control ptc in the form of selectively distributed surface roughness on a rigid circular cylinder on two end springs placed perpendicular to a uniform steady flow and the cylinder response was measured experimentally in the reynolds number range of 3 104 re 1 2 105 and throughout a broad range of the main ptc parameters flow induced motion fim enhancement was studied in that paper in the soft galloping zone and two hard galloping zones identified in the ptc to fim map the use of broad field of view laser visualization revealed very different vortex structures between viv and galloping confirming the fundamentally different driving mechanisms of these two fim types ding and bernitsas ding et al 2013b studied the fim of two rigid circular cylinders on linear end springs in tandem using two dimensional unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes 2 d urans simulations verified by experimental data in the transition to shear layer 3 trsl3 regime in which the shear layers are fully saturated and consequently the lift is high the vortex structures in viv the transition from viv to galloping and galloping were also studied later ding et al 2016 conducted further research on this structure analyzed the effect of rough bands on the vortex shedding mode and explored the vibration and energy harvesting characteristics of the energy collector under the interaction of the two cylinders the results show that the proposed device is suitable for the harvesting and utilization of ocean energy at high reynolds numbers wang et al 2019b studied the performance of the device under a low reynolds number wind current the results show that the structure also has a good effect for energy harvesting at low reynolds numbers and when the performance of energy collectors with different cylinders is compared the results show that a triangular column can effectively increase the size of the lock in region for viv ding et al 2018 simulated the flow field and energy collection process for three cylinders with rough strips in tandem and the simulation results were in good agreement with the experimental results a maximum power of 85 26 w was obtained from the interference of the eddy currents between the cylinders in summary to enhance the flow induced vibration and obtain more energy ding et al added rough bands to the cylinder section and carried out a series of corresponding studies inspired by this it is expected that the flow induced vibration of a cylinder can also be significantly enhanced by adding grooves to the cylinder section based on the above analysis a new type of grooved cylinder is proposed in this paper by varying the groove locations the vibrational characteristics and energy harvesting characteristics of the structure are explored 2 physical model based on the energy harvesting characteristics of vivs inspired by ding et al s work ding et al 2013b a new blunt body structure is proposed here and is compared with a smooth cylinder model as shown in fig 1 relative to the smooth cylinder the proposed structure has two grooves each of which is 16 wide and 2 mm deep and the angle between them is 2α in this paper the viv model is simplified to a single degree of freedom mass spring damper system which is mainly composed of the following parts a cylinder with mass m s and diameter d a supporting spring with elastic coefficient k s and a damper with total damping coefficient c s in this system the cylinder vibrates along the y direction which is perpendicular to the incoming flow direction in this paper the vibration characteristics of grooved cylinders of the general design shown in fig 1 b with grooves at different positions are studied by varying the value of α α 30 60 90 120 and 150 the main parameters of the system are shown in table 1 3 numerical simulations 3 1 control equation the motion of a viscous fluid follows the laws of conservation of mass and conservation of momentum the corresponding mathematical descriptions are as follows abdelkefi et al 2012 zhu et al 2020 wang et al 2018 2020 1 continuity equation according to the law of conservation of mass the increment of mass per unit time should be equal to the net mass that flows out of the control body in the same time interval the corresponding differential form is as follows 1 ρ t ρ u x ρ v y ρ w z 0 where u v and w are the velocity vectors in the x y and z directions respectively ρ is the density of the fluid and t is time 2 conservation of momentum for a given microelement body the rate of change in momentum with time should be equal to the sum of the forces acting on the microelement body the momentum equations are essentially equivalent to newton s second law and are expressed as follows 2 ρ u t d i v ρ u u p x τ x x x τ y x y τ z x z ρ f x ρ v t d i v ρ v u p y τ x y x τ y y y τ z y z ρ f y ρ w t d i v ρ w u p z τ x z x τ

3 2 solution method the grooved cylinder spring oscillator system can be simplified as a mass spring damper system khalak and williamson 1999 the equation of motion is as follows 3 m s y c s y k s y f y t where m s is the mass of the grooved cylinder c s is the system damping k s is the elastic coefficient of the system and f y is the fluid force acting on the cylindrical blunt body in the y direction c s can be decomposed as follows 4 c s c s t r u c h a r n where c stru is the mechanical damping of the system and c harn is the damping caused by the internal resistance of the generator when the mechanical energy is converted into electrical energy the two formulas are as follows lee and bernitsas 2011 ding et al 2016 abdelkefi et al 2012 5 ζ s c s 2 m s k s ζ h a r n c h a r n 2 m s k s the dynamic response of the system can be obtained by solving equation 3 with the given parameters 3 3 mathematical model for power calculation the dynamic response of the system is obtained using equation 3 the power of the system in one period is calculated as follows 6 p v i v 1 t o s c 0 t o s c f y y d t by incorporating formula 4 equation 6 can be rewritten as 7 p v i v 1 t o s c 0 t o s c m s y c s y k s y y d t formula 7 is the total power equation of the system to conveniently solve for the power parameters it is assumed that the displacement of the system always exhibits sinusoidal characteristics when the system is undergoing vortex excitation or galloping then the displacement is expressed as 8 y t a sin 2 π f o s c t the vibration velocity in the y direction is 9 y t 2 a π f o s c cos 2 π f o s c t where f osc is the natural frequency of the structure given formula 8 the only nonzero term on the right hand side of formula 7 is the velocity term then we have 10 p v i v 1 t o s c 0 t o s c c s y 2 d t an expression for the system power can be obtained by substituting formula 9 into formula 10 as follows 11 p v i v 8 π 3 m s ζ s f n w a t e r a 2 f o s c 2 where f n water is the natural frequency of the structure in water and is calculated as 12 f n w a t e r 1 2 π k s m s according to the definition of the total damping coefficient in formula 4 the effective power of the system is calculated as 13 p h a r n c h a r n c s p v i v the ratio of the effective power of the system to the flow power in the fluid is 14 η v i v p h a r n p f l u i d where the flow power of the fluid is calculated using the following formula 15 p f l u i d f x u 1 2 ρ u 3 d l here f x is the fluid force acting in the x direction of the structure which can be obtained from the bernoulli equation 16 f x 1 2 ρ u 2 d l it should be noted that other expressions can also be used for the reference power in the fluid such as the power of the total area integrated over the cylinder i e 0 5ρu 3 2a d l notably this latter calculation will lead to a fairly low efficiency there are supporting arguments for using both expressions 3 4 study case settings a user defined function udf was compiled and embedded in fluent to implement the translational motion of the system in this study define cg motion was used as the motion function to define the motion mode of the cylinder the main objective in this paper is to study the vibrational characteristics and energy harvesting characteristics of cylinders with grooves at different locations reynolds numbers in the range of 1 6 103 re 105 are considered and the corresponding equivalent water velocities are in the range 1 86 u water 11 63 the equivalent water velocity is defined as follows 17 u w a t e r u f n w a t e r d where u is the water velocity d is the diameter of the cylinder and f n water is the natural frequency of the system in water the specific study cases are summarized in table 2 4 meshing and model verification in this paper a smooth cylinder and grooved cylinders are analyzed based on simulations using an overlapping mesh for the overset grid method which is also known as the overlapping grid or nested grid method nc anone 2011 there is no need to define an update method instead the user is required to use two or more sets of grids see fig 2 one is the background grid and the others are the foreground grids including the grid of the moving parts and their boundary conditions boundary conditions must be set for the generation of the foreground meshes which can then be assembled and used in ansys fluent by reading the size of the grid around the overset boundary in the foreground mesh beforehand and detecting the size of the background mesh in real time during the movement of the foreground mesh the background mesh and a mesh of a similar size around the foreground mesh boundary can be fused thereby combining the foreground and background meshes into a coupled set of meshes an overset mesh does not have a negative volume and does not cause mesh distortion it is suitable for simulating motions and deformations of various magnitudes in particular for various moving parts this method can overcome the difficulties faced by other methods in early processing and simplify the simulation process in addition it can ensure that the accuracy requirements around the model boundary are met and effectively solve the problem of low accuracy in the simulation of moving parts 4 1 settings for the computational domain and boundary conditions in theory as the computational domain increases in size the fluid characteristics can be more accurately reproduced however when the computational domain is too large considerable resources are wasted therefore it is vital to reasonably establish the computational domain to reduce the waste of computational resources and improve the computational efficiency to ensure the accuracy of the calculation many scholars have examined suitable settings for the computational domain for a flow around a cylinder in this paper the computational domain is defined based on the results of previous studies combined with simulation experience as shown in fig 3 in this study a rectangular computational domain with dimensions of 35d 20d is adopted the distances from the center of the structure to the entrance boundary of the calculation domain the downstream exit boundary and the upper and lower boundaries are 10d 25d and 10d respectively to ensure the calculation accuracy an encrypted area with a diameter of 5d is set up around the cylinder the boundary conditions are set as follows the velocity inlet condition is used at the inlet the pressure outlet condition is used at the outlet the upper and lower walls are free slip walls and the wall of the conductor is a no slip wall the solution model used is the shear stress transport sst k ω turbulence model which can accurately capture the flow characteristics in the main fluid region through the k ε solution and the viscous bottom flow in the region near the wall through the k ω solution this model offers high accuracy for the viv problem moreover considering the precision requirement for the encrypted area in subsequent transverse vibration when using the overset overlapping grid the enlargement of the encrypted area can reduce the error caused by the data exchange among different grid layers hence the encrypted area is set accordingly 4 2 meshing and independence verification different encryption accuracies are used for different reynolds numbers re the size of the boundary grid of the first layer is controlled by the height y for a mostly smooth cylinder y is 1 wieselsberger 1922 kondo 1993 for a grooved cylinder y is in the range of 30 70 the first layer grid height is calculated as follows 18 y 0 172 δ y l r e 0 9 where re is the reynolds number u is the flow velocity and d is the diameter of the structure three encrypted grids of different densities are shown in fig 4 these three grids are investigated for accuracy and computational efficiency the parameters of the verification case are α 60 u 0 465 m s ζ s 0 0161 and k s 474 923 n m the encryption sizes of the three grids of different densities and the calculated cd mean cl rms st and a rms d values are shown in table 3 table 3 shows that when the minimum grid size is 0 005d or 0 0025d there is little difference in the calculated values therefore to balance computational efficiency and accuracy the second grid density is selected for meshing 4 3 model verification to verify the accuracy of the model the aerodynamic parameters of a smooth cylinder with re values of 103 105 under fixed conditions are compared comparisons of the mean drag coefficient cd mean and the strouhal number st are shown in fig 5 as observed in the figure the cd mean values calculated in this paper are slightly larger than the experimental values of wieselsberger wieselsberger 1922 kondo 1993 r f rodi and schnung 1990 because the two dimensional structure simulation analysis in this paper does not consider the three dimensional effects of the structure while the st results are consistent meanwhile in the study of vortex induced vibration energy harvesting the amplitude ratio a d is a key parameter in order to further verify our model we compare the amplitude ratios under different reynolds numbers that is different reduction velocities in water with the previous work gu et al 2020 khalak and williamson 1996 bernitsas 2016 the results are shown in fig 6 generally the simulation method adopted in this paper is reliable and can satisfy the relevant accuracy requirements 5 result analysis in this part a symmetrically grooved cylinder like elastic structure is studied through numerical simulation by varying the locations of the grooves the vibration characteristics frequency characteristics vortex shedding characteristics and energy harvesting characteristics are studied using bidirectional fluid solid coupling finally the energy harvesting characteristics under different system damping ratios are analyzed for the case in which the angle between the two grooves is α 60 5 1 lift and drag coefficients the variations in the mean square value of the lift coefficient cl rms and the mean value of the drag coefficient cd mean with re are shown in fig 7 as observed in this figure when the grooves are in different positions cd mean shows the same variational trend as it does for the smooth cylinder it first increases and subsequently decreases with increasing re when re 30000 the structure begins to enter the lock in region cd mean first reaches its maximum value and subsequently rapidly decreases with increasing velocity in contrast cl rms first slightly increases and subsequently rapidly decreases and when re 30000 its rate of decline rapidly decreases for reynolds numbers in the range of 16000 re 30000 the cl rms and cd mean values of the grooved structure are identical to those of the smooth cylinder however when 30000 re 100000 the cl rms and cd mean values of the grooved structure are larger than those of the smooth cylinder the fluid medium in this simulation is water according to equation 3 the vibration of the device is mainly caused by vortex shedding the lift and drag coefficients of cylinders with grooves at various positions are greater than those of the smooth cylinder at 30000 re 100000 thus the corresponding amplitude responses and energy characteristics will inevitably be improved as discussed below the cl rms and cd mean values of the structure with an angle of α 30 between the two grooves are much larger than those in other cases when the grooves are in this relative position the structure starts galloping the vortex induced force acting on this grooved cylinder in the lock in region is more than twice as large as that of the smooth cylinder 5 2 amplitude response characteristics the lift and drag coefficients of the structure are analyzed in section 5 1 the lift and drag coefficients of the grooved cylinder structure are larger than those of the smooth cylinder when re 3000 the amplitude response of the structure under different forces is discussed in this section the variations in the amplitude and vibration velocity with re are shown in fig 8 with increasing re both a rms d and v rms initially increase reach their maximum and subsequently decrease each entire curve can be divided into three stages as follows when 16000 re 30000 the structure has not yet entered the lock in region and the amplitude and vibration velocity of the grooved cylinder are not much different from those of the smooth cylinder when 30000 re 80000 the structure begins to enter the lock in region and the displacement and vibration velocity diverge with the cases of α 30 60 and 150 and the smooth cylinder showing increasing trends when re 30000 and α 60 the displacement curve begins to diverge from that of the smooth cylinder with the vibration of the grooved cylinder becoming stronger when re 80000 the vibrations of the smooth cylinder and the grooved cylinders with α 60 and 150 begin to decrease with the amplitude and vibration velocity both decreasing at this point the system is approaching the end of the lock in region and the vibration response begins to weaken the vibration responses of the smooth cylinder and the grooved cylinder with α 150 rapidly decrease while that of the grooved cylinder with α 60 only slightly decreases on the other hand the structural vibrations become weaker at re 50000 for α 90 and 120 a subsequent rapid decrease is observed when re 80000 for α 120 while the amplitude of the structure continues to slowly decrease when α 90 for α 30 and re 50000 60000 the diagram of the amplitude over time presented in fig 9 shows that when α 30 and re 60000 the corresponding u water is 6 510 and the grooved cylinder beats as the amplitude and displacement gradually increase after divergence galloping of the structure occurs when re 100000 the displacement is a rms d 1 170 5 3 spectral characteristics fig 10 shows the variations in the vortex shedding frequency f s vibration frequency f osc and frequency ratio f osc f n water of each structure with the re of the water where the dashed line indicates the natural frequency of the structure fig 10 a shows that with increasing re the vortex shedding frequencies of the smooth cylinder and the grooved cylinders with α 30 120 and 150 gradually increase when α 60 or 90 and re 40000 the vortex shedding frequencies remain in the range of 1 1 1 2 hz in fig 11 the spectrograms of the vortex shedding frequency f s and the vibration frequency f osc are provided for the smooth cylinder and the grooved cylinders with α 30 90 these spectrograms show that for the smooth cylinder and the grooved cylinder with α 30 there are two main vortex shedding frequencies when re 40000 and the vibration frequency of the structure is identical to its second main frequency when α 60 and 90 f s is always identical to the main frequency of f osc fig 10 b shows that the f osc f n ratio of the structure gradually increases with increasing re when re 40000 the ratio is stable and fluctuates up and down near f osc f n 1 0 1 2 hence with increasing re both the smooth and grooved cylinders have vibration frequencies that are generally consistent with the natural frequency of the structure at 40000 re 100000 for a grooved cylinder when α 60 or 90 f osc corresponds to the first main frequency of f s in the remaining cases it is excited by the second main frequency thus a wider vibration band can be obtained for grooved cylinders with α 60 and 90 5 4 vortex shedding modes according to williamson and govardhan 2004 the wake modes of viv can be mainly divided into 2s 2p 2t and 2c modes singh and mittal 2005 in the 2s mode two separate vortices fall off the cylinder in each vibration period these two vortices have almost equal intensities and opposite rotation directions in the 2p mode two pairs of vortices fall off the cylinder in each period the energies of the two vortices in each pair are not equal the first vortex has a larger energy than the second one and their rotation directions are opposite subsequently other researchers have found new wake modes such as p s 2q and complex wake modes in the viv of cylinders observations show that the amplitude and frequency responses of such a structure are closely related to the vorticity wake the vorticity contours of a smooth cylinder and grooved cylinders with α 30 60 and 90 for u water 2 790 4 651 6 512 and 11 629 are shown in fig 12 as shown in fig 12 when u water 2 790 all wakes of each structure are in the typical 2s mode the wakes consist of two single vortices with identical vorticities and opposite rotation directions when u water 4 651 there is a distinct difference in the vortex shedding mode as seen in fig 12 a there is an additional small vortex near each main vortex this mode is called the quasi 2p mode the quasi 2p mode is the transition mode from 2s to 2p fig 12 a d shows that the quasi 2p mode approaches the 2p mode as α increases when u water 6 512 each trajectory consists of two vortices one of which has more energy than the other and the vortices represent a q p mode with increasing α the quasi 2p mode gradually changes w pphen u water 11 629 for the smooth cylinder the vortex shedding mode changes to the 2s mode while the vortex shedding modes for grooved cylinders with α 30 60 and 90 remain as quasi 2p and q p modes by comparing different working conditions we observe that the vortex shedding modes of the grooved structure are more complex than those of the smooth cylinder when α 30 or 60 two or more vortices are shed in one cycle thus providing the power of the structural vibration response 5 5 vortex at the location for the groove the local vortex structure of the groove when the cylinder is fixed is shown in fig 13 the variation of vortex in a period is given corresponding to u water 4 651 as shown in the figure when α 30 120 150 fig 13 b e f compared with the smooth cylinder fig 13 a the groove does not produce additional vortex and has little effect on the shedding position of the vortex in the flow when α 60 the vortex formed inside the groove can be seen obviously with the gradual formation of the wake vortex the vortex at the groove alternately released and fused with the main vortex which increases the lift drag coefficient to a certain extent that is corresponding to the lift drag coefficient in fig 8 when α 90 the existence of the groove changes the peeling point of the vortex but there is no excess vorticity storage in the groove and the form of vortex stripping is not much different from that of other cases in fig 14 the local vortex in a period is given when α 60 and u water 4 651 among them the grooved cylinder in subgraph a is at the maximum position in the direction of y and in subgraph d the grooved cylinder moves in the negative y direction from the equilibrium position subgraph g shows that the grooved cylinder is at the maximum position in the negative direction of y and the grooved cylinder at the equilibrium position moves forward to y in subgraph j subgraph l shows the end of this cycle and then returns to the maximum positive position shown in subgraph a the amplitude of the grooved cylinder subgraph a l goes through a period from positive maximum to negative maximum and then back to positive maximum it can be seen from fig 14 that when the displacement of the grooved cylinder is maximum and the vibration velocity is minimum there are two vortices in the groove when the grooved cylinder moves forward to the y axis the vortex in the groove in the motion direction will release rapidly and disappear and the vortex in the groove deviating from the motion direction will gradually release and coincide with the wake it can be clearly seen in the subgraphs c d e and f that the local vortex at the upper groove in the whole descending process releases gradually similarly when the grooved cylinder moves in the direction of y axis subgraph g l the vortex in the lower groove releases rapidly and the upper vortex gradually releases during the downward movement in the motion of the grooved cylinder the vortex in the groove is gradually released in the opposite direction of the vibration this release makes the vortex in the wake strengthened to a certain extent and then the vibration becomes more severe combined with fig 8 it can be seen that when α is 60 the vibration speed and amplitude of the grooved cylinder increase compared with the smooth cylinder the attenuation becomes slower with the increase of u water 5 6 energy harvesting characteristics the variations in the amount of converted energy p harn and the ratio of energy conversion η viv with re are shown in fig 15 as seen from these plots p harn and η viv first increase and subsequently decrease with increasing re the calculation formulas for p harn and η viv are presented in section 3 p harn is mainly related to the vibration frequency and amplitude of the structure the variations in f osc and a rms d are discussed in sections 5 2 and 5 3 respectively when re 40000 f osc is essentially identical to the natural frequency of the structure meaning that at 40 000 re 100 000 p harn is related only to a rms d therefore at 40 000 re 100000 the variational trend of p harn is identical to that of the amplitude a rms d as shown in fig 15 p harn and η viv gradually increase with increasing re when 10000 re 30000 and their values are basically identical for each structure when re 30000 p harn begins to diverge and η viv reaches its maximum as reported in section 5 2 when re 30000 the structure is just beginning to enter the lock in region and η viv reaches its maximum when 30000 re 100000 p harn continues to increase and η viv begins to decrease for the smooth cylinder and the grooved cylinders with α 60 and α 150 when re 80000 p harn reaches its maximum and begins to decline by contrast for α 90 and 120 p harn reaches its maximum at re 50000 and subsequently begins to decline when α 30 due to the galloping of the structure p harn continuously increases whereas η viv still reaches its maximum when re 30000 in general for a grooved cylinder p harn and η viv are effectively increased when α 30 or 60 indicating that the grooved structure can effectively increase η viv especially in the case of structure galloping more energy can be collected and p harn and η viv can be increased dramatically 5 7 effects of the damping ratio to study the effects of the damping ratio on the energy harvesting behavior of the grooved cylinder structure the variations in a rms d f p harn and η viv with re under ζ s 0 0161 0 0805 and 0 161 are compared by varying ζ n to adjust the ζ s value of the system as shown in fig 16 the corresponding ζ n values are 0 01 0 074 and 0 154 respectively as shown in fig 16 increasing ζ n can effectively increase p harn and η viv table 4 shows the maximum amplitude p harn and η viv of each conductor under different ζ n values the maximum amplitude decreases with the increase of damping ratio of the system while the corresponding p harn increases by up to a factor of 15 and η viv increases by up to a factor of 14 therefore increasing ζ n can effectively enhance energy harvesting and increase the ratio of energy conversion 6 conclusions in this paper smooth and grooved cylinder structures were taken as the research objects the lift and drag coefficients frequency response amplitude response and energy harvesting characteristics of each model at 1 6 103 re 1 105 1 86 u water 11 63 were analyzed then the dynamic response and energy characteristics of a grooved cylinder at different damping ratios were analyzed the main conclusions are as follows 1 the lift and drag coefficients of the grooved and smooth cylinders follow identical trends when the structure begins to enter the lock in region cd mean reaches its maximum value whereas cl rms gently decreases 2 the vibration displacements of the two types of structures initially show identical trends of variation with the reynolds number but diverge when the structure begins to enter the lock in region with the amplitude being maximal when the angle between the two grooves in the cylinder is α 60 galloping occurs at α 30 the amplitude and vibration velocity steadily increase 3 for the grooved cylinder structures with α 30 120 and 150 the vortex shedding frequency is identical to that of the smooth cylinder structure once the structure enters the lock in region the vortex shedding frequency has multiple peaks in this region the vibration frequency of both types of structures is consistent with the second main vortex shedding frequency when α 30 or 60 the vortex shedding frequency vibration frequency and natural frequency of the structure are always the same after entering the lock in region resulting in a wider vibration band 4 for a grooved cylinder with α 30 or 60 p harn and η viv can be effectively increased especially when the structure is galloping more energy can be collected and p harn and η viv can be greatly increased 5 when the grooved cylinder structure has just entered the lock in region its η viv is maximal and increasing ζ n will reduce the amplitude of the structure although it can effectively enhance energy harvesting and increase the energy conversion

21337,the energy generated by vortex induced vibrations is studied through numerical simulation and the vibration characteristics of the energy harvesting device are studied using a bidirectional coupled fluid structure simulation the energy collector consists of an elastic cylinder with symmetrical grooves which can effectively improve the energy extraction performance the studied range of reynolds numbers is 15 000 to 100 000 1 86 u water 11 63 the performance of the energy collector can be significantly affected by modifying various parameters of the grooved structure moreover changing the damping ratio ζ n will also affect the energy harvesting the results show that the grooves affect the dynamic response of the structure the structure will gallop when the angle between the grooves and the inflow direction is α 30 for a grooved cylinder with α 30 or 60 the effective power p harn of the system can be effectively increased and the grooves can also effectively increase the energy conversion rate η viv especially in the case of structure galloping more energy can be collected and p harn and η viv can be dramatically increased immediately after the structure has entered the lock in region η viv reaches its maximum varying ζ n has little effect on the amplitude of the conductor but it can effectively enhance energy harvesting and energy conversion keywords vortex induced vibration grooved cylinder energy harvesting 1 introduction fluid energy harvesting has always been a fundamental research problem specifically fluid energy harvesting refers to the continuous harvesting storage and utilization of energy contained in moving media and the most common types of such energy harvesting are associated with water and wind among conventional energy generation methods the flow induced vibration approach in particular has been widely studied in recent years ding et al 2020 ma et al 2020 wang et al 2019a wang et al 2020a hu et al 2019 wang et al 2019b zhang et al 2017 when a fluid passes around a blunt body the blunt body structure is subjected to an oscillatory fluid force which results in vibratory motion of the structure this phenomenon is called flow induced vibration in particular vortex induced vibration viv is a kind of vibration with high frequency and low amplitude that is stable and easy to excite the energy characteristics of viv are based on these two features galloping and flutter are both self excited vibrations flutter is a kind of self excited vibration of an elastic structure in a uniform air flow that is caused by the coupling of aerodynamic elastic and inertial forces eugeni et al 2019 galloping refers to a negative aerodynamic damping component caused by flow separation and vortex shedding which leads to unstable vibration of a slender structure notably the cross section that causes galloping is generally noncircular it is very difficult to maintain energy collection under galloping conditions vivs are vibrations perpendicular to the incoming flow direction when the vibration frequency of a structure is near its natural frequency the vibrations are the most violent and the lock in phenomenon occurs in other words within a certain range of fluid velocity the vibration frequency of the structure remains unchanged and identical to the natural frequency of the structure and the amplitude is maximal griffin and koopmann 1977 griffin 1985 zhu and yao 2015 toebes 1969 wang et al 2018 khalak and williamson 1999 stansby 1976 xu et al 2019 zhu et al 2020a akaydın et al 2010 because it is easy to excite such vibrations and they last for a long time the application of vivs for energy harvesting has been a focus of scholars worldwide in recent years the energy harvesting characteristics of vivs have been extensively studied allen and taylor taylor et al 2001 designed an eel device with a polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf device on its surface this device can generate vibrations by means of the whirlpool effect in a kármán vortex street resulting in optimal resonance conditions gao et al 2013 and mehmood et al 2013 designed a piezoelectric cantilever beam structure that generates electric charge through the vibration of a cylinder at the end of the cantilever beam and subsequently collects energy bernitsas et al lee and bernitsas 2011 effectively increased the vibration amplitude of the cylinder by adding a set of rough bands to the surface of the cylinder and expanded the frequency locking range of the energy collector thereby improving the viv energy harvesting characteristics hongrae park et al 2013 applied passive turbulence control ptc in the form of selectively distributed surface roughness on a rigid circular cylinder on two end springs placed perpendicular to a uniform steady flow and the cylinder response was measured experimentally in the reynolds number range of 3 104 re 1 2 105 and throughout a broad range of the main ptc parameters flow induced motion fim enhancement was studied in that paper in the soft galloping zone and two hard galloping zones identified in the ptc to fim map the use of broad field of view laser visualization revealed very different vortex structures between viv and galloping confirming the fundamentally different driving mechanisms of these two fim types ding and bernitsas ding et al 2013b studied the fim of two rigid circular cylinders on linear end springs in tandem using two dimensional unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes 2 d urans simulations verified by experimental data in the transition to shear layer 3 trsl3 regime in which the shear layers are fully saturated and consequently the lift is high the vortex structures in viv the transition from viv to galloping and galloping were also studied later ding et al 2016 conducted further research on this structure analyzed the effect of rough bands on the vortex shedding mode and explored the vibration and energy harvesting characteristics of the energy collector under the interaction of the two cylinders the results show that the proposed device is suitable for the harvesting and utilization of ocean energy at high reynolds numbers wang et al 2019b studied the performance of the device under a low reynolds number wind current the results show that the structure also has a good effect for energy harvesting at low reynolds numbers and when the performance of energy collectors with different cylinders is compared the results show that a triangular column can effectively increase the size of the lock in region for viv ding et al 2018 simulated the flow field and energy collection process for three cylinders with rough strips in tandem and the simulation results were in good agreement with the experimental results a maximum power of 85 26 w was obtained from the interference of the eddy currents between the cylinders in summary to enhance the flow induced vibration and obtain more energy ding et al added rough bands to the cylinder section and carried out a series of corresponding studies inspired by this it is expected that the flow induced vibration of a cylinder can also be significantly enhanced by adding grooves to the cylinder section based on the above analysis a new type of grooved cylinder is proposed in this paper by varying the groove locations the vibrational characteristics and energy harvesting characteristics of the structure are explored 2 physical model based on the energy harvesting characteristics of vivs inspired by ding et al s work ding et al 2013b a new blunt body structure is proposed here and is compared with a smooth cylinder model as shown in fig 1 relative to the smooth cylinder the proposed structure has two grooves each of which is 16 wide and 2 mm deep and the angle between them is 2α in this paper the viv model is simplified to a single degree of freedom mass spring damper system which is mainly composed of the following parts a cylinder with mass m s and diameter d a supporting spring with elastic coefficient k s and a damper with total damping coefficient c s in this system the cylinder vibrates along the y direction which is perpendicular to the incoming flow direction in this paper the vibration characteristics of grooved cylinders of the general design shown in fig 1 b with grooves at different positions are studied by varying the value of α α 30 60 90 120 and 150 the main parameters of the system are shown in table 1 3 numerical simulations 3 1 control equation the motion of a viscous fluid follows the laws of conservation of mass and conservation of momentum the corresponding mathematical descriptions are as follows abdelkefi et al 2012 zhu et al 2020 wang et al 2018 2020 1 continuity equation according to the law of conservation of mass the increment of mass per unit time should be equal to the net mass that flows out of the control body in the same time interval the corresponding differential form is as follows 1 ρ t ρ u x ρ v y ρ w z 0 where u v and w are the velocity vectors in the x y and z directions respectively ρ is the density of the fluid and t is time 2 conservation of momentum for a given microelement body the rate of change in momentum with time should be equal to the sum of the forces acting on the microelement body the momentum equations are essentially equivalent to newton s second law and are expressed as follows 2 ρ u t d i v ρ u u p x τ x x x τ y x y τ z x z ρ f x ρ v t d i v ρ v u p y τ x y x τ y y y τ z y z ρ f y ρ w t d i v ρ w u p z τ x z x τ y z y τ z z z ρ f z where p is the pressure acting on the microelement body τ xx τ yx and τ zx are the components of the viscous stress τ and f x f y and f z are the unit mass forces in all directions 3 2 solution method the grooved cylinder spring oscillator system can be simplified as a mass spring damper system khalak and williamson 1999 the equation of motion is as follows 3 m s y c s y k s y f y t where m s is the mass of the grooved cylinder c s is the system damping k s is the elastic coefficient of the system and f y is the fluid force acting on the cylindrical blunt body in the y direction c s can be decomposed as follows 4 c s c s t r u c h a r n where c stru is the mechanical damping of the system and c harn is the damping caused by the internal resistance of the generator when the mechanical energy is converted into electrical energy the two formulas are as follows lee and bernitsas 2011 ding et al 2016 abdelkefi et al 2012 5 ζ s c s 2 m s k s ζ h a r n c h a r n 2 m s k s the dynamic response of the system can be obtained by solving equation 3 with the given parameters 3 3 mathematical model for power calculation the dynamic response of the system is obtained using equation 3 the power of the system in one period is calculated as follows 6 p v i v 1 t o s c 0 t o s c f y y d t by incorporating formula 4 equation 6 can be rewritten as 7 p v i v 1 t o s c 0 t o s c m s y c s y k s y y d t formula 7 is the total power equation of the system to conveniently solve for the power parameters it is assumed that the displacement of the system always exhibits sinusoidal characteristics when the system is undergoing vortex excitation or galloping then the displacement is expressed as 8 y t a sin 2 π f o s c t the vibration velocity in the y direction is 9 y t 2 a π f o s c cos 2 π f o s c t where f osc is the natural frequency of the structure given formula 8 the only nonzero term on the right hand side of formula 7 is the velocity term then we have 10 p v i v 1 t o s c 0 t o s c c s y 2 d t an expression for the system power can be obtained by substituting formula 9 into formula 10 as follows 11 p v i v 8 π 3 m s ζ s f n w a t e r a 2 f o s c 2 where f n water is the natural frequency of the structure in water and is calculated as 12 f n w a t e r 1 2 π k s m s according to the definition of the total damping coefficient in formula 4 the effective power of the system is calculated as 13 p h a r n c h a r n c s p v i v the ratio of the effective power of the system to the flow power in the fluid is 14 η v i v p h a r n p f l u i d where the flow power of the fluid is calculated using the following formula 15 p f l u i d f x u 1 2 ρ u 3 d l here f x is the fluid force acting in the x direction of the structure which can be obtained from the bernoulli equation 16 f x 1 2 ρ u 2 d l it should be noted that other expressions can also be used for the reference power in the fluid such as the power of the total area integrated over the cylinder i e 0 5ρu 3 2a d l notably this latter calculation will lead to a fairly low efficiency there are supporting arguments for using both expressions 3 4 study case settings a user defined function udf was compiled and embedded in fluent to implement the translational motion of the system in this study define cg motion was used as the motion function to define the motion mode of the cylinder the main objective in this paper is to study the vibrational characteristics and energy harvesting characteristics of cylinders with grooves at different locations reynolds numbers in the range of 1 6 103 re 105 are considered and the corresponding equivalent water velocities are in the range 1 86 u water 11 63 the equivalent water velocity is defined as follows 17 u w a t e r u f n w a t e r d where u is the water velocity d is the diameter of the cylinder and f n water is the natural frequency of the system in water the specific study cases are summarized in table 2 4 meshing and model verification in this paper a smooth cylinder and grooved cylinders are analyzed based on simulations using an overlapping mesh for the overset grid method which is also known as the overlapping grid or nested grid method nc anone 2011 there is no need to define an update method instead the user is required to use two or more sets of grids see fig 2 one is the background grid and the others are the foreground grids including the grid of the moving parts and their boundary conditions boundary conditions must be set for the generation of the foreground meshes which can then be assembled and used in ansys fluent by reading the size of the grid around the overset boundary in the foreground mesh beforehand and detecting the size of the background mesh in real time during the movement of the foreground mesh the background mesh and a mesh of a similar size around the foreground mesh boundary can be fused thereby combining the foreground and background meshes into a coupled set of meshes an overset mesh does not have a negative volume and does not cause mesh distortion it is suitable for simulating motions and deformations of various magnitudes in particular for various moving parts this method can overcome the difficulties faced by other methods in early processing and simplify the simulation process in addition it can ensure that the accuracy requirements around the model boundary are met and effectively solve the problem of low accuracy in the simulation of moving parts 4 1 settings for the computational domain and boundary conditions in theory as the computational domain increases in size the fluid characteristics can be more accurately reproduced however when the computational domain is too large considerable resources are wasted therefore it is vital to reasonably establish the computational domain to reduce the waste of computational resources and improve the computational efficiency to ensure the accuracy of the calculation many scholars have examined suitable settings for the computational domain for a flow around a cylinder in this paper the computational domain is defined based on the results of previous studies combined with simulation experience as shown in fig 3 in this study a rectangular computational domain with dimensions of 35d 20d is adopted the distances from the center of the structure to the entrance boundary of the calculation domain the downstream exit boundary and the upper and lower boundaries are 10d 25d and 10d respectively to ensure the calculation accuracy an encrypted area with a diameter of 5d is set up around the cylinder the boundary conditions are set as follows the velocity inlet condition is used at the inlet the pressure outlet condition is used at the outlet the upper and lower walls are free slip walls and the wall of the conductor is a no slip wall the solution model used is the shear stress transport sst k ω turbulence model which can accurately capture the flow characteristics in the main fluid region through the k ε solution and the viscous bottom flow in the region near the wall through the k ω solution this model offers high accuracy for the viv problem moreover considering the precision requirement for the encrypted area in subsequent transverse vibration when using the overset overlapping grid the enlargement of the encrypted area can reduce the error caused by the data exchange among different grid layers hence the encrypted area is set accordingly 4 2 meshing and independence verification different encryption accuracies are used for different reynolds numbers re the size of the boundary grid of the first layer is controlled by the height y for a mostly smooth cylinder y is 1 wieselsberger 1922 kondo 1993 for a grooved cylinder y is in the range of 30 70 the first layer grid height is calculated as follows 18 y 0 172 δ y l r e 0 9 where re is the reynolds number u is the flow velocity and d is the diameter of the structure three encrypted grids of different densities are shown in fig 4 these three grids are investigated for accuracy and computational efficiency the parameters of the verification case are α 60 u 0 465 m s ζ s 0 0161 and k s 474 923 n m the encryption sizes of the three grids of different densities and the calculated cd mean cl rms st and a rms d values are shown in table 3 table 3 shows that when the minimum grid size is 0 005d or 0 0025d there is little difference in the calculated values therefore to balance computational efficiency and accuracy the second grid density is selected for meshing 4 3 model verification to verify the accuracy of the model the aerodynamic parameters of a smooth cylinder with re values of 103 105 under fixed conditions are compared comparisons of the mean drag coefficient cd mean and the strouhal number st are shown in fig 5 as observed in the figure the cd mean values calculated in this paper are slightly larger than the experimental values of wieselsberger wieselsberger 1922 kondo 1993 r f rodi and schnung 1990 because the two dimensional structure simulation analysis in this paper does not consider the three dimensional effects of the structure while the st results are consistent meanwhile in the study of vortex induced vibration energy harvesting the amplitude ratio a d is a key parameter in order to further verify our model we compare the amplitude ratios under different reynolds numbers that is different reduction velocities in water with the previous work gu et al 2020 khalak and williamson 1996 bernitsas 2016 the results are shown in fig 6 generally the simulation method adopted in this paper is reliable and can satisfy the relevant accuracy requirements 5 result analysis in this part a symmetrically grooved cylinder like elastic structure is studied through numerical simulation by varying the locations of the grooves the vibration characteristics frequency characteristics vortex shedding characteristics and energy harvesting characteristics are studied using bidirectional fluid solid coupling finally the energy harvesting characteristics under different system damping ratios are analyzed for the case in which the angle between the two grooves is α 60 5 1 lift and drag coefficients the variations in the mean square value of the lift coefficient cl rms and the mean value of the drag coefficient cd mean with re are shown in fig 7 as observed in this figure when the grooves are in different positions cd mean shows the same variational trend as it does for the smooth cylinder it first increases and subsequently decreases with increasing re when re 30000 the structure begins to enter the lock in region cd mean first reaches its maximum value and subsequently rapidly decreases with increasing velocity in contrast cl rms first slightly increases and subsequently rapidly decreases and when re 30000 its rate of decline rapidly decreases for reynolds numbers in the range of 16000 re 30000 the cl rms and cd mean values of the grooved structure are identical to those of the smooth cylinder however when 30000 re 100000 the cl rms and cd mean values of the grooved structure are larger than those of the smooth cylinder the fluid medium in this simulation is water according to equation 3 the vibration of the device is mainly caused by vortex shedding the lift and drag coefficients of cylinders with grooves at various positions are greater than those of the smooth cylinder at 30000 re 100000 thus the corresponding amplitude responses and energy characteristics will inevitably be improved as discussed below the cl rms and cd mean values of the structure with an angle of α 30 between the two grooves are much larger than those in other cases when the grooves are in this relative position the structure starts galloping the vortex induced force acting on this grooved cylinder in the lock in region is more than twice as large as that of the smooth cylinder 5 2 amplitude response characteristics the lift and drag coefficients of the structure are analyzed in section 5 1 the lift and drag coefficients of the grooved cylinder structure are larger than those of the smooth cylinder when re 3000 the amplitude response of the structure under different forces is discussed in this section the variations in the amplitude and vibration velocity with re are shown in fig 8 with increasing re both a rms d and v rms initially increase reach their maximum and subsequently decrease each entire curve can be divided into three stages as follows when 16000 re 30000 the structure has not yet entered the lock in region and the amplitude and vibration velocity of the grooved cylinder are not much different from those of the smooth cylinder when 30000 re 80000 the structure begins to enter the lock in region and the displacement and vibration velocity diverge with the cases of α 30 60 and 150 and the smooth cylinder showing increasing trends when re 30000 and α 60 the displacement curve begins to diverge from that of the smooth cylinder with the vibration of the grooved cylinder becoming stronger when re 80000 the vibrations of the smooth cylinder and the grooved cylinders with α 60 and 150 begin to decrease with the amplitude and vibration velocity both decreasing at this point the system is approaching the end of the lock in region and the vibration response begins to weaken the vibration responses of the smooth cylinder and the grooved cylinder with α 150 rapidly decrease while that of the grooved cylinder with α 60 only slightly decreases on the other hand the structural vibrations become weaker at re 50000 for α 90 and 120 a subsequent rapid decrease is observed when re 80000 for α 120 while the amplitude of the structure continues to slowly decrease when α 90 for α 30 and re 50000 60000 the diagram of the amplitude over time presented in fig 9 shows that when α 30 and re 60000 the corresponding u water is 6 510 and the grooved cylinder beats as the amplitude and displacement gradually increase after divergence galloping of the structure occurs when re 100000 the displacement is a rms d 1 170 5 3 spectral characteristics fig 10 shows the variations in the vortex shedding frequency f s vibration frequency f osc and frequency ratio f osc f n water of each structure with the re of the water where the dashed line indicates the natural frequency of the structure fig 10 a shows that with increasing re the vortex shedding frequencies of the smooth cylinder and the grooved cylinders with α 30 120 and 150 gradually increase when α 60 or 90 and re 40000 the vortex shedding frequencies remain in the range of 1 1 1 2 hz in fig 11 the spectrograms of the vortex shedding frequency f s and the vibration frequency f osc are provided for the smooth cylinder and the grooved cylinders with α 30 90 these spectrograms show that for the smooth cylinder and the grooved cylinder with α 30 there are two main vortex shedding frequencies when re 40000 and the vibration frequency of the structure is identical to its second main frequency when α 60 and 90 f s is always identical to the main frequency of f osc fig 10 b shows that the f osc f n ratio of the structure gradually increases with increasing re when re 40000 the ratio is stable and fluctuates up and down near f osc f n 1 0 1 2 hence with increasing re both the smooth and grooved cylinders have vibration frequencies that are generally consistent with the natural frequency of the structure at 40000 re 100000 for a grooved cylinder when α 60 or 90 f osc corresponds to the first main frequency of f s in the remaining cases it is excited by the second main frequency thus a wider vibration band can be obtained for grooved cylinders with α 60 and 90 5 4 vortex shedding modes according to williamson and govardhan 2004 the wake modes of viv can be mainly divided into 2s 2p 2t and 2c modes singh and mittal 2005 in the 2s mode two separate vortices fall off the cylinder in each vibration period these two vortices have almost equal intensities and opposite rotation directions in the 2p mode two pairs of vortices fall off the cylinder in each period the energies of the two vortices in each pair are not equal the first vortex has a larger energy than the second one and their rotation directions are opposite subsequently other researchers have found new wake modes such as p s 2q and complex wake modes in the viv of cylinders observations show that the amplitude and frequency responses of such a structure are closely related to the vorticity wake the vorticity contours of a smooth cylinder and grooved cylinders with α 30 60 and 90 for u water 2 790 4 651 6 512 and 11 629 are shown in fig 12 as shown in fig 12 when u water 2 790 all wakes of each structure are in the typical 2s mode the wakes consist of two single vortices with identical vorticities and opposite rotation directions when u water 4 651 there is a distinct difference in the vortex shedding mode as seen in fig 12 a there is an additional small vortex near each main vortex this mode is called the quasi 2p mode the quasi 2p mode is the transition mode from 2s to 2p fig 12 a d shows that the quasi 2p mode approaches the 2p mode as α increases when u water 6 512 each trajectory consists of two vortices one of which has more energy than the other and the vortices represent a q p mode with increasing α the quasi 2p mode gradually changes w pphen u water 11 629 for the smooth cylinder the vortex shedding mode changes to the 2s mode while the vortex shedding modes for grooved cylinders with α 30 60 and 90 remain as quasi 2p and q p modes by comparing different working conditions we observe that the vortex shedding modes of the grooved structure are more complex than those of the smooth cylinder when α 30 or 60 two or more vortices are shed in one cycle thus providing the power of the structural vibration response 5 5 vortex at the location for the groove the local vortex structure of the groove when the cylinder is fixed is shown in fig 13 the variation of vortex in a period is given corresponding to u water 4 651 as shown in the figure when α 30 120 150 fig 13 b e f compared with the smooth cylinder fig 13 a the groove does not produce additional vortex and has little effect on the shedding position of the vortex in the flow when α 60 the vortex formed inside the groove can be seen obviously with the gradual formation of the wake vortex the vortex at the groove alternately released and fused with the main vortex which increases the lift drag coefficient to a certain extent that is corresponding to the lift drag coefficient in fig 8 when α 90 the existence of the groove changes the peeling point of the vortex but there is no excess vorticity storage in the groove and the form of vortex stripping is not much different from that of other cases in fig 14 the local vortex in a period is given when α 60 and u water 4 651 among them the grooved cylinder in subgraph a is at the maximum position in the direction of y and in subgraph d the grooved cylinder moves in the negative y direction from the equilibrium position subgraph g shows that the grooved cylinder is at the maximum position in the negative direction of y and the grooved cylinder at the equilibrium position moves forward to y in subgraph j subgraph l shows the end of this cycle and then returns to the maximum positive position shown in subgraph a the amplitude of the grooved cylinder subgraph a l goes through a period from positive maximum to negative maximum and then back to positive maximum it can be seen from fig 14 that when the displacement of the grooved cylinder is maximum and the vibration velocity is minimum there are two vortices in the groove when the grooved cylinder moves forward to the y axis the vortex in the groove in the motion direction will release rapidly and disappear and the vortex in the groove deviating from the motion direction will gradually release and coincide with the wake it can be clearly seen in the subgraphs c d e and f that the local vortex at the upper groove in the whole descending process releases gradually similarly when the grooved cylinder moves in the direction of y axis subgraph g l the vortex in the lower groove releases rapidly and the upper vortex gradually releases during the downward movement in the motion of the grooved cylinder the vortex in the groove is gradually released in the opposite direction of the vibration this release makes the vortex in the wake strengthened to a certain extent and then the vibration becomes more severe combined with fig 8 it can be seen that when α is 60 the vibration speed and amplitude of the grooved cylinder increase compared with the smooth cylinder the attenuation becomes slower with the increase of u water 5 6 energy harvesting characteristics the variations in the amount of converted energy p harn and the ratio of energy conversion η viv with re are shown in fig 15 as seen from these plots p harn and η viv first increase and subsequently decrease with increasing re the calculation formulas for p harn and η viv are presented in section 3 p harn is mainly related to the vibration frequency and amplitude of the structure the variations in f osc and a rms d are discussed in sections 5 2 and 5 3 respectively when re 40000 f osc is essentially identical to the natural frequency of the structure meaning that at 40 000 re 100 000 p harn is related only to a rms d therefore at 40 000 re 100000 the variational trend of p harn is identical to that of the amplitude a rms d as shown in fig 15 p harn and η viv gradually increase with increasing re when 10000 re 30000 and their values are basically identical for each structure when re 30000 p harn begins to diverge and η viv reaches its maximum as reported in section 5 2 when re 30000 the structure is just beginning to enter the lock in region and η viv reaches its maximum when 30000 re 100000 p harn continues to increase and η viv begins to decrease for the smooth cylinder and the grooved cylinders with α 60 and α 150 when re 80000 p harn reaches its maximum and begins to decline by contrast for α 90 and 120 p harn reaches its maximum at re 50000 and subsequently begins to decline when α 30 due to the galloping of the structure p harn continuously increases whereas η viv still reaches its maximum when re 30000 in general for a grooved cylinder p harn and η viv are effectively increased when α 30 or 60 indicating that the grooved structure can effectively increase η viv especially in the case of structure galloping more energy can be collected and p harn and η viv can be increased dramatically 5 7 effects of the damping ratio to study the effects of the damping ratio on the energy harvesting behavior of the grooved cylinder structure the variations in a rms d f p harn and η viv with re under ζ s 0 0161 0 0805 and 0 161 are compared by varying ζ n to adjust the ζ s value of the system as shown in fig 16 the corresponding ζ n values are 0 01 0 074 and 0 154 respectively as shown in fig 16 increasing ζ n can effectively increase p harn and η viv table 4 shows the maximum amplitude p harn and η viv of each conductor under different ζ n values the maximum amplitude decreases with the increase of damping ratio of the system while the corresponding p harn increases by up to a factor of 15 and η viv increases by up to a factor of 14 therefore increasing ζ n can effectively enhance energy harvesting and increase the ratio of energy conversion 6 conclusions in this paper smooth and grooved cylinder structures were taken as the research objects the lift and drag coefficients frequency response amplitude response and energy harvesting characteristics of each model at 1 6 103 re 1 105 1 86 u water 11 63 were analyzed then the dynamic response and energy characteristics of a grooved cylinder at different damping ratios were analyzed the main conclusions are as follows 1 the lift and drag coefficients of the grooved and smooth cylinders follow identical trends when the structure begins to enter the lock in region cd mean reaches its maximum value whereas cl rms gently decreases 2 the vibration displacements of the two types of structures initially show identical trends of variation with the reynolds number but diverge when the structure begins to enter the lock in region with the amplitude being maximal when the angle between the two grooves in the cylinder is α 60 galloping occurs at α 30 the amplitude and vibration velocity steadily increase 3 for the grooved cylinder structures with α 30 120 and 150 the vortex shedding frequency is identical to that of the smooth cylinder structure once the structure enters the lock in region the vortex shedding frequency has multiple peaks in this region the vibration frequency of both types of structures is consistent with the second main vortex shedding frequency when α 30 or 60 the vortex shedding frequency vibration frequency and natural frequency of the structure are always the same after entering the lock in region resulting in a wider vibration band 4 for a grooved cylinder with α 30 or 60 p harn and η viv can be effectively increased especially when the structure is galloping more energy can be collected and p harn and η viv can be greatly increased 5 when the grooved cylinder structure has just entered the lock in region its η viv is maximal and increasing ζ n will reduce the amplitude of the structure although it can effectively enhance energy harvesting and increase the energy conversion

21338,subsea pipelines with a free suspended span segment may be subject to upheaval buckling under high temperature which may lead to a failure mode such as local buckling fracture and fatigue mathematical models are established to study the upheaval buckling behaviour of subsea pipelines with a free span segment then the accurate locations of the maxima of displacement and stress are obtained the buckled configuration and the typical post buckling behaviour and their dependence on free span length are analysed furthermore a detailed analysis is presented for critical temperature difference displacement amplitude and maximum axial compressive stress finally the influence of touchdown on post buckling behaviour during the process of upheaval buckling is discussed the results show that the pipeline is prone to upheaval buckling when the free span length is large enough and the critical temperature difference decreases with increasing free span length the displacement amplitude and the maximum stress within the span increase with the increase of the free span length before touchdown however after the pipeline touches the bottom of the free span the maximum stress within the span decreases significantly compared to the case without touchdown which becomes further smaller for smaller depth of the free span keywords subsea pipelines upheaval buckling free span touchdown 1 introduction in order to meet the demand for energy the exploiting of offshore oil and gas has developed rapidly during the past few decades in recent years more and more high pressure and high temperature oil and gas fields have been developed by using subsea pipelines to transport oil and gas products so the subsea pipelines are subjected to high pressure and high temperature in operating conditions which has a tendency to expand longitudinally due to the rise in temperature and in internal pressure wang et al 2017c however the subsea pipelines are restrained by the seabed friction and the pipe end devices resulting in the accumulation of effective axial compressive force in the pipe wall for a pipeline laid on an uneven seabed such as a seabed with a free span upheaval buckling will be triggered when the axial compressive force induced by thermal expansion and pressure increase is larger than the critical axial compressive force upheaval buckling is considered as a structural response to a high axial compressive force and not a failure mode as such dnvgl rp f110 2018 however upheaval buckling may induce pipeline failures due to an excessive strain at the apex of the buckles local buckling fatigue or excessive displacement so it is necessary to investigate the upheaval buckling behaviour of subsea pipelines with a free span segment to date considerable effort has been made to improve the understanding of thermal buckling behaviour of subsea pipelines analytically an analytical method taking the thermal effect into the theoretical model proposed by kerr was applied to buckling of railroad tracks kerr 1978 and blowup of concrete pavement kerr and shade 1984 which was also employed in the buckling of subsea pipelines based on this method both lateral and upheaval buckling of subsea pipelines were investigated analytically by hobbs 1984 without the consideration of initial imperfections some formulas for critical axial force buckling displacement amplitude and bending moment were derived based on the assumption of the presumed buckling modes then initial imperfections were incorporated into the analytical models by taylor and co workers taylor and gan 1986 taylor and tran 1993 for lateral and upheaval buckling of subsea pipelines for pipelines subjected to time varying temperature loadings upheaval creep behaviour due to initial imperfections was investigated by pedersen and jensen 1988 they found that the imperfection amplitude can magnify for pipelines subjected to time varying temperature loadings namely upheaval creep so that upheaval buckling may take place at a temperature lower than the design temperature the asymmetric effects of prop imperfections on the upheaval buckling of pipelines were studied by ballet and hobbs 1992 and they found that an asymmetric mode of buckling may occur for pipelines with prop imperfections furthermore a simplified analytical model was proposed for upheaval thermal buckling of pipelines with initially imperfect geometry by croll 1997 simple and closed form solutions suitable to design were derived for both initial lift off and the maximum upheaval buckling loads through this analytical model more recently for a pipeline laid on a plastic soft seabed the influence of seabed resistance on upheaval buckling was investigated analytically by shi et al 2013 they found that upheaval buckling phenomenon was affected significantly by soil resistance of soft seabed the downward buckling mode rather than upheaval buckling mode may occur for very soft soil the interaction between upheaval or lateral buckling karampour et al 2013a and propagation buckling karampour 2018 karampour et al 2013b for a pipeline with a single imperfection was investigated by karampour and co workers the analytical solution of higher order lateral buckling was derived by hong et al 2015 for submarine pipelines with a single arch symmetric initial imperfection through the energy method they found that the buckling mode may transform from lower mode into higher mode with increasing temperature difference taking nonlinear pipe soil interaction into account upheaval buckling of imperfect buried pipelines was investigated by wang et al 2017a through perturbation method the mathematical model was established with the incorporation of the interaction between adjacent buckles by wang et al 2017e to investigate the controlled lateral buckling behaviour they found that the feed in length had great influence on the post buckling behaviour as for the initiation of lateral buckling analytical solutions were derived based on the assumption of classical mode one wang et al 2017d 2018b and mode three wang et al 2018a c when the sleeper or the buoyancy section were incorporated into the model to trigger lateral buckles both the critical temperature difference and the maximum stress of the laterally buckled pipeline were found to reduce when a buoyancy section or a sleeper were employed even though the displacement amplitude increased furthermore localised lateral buckling of subsea pipelines with nonlinear foundation was investigated by zeng and duan 2014 and wang and van der heijden 2017 in their study wang and van der heijden 2017 found that both the critical temperature difference and the maximum stress increased with increasing breakout resistance localised upheaval buckling was investigated for buried pipelines with the consideration of vertical nonlinear foundation force by wang et al 2018d the more recent studies employ the finite element method to investigate thermal buckling for pipelines with initial imperfections based on the finite element method four types of numerical simulation models were proposed by liu et al 2014 to simulate pipeline lateral buckling under temperature difference in which a new method was proposed to incorporate the initial imperfection into the finite element model taking the initial geometric imperfection and the nonlinear soil resistance model into account liu et al 2015 also studied upheaval buckling for buried subsea pipelines finite element models were employed to simulate upheaval buckling behaviour of pipe in pipe systems by wang et al 2015 and lateral buckling behaviour for pipelines with sleeper wang et al 2017b xu and lin 2017 considered the influence of seabed undulation and initial stress in the pipe on the critical load of upheaval buckling by the vector form intrinsic finite element method a unified formula for the critical compressive force of upheaval and lateral buckling was proposed by zhang et al zhang and duan 2015 zhang et al 2018a b based on different initial imperfection shapes of subsea pipelines liu and li 2018 proposed a method to determine the model length of pipelines in the process of pipeline buckling based on the characteristics of short pipes and long pipes they found that the displacement amplitude increased with increasing model length of pipeline for a short pipe when the model length of the pipeline was larger than the critical length the displacement amplitude would keep constant with further increasing model length liang et al 2019 investigated the thermal upheaval bucklilng of submarine pipelines laid on submarine pits and trenches through the finite element method upheaval buckling of subsea pipelines laid on the seabed with topographic step imperfection under high temperature was investigated through theoretical and finite element method chen et al 2020 wang and van der heijden 2020 for sufficiently small step heights the pipeline may suffer a snap back instability under decreasing thermal loading raising the possibility of hysteretic snap behaviour under cyclic thermal loading based on the experience gained during the projects the interaction of free span and lateral buckling problems was studied by galgoul et al 2004 through finite element method the vertical deflection will grow due to the self weight of subsea pipelines and the axial force resulting from the temperature difference the buckled pipeline may touch the ground before the pipeline turn to the lateral buckling mode however in this study only the upheaval buckling process before the upheaval buckling mode turns into lateral buckling mode is investigated buckling response of subsea pipelines with free span lengths under axial loads was investigated by seyfipour and bahaari 2018 based on these studies with the consideration of the temperature difference and touchdown effect between the pipeline and the ground within the span upheaval buckling behaviour for subsea pipelines with free span segment will be carried out in this study the objective of the present paper is to propose an analytical model to investigate analytically the influence of free span on pipeline upheaval buckling behaviour first analytical solutions of upheaval buckling are derived for subsea pipelines with a free span segment under axial force induced by high temperature and high internal pressure then the accurate locations of two buckling displacement amplitudes and three extrema of the stress along the buckled pipeline are determined after that the buckled configuration and the typical post buckling behaviour and their dependence on free span length are presented and analysed in addition a more detailed parametric analysis about the influence of free span length is presented finally the effect of the touchdown of the pipeline to the bottom of the free span on the upheaval buckling behaviour is discussed 2 analytical solution under high temperature and high pressure subsea pipelines tend to expand longitudinally to relieve the axial strain the axial force induced by the axial strain will build up along the length of the pipeline due to the constraint of the axial soil resistance between the pipeline and the seabed when the axial compressive force is larger than the critical value upheaval buckling will occur for a pipeline with a free span segment during upheaval buckling a small segment of pipe will mobilise vertically see fig 1 within the buckled region the axial compressive force drops since additional pipe feeds into the buckle to form vertical deflection for the pipe segment within the buckled region there is no contact between the pipeline and the seabed except the location of the edge of the free span x l 2 l 1 so the axial compressive force keeps constant for the pipe segment within the buckled region except that a jump of axial compressive force exists at x l 2 l 1 see fig 1 induced by the vertical contact force see fig 2 beyond the buckled region the axial compressive force increases linearly with the distance from the nearest touchdown points x 0 and 2 l 2 with assuming that the axial soil resistance is constant say f a the segment 0 x 2 l 2 is called the buckled region at some points x l 2 l s the axial thermal expansion of the pipeline is sufficient to satisfy the requirement of additional length introduced by the vertical deflection at these points the axial displacement is therefore zero they are called virtual anchor points and bound what is called the feed in region fig 1 shows this feed in region of length 2 l s together with the typical axial compressive force distribution p 0 is the axial compressive force where no axial thermal expansion occurs fig 2 illustrates the load distribution of upheaval buckling for pipelines with a free span segment a symmetric free span with a span length of 2 l 1 and a depth of h is introduced artificially in the middle of the pipeline as shown in fig 2 linear beam column theory valid for small deflections is used to formulate the upheaval buckling of the pipeline with a free span segment a perfectly straight pipeline is considered in stress free conditions when the pipeline is installed on the seabed at ambient temperature let the temperature of the pipeline be raised by an amount t 0 composed of the increase of temperature difference and the equivalent temperature difference generated by internal pressure if the pipe were free to expand it would do so with a longitudinal strain α t 0 where α is the coefficient of thermal expansion of the material however the expansion is opposed by the axial soil resistance between the pipe and the seabed so an axial compressive force p 0 e a α t 0 builds up along the length of the pipeline assuming the pipeline remains straight here a is the cross sectional area of the pipeline e is the elastic modulus the axial compressive force distribution p x as shown in fig 1 during the buckling stage is expressed as 1 p x p l 2 x l 2 l 1 p f a t 1 l 2 l 1 x 2 l 2 p f a t 1 f a t 2 f a x 2 l 2 2 l 2 x l 2 l s where f a t 1 μ a f t 1 and f a t 2 μ a f t 2 are the concentrated axial friction force induced by the vertical concentrated contact forces f t 1 and f t 2 at x l 2 l 1 and x 0 or 2 l 2 respectively μ a is the axial friction coefficient between pipeline and seabed l s is the feed in length therefore the axial compressive force at the virtual anchor point x l 2 l s is 2 p 0 p f a t 1 f a t 2 f a l s l 2 the equations governing the pipeline with a free span segment are 3 e i d 4 w 1 d x 4 p f a t 1 d 2 w 1 d x 2 q 0 x l 3 e i d 4 w 2 d x 4 p d 2 w 2 d x 2 q l 3 x l 2 where i is the moment of inertia q is the submerged weight per unit length of the pipeline w 1 and w 2 are the vertical deflection the seabed is assumed as rigid in this study which is acceptable for upheaval buckling of unburied subsea pipelines wang et al 2018d now let 4 λ 2 p e i and μ 2 p f a t 1 e i the general solutions of eq 3 can then be written as 5 w 1 x b 1 cos μ x b 2 sin μ x b 3 x b 4 q 2 λ 2 e i x 2 0 x l 3 w 2 x b 5 cos λ x b 6 sin λ x b 7 x b 8 q 2 λ 2 e i x 2 l 3 x l 2 the displacement slope and moment at x 0 are zero in addition the slope of the deflection and the shear force at x l 2 is zero due to symmetry when there is no contact between the pipeline and the bottom of the free span so the boundary conditions at x 0 and x l 2 are 6 w 1 0 0 d w 1 d x 0 0 d 2 w 1 d x 2 0 0 d w 2 d x l 2 0 d 3 w 2 d x 3 l 2 0 the displacement slope and bending moment must be continuous at the edge of the free span however the shear force has a jump at the touchdown point x l 3 due to the concentrated contact force between the pipeline and the seabed at the edge of the free span the vertical deflection at the edge of the span is zero thus the following matching conditions have to be satisfied 7 w 1 l 3 w 2 l 3 d w 1 d x l 3 d w 2 d x l 3 d 2 w 1 d x 2 l 3 d 2 w 2 d x 2 l 3 d 3 w 1 d x 3 l 3 d 3 w 2 d x 3 l 3 f t 1 e i w 1 l 3 0 then the contact force between the pipeline and the seabed at the end of the buckled pipeline can be solved by 8 f t 2 e i d 3 w 1 d x 3 0 when upheaval buckling occurs the pipeline will deflect vertically so more pipe length needs to be feed in the buckled region which comes from the axial thermal expansion within the feed in region thus the axial thermal expansion denoted as u 1 should be equal to the additional length introduced by the vertical deflection denoted as u 2 so the compatibility between the axial and vertical deformation used to derive the relationship between the axial compressive force p and the temperature difference t 0 can be expressed as 9 u 1 u 2 for u 1 we have 10 u 1 l 2 l s l 2 δ p x e a d x where δ p x p 0 p x is the amount of reduction of axial compressive force meanwhile for u 2 we have 11 u 2 1 2 0 l 3 d w 1 d x 2 d x 1 2 l 3 l 2 d w 2 d x 2 d x the bending moment m along the buckled pipeline is 12 m e i d 2 w d x 2 where w stands for either w 1 or w 2 thus the corresponding bending stress σ m along the buckled pipeline is 13 σ m m d 2 i where d is the external diameter of the pipe the maximum axial compressive stress σ m along the pipeline can be obtained from the following expression 14 σ m σ p σ m m where the stresses σ p and σ m m induced by axial compressive force p x and maximum bending moment m m respectively can be obtained by 15 σ p p x a σ m m m m d 2 i 3 analytical results 3 1 the values of f t 1 and λ l 2 the solution for the pipeline deflection w 1 w 2 can be presented in semi explicit form by using eq 6 and eq 7 to express the coefficients b i in terms of f t 1 λ and l 2 and all the parameters of the problem see eq 16 for the values of f t 1 and λ l 2 we then still need to solve two transcendental equations firstly the relationship between λ and l 2 can be obtained by solving the transcendental equations as shown in fig 3 a then through eq 9 the relationship between λ l 2 and t 0 can be obtained for pipelines suspended in a free span the values of f t 1 and λ l 2 change with the total temperature difference t 0 and half free span length l 1 as shown in fig 3 b and fig 4 a the values of f t 2 can also be calculated by eq 8 as shown in fig 4 b from fig 4 with increasing temperature difference the value of f t 1 q l 2 decreases while the value of f t 2 q l 2 increases however for larger half free span length l 1 the value of f t 1 q l 2 becomes larger while the value of f t 2 q l 2 becomes smaller 16 b 1 f ei λ 2 μ 2 b 2 f μ 2 l 3 2 2

influence of temperature difference on the buckled configurations is presented in fig 5 it is obvious that half a small lobe forms within the span while a large lobe forms beyond the free span for each half buckled shape as shown in fig 5 a with increasing temperature difference the large lobes beyond the free span enlarge significantly while the small lobes only increase slightly it is clear to see that two displacement amplitudes exist one lies in the middle of the free span in the negative direction denoted as w m 1 while the other is beyond the free span in the positive direction denoted as w m 2 the locations of them are denoted as x w m 1 and x w m 2 respectively the location of w m 1 lies in the middle of the span w m 2 increases significantly and the location of it moves away from the free span with increasing temperature difference so it s necessary to determine the location of w m 2 first once the location is obtained the value of w m 2 can be determined in fig 5 b three extrema of bending stress exist along the half buckled pipeline denoted by σ m m 1 σ m m 2 and σ m m 3 the axial compressive stress is composed of bending stress and stress induced by axial compressive force the axial compressive force is constant within each buckled segment so the locations of extrema of the bending stress are the same as the locations of extrema of the axial compressive stress the three extrema of the axial compressive stress corresponding to σ m m 1 σ m m 2 and σ m m 3 respectively are denoted as σ m 1 σ m 2 σ m 3 the corresponding locations are x σ m 1 x σ m 2 and x σ m 3 respectively σ m 1 lies in the middle of the span whose location is the same as the location of the displacement amplitude w m 1 however another two locations of extrema of the axial compressive stress lie beyond the span which move away from the free span with increasing temperature difference the extrema of the axial compressive stress all increase significantly with increasing temperature difference now consideration will be given to determine how to calculate the exact locations of the displacement amplitudes and three extrema of the axial compressive stress the locations of displacement amplitude and extrema of the axial compressive stress along the pipeline can be obtained by d w d x 0 and d 3 w d x 3 0 respectively as shown in fig 6 the locations of w m 1 and σ m 1 are obtained by deflection w 2 however the locations of w m 2 σ m 2 and σ m 3 will be obtained through deflection w 1 the values of the displacement amplitudes and extrema of the axial compressive stress will be obtained through deflections w 1 or w 2 when the locations of them are determined in fig 6 it is clear to see that w m 1 and σ m 1 are almost at the same location the locations of w m 2 σ m 2 and σ m 3 all increase with increasing temperature difference in the post buckling stage the ratios of different extrema of the axial compressive stress shown in fig 7 can be used to judge which is the maximum axial compressive stress the ratios of σ m 3 to σ m 2 with different half free span lengths are all smaller than one as shown in fig 7 a which means that the values of σ m 3 are smaller than those of σ m 2 so the maximum axial compressive stress cannot be located at x σ m 3 so the maximum axial compressive stress may locate at the locations of x σ m 1 or x σ m 2 from fig 7 b the ratios of σ m 1 to σ m 2 with different half free span lengths are used to compare the values of σ m 1 and σ m 2 the values of σ m 1 σ m 2 reduce with increasing temperature difference in the post buckling stage which means the increasing rate of σ m 1 is slower than that of σ m 2 as shown in fig 8 in fig 7 b taking l 1 5 m for example the values of σ m 1 σ m 2 are smaller than one in the post buckling stage so the maximum axial compressive stress locates at x σ m 2 for l 1 10 m the values of σ m 1 σ m 2 are larger than one within the range of temperature difference shown in fig 7 b even though they will decrease to smaller than one for significant large temperature difference so the maximum axial compressive stress locates at x σ m 1 namely in the middle of the span for the range of temperature difference shown in fig 7 b the situation is a little more complex for l 1 7 5 m when the temperature difference is smaller than t 0 a the values of σ m 1 σ m 2 are larger than one however the values of σ m 1 σ m 2 reduce to smaller than one when the temperature difference increases to larger than t 0 a so the maximum axial compressive stress locates at x σ m 1 i e at the midpoint of the free span for t 0 t 0 a while it locates at x σ m 2 for t 0 t 0 a thus we can conclude that for large free span length the maximum axial compressive stress will locate at x σ m 1 at relative low temperature difference however it will locate at x σ m 2 at relative high temperature difference for small free span length such as l 1 5 m the maximum axial compressive stress will locate at x σ m 2 so it s better to calculate both the values of σ m 1 and σ m 2 in the post buckling analysis the absolute values of three extrema of axial compressive stress are shown in fig 8 it is clear to see that the absolute values of σ m 1 and σ m 2 are larger than those of σ m 3 under the same temperature difference the values of σ m 1 are larger than those of σ m 2 at relative low temperature difference however the values of σ m 1 are smaller than those of σ m 2 at relative high temperature difference because the increasing rate of σ m 1 is smaller than that of σ m 2 with increasing temperature difference comparisons between different extrema of displacement amplitudes are shown in fig 9 the values of w m 1 w m 2 decrease with increasing temperature difference in the post buckling stage which means that the increasing rate of w m 1 is slower than that of w m 2 for small free span length such as l 1 5 m all the values of w m 1 w m 2 are smaller than one in the post buckling stage which indicates that the displacement amplitude locates at x w m 2 namely beyond the span however for large free span length taking l 1 12 5 m for example when the temperature difference is smaller than t 0 b the values of w m 1 w m 2 are larger than one however the values of w m 1 w m 2 reduce to smaller than one when the temperature difference increases to larger than t 0 b so the displacement amplitude locates at x w m 1 namely in the middle of the free span for t 0 t 0 b while it locates at x w m 2 for t 0 t 0 b so the conclusion is that the displacement amplitude locates in the middle of the span for relatively larger free span length at lower temperature difference while it locates beyond the span at higher temperature difference however for smaller free span length the displacement amplitude locates beyond the span for all the temperature differences 3 3 parametric study upheaval buckling of a typical pipeline resting on a free span is studied in this section first the influence of half free span length on buckled configurations are presented and discussed then the influence of half free span length on typical upheaval buckling behaviour is analysed after that a detailed analysis about the influence of half free span length on the normalised minimum critical temperature difference displacement amplitude and maximum axial compressive stress is analysed finally the effect of touchdown on the post upheaval buckling behaviour is investigated in detail the analytical formulations derived in section 2 are used here to study the effect of free span the parameters in table 1 are employed as a realistic case study 3 3 1 buckled configuration the influence of free span length on the deformed shapes and the corresponding bending stresses σ m under the same operating temperature difference are shown in fig 10 a and fig 10 b respectively a smaller lobe forms in the negative direction within the span while a larger lobe forms in the positive direction beyond the span for each buckled shape as shown in fig 10 a however for pipelines without span only one lobe forms in the positive direction with increasing free span length the smaller lobe within the span enlarges however the larger lobe beyond the span shrinks the displacement amplitude in the middle of the span increases while the other one in the positive direction decreases with increasing free span length in fig 10 b with increasing free span length the extremum of bending stress in the middle of the span increases significantly while another two decrease slightly 3 3 2 typical post buckling behaviour the relationships between temperature difference and displacement amplitude with different half free span lengths are shown in fig 11 where t m is the minimum critical temperature difference in fig 11 b it is clear to see that the minimum critical temperature difference t m decreases with increasing free span length for small half free span length such as l 1 10 m two post buckling branches exist namely branch m b and m c fig 11 b shows that the displacement amplitude w m 2 increases with increasing temperature difference along branch m b and decreases with increasing temperature difference along branch m c the conclusion is that branch m b is stable and branch m c is unstable wang and van der heijden 2017 the buckle only occurs when the temperature difference is larger than the minimum critical temperature difference in the post buckling stage snap through buckling phenomenon may happen from unstable branch to stable branch however when the half free span length is large enough such as l 1 12 5 m the minimum critical temperature difference t m does not exist and the unstable branch disappears the displacement amplitudes increase monotonically with increasing temperature difference both the displacement amplitudes w m 1 and w m 2 increase in negative and positive direction respectively with increasing temperature difference moreover under the same temperature difference displacement amplitude w m 1 increases in the negative direction significantly with increasing span length while displacement amplitude w m 2 decreases in the positive direction the displacement amplitude for pipelines with a free span segment is much smaller than that for pipelines without a free span segment the first reason for this is that the axial thermal expansion for pipeline with a free span segment is smaller than that for pipeline without a free span segment as shown in fig 13 b the second reason of this is that three buckled lobes one lobe in the negative direction and two lobes in the positive direction form for pipeline with a free span segment while only one lobe forms in the positive direction for pipeline without a free span segment see fig 10 the relationships between temperature difference and maximum axial compressive stresses with different half free span lengths are shown in fig 12 both the maximum axial compressive stresses σ m 1 and σ m 2 increase with increasing temperature difference morever under the same temperature difference the maximum axial compressive stress σ m 1 in the middle of the free span increases significantly with increasing free span length while the maximum axial compressive stress σ m 2 decreases the reason of the increase of σ m 1 with increasing free span length is that the maximum bending stress induced by the maximum bending moment in the middle of the span increases see fig 10 b even though the stress induced by axial compressive force decreases see fig 13 a with increasing free span length the reason of the decrease of σ m 2 with increasing free span length is that the maximum bending stress induced by the maximum bending moment decreases see fig 10 b and the stress induced by axial compressive force also decreases see fig 13 a from fig 12 a for smaller half free span length such as l 1 10 m the maximum axial compressive stress σ m 1 in the middle of the span is smaller than that for pipelines without a free span segment under the same temperature difference however when the half free span length is large enough such as l 1 12 5 m the maximum axial compressive stress σ m 1 is larger than that for pipeline without a free span segment under the same temperature difference from fig 12 b it is clear to see that maximum axial compressive stress σ m 2 is smaller than that for pipelines without a free span segment so it is safer for the pipeline to rest on a span with smaller half free span length triggering upheaval buckling with three lobes however the pipeline will be more dangerous compared to the case without a free span segment when it is suspended on a free span with large enough free span length 3 3 3 detailed analysis on t m w m and σ m now a more detailed parametric analysis about the influence of half free span length on the normalised minimum critical temperature difference is presented in fig 14 the values of minimum critical temperature difference shown in fig 14 are normalised against the value of minimum critical temperature difference for pipeline without span the normalised minimum critical temperature difference decreases with the increase of half free span length its decreasing rate increases with increasing half free span length from fig 14 the normalised minimum critical temperature difference is larger than one for l 1 l 1 a which indicates that the minimum critical temperature difference for pipelines with span is larger than that for pipeline without span so upheaval buckling of pipelines without span tends to form one buckled lobe however for l 1 l 1 a the normalised minimum critical temperature difference reduces to smaller than one which means that the minimum critical temperature difference for pipeline with span is smaller than that for pipelines without span so upheaval buckling of pipelines with span tends to form three buckled lobes finally the conclusion is that the pipelines with a suspended section are prone to upheaval buckling to form three buckled lobes for large free span length the influence of half free span length on the normalised displacement amplitude and normalised maximum axial compressive stress is shown in fig 15 they are all normalised against the values of the case without free span from fig 15 a the normalised displacement amplitude w m 1 in the middle of the free span increases with increasing half free span length while the normalised displacement amplitude w m 2 beyond the free span decreases with increasing half free span length both w m 1 and w m 2 are smaller than one for all the values of the half free span length this means that all the displacement amplitudes for pipeline with a free span segment are smaller than that for pipeline without a free span segment from fig 15 b the normalised maximum axial compressive stress σ m 2 beyond the span decreases slightly with increasing half free span length but the normalised maximum axial compressive stress σ m 1 in the middle of the free span increases significantly with increasing half free span length its value is smaller than one for l 1 l 1 a however its value increases to larger than one for l 1 l 1 a so the maximum axial compressive stress σ m 1 for pipelines with l 1 l 1 a is smaller than that for pipelines without span while σ m 1 for pipeline with l 1 l 1 a is larger than that for pipeline without free span so the pipelines will be more dangerous for large enough free span length during the post buckling stage compared to the case for pipeline without span from fig 15 b the values of normalised σ m 1 and σ m 2 are the same at l 1 l 1 b the value of normalised σ m 1 is larger than that of normalised σ m 2 for l 1 l 1 b while it s smaller than that of normalised σ m 2 for l 1 l 1 b so the maximum axial compressive stress locates at the middle of the free span for l 1 l 1 b and locates beyond the free span for l 1 l 1 b so it s necessary to calculate the values of σ m 1 and σ m 2 during the design process 3 3 4 touchdown effect in this section the effect of touchdown on the post upheaval buckling behaviour is discussed in detail the previous analysis has shown that the displacement amplitude within the span locates in the middle of the free span so the pipeline section in the middle of the free span will touch down the bottom of the free span firstly during upheaval buckling when the displacement amplitude within the free span reaches the depth of the free span denoted as h afterwards the touchdown point at the bottom of the span will be constrained by the seabed so the corresponding boundary conditions in the middle of the free span will change firstly the displacement in the middle of the free span will be kept constant and equal to the depth of the free span due to the constraint of the bottom of the free span secondly the slope of the deflection in the middle of the free span should be zero due to symmetry finally the shear force is not constant due to the concentrated contact force in the middle of the free span therefore the boundary conditions in the middle of the free span should be modified as 17 w 1 l 2 h d w 1 d x l 2 0 then using the boundary conditions listed in eq 17 combined with all the other boundary conditions and continuous conditions in section 2 the same methods and procedures as the case without touchdown can be applied to obtain the solutions for upheaval buckling with the consideration of the touchdown effect all the results of the touchdown effect on the post buckling behaviours are shown in fig 16 and fig 17 the effect of touchdown on displacement amplitudes is shown in fig 16 the pipeline will follow the path of no touchdown i e m a before the displacement amplitude in the middle of the free span w m 1 reaches the depth of the free span as shown in fig 16 a however when the pipeline touches the seabed taking h 0 5 m as an example the buckling path will follow the path a a 1 with increasing temperature difference the displacement amplitude w m 1 keeps constant after the touchdown point due to the restriction of the bottom of the free span the maximum axial compressive stress in the middle of the span σ m 1 will also follow the path a a 1 to develop after the touchdown point as shown in fig 17 a this shows that with increasing temperature difference the maximum axial compressive stress in the middle of the span σ m 1 firstly decreases rapidly after the touchdown point the reason of which is that the deflection around the touchdown point is more benign leading to smaller bending stress then it increases slightly with further increasing temperature difference from fig 17 a σ m 1 decreases significantly with decreasing depth of free span under the same temperature difference so a good strategy to decrease the maximum stress within the free span is to reduce the depth of the free span when upheaval buckling occurs for subsea pipelines with a free span segment from fig 16 b it is clear to see that the displacement amplitude beyond the free span w m 2 becomes larger after the touchdown point namely point a compared to the no touchdown case it increases slightly with decreasing depth of the free span the reason is that the more thermal expansion will feed into the deflection in the positive direction since the deflection in the negative direction within the free span is restricted by the bottom of the free span at the same time the maximum axial compressive stress beyond the free span σ m 2 will also increase after the touchdown point compared to the no touchdown case both w m 2 and σ m 2 increase with decreasing depth of free span under the same temperature difference after the pipeline touches the bottom of the free span 4 conclusions analytical solutions of upheaval buckling were derived for subsea pipelines with a free span section first the accurate locations of displacement amplitudes and extrema of axial compressive stress were obtained the comparisons between different extrema of axial compressive stress and displacement amplitudes were carried out to determine which of them is the largest stress and displacement then the influence of free span length on buckled configuration and post buckling behaviour was analysed a detailed parametric analysis was performed to investigate the influence of free span length on minimum critical temperature displacement amplitudes and maximum axial compressive stresses finally the effect of the touchdown is discussed from the parametric analyses the following conclusions can be drawn i the maximum axial compressive stress will locate in the middle of the free span for large free span length at relative low temperature difference while it will locate beyond the free span at relative high temperature difference or for small free span length so it is necessary to calculate both the values of the maximum axial compressive stresses within and beyond the free span in the post buckling analysis ii the deformed shapes and the corresponding bending stresses within the span are affected significantly by the free span length the displacement amplitude and the extremum of bending stress in the middle of the free span increase significantly while the rest of them beyond the free span decrease slightly with increasing free span length iii the minimum critical temperature difference decreases with increasing free span length both the stable and unstable branches exist for small free span length while the unstable branch disappears for large enough free span length iv the pipeline is safer to rest on a span with small free span length to form the buckled shape with three lobes compared to the case without free span to form the buckled shape with only one lobe it is more dangerous for the pipeline with too large free span length during the post buckling stage v the maximum stress within the free span decreases significantly while the maximum stress beyond the free span increases slightly with decreasing depth of the free span after the pipeline touches the bottom of the free span so an available way to reduce the maximum stress within the span is to reduce the depth of the span making the buckled pipeline touch the bottom of the free span credit

21338,subsea pipelines with a free suspended span segment may be subject to upheaval buckling under high temperature which may lead to a failure mode such as local buckling fracture and fatigue mathematical models are established to study the upheaval buckling behaviour of subsea pipelines with a free span segment then the accurate locations of the maxima of displacement and stress are obtained the buckled configuration and the typical post buckling behaviour and their dependence on free span length are analysed furthermore a detailed analysis is presented for critical temperature difference displacement amplitude and maximum axial compressive stress finally the influence of touchdown on post buckling behaviour during the process of upheaval buckling is discussed the results show that the pipeline is prone to upheaval buckling when the free span length is large enough and the critical temperature difference decreases with increasing free span length the displacement amplitude and the maximum stress within the span increase with the increase of the free span length before touchdown however after the pipeline touches the bottom of the free span the maximum stress within the span decreases significantly compared to the case without touchdown which becomes further smaller for smaller depth of the free span keywords subsea pipelines upheaval buckling free span touchdown 1 introduction in order to meet the demand for energy the exploiting of offshore oil and gas has developed rapidly during the past few decades in recent years more and more high pressure and high temperature oil and gas fields have been developed by using subsea pipelines to transport oil and gas products so the subsea pipelines are subjected to high pressure and high temperature in operating conditions which has a tendency to expand longitudinally due to the rise in temperature and in internal pressure wang et al 2017c however the subsea pipelines are restrained by the seabed friction and the pipe end devices resulting in the accumulation of effective axial compressive force in the pipe wall for a pipeline laid on an uneven seabed such as a seabed with a free span upheaval buckling will be triggered when the axial compressive force induced by thermal expansion and pressure increase is larger than the critical axial compressive force upheaval buckling is considered as a structural response to a high axial compressive force and not a failure mode as such dnvgl rp f110 2018 however upheaval buckling may induce pipeline failures due to an excessive strain at the apex of the buckles local buckling fatigue or excessive displacement so it is necessary to investigate the upheaval buckling behaviour of subsea pipelines with a free span segment to date considerable effort has been made to improve the understanding of thermal buckling behaviour of subsea pipelines analytically an analytical method taking the thermal effect into the theoretical model proposed by kerr was applied to buckling of railroad tracks kerr 1978 and blowup of concrete pavement kerr and shade 1984 which was also employed in the buckling of subsea pipelines based on this method both lateral and upheaval buckling of subsea pipelines were investigated analytically by hobbs 1984 without the consideration of initial imperfections some formulas for critical axial force buckling displacement amplitude and bending moment were derived based on the assumption of the presumed buckling modes then initial imperfections were incorporated into the analytical models by taylor and co workers taylor and gan 1986 taylor and tran 1993 for lateral and upheaval buckling of subsea pipelines for pipelines subjected to time varying temperature loadings upheaval creep behaviour due to initial imperfections was investigated by pedersen and jensen 1988 they found that the imperfection amplitude can magnify for pipelines subjected to time varying temperature loadings namely upheaval creep so that upheaval buckling may take place at a temperature lower than the design temperature the asymmetric effects of prop imperfections on the upheaval buckling of pipelines were studied by ballet and hobbs 1992 and they found that an asymmetric mode of buckling may occur for pipelines with prop imperfections furthermore a simplified analytical model was proposed for upheaval thermal buckling of pipelines with initially imperfect geometry by croll 1997 simple and closed form solutions suitable to design were derived for both initial lift off and the maximum upheaval buckling loads through this analytical model more recently for a pipeline laid on a plastic soft seabed the influence of seabed resistance on upheaval buckling was investigated analytically by shi et al 2013 they found that upheaval buckling phenomenon was affected significantly by soil resistance of soft seabed the downward buckling mode rather than upheaval buckling mode may occur for very soft soil the interaction between upheaval or lateral buckling karampour et al 2013a and propagation buckling karampour 2018 karampour et al 2013b for a pipeline with a single imperfection was investigated by karampour and co workers the analytical solution of higher order lateral buckling was derived by hong et al 2015 for submarine pipelines with a single arch symmetric initial imperfection through the energy method they found that the buckling mode may transform from lower mode into higher mode with increasing temperature difference taking nonlinear pipe soil interaction into account upheaval buckling of imperfect buried pipelines was investigated by wang et al 2017a through perturbation method the mathematical model was established with the incorporation of the interaction between adjacent buckles by wang et al 2017e to investigate the controlled lateral buckling behaviour they found that the feed in length had great influence on the post buckling behaviour as for the initiation of lateral buckling analytical solutions were derived based on the assumption of classical mode one wang et al 2017d 2018b and mode three wang et al 2018a c when the sleeper or the buoyancy section were incorporated into the model to trigger lateral buckles both the critical temperature difference and the maximum stress of the laterally buckled pipeline were found to reduce when a buoyancy section or a sleeper were employed even though the displacement amplitude increased furthermore localised lateral buckling of subsea pipelines with nonlinear foundation was investigated by zeng and duan 2014 and wang and van der heijden 2017 in their study wang and van der heijden 2017 found that both the critical temperature difference and the maximum stress increased with increasing breakout resistance localised upheaval buckling was investigated for buried pipelines with the consideration of vertical nonlinear foundation force by wang et al 2018d the more recent studies employ the finite element method to investigate thermal buckling for pipelines with initial imperfections based on the finite element method four types of numerical simulation models were proposed by liu et al 2014 to simulate pipeline lateral buckling under temperature difference in which a new method was proposed to incorporate the initial imperfection into the finite element model taking the initial geometric imperfection and the nonlinear soil resistance model into account liu et al 2015 also studied upheaval buckling for buried subsea pipelines finite element models were employed to simulate upheaval buckling behaviour of pipe in pipe systems by wang et al 2015 and lateral buckling behaviour for pipelines with sleeper wang et al 2017b xu and lin 2017 considered the influence of seabed undulation and initial stress in the pipe on the critical load of upheaval buckling by the vector form intrinsic finite element method a unified formula for the critical compressive force of upheaval and lateral buckling was proposed by zhang et al zhang and duan 2015 zhang et al 2018a b based on different initial imperfection shapes of subsea pipelines liu and li 2018 proposed a method to determine the model length of pipelines in the process of pipeline buckling based on the characteristics of short pipes and long pipes they found that the displacement amplitude increased with increasing model length of pipeline for a short pipe when the model length of the pipeline was larger than the critical length the displacement amplitude would keep constant with further increasing model length liang et al 2019 investigated the thermal upheaval bucklilng of submarine pipelines laid on submarine pits and trenches through the finite element method upheaval buckling of subsea pipelines laid on the seabed with topographic step imperfection under high temperature was investigated through theoretical and finite element method chen et al 2020 wang and van der heijden 2020 for sufficiently small step heights the pipeline may suffer a snap back instability under decreasing thermal loading raising the possibility of hysteretic snap behaviour under cyclic thermal loading based on the experience gained during the projects the interaction of free span and lateral buckling problems was studied by galgoul et al 2004 through finite element method the vertical deflection will grow due to the self weight of subsea pipelines and the axial force resulting from the temperature difference the buckled pipeline may touch the ground before the pipeline turn to the lateral buckling mode however in this study only the upheaval buckling process before the upheaval buckling mode turns into lateral buckling mode is investigated buckling response of subsea pipelines with free span lengths under axial loads was investigated by seyfipour and bahaari 2018 based on these studies with the consideration of the temperature difference and touchdown effect between the pipeline and the ground within the span upheaval buckling behaviour for subsea pipelines with free span segment will be carried out in this study the objective of the present paper is to propose an analytical model to investigate analytically the influence of free span on pipeline upheaval buckling behaviour first analytical solutions of upheaval buckling are derived for subsea pipelines with a free span segment under axial force induced by high temperature and high internal pressure then the accurate locations of two buckling displacement amplitudes and three extrema of the stress along the buckled pipeline are determined after that the buckled configuration and the typical post buckling behaviour and their dependence on free span length are presented and analysed in addition a more detailed parametric analysis about the influence of free span length is presented finally the effect of the touchdown of the pipeline to the bottom of the free span on the upheaval buckling behaviour is discussed 2 analytical solution under high temperature and high pressure subsea pipelines tend to expand longitudinally to relieve the axial strain the axial force induced by the axial strain will build up along the length of the pipeline due to the constraint of the axial soil resistance between the pipeline and the seabed when the axial compressive force is larger than the critical value upheaval buckling will occur for a pipeline with a free span segment during upheaval buckling a small segment of pipe will mobilise vertically see fig 1 within the buckled region the axial compressive force drops since additional pipe feeds into the buckle to form vertical deflection for the pipe segment within the buckled region there is no contact between the pipeline and the seabed except the location of the edge of the free span x l 2 l 1 so the axial compressive force keeps constant for the pipe segment within the buckled region except that a jump of axial compressive force exists at x l 2 l 1 see fig 1 induced by the vertical contact force see fig 2 beyond the buckled region the axial compressive force increases linearly with the distance from the nearest touchdown points x 0 and 2 l 2 with assuming that the axial soil resistance is constant say f a the segment 0 x 2 l 2 is called the buckled region at some points x l 2 l s the axial thermal expansion of the pipeline is sufficient to satisfy the requirement of additional length introduced by the vertical deflection at these points the axial displacement is therefore zero they are called virtual anchor points and bound what is called the feed in region fig 1 shows this feed in region of length 2 l s together with the typical axial compressive force distribution p 0 is the axial compressive force where no axial thermal expansion occurs fig 2 illustrates the load distribution of upheaval buckling for pipelines with a free span segment a symmetric free span with a span length of 2 l 1 and a depth of h is introduced artificially in the middle of the pipeline as shown in fig 2 linear beam column theory valid for small deflections is used to formulate the upheaval buckling of the pipeline with a free span segment a perfectly straight pipeline is considered in stress free conditions when the pipeline is installed on the seabed at ambient temperature let the temperature of the pipeline be raised by an amount t 0 composed of the increase of temperature difference and the equivalent temperature difference generated by internal pressure if the pipe were free to expand it would do so with a longitudinal strain α t 0 where α is the coefficient of thermal expansion of the material however the expansion is opposed by the axial soil resistance between the pipe and the seabed so an axial compressive force p 0 e a α t 0 builds up along the length of the pipeline assuming the pipeline remains straight here a is the cross sectional area of the pipeline e is the elastic modulus the axial compressive force distribution p x as shown in fig 1 during the buckling stage is expressed as 1 p x p l 2 x l 2 l 1 p f a t 1 l 2 l 1 x 2 l 2 p f a t 1 f a t 2 f a x 2 l 2 2 l 2 x l 2 l s where f a t 1 μ a f t 1 and f a t 2 μ a f t 2 are the concentrated axial friction force induced by the vertical concentrated contact forces f t 1 and f t 2 at x l 2 l 1 and x 0 or 2 l 2 respectively μ a is the axial friction coefficient between pipeline and seabed l s is the feed in length therefore the axial compressive force at the virtual anchor point x l 2 l s is 2 p 0 p f a t 1 f a t 2 f a l s l 2 the equations governing the pipeline with a free span segment are 3 e i d 4 w 1 d x 4 p f a t 1 d 2 w 1 d x 2 q 0 x l 3 e i d 4 w 2 d x 4 p d 2 w 2 d x 2 q l 3 x l 2 where i is the moment of inertia q is the submerged weight per unit length of the pipeline w 1 and w 2 are the vertical deflection the seabed is assumed as rigid in this study which is acceptable for upheaval buckling of unburied subsea pipelines wang et al 2018d now let 4 λ 2 p e i and μ 2 p f a t 1 e i the general solutions of eq 3 can then be written as 5 w 1 x b 1 cos μ x b 2 sin μ x b 3 x b 4 q 2 λ 2 e i x 2 0 x l 3 w 2 x b 5 cos λ x b 6 sin λ x b 7 x b 8 q 2 λ 2 e i x 2 l 3 x l 2 the displacement slope and moment at x 0 are zero in addition the slope of the deflection and the shear force at x l 2 is zero due to symmetry when there is no contact between the pipeline and the bottom of the free span so the boundary conditions at x 0 and x l 2 are 6 w 1 0 0 d w 1 d x 0 0 d 2 w 1 d x 2 0 0 d w 2 d x l 2 0 d 3 w 2 d x 3 l 2 0 the displacement slope and bending moment must be continuous at the edge of the free span however the shear force has a jump at the touchdown point x l 3 due to the concentrated contact force between the pipeline and the seabed at the edge of the free span the vertical deflection at the edge of the span is zero thus the following matching conditions have to be satisfied 7 w 1 l 3 w 2 l 3 d w 1 d x l 3 d w 2 d x l 3 d 2 w 1 d x 2 l 3 d 2 w 2 d x 2 l 3 d 3 w 1 d x 3 l 3 d 3 w 2 d x 3 l 3 f t 1 e i w 1 l 3 0 then the contact force between the pipeline and the seabed at the end of the buckled pipeline can be solved by 8 f t 2 e i d 3 w 1 d x 3 0 when upheaval buckling occurs the pipeline will deflect vertically so more pipe length needs to be feed in the buckled region which comes from the axial thermal expansion within the feed in region thus the axial thermal expansion denoted as u 1 should be equal to the additional length introduced by the vertical deflection denoted as u 2 so the compatibility between the axial and vertical deformation used to derive the relationship between the axial compressive force p and the temperature difference t 0 can be expressed as 9 u 1 u 2 for u 1 we have 10 u 1 l 2 l s l 2 δ p x e a d x where δ p x p 0 p x is the amount of reduction of axial compressive force meanwhile for u 2 we have 11 u 2 1 2 0 l 3 d w 1 d x 2 d x 1 2 l 3 l 2 d w 2 d x 2 d x the bending moment m along the buckled pipeline is 12 m e i d 2 w d x 2 where w stands for either w 1 or w 2 thus the corresponding bending stress σ m along the buckled pipeline is 13 σ m m d 2 i where d is the external diameter of the pipe the maximum axial compressive stress σ m along the pipeline can be obtained from the following expression 14 σ m σ p σ m m where the stresses σ p and σ m m induced by axial compressive force p x and maximum bending moment m m respectively can be obtained by 15 σ p p x a σ m m m m d 2 i 3 analytical results 3 1 the values of f t 1 and λ l 2 the solution for the pipeline deflection w 1 w 2 can be presented in semi explicit form by using eq 6 and eq 7 to express the coefficients b i in terms of f t 1 λ and l 2 and all the parameters of the problem see eq 16 for the values of f t 1 and λ l 2 we then still need to solve two transcendental equations firstly the relationship between λ and l 2 can be obtained by solving the transcendental equations as shown in fig 3 a then through eq 9 the relationship between λ l 2 and t 0 can be obtained for pipelines suspended in a free span the values of f t 1 and λ l 2 change with the total temperature difference t 0 and half free span length l 1 as shown in fig 3 b and fig 4 a the values of f t 2 can also be calculated by eq 8 as shown in fig 4 b from fig 4 with increasing temperature difference the value of f t 1 q l 2 decreases while the value of f t 2 q l 2 increases however for larger half free span length l 1 the value of f t 1 q l 2 becomes larger while the value of f t 2 q l 2 becomes smaller 16 b 1 f ei λ 2 μ 2 b 2 f μ 2 l 3 2 2

influence of temperature difference on the buckled configurations is presented in fig 5 it is obvious that half a small lobe forms within the span while a large lobe forms beyond the free span for each half buckled shape as shown in fig 5 a with increasing temperature difference the large lobes beyond the free span enlarge significantly while the small lobes only increase slightly it is clear to see that two displacement amplitudes exist one lies in the middle of the free span in the negative direction denoted as w m 1 while the other is beyond the free span in the positive direction denoted as w m 2 the locations of them are denoted as x w m 1 and x w m 2 respectively the location of w m 1 lies in the middle of the span w m 2 increases significantly and the location of it moves away from the free span with increasing temperature difference so it s necessary to determine the location of w m 2 first once the location is obtained the value of w m 2 can be determined in fig 5 b three extrema of bending stress exist along the half buckled pipeline denoted by σ m m 1 σ m m 2 and σ m m 3 the axial compressive stress is composed of bending stress and stress induced by axial compressive force the axial compressive force is constant within each buckled segment so the locations of extrema of the bending stress are the same as the locations of extrema of the axial compressive stress the three extrema of the axial compressive stress corresponding to σ m m 1 σ m m 2 and σ m m 3 respectively are denoted as σ m 1 σ m 2 σ m 3 the corresponding locations are x σ m 1 x σ m 2 and x σ m 3 respectively σ m 1 lies in the middle of the span whose location is the same as the location of the displacement amplitude w m 1 however another two locations of extrema of the axial compressive stress lie beyond the span which move away from the free span with increasing temperature difference the extrema of the axial compressive stress all increase significantly with increasing temperature difference now consideration will be given to determine how to calculate the exact locations of the displacement amplitudes and three extrema of the axial compressive stress the locations of displacement amplitude and extrema of the axial compressive stress along the pipeline can be obtained by d w d x 0 and d 3 w d x 3 0 respectively as shown in fig 6 the locations of w m 1 and σ m 1 are obtained by deflection w 2 however the locations of w m 2 σ m 2 and σ m 3 will be obtained through deflection w 1 the values of the displacement amplitudes and extrema of the axial compressive stress will be obtained through deflections w 1 or w 2 when the locations of them are determined in fig 6 it is clear to see that w m 1 and σ m 1 are almost at the same location the locations of w m 2 σ m 2 and σ m 3 all increase with increasing temperature difference in the post buckling stage the ratios of different extrema of the axial compressive stress shown in fig 7 can be used to judge which is the maximum axial compressive stress the ratios of σ m 3 to σ m 2 with different half free span lengths are all smaller than one as shown in fig 7 a which means that the values of σ m 3 are smaller than those of σ m 2 so the maximum axial compressive stress cannot be located at x σ m 3 so the maximum axial compressive stress may locate at the locations of x σ m 1 or x σ m 2 from fig 7 b the ratios of σ m 1 to σ m 2 with different half free span lengths are used to compare the values of σ m 1 and σ m 2 the values of σ m 1 σ m 2 reduce with increasing temperature difference in the post buckling stage which means the increasing rate of σ m 1 is slower than that of σ m 2 as shown in fig 8 in fig 7 b taking l 1 5 m for example the values of σ m 1 σ m 2 are smaller than one in the post buckling stage so the maximum axial compressive stress locates at x σ m 2 for l 1 10 m the values of σ m 1 σ m 2 are larger than one within the range of temperature difference shown in fig 7 b even though they will decrease to smaller than one for significant large temperature difference so the maximum axial compressive stress locates at x σ m 1 namely in the middle of the span for the range of temperature difference shown in fig 7 b the situation is a little more complex for l 1 7 5 m when the temperature difference is smaller than t 0 a the values of σ m 1 σ m 2 are larger than one however the values of σ m 1 σ m 2 reduce to smaller than one when the temperature difference increases to larger than t 0 a so the maximum axial compressive stress locates at x σ m 1 i e at the midpoint of the free span for t 0 t 0 a while it locates at x σ m 2 for t 0 t 0 a thus we can conclude that for large free span length the maximum axial compressive stress will locate at x σ m 1 at relative low temperature difference however it will locate at x σ m 2 at relative high temperature difference for small free span length such as l 1 5 m the maximum axial compressive stress will locate at x σ m 2 so it s better to calculate both the values of σ m 1 and σ m 2 in the post buckling analysis the absolute values of three extrema of axial compressive stress are shown in fig 8 it is clear to see that the absolute values of σ m 1 and σ m 2 are larger than those of σ m 3 under the same temperature difference the values of σ m 1 are larger than those of σ m 2 at relative low temperature difference however the values of σ m 1 are smaller than those of σ m 2 at relative high temperature difference because the increasing rate of σ m 1 is smaller than that of σ m 2 with increasing temperature difference comparisons between different extrema of displacement amplitudes are shown in fig 9 the values of w m 1 w m 2 decrease with increasing temperature difference in the post buckling stage which means that the increasing rate of w m 1 is slower than that of w m 2 for small free span length such as l 1 5 m all the values of w m 1 w m 2 are smaller than one in the post buckling stage which indicates that the displacement amplitude locates at x w m 2 namely beyond the span however for large free span length taking l 1 12 5 m for example when the temperature difference is smaller than t 0 b the values of w m 1 w m 2 are larger than one however the values of w m 1 w m 2 reduce to smaller than one when the temperature difference increases to larger than t 0 b so the displacement amplitude locates at x w m 1 namely in the middle of the free span for t 0 t 0 b while it locates at x w m 2 for t 0 t 0 b so the conclusion is that the displacement amplitude locates in the middle of the span for relatively larger free span length at lower temperature difference while it locates beyond the span at higher temperature difference however for smaller free span length the displacement amplitude locates beyond the span for all the temperature differences 3 3 parametric study upheaval buckling of a typical pipeline resting on a free span is studied in this section first the influence of half free span length on buckled configurations are presented and discussed then the influence of half free span length on typical upheaval buckling behaviour is analysed after that a detailed analysis about the influence of half free span length on the normalised minimum critical temperature difference displacement amplitude and maximum axial compressive stress is analysed finally the effect of touchdown on the post upheaval buckling behaviour is investigated in detail the analytical formulations derived in section 2 are used here to study the effect of free span the parameters in table 1 are employed as a realistic case study 3 3 1 buckled configuration the influence of free span length on the deformed shapes and the corresponding bending stresses σ m under the same operating temperature difference are shown in fig 10 a and fig 10 b respectively a smaller lobe forms in the negative direction within the span while a larger lobe forms in the positive direction beyond the span for each buckled shape as shown in fig 10 a however for pipelines without span only one lobe forms in the positive direction with increasing free span length the smaller lobe within the span enlarges however the larger lobe beyond the span shrinks the displacement amplitude in the middle of the span increases while the other one in the positive direction decreases with increasing free span length in fig 10 b with increasing free span length the extremum of bending stress in the middle of the span increases significantly while another two decrease slightly 3 3 2 typical post buckling behaviour the relationships between temperature difference and displacement amplitude with different half free span lengths are shown in fig 11 where t m is the minimum critical temperature difference in fig 11 b it is clear to see that the minimum critical temperature difference t m decreases with increasing free span length for small half free span length such as l 1 10 m two post buckling branches exist namely branch m b and m c fig 11 b shows that the displacement amplitude w m 2 increases with increasing temperature difference along branch m b and decreases with increasing temperature difference along branch m c the conclusion is that branch m b is stable and branch m c is unstable wang and van der heijden 2017 the buckle only occurs when the temperature difference is larger than the minimum critical temperature difference in the post buckling stage snap through buckling phenomenon may happen from unstable branch to stable branch however when the half free span length is large enough such as l 1 12 5 m the minimum critical temperature difference t m does not exist and the unstable branch disappears the displacement amplitudes increase monotonically with increasing temperature difference both the displacement amplitudes w m 1 and w m 2 increase in negative and positive direction respectively with increasing temperature difference moreover under the same temperature difference displacement amplitude w m 1 increases in the negative direction significantly with increasing span length while displacement amplitude w m 2 decreases in the positive direction the displacement amplitude for pipelines with a free span segment is much smaller than that for pipelines without a free span segment the first reason for this is that the axial thermal expansion for pipeline with a free span segment is smaller than that for pipeline without a free span segment as shown in fig 13 b the second reason of this is that three buckled lobes one lobe in the negative direction and two lobes in the positive direction form for pipeline with a free span segment while only one lobe forms in the positive direction for pipeline without a free span segment see fig 10 the relationships between temperature difference and maximum axial compressive stresses with different half free span lengths are shown in fig 12 both the maximum axial compressive stresses σ m 1 and σ m 2 increase with increasing temperature difference morever under the same temperature difference the maximum axial compressive stress σ m 1 in the middle of the free span increases significantly with increasing free span length while the maximum axial compressive stress σ m 2 decreases the reason of the increase of σ m 1 with increasing free span length is that the maximum bending stress induced by the maximum bending moment in the middle of the span increases see fig 10 b even though the stress induced by axial compressive force decreases see fig 13 a with increasing free span length the reason of the decrease of σ m 2 with increasing free span length is that the maximum bending stress induced by the maximum bending moment decreases see fig 10 b and the stress induced by axial compressive force also decreases see fig 13 a from fig 12 a for smaller half free span length such as l 1 10 m the maximum axial compressive stress σ m 1 in the middle of the span is smaller than that for pipelines without a free span segment under the same temperature difference however when the half free span length is large enough such as l 1 12 5 m the maximum axial compressive stress σ m 1 is larger than that for pipeline without a free span segment under the same temperature difference from fig 12 b it is clear to see that maximum axial compressive stress σ m 2 is smaller than that for pipelines without a free span segment so it is safer for the pipeline to rest on a span with smaller half free span length triggering upheaval buckling with three lobes however the pipeline will be more dangerous compared to the case without a free span segment when it is suspended on a free span with large enough free span length 3 3 3 detailed analysis on t m w m and σ m now a more detailed parametric analysis about the influence of half free span length on the normalised minimum critical temperature difference is presented in fig 14 the values of minimum critical temperature difference shown in fig 14 are normalised against the value of minimum critical temperature difference for pipeline without span the normalised minimum critical temperature difference decreases with the increase of half free span length its decreasing rate increases with increasing half free span length from fig 14 the normalised minimum critical temperature difference is larger than one for l 1 l 1 a which indicates that the minimum critical temperature difference for pipelines with span is larger than that for pipeline without span so upheaval buckling of pipelines without span tends to form one buckled lobe however for l 1 l 1 a the normalised minimum critical temperature difference reduces to smaller than one which means that the minimum critical temperature difference for pipeline with span is smaller than that for pipelines without span so upheaval buckling of pipelines with span tends to form three buckled lobes finally the conclusion is that the pipelines with a suspended section are prone to upheaval buckling to form three buckled lobes for large free span length the influence of half free span length on the normalised displacement amplitude and normalised maximum axial compressive stress is shown in fig 15 they are all normalised against the values of the case without free span from fig 15 a the normalised displacement amplitude w m 1 in the middle of the free span increases with increasing half free span length while the normalised displacement amplitude w m 2 beyond the free span decreases with increasing half free span length both w m 1 and w m 2 are smaller than one for all the values of the half free span length this means that all the displacement amplitudes for pipeline with a free span segment are smaller than that for pipeline without a free span segment from fig 15 b the normalised maximum axial compressive stress σ m 2 beyond the span decreases slightly with increasing half free span length but the normalised maximum axial compressive stress σ m 1 in the middle of the free span increases significantly with increasing half free span length its value is smaller than one for l 1 l 1 a however its value increases to larger than one for l 1 l 1 a so the maximum axial compressive stress σ m 1 for pipelines with l 1 l 1 a is smaller than that for pipelines without span while σ m 1 for pipeline with l 1 l 1 a is larger than that for pipeline without free span so the pipelines will be more dangerous for large enough free span length during the post buckling stage compared to the case for pipeline without span from fig 15 b the values of normalised σ m 1 and σ m 2 are the same at l 1 l 1 b the value of normalised σ m 1 is larger than that of normalised σ m 2 for l 1 l 1 b while it s smaller than that of normalised σ m 2 for l 1 l 1 b so the maximum axial compressive stress locates at the middle of the free span for l 1 l 1 b and locates beyond the free span for l 1 l 1 b so it s necessary to calculate the values of σ m 1 and σ m 2 during the design process 3 3 4 touchdown effect in this section the effect of touchdown on the post upheaval buckling behaviour is discussed in detail the previous analysis has shown that the displacement amplitude within the span locates in the middle of the free span so the pipeline section in the middle of the free span will touch down the bottom of the free span firstly during upheaval buckling when the displacement amplitude within the free span reaches the depth of the free span denoted as h afterwards the touchdown point at the bottom of the span will be constrained by the seabed so the corresponding boundary conditions in the middle of the free span will change firstly the displacement in the middle of the free span will be kept constant and equal to the depth of the free span due to the constraint of the bottom of the free span secondly the slope of the deflection in the middle of the free span should be zero due to symmetry finally the shear force is not constant due to the concentrated contact force in the middle of the free span therefore the boundary conditions in the middle of the free span should be modified as 17 w 1 l 2 h d w 1 d x l 2 0 then using the boundary conditions listed in eq 17 combined with all the other boundary conditions and continuous conditions in section 2 the same methods and procedures as the case without touchdown can be applied to obtain the solutions for upheaval buckling with the consideration of the touchdown effect all the results of the touchdown effect on the post buckling behaviours are shown in fig 16 and fig 17 the effect of touchdown on displacement amplitudes is shown in fig 16 the pipeline will follow the path of no touchdown i e m a before the displacement amplitude in the middle of the free span w m 1 reaches the depth of the free span as shown in fig 16 a however when the pipeline touches the seabed taking h 0 5 m as an example the buckling path will follow the path a a 1 with increasing temperature difference the displacement amplitude w m 1 keeps constant after the touchdown point due to the restriction of the bottom of the free span the maximum axial compressive stress in the middle of the span σ m 1 will also follow the path a a 1 to develop after the touchdown point as shown in fig 17 a this shows that with increasing temperature difference the maximum axial compressive stress in the middle of the span σ m 1 firstly decreases rapidly after the touchdown point the reason of which is that the deflection around the touchdown point is more benign leading to smaller bending stress then it increases slightly with further increasing temperature difference from fig 17 a σ m 1 decreases significantly with decreasing depth of free span under the same temperature difference so a good strategy to decrease the maximum stress within the free span is to reduce the depth of the free span when upheaval buckling occurs for subsea pipelines with a free span segment from fig 16 b it is clear to see that the displacement amplitude beyond the free span w m 2 becomes larger after the touchdown point namely point a compared to the no touchdown case it increases slightly with decreasing depth of the free span the reason is that the more thermal expansion will feed into the deflection in the positive direction since the deflection in the negative direction within the free span is restricted by the bottom of the free span at the same time the maximum axial compressive stress beyond the free span σ m 2 will also increase after the touchdown point compared to the no touchdown case both w m 2 and σ m 2 increase with decreasing depth of free span under the same temperature difference after the pipeline touches the bottom of the free span 4 conclusions analytical solutions of upheaval buckling were derived for subsea pipelines with a free span section first the accurate locations of displacement amplitudes and extrema of axial compressive stress were obtained the comparisons between different extrema of axial compressive stress and displacement amplitudes were carried out to determine which of them is the largest stress and displacement then the influence of free span length on buckled configuration and post buckling behaviour was analysed a detailed parametric analysis was performed to investigate the influence of free span length on minimum critical temperature displacement amplitudes and maximum axial compressive stresses finally the effect of the touchdown is discussed from the parametric analyses the following conclusions can be drawn i the maximum axial compressive stress will locate in the middle of the free span for large free span length at relative low temperature difference while it will locate beyond the free span at relative high temperature difference or for small free span length so it is necessary to calculate both the values of the maximum axial compressive stresses within and beyond the free span in the post buckling analysis ii the deformed shapes and the corresponding bending stresses within the span are affected significantly by the free span length the displacement amplitude and the extremum of bending stress in the middle of the free span increase significantly while the rest of them beyond the free span decrease slightly with increasing free span length iii the minimum critical temperature difference decreases with increasing free span length both the stable and unstable branches exist for small free span length while the unstable branch disappears for large enough free span length iv the pipeline is safer to rest on a span with small free span length to form the buckled shape with three lobes compared to the case without free span to form the buckled shape with only one lobe it is more dangerous for the pipeline with too large free span length during the post buckling stage v the maximum stress within the free span decreases significantly while the maximum stress beyond the free span increases slightly with decreasing depth of the free span after the pipeline touches the bottom of the free span so an available way to reduce the maximum stress within the span is to reduce the depth of the span making the buckled pipeline touch the bottom of the free span credit

21339,a submerged floating tunnel sft is a promising alternative to conventional bridges and tunnels and can be potentially built in the qiongzhou strait in china however this area is under the threat of disasters including mega tsunamis and severe storm surges to evaluate the hydrodynamic loads of the sft in this hazardous zone subject to severe tsunami and typhoon impacts the delft3d flow hydrodynamic model and swan wave model are coupled and a computational fluid dynamics cfd method is adopted the maximum probable tsunami and typhoon rammasun july 2014 are selected as hazard assessment conditions in the qiongzhou strait whether the tsunami and hindcast storm surge cause extreme forcing and bring challenges to the sft engineering design operation and maintenance in the qiongzhou strait are discussed in this study we reveal that the typhoon impacts are more devastating than tsunami for an sft in the qiongzhou strait in order to determine the optimal sft cross section under extreme events we use a parametric bezier curve profile compared with two simpler shapes including circular and elliptical cross sections in line force and lift are respectively applied to evaluate the sft s hydrodynamic behaviour our results reveal that the gross horizontal force on the parametric bezier curve shape is more sensitive to flow acceleration while the circular cross section is dominated by current speed the parametric bezier curve cross section shape has the preferable property of reducing the in line force and postponing serious vortex shedding compared with the two simpler shapes keywords storm surge tsunami extreme events submerged floating tunnel delft3d flow cfd 1 introduction the submerged floating tunnel sft is a novel sea crossing infrastructure moored afloat from the seafloor with the advantage of shortened travel distance increased environmental adaptability and reduced construction cost compared with traditional alternatives such as immersed tunnels bored tunnels and bridges fig 1 a potential sft construction site the qiongzhou strait fig 2 located between hainan island and leizhou peninsula guangdong in the south china sea scs is subject to extreme events zhang et al 2010 jiang et al 2018 the sft is at risk of damage due to current and wave actions internal flooding and submergence extreme hydraulic events further exacerbate the structural vulnerability the qiongzhou strait is located approximately 1000 km away from the manila trench and is conceivably threatened by a manila trench tsunami the manila trench and the north fault system are identified as being the most likely sources to generate mega submarine earthquake tsunamis in the scs and adjacent areas michel et al 2001 research about earthquake tsunami generation along the manila trench has been conducted over the past two decades wu and huang 2009 generated a hypothetical tsunami scenario from the manila trench and performed tsunami run up and inundation simulations around taiwan liu et al 2009 discussed the characteristics of tsunamis generated by earthquakes along the manila subduction zone and proposed an early warning system for the scs region hong nguyen et al 2014 assessed the impact of a manila trench tsunami on the vietnamese coast using the comcot model zhao et al 2017 discussed a range of potential tsunami source magnitudes in the manila trench and analysed the tsunami impacts near haikou ren et al 2017 investigated the potential extreme hazard of the manila trench and the impacts on hainan island taiwan island and lingding bay as one of the most devastating natural coastal disasters tsunamis frequently occur and caused approximately 250 000 casualties and us 280 billion in economic losses during the past twenty years devastating tsunami damages characterized by human fatalities and infrastructure failures have increased over the previous two decades imamura et al 2019 bernard and titov 2015 thus assessing large scale tsunami impact in the qiongzhou strait is important for hazard mitigation and tsunami warning capacity improvement is needed for intensive growth of infrastructure and critical engineering facilities such as an sft in this region storm surges are also catastrophic natural disasters for marine and coastal zones storm surge is an abnormal sea level rise driven by physical mechanisms including the inverse barometer pressure effect setup wind induced setup and breaking wave setup brickeret al 2014 the northwest pacific basin holds the highest tropical storm surge frequency and intensity occurrence in the world with approximately 26 9 events annually guangdong and hainan where the qiongzhou strait is located are particularly vulnerable to catastrophic typhoon strikes biu liu et al 2001 moreover the frequency of tropical storm surges and coastal floods in the coastal areas of china over the past 65 years has risen significantly amongst the coastal provinces guangdong suffered the most storm surge events while hainan ranked fourth for storm surge frequency shi et al 2015 the losses caused by storm surges accounted for over 75 of total economic losses an annual average of more than cny 3 9 billion in these tropical coastal provinces shi et al 2015 however little is known about the effects of cross oceanic tsunami and typhoon related strait hydrodynamics on the sft risk and vulnerability assessment due to tsunami and typhoon hazards on an sft in this region had not yet been conducted in this study the worst case tsunami scenario along the manila trench and super typhoon rammasun 2014 are selected as the extreme scenarios to better understand hydrodynamic performance of the sft under the tsunami and storm surge we ask 1 how to determine the typical wave and current input conditions for the sft analysis under these extreme cases 2 which sft cross section shape is favourable and should be adopted for locations subject to extreme events and 3 what is the effect of storm surge and tsunami on an sft to address these questions first descriptions of the selected scenarios and potential sft application sites are depicted in section 2 and the modelling methods are then expanded in section 3 in section 4 tsunami and storm surge model validations are conducted finally the wave and current characteristics induced by extreme events at the optimal sft construction location in the qiongzhou strait are addressed in section 5 along with detailed discussions about the optimal sft cross section geometry and hydrodynamic characteristics 2

optimal sft heading line line v are emphasized in the evaluation of the sft cross section forcing 3 2 model configuration the geographic extent of the model domain ranges from 105 e 26 n to 126 e 10 n three nested grids referred to as grid 1 grid 2 and grid 3 are adopted with spherical coordinates the finest grid covers the qiongzhou strait to obtain the flow and wave conditions fig 5 detailed grid information is shown in table 3 a 0 5 s computational time step for a duration of 12 h is applied in the tsunami simulation in the storm surge simulation a 1 s computational time step is selected for the storm surge model which is coupled with a stationary swan wave simulation every 60 min wind stress and tidal forcing are added to run the simulation from 0 00 on july 14 to 0 00 on july 20 3 3 cross section geometry most sft cross sections have been designed with a circular shape lin et al 2019 jin and kim 2020 deng et al 2020 primarily due to the superior hydrodynamic and blast load behaviour compared with a rectangular shape gang et al 2018 kristoffersen et al 2019 an elliptical cross section has more streamlined hydrodynamic behaviour experiencing smaller displacement and less stress than circular and rectangular shapes li and jiang 2016 mandara et al 2016 however in this study in order to minimize the transverse force and continuously improve the streamlined shape we use an airfoil geometry parameterization method based on the bézier parsec bp curve to describe the sft cross section combining the merits of the bézier curve with parsec variables chen et al 2019 christie et al 2019 derksen and rogalsky 2010 in order to determine the optimal sft cross section the hydrodynamic performance of this parametric bézier curve profile is tested and compared with the simpler circular and elliptical shapes under the tsunami impact the detailed parametric bézier curve information the definitions of b y t r is described in kharal and saleem 2012 zou et al 2020 in this study we choose the bezier parameters b 1 5 m r 0 5 m and y t 4 m to design the sft cross section as per the current technical standards and feasibility studies muhammad et al 2017 aashto 2018 the cross section must provide sufficient space for traffic evacuation ventilation ballast inspection and other services and utilities in order to fix the shape parameters for comparison sft cross sections with lateral and vertical clearances of h 5 m and w 11 m respectively as required by road tunnel construction guidelines is selected for the hydrodynamic analysis of all the three shapes fig 6 the semi minor axis of elliptical shape is 4 m to keep the same vertical clearance as the parametric bezier curve sft profile 3 4 forces on the submerged floating tunnel the cfd code ansys fluent v19 1 is applied to conduct field scale simulations of the sft by solving the rans equations using a finite volume discretization scheme considering the different hydrodynamic performance of the sft under tsunami and typhoon impacts the computational domain is different for each case 3 4 1 governing equations the tsunami affects the sft by generating strong currents strong acceleration of these currents causes the sft boundary layer to alternate between laminar and turbulent flow and inertial forces on the sft are significant to resolve these processes a transient simulation is conducted with the transition sst shear stress transport turbulence model which has been validated to accurately predict the laminar to turbulent transition process langtry and menter 2009 previous studies show the reliability of this turbulence model at both low and high reynolds numbers wauters and degroote 2018 pawar and brizzolara 2019 xu et al 2018 the transition sst model is based on coupling of the sst k ω transport equations with the intermittency and momentum thickness reynolds number transport equations for the transition onset criterion the intermittency factor used to describe transition development is computed by additional transport equations in the form of eq 2 2 t ρ γ x j ρ γ u j x j μ μ t σ γ γ x j p γ 1 e γ 1 p γ 2 e γ 2 t ρ r e θ t x j ρ r e θ t u j x j σ θ t μ μ t r e θ t x j

is upstream flow velocity γ is intermittency μ is viscosity μ t is eddy viscosity and ρ is fluid density detailed formulations of the transition sst model are given in reference coder and maughmer 2013 for the storm surge case however strong flow acceleration is not observed in the qiongzhou strait as per section 5 2 hence the inertial force of the sft can be neglected in order to achieve a conservative hydrodynamic force evaluation for the sft a worst case scenario of the maximum current velocity and wave height is applied at the numerical inlet the reynolds number of the sft cross section is on the order of 107 therefore a fully turbulent model can be used the rng k ε model is applied at high reynolds numbers and is more accurate and reliable for a wider class of flows than the standard k ε model jeong et al 2002 it more accurately simulates blunt geometry and flow separation with an additional term in the ε equation and an analytical formula for the turbulent prandtl number the rng k ε model transport equation can be expressed as eq 3 3 t ρ k x i ρ k u i x j α k μ e f f k x j g k g b ρ ε y m s k t ρ ε x i ρ ε u i x j α ε μ e f f ε x j c 1 ε ε k g k c 3 ε g b c 2 ε ρ ε 2

dissipation rate g k and g b are generation terms y m is the contribution of the fluctuating dilatation of compressible turbulence to the overall dissipation rate α k and α ε are inverse effective prandtl numbers s k and s ε are source terms the additional term in the ε equation is given by eq 4 4 r ε c μ ρ η 3 1 η η 0 1 β η 3 ε 2 k where η s k ε η 0 4 38 and β 0 012 the turbulent viscosity is computed by combining k and ε as eq 5 5 μ t ρ c μ k 2 ε where c μ 0 085 the volume of fluid vof method hirt and nichols 1981 is adopted to track the air water interface this method is accomplished by the solution of a continuity equation for the volume fraction σ of the ith phase the volume fraction equation is obtained with eq 6 and the fluid viscosity μ and density ρ in each grid cell are reconstructed by volume phase averaging with eq 7 8 6 σ i t σ i v i 0 7 ρ i 1 n σ i ρ i 8 μ i 1 n σ i μ i where σ is the volume fraction of the ith phase and v i is the velocity of the ith phase fifth order stokes wave theory fenton 1985 is used for nonlinear wave generation at the inlet open channel wave boundary the generalized expression for fifth order stokes waves is given by eqs 9 and 10 9 ζ x t 1 k i 1 5 j 1 i b i j k h 2 i cos j α 10 α k x x k y y ω e t ε the generalized expression for the associated velocity potential is defined as eq 11 11 φ x t 1 k g k tanh k h 1 2 i 1 5 k h 2 i j 1

heading angle 3 4 2 computational domains for the tsunami a time series of flow speed during the 12 h tsunami simulation period is applied at the inlet boundary a transient analysis with a symmetrical in the vertical computational domain is adopted the computational domain is 400 m in length and 100 m in height fig 7 a the distances from the inlet and outlet boundaries to the sft cross section center are 100 m and 300 m respectively a zero reference pressure and zero gradient condition for velocity are employed at the pressure outlet boundary a no slip hydraulically smooth wall condition is applied to the sft cross section surface for the upper and lower boundaries symmetry free slip is used to avoid wall effects multiple grid sizes were used to evaluate grid independence in zou et al 2020 the computational domain comprises three regions as illustrated in fig 7 a the first region a high quality unstructured mesh is generated around the sft cross section and an inflation tool is used to generate 40 layers of quadrangular cells covering the boundary layer of the sft surface the first grid layer cell size normal to the sft cross section surface is 3 10 5 m with a growth rate of 1 2 resulting in y around 1 fig 7 c the cell size parallel to the surface is 0 01 m the second region the 4 zones around the first region have a grid resolution of 0 5 m the third region a structured mesh with a grid resolution of 1 m is applied in the rest of the domain the total number of cells in this model is about 300 000 the piso pressure implicit with splitting of operators algorithm is used for pressure velocity coupling the cfd simulation runs for the full tsunami generation and propagation process of 12 h a high performance computing hpc cluster is used to run parallel computation tasks since wind induced wave effects need to be considered in the storm surge case a numerical open channel wave flume is established the computational domain is 400 m in length and 140 m in height allowing 9 wavelengths to propagate in the numerical flume fig 7 b the water depth is 100 m based on the topography of the optimal sft heading in the qiongzhou strait the height of the air phase is 40 m the sft is submerged at a depth of generally 30 50 m below the free surface as per the feasibility studies and relevant research to date with the consideration of reducing surface wave impacts and meeting navigation requirements il seo et al 2015 kunisu 2010 herein an sft submergence depth of 40 m is adopted from section 5 2 the maximum current acceleration is below 8 10 5 m s2 during the storm surge simulation indicating the inertial force due to storm surge induced current acting on the sft can be neglected in order to simulate the most unfavorable condition a combined steady current and wave condition is applied from the results of section 5 2 an open channel wave boundary condition with wave height h 4 8 m and wave length l 45 m coupled with a mean current speed of 1 65 m s are specified at the inlet boundary 5th order stokes wave theory with an ursell number of 0 0097 is applied to depict the wave profile the wave and current propagate in the same direction left to right zero reference pressure is employed at the open channel pressure outlet and the top boundary in the air region to avoid back flow into the domain a hydraulically smooth no slip wall condition is applied on the sft cross section surface and at the bottom boundary the grid is almost the same as tsunami case except for two differences 1 since the reynolds number in the storm surge study is higher than the tsunami case and each case uses a different turbulence model in order to meet the required y the first grid layer length normal to the sft cross section surface is 1 10 3 m 2 a fine grid near the free surface and higher order discretization are applied to reduce numerical dissipation of waves the grid resolution near the free surface covers 100 nodes per wave height and 45 nodes per wave length this local refinement sufficiently captures the wave profile as per previous studies tian et al 2019 li and zhang 2019 the total number of cells in this model is 473 252 after mesh refinement a 400s simulation is performed and the last 100s of data in which the force oscillation is stable is used for force analysis 4 model validation 4 1 tsunami case modelled surface elevations at several locations from ren et al 2017 are used to validate our results fig 8 shows our simulated tsunami surface levels and phases are in close agreement with ren et al 2017 s model in general mesh precision differences and steep topography near the coastal regions may cause slight deviation of the peak values at sanya kaoshiung and shantou fig 9 shows the tsunami propagation at several times near the qiongzhou strait the tsunami wave first hits the south eastern shore of hainan island at around 2 h and thereafter refracts around hainan island into two separate parts one propagates from north eastern hainan island into the qiongzhou strait and another bypasses south western hainan island into the beibu gulf the onset of tsunami waves in the qiongzhou strait appears at 4 h and the confluence of the two waves occurs at 6 5 h near north western hainan island the arrival time and temporal variation of tsunami amplitude around the qiongzhou strait agree with ren et al 2017 indicating the robustness and reliability of our results 4 2 typhoon case in order to verify our results two simulations are carried out one contains only astronomical tidal forcing and the other is comprised of tidal forcing plus the meteorological forcing from the typhoon to compute the total storm tide elevations here during typhoon rammasun the measured data of tidal station xiuying fig 3 which is located in the qiongzhou strait is utilised to validate model results the model results of wang et al 2017 are also used for comparison fig 10 a shows the validation results for astronomic tides at xiuying 110 34 e 20 05 n even though the simulated results show a positive bias of 16 cm at the maximum surface elevation the astronomical tides are generally consistent with wang et al 2017 s model results and t tide harmonic analysis the storm tide elevation during typhoon rammasun in xiuying is shown in fig 10 b typhoon rammasun crossed over the qiongzhou strait during high tide the maximum water elevation storm tide is almost 2 m above mean sea level the peak storm tide is underestimated by 20 cm in our model whereas wang et al 2017 s model underestimated observed data by approximately 40 cm both our model and wang et al 2017 predicted the highest storm tide about 3 h earlier than observed since the best track data for the storm is reported at 6 h intervals the meteorological input data cannot be expected to produce a result more accurate than this as the storm location and propagation speed is not constant during the 6 h between reported track times therefore our results show less discrepancy with observations than wang et al 2017 does indicating a reasonable and reliable storm surge simulation and confirming the capacity of the model 5 results and discussion 5 1 tsunami characteristics in the qiongzhou strait to investigate the tsunami characteristics in the qiongzhou strait the maximum water elevation at each grid cell during the entire 12 h simulation is shown in fig 11 a generally water elevations decrease from the east at around 2 m to the west at less than 1 m in the qiongzhou strait throughout the simulation our results show that the qiongzhou strait is sheltered by hainan island preventing the devastating inundation that could occur in hainan guangdong taiwan and hong kong wu and huang 2009 ren et al 2017 since the optimal sft heading is generally transverse to the strait the components of current speed and wave direction parallel to the strait heading are most relevant for evaluation of the sft cross section hydraulic performance fig 11 b shows the maximum east west current speed induced by the tsunami in the qiongzhou strait in most of the qiongzhou strait the current speed is less than 1 m s the current direction is generally east west moving between the beibu gulf and the northern scs since the tsunami is unsteady the time varying current speed and inflow acceleration may change dramatically and hence may cause large drag and inertial forces on the sft compared with the local astronomical tide jeopardizing the sft structure and mooring system to assess the effect of this east west reversing tsunami current on the sft the current in the qiongzhou strait is extracted for the simulation of forces on the sft fig 12 a shows the depth averaged along strait current speed at the seven gauges fig 3 in the qiongzhou strait during the tsunami simulation note that it takes 4 2 h for the first tsunami wave to arrive at the sft site the first current peak occurs at 4 8 h with a maximum speed of 0 6 m s in the westward direction however the largest current speed occurs at around 11 3 h flowing from west to east with a maximum speed of 0 9 m s generally gauge 7 records the most severe current speed variation so is used for further sft hydrodynamic analysis fig 12 b shows the current speed and flow acceleration at gauge 7 it should be noted that the peak values of flow speed and acceleration do not occur simultaneously the largest flow acceleration magnitude is 6 10 4 m s2 in the westward direction at 4 5 h 5 2 storm surge characteristics in the qiongzhou strait fig 13 shows the spatial distribution of maximum water level storm tide in the qiongzhou strait during the typhoon simulation typhoon rammasun passed over north eastern hainan island with a counterclockwise wind field these effects were conductive to the sea water rising rapidly to the east of the qiongzhou strait and piling up along the coasts especially near the leizhou peninsula and northeastern hainan island the maximum water level on the eastern coast of the leizhou peninsula reached over 3 m however due to the sheltering effect of the leizhou peninsula and hainan island and additionally the gradually weakened strength of rammasun when it crossed over the qiongzhou strait the maximum water elevation in the strait was less than 2 m dropping rapidly to the west the current speed and wave direction transverse to the sft are extracted for hydraulic performance analysis as illustrated in fig 14 a the maximum absolute value of depth averaged flow speed observed in gauge 3 in the x direction is 1 65 m s westward the peak value occurred at 6 00 9 00 on july 18 at different virtual flow gauges along the optimal sft heading this is consistent with the time of the peak storm tide level fig 10 b however unlike the tsunami the maximum current acceleration of the typhoon storm surge is below 8 10 5 m s2 resulting in the drag force dominating the in line forces of the sft with negligible inertia force however the vertical distribution of wind driven flow is complex in order to evaluate the sft hydraulic forcing accurately the current speed input to the inlet boundary of the cfd program should be carefully examined therefore a three dimensional delft3d flow hydrodynamic model with 10 uniform vertical sigma layers forced by the same conditions as the two dimensional typhoon rammasun model above is adopted and compared fig 14 c shows the current speed in x direction at 40 m below the surface the sft submergence depth is around 1 64 m s which is nearly equal to the 1 65 m s depth averaged flow speed from the two dimensional model hence using the depth averaged current speed is sufficient for sft force analysis fig 15 shows the typhoon induced wind velocity magnitude fields superimposed on wind speed vectors the sft cross section is affected by wave induced orbital velocities normal to the tunnel tube rather than the component parallel to the tunnel to obtain the component of the wave induced orbital velocity vector normal to the tube the orbital velocity vector is multiplied by the sine of the angle between the velocity vector and the sft heading since orbital velocities are proportional to the wave height we determine the wave height using the corresponding x component of the orbital velocities the wave height at the seven virtual wave gauges on the optimal sft heading is illustrated in fig 14 b at 10 00 on july 18 the typhoon eye entered the strait accompanied by low wind speed resulting in low wave height in the qiongzhou strait as typhoon rammasun moved north westward at 14 00 on july 18 the wind speed in the strait dramatically increased the maximum wind speed at gauge 3 110 164 e 20 132 n increased to around 30 m s and westerly wind dominated the strait thus the wave height increased the wave height reached its maximum value of 4 8 m with a corresponding wave period of 5 08 s the sheltering effect of hainan island reduces the wave height and wave period in the strait compared to the open sea after the typhoon crossed over the strait entered beibu gulf and made landfall in guangxi province the wind intensity and wave height continuously decreased 5 3 tsunami impacts on the sft fig 16 a shows the temporal variation of in line force combined drag and inertial force during the tsunami simulation with different sft cross sections the maximum in line force on all cross sectional shapes occurs at around 11 3 h which is the same time as the peak inlet current speed fig 12 b for the parametric bezier curve shape the maximum in line force is 200 n m which is half that of the elliptical sft cross section however the circular cross section shape experiences a maximum in line force of 1700 n m which is over 8 times the force on the parametric bezier curve cross section in addition to this the times of peak in line force are not the same for all shapes for the parametric bezier curve shape the first negative and positive maxima of inline force occur at around 4 5 h and 5 5 h respectively which are almost identical to the times of local peaks in acceleration fig 12 b indicating dominance of the inertia force however for the circular cross section the first negative and positive maxima of inline force occur at around 4 8 h and 6 0 h respectively fig 12 b indicating dominance of the drag force the elliptical cross section displays a phase between the other two shapes therefore the in line force on the elliptical sft is a combined effect of inertial and drag forces fig 16 b shows the lift force during the tsunami simulation for different sft cross sections the results indicate that severe vortex shedding occurs at about 11 h for the parametric bezier curve shape while it shows vortex shedding beginning before 10 h for the ellipse the circular cross section experiences a larger lift force than the other shapes and vortex shedding begins just after the tsunami reaches the sft heading in the qiongzhou strait it should also be noted that the vortex shedding frequency of the circular sft is higher than that of the other two sft cross sections fig 17 shows time averaged velocity contours for the three different sft cross sections the parametric bezier curve profile fig 17 c is the most streamlined shape with the furthest downstream separation point and the smallest wake region thereby mitigating the in line force on the sft this shape also experiences a maximum velocity lower than the other two cross section shapes resulting in a pressure more uniformly distributed along the sft surface 5 4 typhoon impacts on the sft section 5 3 shows that the parametric bezier curve sft cross section has more favourable hydrodynamic performance than simpler shapes therefore the parametric bezier curve sft cross section is adopted for storm surge impact analysis fig 18 a shows time series of in line force and lift force on the sft in the typhoon scenario the maximum in line force on the sft is approximately 2500 n m whereas maximum lift is 4000 n m the in line force and lift have the same fluctuation period of about 4 3 s driven by the combined wave and current forcing at the inlet of the ansys fluent simulation the in line force lags behind the lift with a phase difference as expected for orbital flow induced by progressive surface waves fig 19 presents velocity contours around the sft cross section at t 400 s in the water phase the velocity near the wave crest is high whereas below the wave trough it is low the velocity field is distorted near the sft to better understand the differences of the wave and current impacts on the sft a simulation with only current no wave is conducted as a comparison the mean current speed remains 1 65 m s the same as in the coupled wave current model the simulation ran for 2500 s and time series of drag and lift during the final 100 s are shown in fig 18 b the maximum drag in this steady flow model is about 1000 n m half that of the wave current case indicating that waves and current contribute equally to the in line force however the lift in the current only model is below 250 n m indicating the waves play a dominant role in lift the large velocity fluctuation at the wave period disrupts the uniform pressure distribution on the upper and lower sft surfaces resulting in an apparent increase of lift in the current only case the drag and lift both fluctuate with a small amplitude at a period of about 6 8 s which is longer than the fluctuation period in the coupled wave current case since the wave height is determined using the corresponding x component of the orbital velocities the inline force of the sft cross section can be accurately calculated however the vertical force due to both the pressure fluctuation and the vertical component of the orbital velocity is underestimated the maximum in line force on the sft in the typhoon case is 12 5 times larger than in the tsunami scenario demonstrating that for an sft in the qiongzhou strait typhoon impacts are more destructive and challenging than tsunami the sft mooring system design and net buoyancy adjustment ability should take these hazards into account 6 conclusion in this paper we calculated the worst case tsunami and hindcast typhoon impacts on hydrodynamic forcing on an sft in the qiongzhou strait in order to determine the optimal sft cross section under extreme events we proposed a parametric bezier curve sft profile and compared the hydrodynamic response with other simpler cross sections the main conclusions are briefly summarized as follows 1 the qiongzhou strait is sheltered by hainan island so is partially spared extreme event hazards the tsunami arrival time at the optimal sft heading is about 4 2 h after an earthquake in the manilla trench the maximum current speed along the strait is 0 9 m s during the hindcast typhoon however maximum current speed along the strait is 1 65 m s 2 considering the in line force components in the tsunami scenario inertia plays an important role in the parametric bezier curve shape while for the circle shape drag dominates the force however in the typhoon case due to the slow variation of the mean current speed from the storm surge not from the waves for which drag and inertia are both important the inertial force can be neglected compared with the drag 3 the sft cross section using the parametric bezier curve profile is recommended due to its streamlined shape and hydraulic force mitigating effects it experiences the minimum in line force and the smallest wake region furthermore serious vortex shedding is limited to a shorter time period and lower amplitude compared with other simpler shapes 4 in the typhoon scenario the wave and current provide an approximately equal contribution to the in line force however the waves play a dominant role in lift 5 the typhoon is more devastating than the tsunami for an sft in the qiongzhou strait the maximum in line force on the sft in the typhoon case is 12 5 times higher than in the tsunami scenario the necessity and importance of hazard assessment and structural vulnerability in typhoon scenarios should be emphasized throughout the processes of engineering design construction operation and maintenance of an sft the present study investigated forces on an sft cross section under extreme events additional research is required to further analyze the sft dynamic and structural response the three dimensional effects of the sft will also be addressed in follow on research credit authorship

21339,a submerged floating tunnel sft is a promising alternative to conventional bridges and tunnels and can be potentially built in the qiongzhou strait in china however this area is under the threat of disasters including mega tsunamis and severe storm surges to evaluate the hydrodynamic loads of the sft in this hazardous zone subject to severe tsunami and typhoon impacts the delft3d flow hydrodynamic model and swan wave model are coupled and a computational fluid dynamics cfd method is adopted the maximum probable tsunami and typhoon rammasun july 2014 are selected as hazard assessment conditions in the qiongzhou strait whether the tsunami and hindcast storm surge cause extreme forcing and bring challenges to the sft engineering design operation and maintenance in the qiongzhou strait are discussed in this study we reveal that the typhoon impacts are more devastating than tsunami for an sft in the qiongzhou strait in order to determine the optimal sft cross section under extreme events we use a parametric bezier curve profile compared with two simpler shapes including circular and elliptical cross sections in line force and lift are respectively applied to evaluate the sft s hydrodynamic behaviour our results reveal that the gross horizontal force on the parametric bezier curve shape is more sensitive to flow acceleration while the circular cross section is dominated by current speed the parametric bezier curve cross section shape has the preferable property of reducing the in line force and postponing serious vortex shedding compared with the two simpler shapes keywords storm surge tsunami extreme events submerged floating tunnel delft3d flow cfd 1 introduction the submerged floating tunnel sft is a novel sea crossing infrastructure moored afloat from the seafloor with the advantage of shortened travel distance increased environmental adaptability and reduced construction cost compared with traditional alternatives such as immersed tunnels bored tunnels and bridges fig 1 a potential sft construction site the qiongzhou strait fig 2 located between hainan island and leizhou peninsula guangdong in the south china sea scs is subject to extreme events zhang et al 2010 jiang et al 2018 the sft is at risk of damage due to current and wave actions internal flooding and submergence extreme hydraulic events further exacerbate the structural vulnerability the qiongzhou strait is located approximately 1000 km away from the manila trench and is conceivably threatened by a manila trench tsunami the manila trench and the north fault system are identified as being the most likely sources to generate mega submarine earthquake tsunamis in the scs and adjacent areas michel et al 2001 research about earthquake tsunami generation along the manila trench has been conducted over the past two decades wu and huang 2009 generated a hypothetical tsunami scenario from the manila trench and performed tsunami run up and inundation simulations around taiwan liu et al 2009 discussed the characteristics of tsunamis generated by earthquakes along the manila subduction zone and proposed an early warning system for the scs region hong nguyen et al 2014 assessed the impact of a manila trench tsunami on the vietnamese coast using the comcot model zhao et al 2017 discussed a range of potential tsunami source magnitudes in the manila trench and analysed the tsunami impacts near haikou ren et al 2017 investigated the potential extreme hazard of the manila trench and the impacts on hainan island taiwan island and lingding bay as one of the most devastating natural coastal disasters tsunamis frequently occur and caused approximately 250 000 casualties and us 280 billion in economic losses during the past twenty years devastating tsunami damages characterized by human fatalities and infrastructure failures have increased over the previous two decades imamura et al 2019 bernard and titov 2015 thus assessing large scale tsunami impact in the qiongzhou strait is important for hazard mitigation and tsunami warning capacity improvement is needed for intensive growth of infrastructure and critical engineering facilities such as an sft in this region storm surges are also catastrophic natural disasters for marine and coastal zones storm surge is an abnormal sea level rise driven by physical mechanisms including the inverse barometer pressure effect setup wind induced setup and breaking wave setup brickeret al 2014 the northwest pacific basin holds the highest tropical storm surge frequency and intensity occurrence in the world with approximately 26 9 events annually guangdong and hainan where the qiongzhou strait is located are particularly vulnerable to catastrophic typhoon strikes biu liu et al 2001 moreover the frequency of tropical storm surges and coastal floods in the coastal areas of china over the past 65 years has risen significantly amongst the coastal provinces guangdong suffered the most storm surge events while hainan ranked fourth for storm surge frequency shi et al 2015 the losses caused by storm surges accounted for over 75 of total economic losses an annual average of more than cny 3 9 billion in these tropical coastal provinces shi et al 2015 however little is known about the effects of cross oceanic tsunami and typhoon related strait hydrodynamics on the sft risk and vulnerability assessment due to tsunami and typhoon hazards on an sft in this region had not yet been conducted in this study the worst case tsunami scenario along the manila trench and super typhoon rammasun 2014 are selected as the extreme scenarios to better understand hydrodynamic performance of the sft under the tsunami and storm surge we ask 1 how to determine the typical wave and current input conditions for the sft analysis under these extreme cases 2 which sft cross section shape is favourable and should be adopted for locations subject to extreme events and 3 what is the effect of storm surge and tsunami on an sft to address these questions first descriptions of the selected scenarios and potential sft application sites are depicted in section 2 and the modelling methods are then expanded in section 3 in section 4 tsunami and storm surge model validations are conducted finally the wave and current characteristics induced by extreme events at the optimal sft construction location in the qiongzhou strait are addressed in section 5 along with detailed discussions about the optimal sft cross section geometry and hydrodynamic characteristics 2 description of selected extreme events and analysis location 2 1 tsunami generated in the manila trench the largest historical tsunamigenic earthquake in the manila trench wu and huang 2009 was simulated as six fault segments acting as one long earthquake source in this study the worst case manila trench source parameters used in our model are proposed by hong nguyen et al 2014 which modifies wu and huang 2009 s model with more precise fault width values by an interpolation method megawatiet al 2009 table 1 shows the hypothetical fault parameters along the manila trench source

island since 1949 super typhoon rammasun 2014 is selected as an extreme event for hydrodynamic assessment of the sft rammasun made first landfall on wenchang hainan at 7 00 utc on july 18 2014 with a maximum wind speed of 60 m s and a minimum pressure of 910 hpa after that rammasun retained super typhoon intensity while crossing the qiongzhou strait and moving north westward it weakened when it entered beibu gulf and dissipated when it made its second landfall in guangxi province on july 19 rammasun is the most devastating typhoon that affected hainan island since 1949 it affected 3 26

fig 3 was recommended as the optimal sft construction heading it is selected for sft hydrodynamic analysis under the tsunami and storm surge impacts in this study seven virtual gauges are set uniformly along this optimal heading to obtain the hydrodynamic conditions in the strait during the simulated events the coordinate of each virtual gauge is listed in table 2 3 methodology 3 1 model

delft3d flow is a widely used prediction tool for tsunami events tidal flows and wind pressure fields yin et al 2020 roeber and bricker 2015 bricker and nakayama 2014 for tsunami simulation the seafloor deformation of a tsunami generating earthquake can be computed by the okada model derived from a green s function solution to the elastic half space problem okada 1992 the static deformation of the seafloor after the oceanic earthquake is then estimated as an initial free surface profile the initial water level of the manila trench tsunami is shown in fig 4 the behaviour of typhoon rammasun is hindcast with track data cam tropical cyclone data spatialized into wind and pressure fields by the holland holland et al 2010 parametric hurricane method which improves the holland 1980 parametric approach by applying wind pressure parameters readily available from hurricane archives empirical relations for central pressure and maximum wind speed are devised by holland 2008 the wind field is asymmetric due to the inflow angle caused by friction here a constant angle of 25 is applied wankang et al 2019 a wind conversion factor of 0 93 is adopted the radius of maximum winds r m is expressed per gross et al 2004 in eq 1 1 r m 35 37 0 111 v m 0 570 ϕ 25 where v m is the maximum wind speed and ϕ is latitude an integrated atmosphere ocean storm surge modelling framework is

when interacting with meteorological forcing caldwell and edmonds 2014 the bathymetry data is taken from the general bathymetric chart of the oceans gebco 2020 in this study large scale tsunami and typhoon models are established respectively to analyze depth averaged flow characteristics in the qiongzhou strait the in line component of the current and wave loads at planes perpendicular to the optimal sft heading line line v are emphasized in the evaluation of the sft cross section forcing 3 2 model configuration the geographic extent of the model domain ranges from 105 e 26 n to 126 e 10 n three nested grids referred to as grid 1 grid 2 and grid 3 are adopted with spherical coordinates the finest grid covers the qiongzhou strait to obtain the flow and wave conditions fig 5 detailed grid

the storm surge model which is coupled with a stationary swan wave simulation every 60 min wind stress and tidal forcing are added to run the simulation from 0 00 on july 14 to 0 00 on july 20 3 3 cross section geometry most sft cross sections have been designed with a circular shape lin et al 2019 jin and kim 2020 deng et al 2020 primarily due to the superior hydrodynamic and blast load behaviour compared with a rectangular shape gang et al 2018 kristoffersen et al 2019 an elliptical cross section has more streamlined hydrodynamic behaviour experiencing smaller displacement and less stress than circular and rectangular shapes li and jiang 2016 mandara et al 2016 however in this study in order to minimize the transverse force and continuously improve the streamlined shape we use an airfoil geometry parameterization method based on the bézier parsec bp curve to describe the sft cross section combining the merits of the bézier curve with parsec variables chen et al 2019 christie et al 2019 derksen and rogalsky 2010 in order to determine the optimal sft cross section the hydrodynamic performance of this parametric bézier curve profile is tested and compared with the simpler circular and elliptical shapes under the tsunami impact the detailed parametric bézier curve information the definitions of b y t r is described in kharal and saleem 2012 zou et al 2020 in this study we choose the bezier parameters b 1 5 m r 0 5 m and y t 4 m to design the sft cross section as per the current technical standards and feasibility studies muhammad et al 2017 aashto 2018 the cross section must provide sufficient space for traffic evacuation ventilation ballast inspection and other services and utilities in order to fix the shape parameters for comparison sft cross sections with lateral and vertical clearances of h 5 m and w 11 m respectively as required by road tunnel construction guidelines is selected for the hydrodynamic analysis of all the three shapes fig 6 the semi minor axis of elliptical shape is 4 m to keep the same vertical clearance as the parametric bezier curve sft profile 3 4 forces on the submerged floating tunnel the cfd code ansys fluent v19 1 is applied to conduct field scale simulations of the sft by solving the rans equations using a finite volume discretization scheme considering the different hydrodynamic performance of the sft under tsunami and typhoon impacts the computational domain is different for each case 3 4 1 governing equations the tsunami affects the sft by generating strong currents strong acceleration of these currents causes the sft boundary layer to alternate between laminar and turbulent flow and inertial forces on the sft are significant to resolve these processes a transient simulation is conducted with the transition sst shear stress transport turbulence model which has been validated to accurately predict the laminar to turbulent transition process langtry and menter 2009 previous studies show the reliability of this turbulence model at both low and high reynolds numbers wauters and degroote 2018 pawar and brizzolara 2019 xu et al 2018 the transition sst model is based on coupling of the sst k ω transport equations with the intermittency and momentum thickness reynolds number transport equations for the transition onset criterion the intermittency factor used to describe transition development is computed by additional transport equations in the form of eq 2 2 t ρ γ x j ρ γ u j x j μ μ t σ γ γ x j p γ 1 e γ 1 p γ 2 e γ 2 t ρ r e θ t x j ρ r e θ t u j x j σ θ t μ μ t r e θ t x j

is upstream flow velocity γ is intermittency μ is viscosity μ t is eddy viscosity and ρ is fluid density detailed formulations of the transition sst model are given in reference coder and maughmer 2013 for the storm surge case however strong flow acceleration is not observed in the qiongzhou strait as per section 5 2 hence the inertial force of the sft can be neglected in order to achieve a conservative hydrodynamic force evaluation for the sft a worst case scenario of the maximum current velocity and wave height is applied at the numerical inlet the reynolds number of the sft cross section is on the order of 107 therefore a fully turbulent model can be used the rng k ε model is applied at high reynolds numbers and is more accurate and reliable for a wider class of flows than the standard k ε model jeong et al 2002 it more accurately simulates blunt geometry and flow separation with an additional term in the ε equation and an analytical formula for the turbulent prandtl number the rng k ε model transport equation can be expressed as eq 3 3 t ρ k x i ρ k u i x j α k μ e f f k x j g k g b ρ ε y m s k t ρ ε x i ρ ε u i x j α ε μ e f f ε x j c 1 ε ε k g k c 3 ε g b c 2 ε ρ ε 2

dissipation rate g k and g b are generation terms y m is the contribution of the fluctuating dilatation of compressible turbulence to the overall dissipation rate α k and α ε are inverse effective prandtl numbers s k and s ε are source terms the additional term in the ε equation is given by eq 4 4 r ε c μ ρ η 3 1 η η 0 1 β η 3 ε 2 k where η s k ε η 0 4 38 and β 0 012 the turbulent viscosity is computed by combining k and ε as eq 5 5 μ t ρ c μ k 2 ε where c μ 0 085 the volume of fluid vof method hirt and nichols 1981 is adopted to track the air water interface this method is accomplished by the solution of a continuity equation for the volume fraction σ of the ith phase the volume fraction equation is obtained with eq 6 and the fluid viscosity μ and density ρ in each grid cell are reconstructed by volume phase averaging with eq 7 8 6 σ i t σ i v i 0 7 ρ i 1 n σ i ρ i 8 μ i 1 n σ i μ i where σ is the volume fraction of the ith phase and v i is the velocity of the ith phase fifth order stokes wave theory fenton 1985 is used for nonlinear wave generation at the inlet open channel wave boundary the generalized expression for fifth order stokes waves is given by eqs 9 and 10 9 ζ

heading angle 3 4 2 computational domains for the tsunami a time series of flow speed during the 12 h tsunami simulation period is applied at the inlet boundary a transient analysis with a symmetrical in the vertical computational domain is adopted the computational domain is 400 m in length and 100 m in height fig 7 a the distances from the inlet and outlet boundaries to the sft cross section center are 100 m and 300 m respectively a zero reference pressure and zero gradient condition for velocity are employed at the pressure outlet boundary a no slip hydraulically smooth wall condition is applied to the sft cross section surface for the upper and lower boundaries symmetry free slip is used to avoid wall effects multiple grid sizes were used to evaluate grid independence in zou et al 2020 the computational domain comprises three regions as illustrated in fig 7 a the first region a high quality unstructured mesh is generated around the sft cross section and an inflation tool is used to generate 40 layers of quadrangular cells covering the boundary layer of the sft surface the first grid layer cell size normal to the sft cross section surface is 3 10 5 m with a growth rate of 1 2 resulting in y around 1 fig 7 c the cell size parallel to the surface is 0 01 m the second region the 4 zones around the first region have a grid resolution of 0 5 m the third region a structured mesh with a grid resolution of 1 m is applied in the rest of the domain the total number of cells in this model is about 300 000 the piso pressure implicit with splitting of operators algorithm is used for pressure velocity coupling the cfd simulation runs for the full tsunami generation and propagation process of 12 h a high performance computing hpc cluster is used to run parallel computation tasks since wind induced wave effects need to be considered in the storm surge case a numerical open channel wave flume is established the computational domain is 400 m in length and 140 m in height allowing 9 wavelengths to propagate in the numerical flume fig 7 b the water depth is 100 m based on the topography of the optimal sft heading in the qiongzhou strait the height of the air phase is 40 m the sft is submerged at a depth of generally 30 50 m below the free surface as per the feasibility studies and relevant research to date with the consideration of reducing surface wave impacts and meeting navigation requirements il seo et al 2015 kunisu 2010 herein an sft submergence depth of 40 m is adopted from section 5 2 the maximum current acceleration is below 8 10 5 m s2 during the storm surge simulation indicating the inertial force due to storm surge induced current acting on the sft can be neglected in order to simulate the most unfavorable condition a combined steady current and wave condition is applied from the results of section 5 2 an open channel wave boundary condition with wave height h 4 8 m and wave length l 45 m coupled with a mean current speed of 1 65 m s are specified at the inlet boundary 5th order stokes wave theory with an ursell number of 0 0097 is applied to depict the wave profile the wave and current propagate in the same direction left to right zero reference pressure is employed at the open channel pressure outlet and the top boundary in the air region to avoid back flow into the domain a hydraulically smooth no slip wall condition is applied on the sft cross section surface and at the bottom boundary the grid is almost the same as tsunami case except for two differences 1 since the reynolds number in the storm surge study is higher than the tsunami case and each case uses a different turbulence model in order to meet the required y the first grid layer length normal to the sft cross section surface is 1 10 3 m 2 a fine grid near the free surface and higher order discretization are applied to reduce numerical dissipation of waves the grid resolution near the free surface covers 100 nodes per wave height and 45 nodes per wave length this local refinement sufficiently captures the wave profile as per previous studies tian et al 2019 li and zhang 2019 the total number of cells in this model is 473 252 after mesh refinement a 400s simulation is performed and the last 100s of data in which the force oscillation is stable is used for force analysis 4 model validation 4 1 tsunami case modelled surface elevations at several locations from ren et al 2017 are used to validate our results fig 8 shows our simulated tsunami surface levels and phases are in close agreement with ren et al 2017 s model in general mesh precision differences and steep topography near the coastal regions may cause slight deviation of the peak values at sanya kaoshiung and shantou fig 9 shows the tsunami propagation at several times near the qiongzhou strait the tsunami wave first hits the south eastern shore of hainan island at around 2 h and thereafter refracts around hainan island into two separate parts one propagates from north eastern hainan island into the qiongzhou strait and another bypasses south western hainan island into the beibu gulf the onset of tsunami waves in the qiongzhou strait appears at 4 h and the confluence of the two waves occurs at 6 5 h near north western hainan island the arrival time and temporal variation of tsunami amplitude around the qiongzhou strait agree with ren et al 2017 indicating the robustness and reliability of our results 4 2 typhoon case in order to verify our results two simulations are carried out one contains only astronomical tidal forcing and the other is comprised of tidal forcing plus the meteorological forcing from the typhoon to compute the total storm tide elevations here during typhoon rammasun the measured data of tidal station xiuying fig 3 which is located in the qiongzhou strait is utilised to validate model results the model results of wang et al 2017 are also used for comparison fig 10 a shows the validation results for astronomic tides at xiuying 110 34 e 20 05 n even though the simulated results show a positive bias of 16 cm at the maximum surface elevation the astronomical tides are generally consistent with wang et al 2017 s model results and t tide harmonic analysis the storm tide elevation during typhoon rammasun in xiuying is shown in fig 10 b typhoon rammasun crossed over the qiongzhou strait during high tide the maximum water elevation storm tide is almost 2 m above mean sea level the peak storm tide is underestimated by 20 cm in our model whereas wang et al 2017 s model underestimated observed data by approximately 40 cm both our model and wang et al 2017 predicted the highest storm tide about 3 h earlier than observed since the best track data for the storm is reported at 6 h intervals the meteorological input data cannot be expected to produce a result more accurate than this as the storm location and propagation speed is not constant during the 6 h between reported track times therefore our results show less discrepancy with observations than wang et al 2017 does indicating a reasonable and reliable storm surge simulation and confirming the capacity of the model 5 results and discussion 5 1 tsunami characteristics in the qiongzhou strait to investigate the tsunami characteristics in the qiongzhou strait the maximum water elevation at each grid cell during the entire 12 h simulation is shown in fig 11 a generally water elevations decrease from the east at around 2 m to the west at less than 1 m in the qiongzhou strait throughout the simulation our results show that the qiongzhou strait is sheltered by hainan island preventing the devastating inundation that could occur in hainan guangdong taiwan and hong kong wu and huang 2009 ren et al 2017 since the optimal sft heading is generally transverse to the strait the components of current speed and wave direction parallel to the strait heading are most relevant for evaluation of the sft cross section hydraulic performance fig 11 b shows the maximum east west current speed induced by the tsunami in the qiongzhou strait in most of the qiongzhou strait the current speed is less than 1 m s the current direction is generally east west moving between the beibu gulf and the northern scs since the tsunami is unsteady the time varying current speed and inflow acceleration may change dramatically and hence may cause large drag and inertial forces on the sft compared with the local astronomical tide jeopardizing the sft structure and mooring system to assess the effect of this east west reversing tsunami current on the sft the current in the qiongzhou strait is extracted for the simulation of forces on the sft fig 12 a shows the depth averaged along strait current speed at the seven gauges fig 3 in the qiongzhou strait during the tsunami simulation note that it takes 4 2 h for the first tsunami wave to arrive at the sft site the first current peak occurs at 4 8 h with a maximum speed of 0 6 m s in the westward direction however the largest current speed occurs at around 11 3 h flowing from west to east with a maximum speed of 0 9 m s generally gauge 7 records the most severe current speed variation so is used for further sft hydrodynamic analysis fig 12 b shows the current speed and flow acceleration at gauge 7 it should be noted that the peak values of flow speed and acceleration do not occur simultaneously the largest flow acceleration magnitude is 6 10 4 m s2 in the westward direction at 4 5 h 5 2 storm surge characteristics in the qiongzhou strait fig 13 shows the spatial distribution of maximum water level storm tide in the qiongzhou strait during the typhoon simulation typhoon rammasun passed over north eastern hainan island with a counterclockwise wind field these effects were conductive to the sea water rising rapidly to the east of the qiongzhou strait and piling up along the coasts especially near the leizhou peninsula and northeastern hainan island the maximum water level on the eastern coast of the leizhou peninsula reached over 3 m however due to the sheltering effect of the leizhou peninsula and hainan island and additionally the gradually weakened strength of rammasun when it crossed over the qiongzhou strait the maximum water elevation in the strait was less than 2 m dropping rapidly to the west the current speed and wave direction transverse to the sft are extracted for hydraulic performance analysis as illustrated in fig 14 a the maximum absolute value of depth averaged flow speed observed in gauge 3 in the x direction is 1 65 m s westward the peak value occurred at 6 00 9 00 on july 18 at different virtual flow gauges along the optimal sft heading this is consistent with the time of the peak storm tide level fig 10 b however unlike the tsunami the maximum current acceleration of the typhoon storm surge is below 8 10 5 m s2 resulting in the drag force dominating the in line forces of the sft with negligible inertia force however the vertical distribution of wind driven flow is complex in order to evaluate the sft hydraulic forcing accurately the current speed input to the inlet boundary of the cfd program should be carefully examined therefore a three dimensional delft3d flow hydrodynamic model with 10 uniform vertical sigma layers forced by the same conditions as the two dimensional typhoon rammasun model above is adopted and compared fig 14 c shows the current speed in x direction at 40 m below the surface the sft submergence depth is around 1 64 m s which is nearly equal to the 1 65 m s depth averaged flow speed from the two dimensional model hence using the depth averaged current speed is sufficient for sft force analysis fig 15 shows the typhoon induced wind velocity magnitude fields superimposed on wind speed vectors the sft cross section is affected by wave induced orbital velocities normal to the tunnel tube rather than the component parallel to the tunnel to obtain the component of the wave induced orbital velocity vector normal to the tube the orbital velocity vector is multiplied by the sine of the angle between the velocity vector and the sft heading since orbital velocities are proportional to the wave height we determine the wave height using the corresponding x component of the orbital velocities the wave height at the seven virtual wave gauges on the optimal sft heading is illustrated in fig 14 b at 10 00 on july 18 the typhoon eye entered the strait accompanied by low wind speed resulting in low wave height in the qiongzhou strait as typhoon rammasun moved north westward at 14 00 on july 18 the wind speed in the strait dramatically increased the maximum wind speed at gauge 3 110 164 e 20 132 n increased to around 30 m s and westerly wind dominated the strait thus the wave height increased the wave height reached its maximum value of 4 8 m with a corresponding wave period of 5 08 s the sheltering effect of hainan island reduces the wave height and wave period in the strait compared to the open sea after the typhoon crossed over the strait entered beibu gulf and made landfall in guangxi province the wind intensity and wave height continuously decreased 5 3 tsunami impacts on the sft fig 16 a shows the temporal variation of in line force combined drag and inertial force during the tsunami simulation with different sft cross sections the maximum in line force on all cross sectional shapes occurs at around 11 3 h which is the same time as the peak inlet current speed fig 12 b for the parametric bezier curve shape the maximum in line force is 200 n m which is half that of the elliptical sft cross section however the circular cross section shape experiences a maximum in line force of 1700 n m which is over 8 times the force on the parametric bezier curve cross section in addition to this the times of peak in line force are not the same for all shapes for the parametric bezier curve shape the first negative and positive maxima of inline force occur at around 4 5 h and 5 5 h respectively which are almost identical to the times of local peaks in acceleration fig 12 b indicating dominance of the inertia force however for the circular cross section the first negative and positive maxima of inline force occur at around 4 8 h and 6 0 h respectively fig 12 b indicating dominance of the drag force the elliptical cross section displays a phase between the other two shapes therefore the in line force on the elliptical sft is a combined effect of inertial and drag forces fig 16 b shows the lift force during the tsunami simulation for different sft cross sections the results indicate that severe vortex shedding occurs at about 11 h for the parametric bezier curve shape while it shows vortex shedding beginning before 10 h for the ellipse the circular cross section experiences a larger lift force than the other shapes and vortex shedding begins just after the tsunami reaches the sft heading in the qiongzhou strait it should also be noted that the vortex shedding frequency of the circular sft is higher than that of the other two sft cross sections fig 17 shows time averaged velocity contours for the three different sft cross sections the parametric bezier curve profile fig 17 c is the most streamlined shape with the furthest downstream separation point and the smallest wake region thereby mitigating the in line force on the sft this shape also experiences a maximum velocity lower than the other two cross section shapes resulting in a pressure more uniformly distributed along the sft surface 5 4 typhoon impacts on the sft section 5 3 shows that the parametric bezier curve sft cross section has more favourable hydrodynamic performance than simpler shapes therefore the parametric bezier curve sft cross section is adopted for storm surge impact analysis fig 18 a shows time series of in line force and lift force on the sft in the typhoon scenario the maximum in line force on the sft is approximately 2500 n m whereas maximum lift is 4000 n m the in line force and lift have the same fluctuation period of about 4 3 s driven by the combined wave and current forcing at the inlet of the ansys fluent simulation the in line force lags behind the lift with a phase difference as expected for orbital flow induced by progressive surface waves fig 19 presents velocity contours around the sft cross section at t 400 s in the water phase the velocity near the wave crest is high whereas below the wave trough it is low the velocity field is distorted near the sft to better understand the differences of the wave and current impacts on the sft a simulation with only current no wave is conducted as a comparison the mean current speed remains 1 65 m s the same as in the coupled wave current model the simulation ran for 2500 s and time series of drag and lift during the final 100 s are shown in fig 18 b the maximum drag in this steady flow model is about 1000 n m half that of the wave current case indicating that waves and current contribute equally to the in line force however the lift in the current only model is below 250 n m indicating the waves play a dominant role in lift the large velocity fluctuation at the wave period disrupts the uniform pressure distribution on the upper and lower sft surfaces resulting in an apparent increase of lift in the current only case the drag and lift both fluctuate with a small amplitude at a period of about 6 8 s which is longer than the fluctuation period in the coupled wave current case since the wave height is determined using the corresponding x component of the orbital velocities the inline force of the sft cross section can be accurately calculated however the vertical force due to both the pressure fluctuation and the vertical component of the orbital velocity is underestimated the maximum in line force on the sft in the typhoon case is 12 5 times larger than in the tsunami scenario demonstrating that for an sft in the qiongzhou strait typhoon impacts are more destructive and challenging than tsunami the sft mooring system design and net buoyancy adjustment ability should take these hazards into account 6 conclusion in this paper we calculated the worst case tsunami and hindcast typhoon impacts on hydrodynamic forcing on an sft in the qiongzhou strait in order to determine the optimal sft cross section under extreme events we proposed a parametric bezier curve sft profile and compared the hydrodynamic response with other simpler cross sections the main conclusions are briefly summarized as follows 1 the qiongzhou strait is sheltered by hainan island so is partially spared extreme event hazards the tsunami arrival time at the optimal sft heading is about 4 2 h after an earthquake in the manilla trench the maximum current speed along the strait is 0 9 m s during the hindcast typhoon however maximum current speed along the strait is 1 65 m s 2 considering the in line force components in the tsunami scenario inertia plays an important role in the parametric bezier curve shape while for the circle shape drag dominates the force however in the typhoon case due to the slow variation of the mean current speed from the storm surge not from the waves for which drag and inertia are both important the inertial force can be neglected compared with the drag 3 the sft cross section using the parametric bezier curve profile is recommended due to its streamlined shape and hydraulic force mitigating effects it experiences the minimum in line force and the smallest wake region furthermore serious vortex shedding is limited to a shorter time period and lower amplitude compared with other simpler shapes 4 in the typhoon scenario the wave and current provide an approximately equal contribution to the in line force however the waves play a dominant role in lift 5 the typhoon is more devastating than the tsunami for an sft in the qiongzhou strait the maximum in line force on the sft in the typhoon case is 12 5 times higher than in the tsunami scenario the necessity and importance of hazard assessment and structural vulnerability in typhoon scenarios should be emphasized throughout the processes of engineering design construction operation and maintenance of an sft the present study investigated forces on an sft cross section under extreme events additional research is required to further analyze the sft dynamic and structural response the three dimensional effects of the sft will also be addressed in follow on research credit authorship
