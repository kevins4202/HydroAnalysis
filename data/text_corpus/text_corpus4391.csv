21955,in the present paper the hybrid numerical model sriram et al 2014 is used for the estimation of long wave run up the model is based on the strong coupling between the fully nonlinear potential flow theory fnpt at the far field and navier stokes ns equations in the nearshore the simulations are carried out for the propagation and evolution of the tsunami like waves i e elongated single pulses having a realistic timescale the model is validated from large scale experiments for the wave propagation as well as for run up sriram et al 2016 the numerical simulations are found to agree well with experiments the model capability is shown for two different scenarios over a slope a a rapidly rising tide including surging and spilling breaking and b undular bore formation and its plunging breaking on a beach for the first case the numerical model is also compared with the analytical estimates the second case undular bore breaking over a slope shows the capability of the meshfree method and the requirements of the hybrid model in many of the existing particle based methods dense distribution of particles is required to simulate the rapidly rising tide which is not needed in the present model 1 introduction the extreme wave events such as cyclonic storms coastal storms and tsunamis pose a severe risk to coastal regions these events along with the sea level rise and climate change threaten the very existence of communities that live along the coast predicting and mitigating these threats is essential for disaster mitigation and management in these regions it is necessary to understand these phenomena before taking up any developmental activity in the coastal zone tsunamis are extreme waves generated by an earthquake or any other disturbances on the ocean floor or landmass close to the sea these waves trace its origin to deeper waters and usually travel for very long distances some of the characteristics of a tsunami are long wave periods and tremendous wave heights as they arrive in the nearshore region the behaviour of tsunami waves changes as they propagate from deep water to shallow waters over the years there has been a significant number of tsunami events recorded in many parts of the world our previous encounters with these waves have helped us to understand how they affect the coastal region all of these make the study of these extreme waves an exciting topic for scientists and engineers although tsunamis are often considered in the framework of the nonlinear shallow water theory they may also be affected by dispersive effects when propagating over a long distance the latter may result in disintegration of the initial wave into a series of solitons of smaller period and increase in wave steepness due to exchange of energy see for instance akrish et al 2016 brühl and oumeraci 2016 sriram et al 2016 ezersky et al 2013 herterich and dias 2019 li et al 2019 one of the first models proposed for the laboratory study of the tsunami was a solitary wave a solitary wave has just a crest which makes them look like an elongated pulse signal they are defined with a fixed wave period and wave height these waves were used in synolakis 1986 1987 the experimental results were compared to an in house numerical model the results were used to develop the widely popular analytical expressions for calculating wave run up height on a plane slope it was often observed that during the onset of a tsunami event the shoreline recedes this behaviour is not characteristic of the elongated pulse solitary wave model the receding shoreline phenomena were found to cause an increase in the number of causalities during the recent tsunami events madsen et al 2008 explained the solitary wave paradigm for the tsunami they observed that most of the globally accepted models for tsunamis consist of either solitary wave or cnoidal wave models they noted that even though these formulations are useful for validation and verification of the numerical models the relation between these models and geophysical tsunami was not appropriately established the n wave is another model of tsunami waves tadepalli and synolakis 1994 in comparison to the solitary wave model n wave has a distinctive trough and crest based on the relative shape of the crest and trough the n wave can be symmetric or asymmetric in our studies manoj kumar et al 2017 we observed that a leading trough n wave model could accurately model the receding shoreline phenomenon seen during some of the field observations we also noted that the breaking characteristics and effective run up of both solitary and n wave models were quite different even when they had the same wave height experiments in the model scale analytical formulations and numerical models are some of the most widely used tools when it comes to the study of wave evolution and run up analytical models and empirical models are used for initial assessment of maximum inundation and run up van der meer et al 2016 synolakis 1987 schimmels et al 2016 and sriram et al 2016 used a piston type wavemaker to generate and study the evolution of tsunami in a large scale experimental facility the experiments were carried out at the large wave flume groβer wellenkanal gwk in hannover germany the above papers brought to light the importance of modelling long wave propagation in large scale testing facilities further the run up and inundation of the generated waves were studied using the analytical model developed in didenkulova 2009 it was noted that the run up on a mild slope 1 18 concerning the study was challenging to estimate due to the phenomenon of wave breaking during the run up empirical models have been proposed by the researchers to estimate the run up of tsunami like waves the expressions were developed based on rigorous model studies performed in the laboratory using solitary cnoidal and n wave models in many of the cases the results were supported by numerical studies based on the shallow water equations boussinesq equations potential flow theory and navier stokes equations these estimates help in providing a starting point for researchers when it comes to the study of extreme wave events the analytical expressions are usually developed as closed form solutions during the wave evolution the chances of wave deformation are higher the closed form solutions tend to fail here the alternate approach would be to use the navier stokes or potential flow models a good number of models are found to give excellent results over the years numerical models have gained popularity in studies related to the behaviour of long waves and their propagation characteristics they provide flexibility to the researchers by simulating many different test cases which would be too expensive to perform in physical model tests mesh based methods and particle methods are now being extensively used in this area smooth particle hydrodynamics sph is a popular particle method for simulating the free surface flows gingold and monaghan 1977 and lucy 1977 developed this method for problems in astrophysics since then the meshless nature of the technique has made it popular among researchers working on a broad spectrum of topics the original formulation has been improved considerably over the years to accommodate the needs of specific problem requirements gotoh et al 2004 used this method to investigate the interaction between regular waves and partially immersed breakwater the study considered both overtopping and non overtopping cases large eddy simulation les was used in the formulation to account for the viscous effects a similar approach was used in rogers and dalrymple 2005 to model breaking waves in both these studies the test cases include 2d and 3d models dalrymple et al 2006 presented the challenges posed by different mathematical approaches when used for modelling the tsunamis emphasis was given to the offshore and onshore phenomenon caused by tsunamis the authors commented that no models were able to provide a real time model of the 2004 tsunami event crespo et al 2007 used the sph les formulation by rogers and dalrymple 2005 to study the effect of large waves on coastal structures in the presence of a dike crespo et al 2008 used the sph technique to simulate the dam break problem instead of using the modified formulation for viscosity the artificial viscosity formulation proposed by monaghan 1992 was used dalrymple et al 2010 compiled the developments in sph over the years in simulating water waves special consideration was given to different formulation and solution techniques to obtain a stable solution rogers and dalrymple 2010 used the sph method to model tsunami waves the study was based on the model proposed in rogers and dalrymple 2005 capone et al 2010 used sph to simulate the waves caused by submarine landslides the governing equation used was based on the rheological non newtonian bingham model the model was able to represent the landslide deformation and its interaction with water the sph formulation based on the artificial viscosity term was used in all these studies the researchers have noted that the 3d simulations need a large number of particles the compressible fluid model affects the spatial and temporal resolution requirements another observation was that the models were good at simulating relatively smaller regions with a reasonable degree of accuracy and not suitable for large areas the high resolution is directly proportional to computational costs parallelization and hybridization were proposed as solutions gpu sph hérault 2010 was introduced as a faster alternative that can accommodate a large number of particles and still be computationally effective farahani et al 2013 wei et al 2016 2015 wei and dalrymple 2016 have effectively used this model the studies were able to reproduce phenomena such as mean wave induced nearshore circulation created by a breaking wave wave plunging collapsing and run up and tsunami forces on bridges respectively gotoh and khayyer 2018 have presented a detailed review of particle methods even though particle methods are good alternatives to mesh based methods most of the popular techniques are computationally expensive even for small wave steepness simulations a feasible option is the use of hybrid models a hybrid model combines two or more models and solution techniques to build a robust method to solve a single physical problem they combine the advantage of different models and help to use the best possible models for a physical problem the solution and coupling strategy adopted has to be robust to make sure that the domains communicate effectively without sabotaging the integrity of the flow problem depending on how the domains are coupled at the interface we have two specific classes of solution approaches weak coupled approach and strongly coupled approach in the weakly coupled method the information exchange at the interface occurs only in one direction the domain and mathematical models are independent of each other there is no feedback whereas in the strong coupled approach there is information exchange at the interface between the two models in both directions at every time step the domains are coupled in both space and time the flexibility and higher computational costs associated with the particle methods make them an ideal candidate for the hybrid models there have been many instances in recent years where hybrid models have been used to study hydrodynamic and coastal engineering problems sph smooth particle hydrodynamics is being widely used in hybrid models altomare et al 2018 mogan et al 2018 napoli et al 2016 narayanaswamy et al 2010 are some of the recent examples the mesh based method was combined with sph along with parallel computing and cuda capabilities to solve wave problems the authors have claimed improvement in total simulation duration physical problems such as wave overtopping and standing waves were considered in these studies in the present paper the experimental data from the large wave flume groβer wellenkanal gwk hannover germany is used as an input to the numerical model to simulate wave propagation and its run up characteristics the numerical method employed is based on sriram et al 2014 this method combines a potential flow theory based on the finite element method and the navier stokes equations based on meshless local petrov galerkin method the paper is organized in the following manner firstly the mathematical formulation and a brief explanation of the solution technique used are provided secondly validation of the model against experimental data of long wave propagation and run up from large scale experiments is reported thirdly a comparison of the small amplitude wave run up representing the rapidly raising tide with the analytical model is reported and finally the simulations for the undular bore formation and its plunging breaking over the slope are presented 1 1 mathematical model the strongly coupled 2d numerical model is created by combining two subdomains one based on the fully nonlinear potential flow theory fnpt solved using the finite element method fem and the second based on the navier stokes ns flow model solved by using meshless local petrov galerkin method based on rankine source solution mlpg r method the detailed description and discussion on this method and formulation can be found in sriram et al 2014 a brief description of each formulation is given below along with the coupling strategy adopted 1 2 fnpt fully nonlinear potential flow solver the fluid is assumed to be incompressible inviscid and flow irrotational the flow is defined in terms of the velocity potential φ using the laplace equation 1 2 φ 0 the boundary condition at the bottom impermeable boundary flat bottom γ b is 2 φ z 0 z d at z d on γ b the wave paddle motion is prescribed by 3 φ x x p t at x x p t on γ p here x p t is the time history of paddle motion at x 0 γ p denotes the wave paddle boundary the nonlinear dynamic free surface boundary condition in the lagrangian system is given by 4 d x d t φ x 5 d z d t φ z 6 d φ d t p ρ g z 1 2 φ 2 at the free surface pressure p is set to zero and z η where η is the water surface oscillations the potential inside an element φ x y z can be expressed in terms of nodal potential φ j as 7a φ x z j 1 n φ j n j x z n j is the shape function and n is the number of nodes in an element the finite element formulation for the system is given in the following form 7b ω n i j 1 m φ j n j d ω j i γ s γ p n i x p t d γ ω n i j 1 m φ j n j d ω j γ s i γ s m is the total number of nodes in the domain γ s is the free surface boundary a detailed account of solution procedures can be found in sriram 2008 1 3 ns solver the governing equations consist of the continuity equation and momentum equations as given below 8 u 0 9 d u d t 1 ρ p g ν 2 u g is the gravitational acceleration u is the fluid velocity vector p is the pressure ρ is the density of the fluid and ν is the kinematic viscosity the solution procedure is supported by the boundary conditions specified in the problem domain the lagrangian form of kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions on the free surface is given by 10 d r d t u 11 p 0 in eq 10 r denotes the position vector for the particle position the boundary condition on the rigid boundary is given by 12 u n u n 13 n p ρ ν g n u n denotes the unit normal vector from the rigid boundary u and u are velocity and acceleration of the solid boundary the bottom boundary was specified using a slip boundary condition neglecting the boundary layer effects to evaluate the system of equation we use the chorin s time split algorithm given in chorin 1968 the solution procedure starts from the stage t t n where the state values are all known the values at state t t n 1 will be estimated based on the algorithm first we evaluate the intermediate velocity u and position r based on the values at t t n 14 u u n g d t ν 2 u n δ t 15 r r n u δ t here in eq 14 the term 2 u n is determined based on koshizuka et al 1998 the pressure p n 1 is estimated using the semi implicit poisson s equation given by ma and zhou 2009 16 2 p n 1 α ρ n 1 ρ δ t 2 1 α ρ d t u α here is the artificial coefficient with values between 0 and 1 we use the value of α 0 sriram and ma 2012 this gives us the equation below 17 2 p n 1 ρ d t u the boundary conditions on the surface and solid boundaries were set as p n 1 0 and n p n 1 ρ d t n u u n 1 respectively the estimation makes use of the mlpg r the local weak formulation for a circular support domain is given by 18 ω i n p ϕ d s p ω i ρ d t u ϕ d ω in eq 18 n is unit normal pointing outside of the subdomain ϕ 1 2 π ln r r i is the solution for rankine source in an unbounded 2d domain with r the distance between point under consideration and centre of local subdomain ω i the pressure is estimated from the local weak formulation eq 18 the velocity is then calculated based on the pressure from the pressure poisson equation based on the velocity and the initial position of the particle the particle is moved to a new position the calculation is carried out for all the particles in the support domain the coupling technique adopted and the algorithm employed is discussed in the next section 1 4 coupling in space and time two methods to achieve coupling in the hybrid models are weak coupling and strong coupling in weakly coupled models the domains are independent of each other except for the boundaries the information is exchanged from one model to the other without any feedback this approach allows the simulation to be run stand alone in a strongly coupled model the domains communicate with each other at the interface during all time instances the boundary information is shared at the interface the strong coupling has to be implemented in two ways i in space and ii in time for coupling in space we use moving overlapping zone method fig 1 below shows the concept in this method boundaries can move as the simulation advances the line b 2 denotes the boundary for the fnpt domain and always moves along with the free surface and is kept straight adopting quasi eulerian and lagrangian approach the line b 1 represents the boundary for the ns domain and it can change shape here l f and l o are lengths of the fluid domain and the overlapping zone respectively at time t n as the simulation advances to the time t n 1 the value changes to l f d l and l o d s the next important step is to understand the treatment of different boundaries during the simulation in effect there are three boundaries as described in fig 2 the boundary b 1 marks the start of the ns domain boundary b 2 marks the end of fnpt domain and boundary b 0 corresponds to the region where the feed particle starts special treatments were used to incorporate and extract these values into the simulation there are two distinct formulation and solution methods for the two different domains here the approach adopted is described in the algorithm given in fig 3 the strong coupling in space for the fluid fluid subsystem is based on sriram et al 2014 the algorithm operates from the time step t t n where all the state variables are known the intermediate values of pressure p p is estimated by solving the boundary value problem for φ the estimation is done based on the values φ n and r n where φ and r denotes velocity potential and position respectively from the intermediate value of potential the intermediate value of pressure p p on the boundary b 1 is estimated section b fig 3 b 1 is the boundary on which the values are calculated of the mlpg domain and f e m denotes that the operation has been carried out in the fem domain based on the boundary values of pressures obtained from the simulations carried out in the potential flow domain the boundary value problem for pressure was solved in the navier stokes domain using the mlpg r method the boundary value on the f e m domain is updated based on the estimates from the mlpg r section a fig 3 to ensure that the pressure gradient is evaluated correctly on the boundary b 1 feeding particles are used for calculating the pressure gradient the simplified finite difference scheme sfdi given in ma 2008 is used the estimation based on sfdi depends on the local support domain for each particle if a particle is on the boundary b 1 it doesn t have enough number of particles for calculation additional particles were introduced between the boundary b 0 and b 1 to address this issue in the simulations presented here ten layers of feeding particles were used the fnpt and ns domains share the region between boundaries b 1 and b 2 this region is called the two layered particle tlp zone since two different solvers are used the field variables estimated in this region will be similar but not the same using two solvers on the same domain create continuity issues along the boundaries and affects the stability of the solution process a smoothing technique was employed to address this problem the smoothing function uses a location based approach to select the values from both the domains and applies weights to smooth the velocity in the region shared between the two solvers the technique has been tested and found to work well another critical factor to be kept in mind here is that there are two different solvers using two different time integration approaches hence coupling in time needs to be carried out the fem uses explicit time integration while the mlpg r uses fully implicit time integration to connect both the models rk2 predictor corrector approach was employed the process is illustrated in the flow chart given in fig 3 the operation starts from a physical state at a time t t n where the free surface elevation and velocity potential are known the runge kutta 2nd order time integration technique was employed to find out the velocity potential and new position for the next time step using eqs 4 6 and eq 19a 19d 19a k 1 a φ n x φ n z k 1 b d φ n d t 19b r n 1 r n k 1 a d t φ n 1 φ n k 1 b d t 19c k 2 a φ n 1 x φ n 1 z k 2 b d φ n 1 d t 19d r n 1 r n 0 5 k 1 a 0 5 k 2 a d t φ n 1 φ n 0 5 k 1 b 0 5 k 2 b d t here the values prefixed with in the superscript denote intermediate values of position and velocity potential a detailed description of the procedures and validation cases of the hybrid model can be found in sriram et al 2014 2 results and discussion in sriram et al 2016 three different scenarios for the tsunami approach based on shuto 1985 classification was considered 1 non breaking wave surging that act as a rapidly rising tide observed during small and moderate tsunami events after short distance propagation 2 breaking bore or hydraulic jump wall of water observed as a result of wave breaking during a large tsunami event after short distance propagation 3 undular bore observed after the long distance propagation of tsunami in terms of wavelength wave propagation in case 1 and case 3 was reported earlier both experimentally and numerically sriram et al 2016 however as the numerical model used in the study had difficulty in handling wave breaking such cases were avoided the present model has the capability to handle wave breaking therefore the run up of a rapidly rising tide including both wave surging and spilling over the slope case 1 and the run up of an undular bore formed after a long distance propagation and its plunging breaking over a slope were simulated case 2 can be thought of as a large amplitude wave breaking over a slope or a traditional dam break for the latter there are lots of numerical and experimental works reported in the literature 2 1 model validation against the data of large scale flume experiments on longwave propagation and evolution the physical model tests used in the validation of the present model were performed at the large wave flume groβer wellenkanal gwk hannover germany schimmels et al 2016 sriram et al 2016 from the various test cases presented in that study several long bell shaped pulses table 1 were selected the tsunami like waves were generated in the lab at a scale of 1 100 the water depth was kept constant at 1 00 m a piston type wavemaker was used for the generation of waves fig 4 shows the physical model setup the method suggested by chan and liu 2012 was used for generating the waves several solitons were combined to create the wave the eq 20 describes the expression used 20 η t i 1 n h i sech 2 ω i t t 0 t i here n denotes the total number of solitons h i denotes the wave height of the i t h soliton ω i 2 π t i t i is the period of i t h soliton t i is the time shift of i t h soliton and t 0 is the time shift of the whole wave for n 1 and ω i k c where k and c are the wavenumber and wave celerity respectively eq 20 depicts the classical solitary wave the technique proposed by synolakis 1986 was used for generating the signal for wave paddle the wave paddle motion in time s t was obtained by integrating the water particle velocity profile at the mean position of the wave paddle u 0 t the rate of change of stroke could be directly equated to the velocity of the wave paddle for the shallow water it has a form 21 d s d t c η d η here s is the stroke motion c is the wave celerity d is the water depth and η is the free surface elevation a fourth order runge kutta scheme rk4 was used for integrating this expression more details on the tests carried out and generation methodology can found in sriram et al 2016 the computational domain used for simulating the model is given in fig 5 in figs 6 8 the experimental results for propagation and evolution of long single wave pulses in the large wave flume gwk are compared to the numerical simulations based on the hybrid numerical model the results show that the wave steepens as it propagates over a distance of 225 0 m for the cases with higher wave amplitudes and steeper waves i e with higher wave nonlinearity figs 7 and 8 the initial wave disintegrates into a set of solitons these observations were similar to that of sriram et al 2016 the convergence and error analysis of the present model is previously published in sriram et al 2014 and it is not repeated for most of the simulations carried out in the present study dx dt 6 m s has been considered for the mlpg domain the comparison between the numerical model and experiments shows good agreement even though the wave is characterized as an elongated pulse with a pre set wave period and wave height as it propagates over a long distance the wave characteristics change this phenomenon is explained in detail with the help of three test cases listed in table 1 the wave elevation was measured along the flat bottom and the water depth was kept constant fig 9 fig 10 and fig 11 show the wave elevation at five different locations along the flume for elongated pulse wave having wave heights 0 04 m 0 06 m and 0 12 m respectively for relatively small wave amplitudes shown in figs 9 and 10 the wave retains its original shape at least for the first few wave probes less than 100 00 m however while wave propagates the wave steepness increases this effect was studied theoretically in zahibo et al 2008 and more recently in li et al 2019 for a wave with a relatively high amplitude fig 11 the wave shape is asymmetric already at 50 0 m from the wavemaker further as the wave propagates the waveform tends to split into a series of solitons this effect is well described by the dispersive wave theory sriram et al 2016 numerically simulated this phenomenon with the help of fnpt and korteweg de vries kdv equation based models a similar trend was observed by brühl and oumeraci 2016 for the propagation of long period cosine waves in shallow waters the waves of smaller amplitude are influenced by dispersive effects and evolve into an undular bore nevertheless as per the kdv theory the increase in amplitude is limited to less than twice the initial amplitude sriram et al 2016 the hybrid model was able to capture this process the results obtained showed good agreement with the experimental measurements 2 2 model validation against the data from large scale flume experiments on wave runup the numerical schemes employed near the moving shoreline plays a significant role in validating the numerical model for run up in most of the particle method based approaches less number of particles leads to inferior results validation of run up was carried out to show the capabilities of the hybrid model for this a new set of experiments are carried out in gwk apart from the results mentioned in sriram et al 2016 in this section the time series of wave run up simulated numerically using the hybrid model is compared with the experiments conducted in the water depth of 3 5 m having a natural slope of 1 6 fig 12 shows the test setup the wave elevation data was recorded using 16 wave gauges located along the flume a capacitance probe fixed along the slope was used to measure wave run up the system was calibrated by video recording of the shoreline in the first stage the wave elevation recorded at all the 16 locations were compared the exact position of wave probes along the flume is listed in table 2 fig 13 shows the domain used for the numerical model the entire region denoted by the physical model is split into two zones the flat bottom portion is entirely modelled using the finite element method based on fnpt the area along the slope is modelled using mlpg r the three non breaking solitary waves of different amplitudes see table 3 are tested the period of the wave is about 20 s fig 14 shows the comparison of results obtained from experiments and numerical simulation for the test case gwk2074 with the largest initial wave height 0 24 m similar to the earlier cases the results of the numerical simulation are in good agreement with the experimental data for wave propagation in the flume similar trends were observed for the other two test cases and hence not presented here fig 15 shows the comparison of run up time history from the experiments and numerical simulation for the three test cases listed in table 5 the proposed model was able to reproduce the experimental results with a reasonable degree of accuracy thus the present hybrid numerical model can be used with confidence the maximum run up obtained from the numerical simulation and experiments were then compared the results are rather close to each other as shown in table 3 2 3 simulation of wave run up for a rapidly rising tide this section focuses on how various parameters affect the wave run up height a specific test case was chosen from the test set ep04 elongated pulse given in table 4 and simulated in the hybrid model wave height is fixed as 0 04 m while the wave period is adjusted the waves propagate over different slopes and their run up height is estimated using the hybrid model fig 16 shows the domain used for the test case the wave evolution on a milder slope 1 40 of the same wave ep04 with t 30s no 4 in table 4 is presented in fig 17 each of the lines marks the spatial instances as the wave propagates over the slope here spilling wave breaking was observed which occurred after t 66 970 s for most of the test conditions reported in this section the wave either climbs the shore as gentle surging or undergo slight spilling depending upon the wave amplitude and the slope angle the numerically estimated run up was compared to available analytical formulas for non breaking waves to asses the quality of the simulation analytical formulas especially those confirmed by the experiments synolakis 1987 form a reliable tool for estimating the run up of solitons eqs 22 and 23 describe the shape of the soliton in shallow water in terms of its height h and period t respectively 22 η x h sech 2 3 h 4 d x d 23 η t 1 g 4 π d 3 t 2 sech 2 2 π t t the synolakis 1987 formula for the maximum run up height r max on a plane beach with respect to the initial wave height h has the following form 24 r m a x h 2 8312 cot α h d 1 4 it was observed during the studies presented in sriram et al 2016 that the one parameter equation eq 24 was limited to solitonic solutions and not generally applicable to waves with freely chosen wave heights and periods since the parameters of solitons wave height h period t and the water depth of the flume d are interrelated see eq 22 and 23 the right hand side of eq 24 for the initial wave height was re written for the wave period 25 r m a x h 2 8312 cot α 1 g d 4 π d 3 t 2 1 4 eq 25 can be called the modified synolakis formula it contains two parameters the wave height and period and can serve as a two parameter model it was already used in sriram et al 2016 to evaluate the run up height of elongated pulses here alternatively we also use a two parameter model based on the parameterization of several bell shaped pulses proposed in didenkulova 2009 26 r m a x h 3 5 l λ s 3 5 cot α d g d t s in eq 26 the maximum run up height r max is expressed as a function of significant wave period t s defined at the 2 3 level of the maximum wave height tests cases simulated in the hybrid model are presented in table 4 along with the estimated maximum run up height the run up over the slope was determined by tracking the propagation of the free surface along the slope while analyzing the generated waves it was found that they deviated from the classic sech 2 shape and needed some adjustments and re definition of the wave period in order to be compared with analytical formulas the best fit between the generated waves and sech2 profile was calculated and the corresponding period of the fitted sech2 wave was used in eq 25 the period t s used in eq 26 was estimated at the 2 3 level of the maximum wave height of the initially generated wave these newly defined period can be found in table 5 fig 18 shows the maximum run up measurements from the present hybrid model for the non breaking and breaking cases corresponds to spilling the solid black line depicts eq 24 for h 4 cm the corresponding solitonic wave period for this case is 12s which is much smaller than for considered test cases alternatively the run up of solitary like waves with amplitude h 4 cm and periods t 33 8 s solid blue line t 65 s solid green line and t 99 s solid red line described by eq 25 is also plotted and the dashed lines represent the parameterized analytical solution by didenkulova 2009 see eq 26 for h 4 cm and t s 7 0 s blue dashed line t s 13 6 s green dashed line and t s 22 4 s red dashed line both analytical solutions give similar predictions of wave run up height which are also in a relatively good agreement with the simulations for waves of shorter periods t 30 s and t 50 s one can also clearly see the effect of spilling breaking manifested in the reduction of the wave amplification on gentle slopes the results of simulations agree well with the analytical predictions for steeper slopes applies to slopes 1 10 and 1 15 for t 30 s while starting from the slope 1 20 there is an abrupt reduction in the wave run up height which is related to the spilling breaking effects a similar situation was observed for waves with t 50 s for these waves the reduction is not so abrupt and starts at the slope 1 50 note that we assume the slope to be gentle enough to contain at least a half of the wavelength therefore for longer waves t 70 s the analytical predictions are not so good also two analytical formulas eq 25 and eq 26 show a higher discrepancy for waves of larger periods overall it can be said that the hybrid numerical model is in reasonable agreement with analytical predictions for non breaking waves and the deviations are mainly due to occasional spilling breaking scenarios 2 4 undular bore evolution and breaking over a slope in the previous sections the elongated pulse wave approaching the slope as a rapidly rising tide and climbing over different slopes were simulated wave amplitudes in these test cases were very small so the waves were mostly non breaking and only the slight spilling breaking was addressed this is a good test to show the capability of the meshfree methods to model the small amplitude waves the real advantage of the meshfree method is its capability to model the strong wave breaking or a bore in this section the undular bore formation and its plunging breaking over a slope are reported in order to simulate the undular bore the simulations need to be carried out for a large domain and over long durations in these scenarios the hybrid model can be effectively used the same case ep12 wherein the splitting of waves was observed was simulated for a slope 1 20 to show the capability of the present hybrid model to simulate wave breaking to simulate the present case a new set up as shown in fig 19 was used the water depth was kept as 1 00 m and the flat part of the domain is 210 00 m long which ends with a slope of 1 20 the waves generated in the fem side of the domain travel over the long flat part and then propagated over the slope in the earlier observations it was noticed that the wave shape changes as the wave travels over a longer distance case 3 in table 1 over 100 00 m this is visible in figs 8 and 11 similar changes were also observed in this simulation the free surface elevations measured at different locations along the numerical wave tank are presented in fig 20 the wave shape changes and the wave steepness increases while the wave travels over a flat bottom in fig 20 the evolution of the wave in the ns mlpg side as the wave travels in the presence and absence of the slope is reported as expected the wave steepness increases gradually over the slope when compared to a flat bottom the wave probes were kept at 1 00 m interval the focus of this test case is the run up of the formed undular bore over the slope fig 22 presents the spatial evolution of this process at various time instances during the simulation the red colour denotes free surface nodes from the fnpt domain and the blue colour corresponds to free surface particles from the mlpg domain from fig 22 the disintegration of the original elongated pulse into two waves can be seen at t 82 s as waves travel further the separation becomes more prominent and the steepness of waves increases this can be seen in figs 20 and 22 the phenomenon is observed even before the wave reaches the slope as the wave propagates over the slope the 1st wave breaks following plunging scenario as shown in fig 23 next the broken wave runs up quickly within 5s and then the 2nd wave breaks forming a bore and starts travelling up the slope as shown in fig 24 the observation is in agreement with the threshold criteria defined by pelinovsky et al 2015 for bore formation i e hd d 1 3 corresponds to an undular bore formation and hd d 1 7 corresponds to a breaking bore formation here hd denotes the height of the bore from the sea bottom thus when the initial wave propagates over the flat bottom the hd d 1 3 i e hd is 1 12 m with d as 1 m results in an undular bore formation and later on the 2nd wave propagates over a slope on top of the 1st wave the water depth in this case is rather small and is defined by the water remaining on the slope after the passage of the 1st wave therefore the threshold will become higher than 1 7 and the 2nd wave develops into a breaking bore on the slope see figs 21 and 24 in order to capture this the number of nodes used in the mlpg domain is about 10900 for 10 m distance in the initial sloping region at rest the maximum inundation for this case is shown in fig 25 which is 8 m the corresponding maximum run up height is 0 4 m which gives almost 4 times the amplification of the initial 12 cm wave at the coast further this test case was compared to the rapidly rising tide ep 04 simulated on the domain given in fig 19 the small amplitude ep 04 does not disintegrate and does not form undular bore it runs up the coast as a single wave undergoing spilling breaking and inundating the slope for over 2 m even though the period of the generated waves was similar the scenarios they undergo during propagation and run up are quite different also the inundation and run up of these waves cannot be explained simply by considering initial wave height for the 4 cm wave the inundation is 2 m while for 3 times higher 12 cm wave the inundation is 8 m which is more than 3 times higher 2 4 1 computational time one of the advantages of the hybrid model is the computational time from the prior experience working with pure particle based models and weakly coupled mesh based models manoj kumar and sriram 2017 the two factors that govern computational time in particle methods are the number of particles used in the simulation and the time step since the number of particles involved in the simulation is directly proportional to the time required for computation reducing the number of particles in the simulation can accelerate the process thus by expertly manipulating the domain a rapid saving in computational time can be achieved as explained in the earlier sections the hybrid model has both mesh based and particle based solution techniques in all the test cases performed a significant part of the domain was solved using the mesh based fem solver the particle method mlpg r based approach was only used in regions where wave deformation run up and breaking was expected based on the flow chart denoted in fig 3 calculations must be carried out in both fnpt and mlpg r domain at every time step when the wave is generated in this case at the fnpt domain on one side of the flume the rest of the flume remains relatively calm the condition mentioned above is quite evident while testing waves of the elongated pulse kind depending on the celerity the wave takes considerable time to cover the large domain around 180 00 m 220 00 m in effect if both the equations are solved simultaneously as per the flow chart for a significant duration the stationary fluid domain is solved in the domain represented by mlpg r this is not required based on this understanding three test cases were formulated the relative performance of the three test cases is presented in the computational performance of the models was compared based on the actual time required for solving one timestep the results are given in table 6 this study shows that the hybrid model is faster than the full particle method further based approach and bringing in additional tweaks can reduce the computational cost further down the results show a reasonable comparison thus the hybrid model can be used as a fast and reliable tool to solve similar problems in coastal engineering table 6 the case 2074 given in table 3 was simulated in all the three tests the wave elevation was measured at wave probe 16 the full mlpg case 1 in the computational performance of the models was compared based on the actual time required for solving one timestep the results are given in table 6 this study shows that the hybrid model is faster than the full particle method further based approach and bringing in additional tweaks can reduce the computational cost further down the results show a reasonable comparison thus the hybrid model can be used as a fast and reliable tool to solve similar problems in coastal engineering table 6 was used as a benchmark and the error was estimated as given in eq 27 27 e r r o r m a x η c a s e 1 η c a s e 2 o r c a s e 3 η c a s e 1 the computational performance of the models was compared based on the actual time required for solving one timestep the results are given in table 6 this study shows that the hybrid model is faster than the full particle method further based approach and bringing in additional tweaks can reduce the computational cost further down the results show a reasonable comparison thus the hybrid model can be used as a fast and reliable tool to solve similar problems in coastal engineering 3 conclusion the estimation of wave run up has a critical role in any infrastructure development projects in proximity to the coastal zones in the present study a 2d hybrid numerical model was used to estimate the run up of tsunami like waves and to understand their propagation and evolution over a long distance the method was able to simulate the propagation of long elongated pulse waves and split up for small and steep waves good agreement with the laboratory measurements is obtained further the numerical model is validated using a new set of measurements for the run up of solitary waves from the large scale experiments analysis of wave propagation and run up on a slope is carried out for two different scenarios a rapidly rising tide which included wave surging and spilling breaking and b undular bore formation and its plunging breaking the wave propagation evolution and run up were investigated for the above two cases the method presented in this article seems to be superior with less number of nodes to capture the small amplitude wave run up which is not feasible in most of the existing particle method a comparison with analytical formulas for run up height also substantiates this effect for studying the long waves propagating and splitting into a series of soliton one needs either euler based model or fnpt however coupling this with lagrangian ns model and applying for longwave propagations and run up is not attempted so far if one needs to simulate the laboratory model scale then potential flow theory irrotational can be used at the far end as shown in this paper otherwise for all practical purpose and mathematical continuity coupling with a rotational flow model euler equations with ns model is recommended based on the present simulations it is shown that the synolakis formulae modified for single pulses and used in sriram et al 2016 and didenkulova 2009 formulae for parameterized bell shaped pulses can be used to estimate run up of long waves which follow rapidly raising tide scenario the run up of the undular bore over the slope leads to the multiple wave breaking the criteria proposed by pelinovsky et al 2015 for the undular and breaking bore with respect to hd d is in agreement with the simulation results the run up of the first wave is the largest one 0 4 m and leads to about the 4 times amplification of the initial wave height of 12 cm on the slope for comparison the run up height of the 4 cm wave with the same period climbing the same slope but undergoing the rapidly raising tide scenario is 0 1 m which gives only 2 5 times amplification of the initial wave height on the slope finally the present hybrid model can be effectively used for the study of wave propagation run up and breaking for considerable distances and long duration instead of running the full navier stokes model wherein the special treatment is required to avoid numerical damping for long duration propagation and substantial computational time however the present model does not incorporate turbulence and air entrapment two phase for breaking waves further for practical scenarios 3d studies need to be carried out this will be considered in our future studies using the hybrid 3d boussinesq ns model which is under development credit authorship contribution

21955,in the present paper the hybrid numerical model sriram et al 2014 is used for the estimation of long wave run up the model is based on the strong coupling between the fully nonlinear potential flow theory fnpt at the far field and navier stokes ns equations in the nearshore the simulations are carried out for the propagation and evolution of the tsunami like waves i e elongated single pulses having a realistic timescale the model is validated from large scale experiments for the wave propagation as well as for run up sriram et al 2016 the numerical simulations are found to agree well with experiments the model capability is shown for two different scenarios over a slope a a rapidly rising tide including surging and spilling breaking and b undular bore formation and its plunging breaking on a beach for the first case the numerical model is also compared with the analytical estimates the second case undular bore breaking over a slope shows the capability of the meshfree method and the requirements of the hybrid model in many of the existing particle based methods dense distribution of particles is required to simulate the rapidly rising tide which is not needed in the present model 1 introduction the extreme wave events such as cyclonic storms coastal storms and tsunamis pose a severe risk to coastal regions these events along with the sea level rise and climate change threaten the very existence of communities that live along the coast predicting and mitigating these threats is essential for disaster mitigation and management in these regions it is necessary to understand these phenomena before taking up any developmental activity in the coastal zone tsunamis are extreme waves generated by an earthquake or any other disturbances on the ocean floor or landmass close to the sea these waves trace its origin to deeper waters and usually travel for very long distances some of the characteristics of a tsunami are long wave periods and tremendous wave heights as they arrive in the nearshore region the behaviour of tsunami waves changes as they propagate from deep water to shallow waters over the years there has been a significant number of tsunami events recorded in many parts of the world our previous encounters with these waves have helped us to understand how they affect the coastal region all of these make the study of these extreme waves an exciting topic for scientists and engineers although tsunamis are often considered in the framework of the nonlinear shallow water theory they may also be affected by dispersive effects when propagating over a long distance the latter may result in disintegration of the initial wave into a series of solitons of smaller period and increase in wave steepness due to exchange of energy see for instance akrish et al 2016 brühl and oumeraci 2016 sriram et al 2016 ezersky et al 2013 herterich and dias 2019 li et al 2019 one of the first models proposed for the laboratory study of the tsunami was a solitary wave a solitary wave has just a crest which makes them look like an elongated pulse signal they are defined with a fixed wave period and wave height these waves were used in synolakis 1986 1987 the experimental results were compared to an in house numerical model the results were used to develop the widely popular analytical expressions for calculating wave run up height on a plane slope it was often observed that during the onset of a tsunami event the shoreline recedes this behaviour is not characteristic of the elongated pulse solitary wave model the receding shoreline phenomena were found to cause an increase in the number of causalities during the recent tsunami events madsen et al 2008 explained the solitary wave paradigm for the tsunami they observed that most of the globally accepted models for tsunamis consist of either solitary wave or cnoidal wave models they noted that even though these formulations are useful for validation and verification of the numerical models the relation between these models and geophysical tsunami was not appropriately established the n wave is another model of tsunami waves tadepalli and synolakis 1994 in comparison to the solitary wave model n wave has a distinctive trough and crest based on the relative shape of the crest and trough the n wave can be symmetric or asymmetric in our studies manoj kumar et al 2017 we observed that a leading trough n wave model could accurately model the receding shoreline phenomenon seen during some of the field observations we also noted that the breaking characteristics and effective run up of both solitary and n wave models were quite different even when they had the same wave height experiments in the model scale analytical formulations and numerical models are some of the most widely used tools when it comes to the study of wave evolution and run up analytical models and empirical models are used for initial assessment of maximum inundation and run up van der meer et al 2016 synolakis 1987 schimmels et al 2016 and sriram et al 2016 used a piston type wavemaker to generate and study the evolution of tsunami in a large scale experimental facility the experiments were carried out at the large wave flume groβer wellenkanal gwk in hannover germany the above papers brought to light the importance of modelling long wave propagation in large scale testing facilities further the run up and inundation of the generated waves were studied using the analytical model developed in didenkulova 2009 it was noted that the run up on a mild slope 1 18 concerning the study was challenging to estimate due to the phenomenon of wave breaking during the run up empirical models have been proposed by the researchers to estimate the run up of tsunami like waves the expressions were developed based on rigorous model studies performed in the laboratory using solitary cnoidal and n wave models in many of the cases the results were supported by numerical studies based on the shallow water equations boussinesq equations potential flow theory and navier stokes equations these estimates help in providing a starting point for researchers when it comes to the study of extreme wave events the analytical expressions are usually developed as closed form solutions during the wave evolution the chances of wave deformation are higher the closed form solutions tend to fail here the alternate approach would be to use the navier stokes or potential flow models a good number of models are found to give excellent results over the years numerical models have gained popularity in studies related to the behaviour of long waves and their propagation characteristics they provide flexibility to the researchers by simulating many different test cases which would be too expensive to perform in physical model tests mesh based methods and particle methods are now being extensively used in this area smooth particle hydrodynamics sph is a popular particle method for simulating the free surface flows gingold and monaghan 1977 and lucy 1977 developed this method for problems in astrophysics since then the meshless nature of the technique has made it popular among researchers working on a broad spectrum of topics the original formulation has been improved considerably over the years to accommodate the needs of specific problem requirements gotoh et al 2004 used this method to investigate the interaction between regular waves and partially immersed breakwater the study considered both overtopping and non overtopping cases large eddy simulation les was used in the formulation to account for the viscous effects a similar approach was used in rogers and dalrymple 2005 to model breaking waves in both these studies the test cases include 2d and 3d models dalrymple et al 2006 presented the challenges posed by different mathematical approaches when used for modelling the tsunamis emphasis was given to the offshore and onshore phenomenon caused by tsunamis the authors commented that no models were able to provide a real time model of the 2004 tsunami event crespo et al 2007 used the sph les formulation by rogers and dalrymple 2005 to study the effect of large waves on coastal structures in the presence of a dike crespo et al 2008 used the sph technique to simulate the dam break problem instead of using the modified formulation for viscosity the artificial viscosity formulation proposed by monaghan 1992 was used dalrymple et al 2010 compiled the developments in sph over the years in simulating water waves special consideration was given to different formulation and solution techniques to obtain a stable solution rogers and dalrymple 2010 used the sph method to model tsunami waves the study was based on the model proposed in rogers and dalrymple 2005 capone et al 2010 used sph to simulate the waves caused by submarine landslides the governing equation used was based on the rheological non newtonian bingham model the model was able to represent the landslide deformation and its interaction with water the sph formulation based on the artificial viscosity term was used in all these studies the researchers have noted that the 3d simulations need a large number of particles the compressible fluid model affects the spatial and temporal resolution requirements another observation was that the models were good at simulating relatively smaller regions with a reasonable degree of accuracy and not suitable for large areas the high resolution is directly proportional to computational costs parallelization and hybridization were proposed as solutions gpu sph hérault 2010 was introduced as a faster alternative that can accommodate a large number of particles and still be computationally effective farahani et al 2013 wei et al 2016 2015 wei and dalrymple 2016 have effectively used this model the studies were able to reproduce phenomena such as mean wave induced nearshore circulation created by a breaking wave wave plunging collapsing and run up and tsunami forces on bridges respectively gotoh and khayyer 2018 have presented a detailed review of particle methods even though particle methods are good alternatives to mesh based methods most of the popular techniques are computationally expensive even for small wave steepness simulations a feasible option is the use of hybrid models a hybrid model combines two or more models and solution techniques to build a robust method to solve a single physical problem they combine the advantage of different models and help to use the best possible models for a physical problem the solution and coupling strategy adopted has to be robust to make sure that the domains communicate effectively without sabotaging the integrity of the flow problem depending on how the domains are coupled at the interface we have two specific classes of solution approaches weak coupled approach and strongly coupled approach in the weakly coupled method the information exchange at the interface occurs only in one direction the domain and mathematical models are independent of each other there is no feedback whereas in the strong coupled approach there is information exchange at the interface between the two models in both directions at every time step the domains are coupled in both space and time the flexibility and higher computational costs associated with the particle methods make them an ideal candidate for the hybrid models there have been many instances in recent years where hybrid models have been used to study hydrodynamic and coastal engineering problems sph smooth particle hydrodynamics is being widely used in hybrid models altomare et al 2018 mogan et al 2018 napoli et al 2016 narayanaswamy et al 2010 are some of the recent examples the mesh based method was combined with sph along with parallel computing and cuda capabilities to solve wave problems the authors have claimed improvement in total simulation duration physical problems such as wave overtopping and standing waves were considered in these studies in the present paper the experimental data from the large wave flume groβer wellenkanal gwk hannover germany is used as an input to the numerical model to simulate wave propagation and its run up characteristics the numerical method employed is based on sriram et al 2014 this method combines a potential flow theory based on the finite element method and the navier stokes equations based on meshless local petrov galerkin method the paper is organized in the following manner firstly the mathematical formulation and a brief explanation of the solution technique used are provided secondly validation of the model against experimental data of long wave propagation and run up from large scale experiments is reported thirdly a comparison of the small amplitude wave run up representing the rapidly raising tide with the analytical model is reported and finally the simulations for the undular bore formation and its plunging breaking over the slope are presented 1 1 mathematical model the strongly coupled 2d numerical model is created by combining two subdomains one based on the fully nonlinear potential flow theory fnpt solved using the finite element method fem and the second based on the navier stokes ns flow model solved by using meshless local petrov galerkin method based on rankine source solution mlpg r method the detailed description and discussion on this method and formulation can be found in sriram et al 2014 a brief description of each formulation is given below along with the coupling strategy adopted 1 2 fnpt fully nonlinear potential flow solver the fluid is assumed to be incompressible inviscid and flow irrotational the flow is defined in terms of the velocity potential φ using the laplace equation 1 2 φ 0 the boundary condition at the bottom impermeable boundary flat bottom γ b is 2 φ z 0 z d at z d on γ b the wave paddle motion is prescribed by 3 φ x x p t at x x p t on γ p here x p t is the time history of paddle motion at x 0 γ p denotes the wave paddle boundary the nonlinear dynamic free surface boundary condition in the lagrangian system is given by 4 d x d t φ x 5 d z d t φ z 6 d φ d t p ρ g z 1 2 φ 2 at the free surface pressure p is set to zero and z η where η is the water surface

the domain γ s is the free surface boundary a detailed account of solution procedures can be found in sriram 2008 1 3 ns solver the governing equations consist of the continuity equation and momentum equations as given below 8 u 0 9 d u d t 1 ρ p g ν 2 u g is the gravitational acceleration u is the fluid velocity vector p is the pressure ρ is the density of the fluid and ν is the kinematic viscosity the solution procedure is supported by the boundary conditions specified in the problem domain the lagrangian form of kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions on the free surface is given by 10 d r d t u 11 p 0 in eq 10 r denotes the position vector for the particle position the boundary condition on the rigid boundary is given by 12 u n u n 13 n p ρ ν g n u n denotes the unit normal vector from the rigid boundary u and u are velocity and acceleration of the solid boundary the bottom boundary was specified using a slip boundary condition neglecting the boundary layer effects to evaluate the system of equation we use the chorin s time split algorithm given in chorin 1968 the solution procedure starts from the stage t t n where the state values are all known the values at state t t n 1 will be estimated based on the algorithm first we evaluate the intermediate velocity u and position r based on the values at t t n 14 u u n g d t ν 2 u n δ t 15 r r n u δ t here in eq 14 the term 2 u n is determined based on koshizuka et al 1998 the pressure p n 1 is estimated using the semi implicit poisson s equation given by ma and zhou 2009 16 2 p n 1 α ρ n 1 ρ δ t 2 1 α ρ d t u α here is the artificial coefficient with values between 0 and 1 we use the value of α 0 sriram and ma 2012 this gives us the equation below 17 2 p n 1 ρ d t u the boundary conditions on the surface and solid boundaries were set as p n 1 0 and n p n 1 ρ d t n u u n 1 respectively the estimation makes use of the mlpg r the local weak formulation for a circular support domain is given by 18 ω i n p ϕ d s p ω i ρ d t u ϕ d ω in eq 18 n is unit normal pointing outside of the subdomain ϕ 1 2 π ln r r i is the solution for rankine source in an unbounded 2d domain with r the distance between point under consideration and centre of local subdomain ω i the pressure is estimated from the local weak formulation eq 18 the velocity is then calculated based on the pressure from the pressure poisson equation based on the velocity and the initial position of the particle the particle is moved to a new position the calculation is carried out for all the particles in the support domain the coupling technique adopted and the algorithm employed is discussed in the next section 1 4 coupling in space and time two methods to achieve coupling in the hybrid models are weak coupling and strong coupling in weakly coupled models the domains are independent of each other except for the boundaries the information is exchanged from one model to the other without any feedback this approach allows the simulation to be run stand alone in a strongly coupled model the domains communicate with each other at the interface during all time instances the boundary information is shared at the interface the strong coupling has to be implemented in two ways i in space and ii in time for coupling in space we use moving overlapping zone method fig 1 below shows the concept in this method boundaries can move as the simulation advances the line b 2 denotes the boundary for the fnpt domain and always moves along with the free surface and is kept straight adopting quasi eulerian and lagrangian approach the line b 1 represents the boundary for the ns domain and it can change shape here l f and l o are lengths of the fluid domain and the overlapping zone respectively at time t n as the simulation advances to the time t n 1 the value changes to l f d l and l o d s the next important step is to understand the treatment of different boundaries during the simulation in effect there are three boundaries as described in fig 2 the boundary b 1 marks the start of the ns domain boundary b 2 marks the end of fnpt domain and boundary b 0 corresponds to the region where the feed particle starts special treatments were used to incorporate and extract these values into the simulation there are two distinct formulation and solution methods for the two different domains here the approach adopted is described in the algorithm given in fig 3 the strong coupling in space for the fluid fluid subsystem is based on sriram et al 2014 the algorithm operates from the time step t t n where all the state variables are known the intermediate values of pressure p p is estimated by solving the boundary value problem for φ the estimation is done based on the values φ n and r n where φ and r denotes velocity potential and position respectively from the intermediate value of potential the intermediate value of pressure p p on the boundary b 1 is estimated section b fig 3 b 1 is the boundary on which the values are calculated of the mlpg domain and f e m denotes that the operation has been carried out in the fem domain based on the boundary values of pressures obtained from the simulations carried out in the potential flow domain the boundary value problem for pressure was solved in the navier stokes domain using the mlpg r method the boundary value on the f e m domain is updated based on the estimates from the mlpg r section a fig 3 to ensure that the pressure gradient is evaluated correctly on the boundary b 1 feeding particles are used for calculating the pressure gradient the simplified finite difference scheme sfdi given in ma 2008 is used the estimation based on sfdi depends on the local support domain for each particle if a particle is on the boundary b 1 it doesn t have enough number of particles for calculation additional particles were introduced between the boundary b 0 and b 1 to address this issue in the simulations presented here ten layers of feeding particles were used the fnpt and ns domains share the region between boundaries b 1 and b 2 this region is called the two layered particle tlp zone since two different solvers are used the field variables estimated in this region will be similar but not the same using two solvers on the same domain create continuity issues along the boundaries and affects the stability of the solution process a smoothing technique was employed to address this problem the smoothing function uses a location based approach to select the values from both the domains and applies weights to smooth the velocity in the region shared between the two solvers the technique has been tested and found to work well another critical factor to be kept in mind here is that there are two different solvers using two different time integration approaches hence coupling in time needs to be carried out the fem uses explicit time integration while the mlpg r uses fully implicit time integration to connect both the models rk2 predictor corrector approach was employed the process is illustrated in the flow chart given in fig 3 the operation starts from a physical state at a time t t n where the free surface elevation and velocity potential are known the runge kutta 2nd order time integration technique was employed to find out the velocity potential and new position for the next time step using eqs 4 6 and eq 19a 19d 19a k 1 a φ n x φ n z k 1 b d φ n d t 19b r n 1 r n k 1 a d t φ n 1 φ n k 1 b d t 19c k 2 a φ n 1 x φ n 1 z k 2 b d φ n 1 d t 19d r n 1 r n 0 5 k 1 a 0 5 k 2 a d t φ n 1 φ n 0 5 k 1 b 0 5 k 2 b d t here the values prefixed with in the superscript denote intermediate values of position and velocity potential a detailed description of the procedures and validation cases of the hybrid model can be found in sriram et al 2014 2 results and discussion in sriram et al 2016 three different scenarios for the tsunami approach based on shuto 1985 classification was considered 1 non breaking wave surging that act as a rapidly rising tide observed during small and moderate tsunami events after short distance propagation 2 breaking bore or hydraulic jump wall of water observed as a result of wave breaking during a large tsunami event after short distance propagation 3 undular bore observed after the long distance propagation of tsunami in terms of wavelength wave propagation in case 1 and case 3 was reported earlier both experimentally and numerically sriram et al 2016 however as the numerical model used in the study had difficulty in handling wave breaking such cases were avoided the present model has the capability to handle wave breaking therefore the run up of a rapidly rising tide including both wave surging and spilling over the slope case 1 and the run up of an undular bore formed after a long distance propagation and its plunging breaking over a slope were simulated case 2 can be thought of as a large amplitude wave breaking over a slope or a traditional dam break for the latter there are lots of numerical and experimental works reported in the literature 2 1 model validation against the data of large scale flume experiments on longwave propagation and evolution the physical model tests used in the validation of the present model were performed at the large wave flume groβer wellenkanal gwk hannover germany schimmels et al 2016 sriram et al 2016 from the various test cases presented in that study several long bell shaped pulses table 1 were selected the tsunami like waves were generated in the lab at a scale of 1 100 the water depth was kept constant at 1 00 m a piston type wavemaker was used for the generation of waves fig 4 shows the physical model setup the method suggested by chan and liu 2012 was used for generating the waves several solitons were combined to create the wave the eq 20 describes the expression used 20 η t i 1 n h i sech 2 ω i t t 0 t i here n denotes the total number of solitons h i denotes the wave height of the i t h soliton ω i 2 π t i t i is the period of i t h soliton t i is the time shift of i t h soliton and t 0 is the time shift of the whole wave for n 1 and ω i k c where k and c are the wavenumber and wave celerity respectively eq 20 depicts the classical solitary wave the technique proposed by synolakis 1986 was used for generating the signal for wave paddle the wave paddle motion in time s t was obtained by integrating the water particle velocity profile at the mean position of the wave paddle u 0 t the rate of change of stroke could be directly equated to the velocity of the wave paddle for the shallow water it has a form 21 d s d t c η d η here s is the stroke motion c is the wave celerity d is the water depth and η is the free surface elevation a fourth order runge kutta scheme rk4 was used for integrating this expression more details on the tests carried out and generation methodology can found in sriram et al 2016 the computational domain used for simulating the model is given in fig 5 in figs 6 8 the experimental results for propagation and evolution of long single wave pulses in the large wave flume gwk are compared to the numerical simulations based on the hybrid numerical model the results show that the wave steepens as it propagates over a distance of 225 0 m for the cases with higher wave amplitudes and steeper waves i e with higher wave nonlinearity figs 7 and 8 the initial wave disintegrates into a set of solitons these observations were similar to that of sriram et al 2016 the convergence and error analysis of the present model is previously published in sriram et al 2014 and it is not repeated for most of the simulations carried out in the present study dx dt 6 m s has been considered for the mlpg domain the comparison between the numerical model and experiments shows good agreement even though the wave is characterized as an elongated pulse with a pre set wave period and wave height as it propagates over a long distance the wave characteristics change this phenomenon is explained in detail with the help of three test cases listed in table 1 the wave elevation was measured along the flat bottom and the water depth was kept constant fig 9 fig 10 and fig 11 show the wave elevation at five different locations along the flume for elongated pulse wave having wave heights 0 04 m 0 06 m and 0 12 m respectively for relatively small wave amplitudes shown in figs 9 and 10 the wave retains its original shape at least for the first few wave probes less than 100 00 m however while wave propagates the wave steepness increases this effect was studied theoretically in zahibo et al 2008 and more recently in li et al 2019 for a wave with a relatively high amplitude fig 11 the wave shape is asymmetric already at 50 0 m from the wavemaker further as the wave propagates the waveform tends to split into a series of solitons this effect is well described by the dispersive wave theory sriram et al 2016 numerically simulated this phenomenon with the help of fnpt and korteweg de vries kdv equation based models a similar trend was observed by brühl and oumeraci 2016 for the propagation of long period cosine waves in shallow waters the waves of smaller amplitude are influenced by dispersive effects and evolve into an undular bore nevertheless as per the kdv theory the increase in amplitude is limited to less than twice the initial amplitude sriram et al 2016 the hybrid model was able to capture this process the results obtained showed good agreement with the experimental measurements 2 2 model validation against the data from large scale flume experiments on wave runup the numerical schemes employed near the moving shoreline plays a significant role in validating the numerical model for run up in most of the particle method based approaches less number of particles leads to inferior results validation of run up was carried out to show the capabilities of the hybrid model for this a new set of experiments are carried out in gwk apart from the results mentioned in sriram et al 2016 in this section the time series of wave run up simulated numerically using the hybrid model is compared with the experiments conducted in the water depth of 3 5 m having a natural slope of 1 6 fig 12 shows the test setup the wave elevation data was recorded using 16 wave gauges located along the flume a capacitance probe fixed along the slope was used to measure wave run up the system was calibrated by video recording of the shoreline in the first stage the wave elevation recorded at all the 16 locations were compared the exact position of wave probes along the flume is listed in table 2 fig 13 shows the domain used for the numerical model the entire region denoted by the physical model is split into two zones the flat bottom portion is entirely modelled using the finite element method based on fnpt the area along the slope is modelled using mlpg r the three non breaking solitary waves of different amplitudes see table 3 are tested the period of the wave is about 20 s fig 14 shows the comparison of results obtained from experiments and numerical simulation for the test case gwk2074 with the largest initial wave height 0 24 m similar to the earlier cases the results of the numerical simulation are in good agreement with the experimental data for wave propagation in the flume similar trends were observed for the other two test cases and hence not presented here fig 15 shows the comparison of run up time history from the experiments and numerical simulation for the three test cases listed in table 5 the proposed model was able to reproduce the experimental results with a reasonable degree of accuracy thus the present hybrid numerical model can be used with confidence the maximum run up obtained from the numerical simulation and experiments were then compared the results are rather close to each other as shown in table 3 2 3 simulation of wave run up for a rapidly rising tide this section focuses on how various parameters affect the wave run up height a specific test case was chosen from the test set ep04 elongated pulse given in table 4 and simulated in the hybrid model wave height is fixed as 0 04 m while the wave period is adjusted the waves propagate over different slopes and their run up height is estimated using the hybrid model fig 16 shows the domain used for the test case the wave evolution on a milder slope 1 40 of the same wave ep04 with t 30s no 4 in table 4 is presented in fig 17 each of the lines marks the spatial instances as the wave propagates over the slope here spilling wave breaking was observed which occurred after t 66 970 s for most of the test conditions reported in this section the wave either climbs the shore as gentle surging or undergo slight spilling depending upon the wave amplitude and the slope angle the numerically estimated run up was compared to available analytical formulas for non breaking waves to asses the quality of the simulation analytical formulas especially those confirmed by the experiments synolakis 1987 form a reliable tool for estimating the run up of solitons eqs 22 and 23 describe the shape of the soliton in shallow water in terms of its height h and period t respectively 22 η x h sech 2 3 h 4 d x d 23 η t 1 g 4 π d 3 t 2 sech 2 2 π t t the synolakis 1987 formula for the maximum run up height r max on a plane beach with respect to the initial wave height h has the following form 24 r m a x h 2 8312 cot α h d 1 4 it was observed during the studies presented in sriram et al 2016 that the one parameter equation eq 24 was limited to solitonic solutions and not generally applicable to waves with freely chosen wave heights and periods since the parameters of solitons wave height h period t and the water depth of the flume d are interrelated see eq 22 and 23 the right hand side of eq 24 for the initial wave height was re written for the wave period 25 r m a x h 2 8312 cot α 1 g d 4 π d 3 t 2 1 4 eq 25 can be called the modified synolakis formula it contains two parameters the wave height and period and can serve as a two parameter model it was already used in sriram et al 2016 to evaluate the run up height of elongated pulses here alternatively we also use a two parameter model based on the parameterization of several bell shaped pulses proposed in didenkulova 2009 26 r m a x h 3 5 l λ s 3 5 cot α d g d t s in eq 26 the maximum run up height r max is expressed as a function of significant wave period t s defined at the 2 3 level of the maximum wave height tests cases simulated in the hybrid model are presented in table 4 along with the estimated maximum run up height the run up over the slope was determined by tracking the propagation of the free surface along the slope while analyzing the generated waves it was found that they deviated from the classic sech 2 shape and needed some adjustments and re definition of the wave period in order to be compared with analytical formulas the best fit between the generated waves and sech2 profile was calculated and the corresponding period of the fitted sech2 wave was used in eq 25 the period t s used in eq 26 was estimated at the 2 3 level of the maximum wave height of the initially generated wave these newly defined period can be found in table 5 fig 18 shows the maximum run up measurements from the present hybrid model for the non breaking and breaking cases corresponds to spilling the solid black line depicts eq 24 for h 4 cm the corresponding solitonic wave period for this case is 12s which is much smaller than for considered test cases alternatively the run up of solitary like waves with amplitude h 4 cm and periods t 33 8 s solid blue line t 65 s solid green line and t 99 s solid red line described by eq 25 is also plotted and the dashed lines represent the parameterized analytical solution by didenkulova 2009 see eq 26 for h 4 cm and t s 7 0 s blue dashed line t s 13 6 s green dashed line and t s 22 4 s red dashed line both analytical solutions give similar predictions of wave run up height which are also in a relatively good agreement with the simulations for waves of shorter periods t 30 s and t 50 s one can also clearly see the effect of spilling breaking manifested in the reduction of the wave amplification on gentle slopes the results of simulations agree well with the analytical predictions for steeper slopes applies to slopes 1 10 and 1 15 for t 30 s while starting from the slope 1 20 there is an abrupt reduction in the wave run up height which is related to the spilling breaking effects a similar situation was observed for waves with t 50 s for these waves the reduction is not so abrupt and starts at the slope 1 50 note that we assume the slope to be gentle enough to contain at least a half of the wavelength therefore for longer waves t 70 s the analytical predictions are not so good also two analytical formulas eq 25 and eq 26 show a higher discrepancy for waves of larger periods overall it can be said that the hybrid numerical model is in reasonable agreement with analytical predictions for non breaking waves and the deviations are mainly due to occasional spilling breaking scenarios 2 4 undular bore evolution and breaking over a slope in the previous sections the elongated pulse wave approaching the slope as a rapidly rising tide and climbing over different slopes were simulated wave amplitudes in these test cases were very small so the waves were mostly non breaking and only the slight spilling breaking was addressed this is a good test to show the capability of the meshfree methods to model the small amplitude waves the real advantage of the meshfree method is its capability to model the strong wave breaking or a bore in this section the undular bore formation and its plunging breaking over a slope are reported in order to simulate the undular bore the simulations need to be carried out for a large domain and over long durations in these scenarios the hybrid model can be effectively used the same case ep12 wherein the splitting of waves was observed was simulated for a slope 1 20 to show the capability of the present hybrid model to simulate wave breaking to simulate the present case a new set up as shown in fig 19 was used the water depth was kept as 1 00 m and the flat part of the domain is 210 00 m long which ends with a slope of 1 20 the waves generated in the fem side of the domain travel over the long flat part and then propagated over the slope in the earlier observations it was noticed that the wave shape changes as the wave travels over a longer distance case 3 in table 1 over 100 00 m this is visible in figs 8 and 11 similar changes were also observed in this simulation the free surface elevations measured at different locations along the numerical wave tank are presented in fig 20 the wave shape changes and the wave steepness increases while the wave travels over a flat bottom in fig 20 the evolution of the wave in the ns mlpg side as the wave travels in the presence and absence of the slope is reported as expected the wave steepness increases gradually over the slope when compared to a flat bottom the wave probes were kept at 1 00 m interval the focus of this test case is the run up of the formed undular bore over the slope fig 22 presents the spatial evolution of this process at various time instances during the simulation the red colour denotes free surface nodes from the fnpt domain and the blue colour corresponds to free surface particles from the mlpg domain from fig 22 the disintegration of the original elongated pulse into two waves can be seen at t 82 s as waves travel further the separation becomes more prominent and the steepness of waves increases this can be seen in figs 20 and 22 the phenomenon is observed even before the wave reaches the slope as the wave propagates over the slope the 1st wave breaks following plunging scenario as shown in fig 23 next the broken wave runs up quickly within 5s and then the 2nd wave breaks forming a bore and starts travelling up the slope as shown in fig 24 the observation is in agreement with the threshold criteria defined by pelinovsky et al 2015 for bore formation i e hd d 1 3 corresponds to an undular bore formation and hd d 1 7 corresponds to a breaking bore formation here hd denotes the height of the bore from the sea bottom thus when the initial wave propagates over the flat bottom the hd d 1 3 i e hd is 1 12 m with d as 1 m results in an undular bore formation and later on the 2nd wave propagates over a slope on top of the 1st wave the water depth in this case is rather small and is defined by the water remaining on the slope after the passage of the 1st wave therefore the threshold will become higher than 1 7 and the 2nd wave develops into a breaking bore on the slope see figs 21 and 24 in order to capture this the number of nodes used in the mlpg domain is about 10900 for 10 m distance in the initial sloping region at rest the maximum inundation for this case is shown in fig 25 which is 8 m the corresponding maximum run up height is 0 4 m which gives almost 4 times the amplification of the initial 12 cm wave at the coast further this test case was compared to the rapidly rising tide ep 04 simulated on the domain given in fig 19 the small amplitude ep 04 does not disintegrate and does not form undular bore it runs up the coast as a single wave undergoing spilling breaking and inundating the slope for over 2 m even though the period of the generated waves was similar the scenarios they undergo during propagation and run up are quite different also the inundation and run up of these waves cannot be explained simply by considering initial wave height for the 4 cm wave the inundation is 2 m while for 3 times higher 12 cm wave the inundation is 8 m which is more than 3 times higher 2 4 1 computational time one of the advantages of the hybrid model is the computational time from the prior experience working with pure particle based models and weakly coupled mesh based models manoj kumar and sriram 2017 the two factors that govern computational time in particle methods are the number of particles used in the simulation and the time step since the number of particles involved in the simulation is directly proportional to the time required for computation reducing the number of particles in the simulation can accelerate the process thus by expertly manipulating the domain a rapid saving in computational time can be achieved as explained in the earlier sections the hybrid model has both mesh based and particle based solution techniques in all the test cases performed a significant part of the domain was solved using the mesh based fem solver the particle method mlpg r based approach was only used in regions where wave deformation run up and breaking was expected based on the flow chart denoted in fig 3 calculations must be carried out in both fnpt and mlpg r domain at every time step when the wave is generated in this case at the fnpt domain on one side of the flume the rest of the flume remains relatively calm the condition mentioned above is quite evident while testing waves of the elongated pulse kind depending on the celerity the wave takes considerable time to cover the large domain around 180 00 m 220 00 m in effect if both the equations are solved simultaneously as per the flow chart for a significant duration the stationary fluid domain is solved in the domain represented by mlpg r this is not required based on this understanding three test cases were formulated the relative performance of the three test cases is presented in the computational performance of the models was compared based on the actual time required for solving one timestep the results are given in table 6 this study shows that the hybrid model is faster than the full particle method further based approach and bringing in additional tweaks can reduce the computational cost further down the results show a reasonable comparison thus the hybrid model can be used as a fast and reliable tool to solve similar problems in coastal engineering table 6 the case 2074 given in table 3 was simulated in all the three tests the wave elevation was measured at wave probe 16 the full mlpg case 1 in the computational performance of the models was compared based on the actual time required for solving one timestep the results are given in table 6 this study shows that the hybrid model is faster than the full particle method further based approach and bringing in additional tweaks can reduce the computational cost further down the results show a reasonable comparison thus the hybrid model can be used as a fast and reliable tool to solve similar problems in coastal engineering table 6 was used as a benchmark and the error was estimated as given in eq 27 27 e r r o r m a x η c a s e 1 η c a s e 2 o r c a s e 3 η c a s e 1 the computational performance of the models was compared based on the actual time required for solving one timestep the results are given in table 6 this study shows that the hybrid model is faster than the full particle method further based approach and bringing in additional tweaks can reduce the computational cost further down the results show a reasonable comparison thus the hybrid model can be used as a fast and reliable tool to solve similar problems in coastal engineering 3 conclusion the estimation of wave run up has a critical role in any infrastructure development projects in proximity to the coastal zones in the present study a 2d hybrid numerical model was used to estimate the run up of tsunami like waves and to understand their propagation and evolution over a long distance the method was able to simulate the propagation of long elongated pulse waves and split up for small and steep waves good agreement with the laboratory measurements is obtained further the numerical model is validated using a new set of measurements for the run up of solitary waves from the large scale experiments analysis of wave propagation and run up on a slope is carried out for two different scenarios a rapidly rising tide which included wave surging and spilling breaking and b undular bore formation and its plunging breaking the wave propagation evolution and run up were investigated for the above two cases the method presented in this article seems to be superior with less number of nodes to capture the small amplitude wave run up which is not feasible in most of the existing particle method a comparison with analytical formulas for run up height also substantiates this effect for studying the long waves propagating and splitting into a series of soliton one needs either euler based model or fnpt however coupling this with lagrangian ns model and applying for longwave propagations and run up is not attempted so far if one needs to simulate the laboratory model scale then potential flow theory irrotational can be used at the far end as shown in this paper otherwise for all practical purpose and mathematical continuity coupling with a rotational flow model euler equations with ns model is recommended based on the present simulations it is shown that the synolakis formulae modified for single pulses and used in sriram et al 2016 and didenkulova 2009 formulae for parameterized bell shaped pulses can be used to estimate run up of long waves which follow rapidly raising tide scenario the run up of the undular bore over the slope leads to the multiple wave breaking the criteria proposed by pelinovsky et al 2015 for the undular and breaking bore with respect to hd d is in agreement with the simulation results the run up of the first wave is the largest one 0 4 m and leads to about the 4 times amplification of the initial wave height of 12 cm on the slope for comparison the run up height of the 4 cm wave with the same period climbing the same slope but undergoing the rapidly raising tide scenario is 0 1 m which gives only 2 5 times amplification of the initial wave height on the slope finally the present hybrid model can be effectively used for the study of wave propagation run up and breaking for considerable distances and long duration instead of running the full navier stokes model wherein the special treatment is required to avoid numerical damping for long duration propagation and substantial computational time however the present model does not incorporate turbulence and air entrapment two phase for breaking waves further for practical scenarios 3d studies need to be carried out this will be considered in our future studies using the hybrid 3d boussinesq ns model which is under development credit authorship contribution

21956,a savonius turbine is a vertical axis hydrokinetic turbine vaht utilizes in low speed channels and rivers in comparison with the other hydrokinetic turbines the savonius turbine is simple in construction and installation and involves less installation cost however these turbines have low torque and power coefficients in comparison with other hydrokinetic turbines the idea of this paper is utilizing a simple barrier to deviate the fluid flow from the reversing bucket of the savonius turbine to enhance its generated power in order to investigate the most appropriate length of the barrier numerical modeling has been performed by applying computational fluid dynamics cfd the continuity reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations and the sst transition turbulence model are numerically solved the validation of the numerical simulation is assessed based on the experimental data of sandia laboratories and the results indicated good agreement with experimental data thereupon the model is utilized for optimizing the length of the barrier in various cases the power coefficient of different cases is compared with the obstacle less conventional savonius turbine the results of this analysis reveal that utilizing a barrier in its optimum length increases the maximum generated power by about 18 percent keywords savonius hydrokinetic turbine low speed flow deflector numerical modeling optimization 1 introduction increasing fossil fuel consumption global warming and the necessity of providing a higher portion of our required primary energy from renewable energy sources are the main reasons which make renewable energies attractive hydro energy is one of the most cost effective and reliable sources amongst other renewable energies the conventional hydro technology harnesses the power of the water s potential energy by storing the water behind dams however hydrokinetic turbines collect the kinetic energy of the flow at much reduced power densities birjandi et al 2013 hydrokinetic turbines do not require dams or extensive facilities for installation therefore these turbines are more applicable for remote power generation current water turbines generate electricity by converting the kinetic energy of natural resources of water by using various types of rotors these rotors are installed on the riversides or free flow paths these turbines also can be considered for different current based flow paths such as the oceans and river tidal currents behrouzi et al 2016 several designs exist to extract energy from current based turbines type of hydrokinetic turbines can be characterized based on the alignment of the rotor axis with respect to the water flow these turbines are categorized as horizontal axis turbines axial turbines and vertical axis turbines cross flow turbines tian et al 2016 horizontal axis hydrokinetic turbines working principle is same as wind turbines a lift force is generated as a result of fluid flowing on the rotor blades which produces torque on the turbine shaft afterward it is converted into electricity by a generator shahsavarifard et al 2015 horizontal axis turbines are mainly applied for ocean currents these turbines are not cost effective for small scale power generation mabrouki et al 2016 on the other hand vertical axis water turbines vawt which are known as the cross flow water turbine rotate around an axis which is perpendicular to the flow direction vertical turbines are generally utilized for small scale power generation jing et al 2014 these turbines are more profitable comparing to the horizontal axis water turbines due to their lower construction and maintenance costs savonius turbines helical turbines darrieus turbines and h shaped darrieus are the most conventional vertical axis turbines behrouzi et al 2014 the savonius turbine is one of the simplest turbines in manufacturing in that initially developed for converting wind energy by a finnish engineer sigurd johannes savonius in 1922 bikas et al 2014 this turbine is utilized as a vertical turbine to exploit hydrokinetic energy and convert its energy into the electricity kumar and saini 2016 the savonius turbine can be used in intermediate to shallow water depths tutar and veci 2016 oscillating water column devices and wave energy converters ram et al 2010 prasad et al 2014 the main driving force of the savonius rotor is drag force as concave surface has higher drag force than the convex surface hence making the rotor to rotate the betz limit of a drag base turbine which illustrates the maximum efficiency of an open flow turbine is approximately 59 3 so different techniques have been proposed by researchers to enhance the performance coefficient of the savonius turbines wong et al 2017 fujisawa and gotoh 1992 experimentally studied the flow in and around a savonius rotor by flow visualization it is shown that reducing the drag force of the returning blade can increase the net driving force this could be caused by deploying an obstacle in the flow path against the returning blade in fact the output power of a savonius rotor can be augmented by reducing the fluid resistance encountered by the convex surface of the returning blade as a consequence the resultant drag acting on the rotor leads to improvement in power output by reducing the reverse torque on the returning blade golecha et al 2011 hitherto various obstacle based augmentation techniques like curtain designs windshields convergent nozzle and deflector plates have been represented in different literature and the influence of utilizing an obstacle in front of a savonius turbine has been investigated roy and saha 2013 in the following some important researches are discussed with the aims of improving the low aerodynamic performance of savonius rotor and reducing the negative torque in the savonius rotor altan and atılgan 2010 investigated the performance of static torque of a conventional savonius rotor and designed a novel curtain arrangement to improve the turbine power coefficient afterward three different curtain lengths were examined both experimentally and numerically so it was observed that long curtain dimensions provide significantly higher static torque values from the study the curtain at its optimum angle increases the power coefficient by about 38 5 but reduces the operational range of the rotor golecha et al 2011 carried out an experimental investigation on the performance improvement of a modified savonius rotor by providing a deflector plate on the returning blade side at a tip speed ratio of 0 82 and in the presence of the deflector plate the maximum coefficient of power was found to be 0 21 for investigating the influence of deflector plate at the optimal position two and three stage modified savonius rotors were tested for two stage savonius rotor with deflector plate in 0 and 90 phase shift the maximum coefficient of power was improved by 42 and 31 respectively for the three stage modified savonius rotor with the deflector plate the maximum coefficient of power was enhanced by 17 mohamed et al 2011 worked on a concept to improve both savonius turbine output power and the static torque which demonstrates the self starting capability of the turbine they used an obstacle shielding at the returning blade side in order to achieve both objectives the geometry of the blade shape was optimized in the presence of the obstacle plate the optimization process was realized by numerical simulation utilizing an in house optimization code the output power coefficient was set as the target function and six free parameters which indicated three free points on the bucket to form the bucket shape were considered in the optimization process the results have shown that the power coefficient enhanced by almost 40 at the tip speed ratio of 0 7 in comparison with conventional savonius turbine furthermore the static torque was studied and found to be positive at any angle and high enough to obtain self starting conditions el askari et al el askary et al 2015 considered a new design to catch the incoming fluid flow to create flow jets towards the advancing bucket and prevent the returning bucket from meeting upstream fluid flow the study proposed three methods to control fluid flow direction in order to enhance the performance of the savonius rotor by reducing the negative torque and improving positive torque the suggested designs enhanced the performance of the savonius rotor so that one of the designs reached a power coefficient of 0 52 at the tip speed ratio of 1 the effect of a wind booster which is a device that controls the fluid flow around a vertical axis wind turbine on a savonius rotor has been studied by korprasertsak and leephakpreeda utilizing both real experiment and cfd simulation korprasertsak and leephakpreeda 2016 the results showed that the specially designed wind booster is able to increase the savonius rotor angular speed under no load conditions and to improve its performance at low speed fluid flow conditions the results also demonstrated that a savonius rotor incorporated with an optimized wind booster yields the power coefficient of 0 55 at its maximum peak yet this enhancement is highly dependent on the flow velocity kailash et al 2012 increased the net driving force of a savonius water turbine by reducing the reverse force on the returning blade this improvement has been made by providing a flow obstacle next to the returning blade besides the optimum position of this obstacle has been examined by an experimental setup the results revealed that utilizing the obstacle enhances the performance coefficient of the savonius hydrokinetic turbine to 0 21 at the tip speed ratio of 0 82 other similar techniques have also been used by researchers to increase the performance coefficients of the savonius water turbines a l manganhar manganhar et al 2019 suggested a rotor house to amplify the flow velocity magnitude inside a three blade savonius rotor zone a h elbatran elbatran et al 2017 used a ducted nozzle and increased the power coefficient of the savonius turbines b wahyudi and s adiwidodo wahyudi and adiwidodo 2017 used two different deflector tangential and radial with a savonius tandem blade and examined the improvement of the savonius hydrokinetic turbines performance due to the use of these barriers by numerical and experimental means the literature review demonstrated the role of utilizing an obstacle in the savonius turbine improvement such an improvement is more favorable in hydrokinetic savonius turbine which is encountered with a fixed water flow direction in comparison with the savonius wind turbine with an unpredictable flow direction although the aforementioned curtain designs would enhance the savonius turbine performance the ease of fabrication and installation have not been considered in their designs therefore in this paper a new design of an obstacle for improving the performance of the savonius hydrokinetic rotors is introduced this barrier has a simple design and is easy to install on the turbine set which makes it more functional in addition utilizing this barrier would further increase the generated power of the turbine furthermore several numerical studies have been conducted to optimize the length of the barrier in order to reach the best performance of the rotors 2 numerical methodology in this research the finite volume method is utilized for solving the conservation equations of the turbulent fluid flow on the savonius turbine to calculate the generated torque of the savonius turbine in the first step the turbine geometry was discretized using structured and unstructured meshes in the next step the conservation equations of mass and momentum along with the turbulence equations were solved numerically details of each of these equations and numerical methods are discussed below and finally the amount of torque was calculated by obtaining the amount of shear and compressive forces on the turbine surface momentum and mass conservation equations have been used here as governing equations eqs 1 2 represent mass and momentum conservation respectively 1 u 0 2 ρ d u d t p i τ where ρ is the density of the fluid u is the velocity in

turbulence model was applied this model was already successfully used in similar studies shaheen et al 2015 lanzafame et al 2014 the sst transition turbulence model is based on sst k ω transport equations coupled with two additional transport equations one for intermittency γ eq 6 and the other for transition reynolds number r e θ t eq 7 menter et al 2006a 2006b lodefier et al 2004 langtry et al 2006a 2006b sørensen 2009 the intermittency is defined as the fraction of time when the flow is turbulent and is equal to 1 and 0 in turbulent and laminar flow respectively the transition onset momentum thickness reynolds number can be described as the point where the velocity profile first starts to deviate from an entirely laminar one kumar and sarkar 2016 6 ρ γ t ρ u j γ x j p γ 1 e γ 1 p

viscosity and turbulent viscosity respectively r e θ t is transition reynolds number and u j and x j are the velocity in j direction and cartesian direction j respectively these two equations were implemented by menter and langtry menter et al 2006a 2006b langtry et al 2006a they used some proprietary empirical correlations to allow proper closure of the model and coupled these equations with the sst shear stress transport turbulence model which is a combination of the k ε and k ω models and uses the k ε model in the free flow and the k ω model close to the walls in the boundary layer of the stream these equations lead to a more realistic prediction of boundary layer behavior above all of the transition from laminar to turbulent since separated flow and stall are phenomena which are strictly related to boundary layer behavior the sst transitional model should be able to predict these phenomena better which is critical for savonius blades 2 2 calculation of performance coefficients in order to compare the performance of any turbine some non dimensional coefficients are utilized three of these universally used non dimensional entities are considered in this study the power coefficient c p describes the energy conversion efficiency of the turbine torque coefficient c t is a non dimensional representation of rotor torque which is proportional to power produced also

numerical model are evaluated based on the experimental data in 1977 a series of experimental tests on the two and three bucket savonius turbine were conducted by robert e sheldahl in sandia laboratories sheldahl et al 1978 therefore a two bucket savonius turbine geometry is opted from the report and utilized to develop and validate the introduced numerical model the selected geometry is shown in fig 1 and the turbine characteristics are listed in table 1 in the next step for domain discretization a 2d mesh with both quadrilateral and triangular elements was built the structure of the grid is shown in fig 2 the mesh consists of two parts the first is a rotating zone that is circumscribed by the interface and the other is the fixed domain no slip boundary condition is used in all the rotor walls the inlet condition same as the experimental condition is set with a uniform velocity of 7 m s corresponding to nominal reynolds number per unit length of 4 32 105 at the outlet the static gauge pressure considered to be zero and a free slip boundary condition was applied for the other two external boundaries the generated grid is built with a combination of the structured and unstructured elements the domain near the turbine s wall is discretized using unstructured triangular elements in that more density of mesh elements is imposed to the boundary layer of the buckets with rectangular cells so that y 1 which is required by the turbulence model the generated mesh in the fixed domain is built with rectangular cells to make the mesh size controllable and improve the mesh quality in the respective areas furthermore the grid independency has been assessed by a series of primary numerical simulations with various levels of refinement of mesh the mesh density was varied from 14000 to 220000 elements by adding about 30000 elements in each level and the static or nonrotating torques of the buckets at rotor angle of 0 is obtained from the numerical analysis comparing the calculated static torque in each level showed that a mesh with approximately 150 000 elements was sufficient due to the insensitivity of the obtained results which was below 1 by extra refinements in the next step the validation process was carried out at first a steady state flow simulation is done to set up the flow domain to reasonable parametric values the rotating reference frame technique is used in this step such that the convergence criteria for rms residuals of continuity momentum and turbulence quantities were set to 10 5 in the following fully implicit time advancement scheme is applied by using a sliding mesh model smm in order to visualize the unsteady characteristics of the wake flow behind the rotor and a transient sst turbulent model for analyzing the generated eddy the discretization methods for the equations are shown in table 2 due to the unsteady nature of the generated torque by the savonius turbine the time step size is selected corresponding to the turbine rotation of 1 00 so the torque values were recorded at each time step the process continued until the recorded torque showed quasi steady behavior finally the average quantities of the performance coefficients were obtained using eq 8 in the following the same process has been done for determining the torque and power coefficients at different tsrs obtained results of the numerical simulations and experimental data are shown in fig 3 the represented results in fig 3 show that the average of the relative errors between the numerical and experimental results are within approximately 6 the maximum deviation is generated at the tip speed ratio of 0 8 while the values obtained at lower and higher tip speed ratio show a lower percentage error in order to determine the accuracy of the results the coefficient of correlation r 2 is utilized which is calculated from eq 9 maindonald and braun 2006 9 r 2 1 ϕ e x p ϕ p r e d 2 ϕ e x p ϕ e x p 2 where 10 ϕ e x p i 1 n ϕ e x p r i m e n t a l n the value of the coefficient of correlation has been calculated about 0 95 which is a strong positive quantity and shows the good accuracy of the numerical results therefore it is acceptable to use the sst transition turbulence model and the other terms utilized in the process of the validation to predict the performance of a low reynolds number hydrokinetic savonius rotor 4 problem description a conventional savonius turbine is made up of two semi cylinders advancing and returning bucket between two horizontal discs with symmetrical position relative to the centerline the difference between the exerted forces on the convex surface of the reversing bucket and concave surface of the advancing bucket causes the savonius turbine to spin the more reduction of generated torque by the reversing bucket the more enhancement of the savonius turbine net efficiency this incident is more applicable in water channel flow with the fixed stream direction accordingly a deviation in fluid flow from the reversing bucket practically enhances the performance of a hydrokinetic savonius turbine in the present study a numerical analysis has been carried out to identify the influence of a deflector on hydrokinetic savonius turbine s performance one of the most important criteria for designing a deflector is its simple construction and installation to avoid complicating the primary savonius rotor fig 4 shows the basic design of the deflector this deflector is a quadrant surface and is designed to be fixed in front of the reversing bucket so the streamlines entering the convex surface would be diminished and the total net torque produced by the turbine would be enhanced the clearance between the barrier and the bucket is 0 05d that is referenced to the dimension of the stator disks of the savonius turbine 1 1d which was utilized in the experimental model the quadrant surface is a basic design for the power generated by the savonius turbine can be affected by the length of the barrier as shown in fig 4 the quadrant surface is divided into nine sectors to evaluate the influence of the barrier length on the rotor performance each sector has about 0 093 m length and covers π 18 radian of the quadrant barrier therefore changing the length of the barrier become conceivable by the presence or absence of each sector various layouts of the nine sectors of the barrier yield different effects on turbine performance accordingly each layout is entitled uniquely to categorize them in different cases in the numerical modeling process the number of the beginning and the end of each arc is used to name each of these cases for example case 3 6 contains all sectors of 3 4 5 and 6 in order to optimize the length of the barrier the numerical modeling process has been carried out with the aforementioned conditions in the validation section at three different tsrs of 0 4 0 8 and 1 2 the dimensions of the model turbine have been set same as the experimental test the conservative equations mass and momentum along with sst transitional turbulence model is utilized to simulate the effects of the different layout of the designed barrier on the savonius turbine performance the reynolds number of the fluid flow is considered to be identical to the reynolds number per unit length of the experimental model accordingly the water flow velocity is considered to be 0 48 m s the rotational speed of the turbine is also set based on the tsr of 0 4 0 8 and 1 2 in each sequence to reduce the computational cost in the optimization process a dynamic boundary condition is imposed on each sector of the barrier in this method the initial boundary condition of each sector is set as an interface between the two adjacent sub domains so no deviation on flow streamlines is appeared by the sector on the other hand each sector acts as a no slip wall if it is opted to influence the fluid flow the other terms of the numerical simulations like boundary conditions discretization methods and the procedure of the numerical analysis are set identical to the validation section 5 results and discussions the numerical model described previously employed to find the best layout of the barrier different lengths in various cases have been evaluated to optimize the dimensions of the barrier each case induces different impacts on rotor performance thus the net generated torque of each case is calculated over time and its characteristics are compared with the other cases fig 5 demonstrates the power coefficient of some cases at different tip speed ratios as it is shown in fig 5 setting up different layouts of the barrier alter the torque coefficient of the savonius turbine in comparison with the base case which is the conventional savonius turbine without any augmentation techniques the impact of different cases on the turbine performance varies at different tsrs the topmost power coefficient is achieved by case 4 6 which means deploying the barrier from section 4 to 6 at tsr of 0 8 however compared to case 4 6 case 3 8 and case 5 6 have a greater influence on turbine performance at tsr of 0 4 and 1 2 respectively in fact increasing the angular velocity of the turbine which yields higher tsr reduces the improvement rate induced by case 3 8 at tsr of 0 4 yet enhances the influence of the case 4 6 at tsr of 0 8 subsequently as the angular velocity increases the effect of case 4 6 reduces and case 5 6 becomes dominant in other words by increasing the tsr the optimum length of the barrier tends to dwindle and slightly shifts in a counter clockwise direction it is noteworthy that some cases like case 2 8 even decrease the torque coefficient of the savonius rotor comparing with the base case at tsr of 0 8 and 1 2 while these cases have a positive impact on turbine performance at tsr of 0 4 as it is shown in fig 5 by deploying case 4 6 at tsr of 0 8 the torque coefficient increases by 19 in comparison with the base case based on the literature review this enhancement is lower than some augmentation techniques which was proposed by other researchers nonetheless those techniques are not applicable except using some complex structures like specific blade profile long curtains or meander duct nuzzle in return deploying the circular barrier with case 4 6 layout which is fixed to the stator of the turbine not only does not impose any complexity to the turbine set but it also enhances the torque coefficient significantly in order to assess this enhancement the generated torque as a function of flow time and the torque coefficient as a function of azimuth angle are depicted in fig 6 for both case 4 6 and the base case as it is shown in fig 6 case 4 6 exhibits superior characteristics to the base case and increases the torque coefficient at almost all azimuth angles yet this enhancement is not uniform at each angle and becomes more enlightened in the vicinity of the torque maxima deploying the case 4 6 in front of the savonius turbine increases both the minimum and maximum of the generated torque curve the maximum and minimum value of the generated torque produced by the turbine is 31 1 and 0 6 n m in the base case respectively while utilizing the case 4 6 enhances these quantities to 37 7 and 2 9 n m respectively fig 7 shows the instantaneous pressure field in and around the savonius rotor deployed with the case 4 6 and the base case in the rotational angle of the minimum generated torque at tsr of 0 8 the primary effect of the barrier is reducing the negative drag force on the savonius turbine while all the illustrated streamlines flow through the reversing bucket in the base case the barrier case 4 6 diverts the fluid flow so diminishes the pressure distribution on the convex surface of the bucket and reduces the stagnation force on the rotor furthermore the barrier shifts the stagnation point toward the trailing edge of the reversing bucket this reduces the moment of the reversing bucket drag force on the turbine rotor and enhances the net generated torque besides relocation of the stagnation point intensifies the smooth pressure drop along the trailing edge of the reversing bucket this phenomenon expedites the accelerated flow incidence on the front side of the reversing blade so aggravates the pressure region developed on the concave side of the advancing blade and reinforces the lifting force on the turbine these factors lead to a higher torque generation induced by case 4 6 in comparison with the base case and enhance the net generated torque by almost four times at this rotational angle fig 8 shows the pressure contour of the case 4 6 and the base case in the rotational angle of the maximum generated torque at this spot as noted earlier the main effect of the barrier is the flow streamlines deflection away from the convex side of the reversing bucket such deviation decreases the stagnation flow rate through the reversing bucket so reduces the negative torque in addition the pressure distribution gradient over the barrier induces a vortex circulation aft the barrier the circulation of the vortex also helps to a more flow deviation which enhances the density of the streamlines through the advancing bucket and subsequently increases the high pressure distribution near the concave surface of the advancing bucket on the other hand it can be inferred from the torque coefficient polar graph fig 6 and also by comparing case 4 6 and the base case in fig 8 that utilizing case 4 6 results in a phase difference at the torque maxima in other words the azimuth angle of the maximum torque spot for the case 4 6 is greater than the base case this phenomenon reduces the relative angular difference between the tip velocity vector of the advancing bucket and the velocity vector of the free stream which yields a higher lift coefficient these factors enhance the net generated torque of the case 4 6 by about 21 at this rotational angle as it is shown in fig 5 other layouts also boost the performance of the savonius turbine yet the maximum enhancement is obtained by utilizing the case 4 6 both decreasing and increasing the length of the barrier with the case 4 6 layout are led to a lower torque coefficient and even less than the torque coefficient of the base case the remarkable thing is that while some protracted layouts have a lower power coefficient at tsr of 0 8 they have a better influence on turbine performance at other tsrs in comparison with the case 4 6 in the following in order to assess this phenomenon the effects of case 3 7 on the fluid flow and turbine performance is investigated and compared with case 4 6 the layout of case 3 7 has been designed by extending the case 4 6 with a sector in both counter clockwise and clockwise direction utilizing this barrier increases the power coefficient by about 6 percent in comparison with the base case at tsr of 0 8 this is about one third of the enhancement rate attained by case 4 6 fig 9 illustrates the comparison of the generated torque of the savonius rotor as a function of flow time between case 4 6 and the case 3 7 layouts the results indicate that the maximum and minimum generated torque is decreased significantly in the case 3 7 in comparison with the case 4 6 in order to assess the reduction of the maximum and minimum generated torque in the case 3 7 compared to the case 4 6 the turbulence intensity of these two cases are depicted in fig 10 as it is shown in fig 10 extending the barrier in a clockwise direction strengthens the vortex at the aft of the leading edge of the barrier it is considered that the formation of this vortex contributes to a higher pressure field contiguous to the advancing bucket however in case 3 7 the vortex detaches from the barrier by rotating the turbine according to fig 10 a3 convection of such circulation through the rotor along with the shedding vortex of the convex side of the reversing bucket disrupts the coanda like flow pattern along the advancing bucket concave side subsequently this decreases the drag coefficient of the advancing bucket the higher turbulence intensity along the concave side of the advancing bucket also weakens the overlap flow so reduces the amplitude of the lateral force on the other hand extending the barrier in a counter clockwise direction increases the turbulence intensity between the reversing bucket and the barrier this phenomenon which is illustrated in fig 10 a4 reduces the dragging flow which is the fluid flow from the convex side of the advancing bucket to the reversing bucket concave side and diminishes the returning effect of the reversing bucket these factors lead to a decrease in torque generation by case 3 7 in comparison with case 4 6 and supposed to be strengthened by adding extra sectors to case 3 7 so that results in a lower torque coefficient 6 conclusion in this study a circular barrier is set on the stator of a hydrokinetic savonius turbine without detracting its inherent simplicity this study aims to investigate the influence of this barrier on the performance of the savonius turbine the conservation equations of mass and momentum are solved using the finite volume method the sst transition model is utilized to describe the turbulence of the fluid flow around the savonius hydrokinetic rotor the validation process is carried out with sandia laboratories experimental data the correlation coefficient is calculated and demonstrated good agreement of the obtained results with experimental data for analyzing the influence of the barrier on turbine efficiency a quadrant barrier is deployed to deflect the fluid flow from the convex side of the reversing bucket afterward this quadrant barrier is divided into nine sectors and the effects of different layouts of these sectors on the turbine performances are investigated in distinct cases based on the results utilizing the barrier with the case 4 6 layout which means deploying the deflector from section 4 to 6 enhances the torque coefficient about 19 compared to the base case at the tip speed ratio of 0 8 the pressure contour has illustrated that utilizing the case 4 6 reduces average pressure distribution on the convex side of the reversing bucket and increases the number of streamlines entering the concave surface of the advancing bucket so the maximum and minimum of the generated torque are increased by about 400 and 21 respectively evaluating the other layouts have demonstrated that increasing the length of the barrier in a counter clockwise direction decreases the dragging flow so diminishes the returning effect of the reversing bucket besides increasing the length of the barrier in a clockwise direction intensifies the vortex shedding at the aft of the barrier and reduces the uniformity of the fluid flow through the advancing bucket and accordingly decreases the torque coefficient compared to the optimum layout credit authorship contribution statement hossein alizadeh data curation visualization writing original draft software methodology validation mohammad

modeling optimization 1 introduction increasing fossil fuel consumption global warming and the necessity of providing a higher portion of our required primary energy from renewable energy sources are the main reasons which make renewable energies attractive hydro energy is one of the most cost effective and reliable sources amongst other renewable energies the conventional hydro technology harnesses the power of the water s potential energy by storing the water behind dams however hydrokinetic turbines collect the kinetic energy of the flow at much reduced power densities birjandi et al 2013 hydrokinetic turbines do not require dams or extensive facilities for installation therefore these turbines are more applicable for remote power generation current water turbines generate electricity by converting the kinetic energy of natural resources of water by using various types of rotors these rotors are installed on the riversides or free flow paths these turbines also can be considered for different current based flow paths such as the oceans and river tidal currents behrouzi et al 2016 several designs exist to extract energy from current based turbines type of hydrokinetic turbines can be characterized based on the alignment of the rotor axis with respect to the water flow these turbines are categorized as horizontal axis turbines axial turbines and vertical axis turbines cross flow turbines tian et al 2016 horizontal axis hydrokinetic turbines working principle is same as wind turbines a lift force is generated as a result of fluid flowing on the rotor blades which produces torque on the turbine shaft afterward it is converted into electricity by a generator shahsavarifard et al 2015 horizontal axis turbines are mainly applied for ocean currents these turbines are not cost effective for small scale power generation mabrouki et al 2016 on the other hand vertical axis water turbines vawt which are known as the cross flow water turbine rotate around an axis which is perpendicular to the flow direction vertical turbines are generally utilized for small scale power generation jing et al 2014 these turbines are more profitable comparing to the horizontal axis water turbines due to their lower construction and maintenance costs savonius turbines helical turbines darrieus turbines and h shaped darrieus are the most conventional vertical axis turbines behrouzi et al 2014 the savonius turbine is one of the simplest turbines in manufacturing in that initially developed for converting wind energy by a finnish engineer sigurd johannes savonius in 1922 bikas et al 2014 this turbine is utilized as a vertical turbine to exploit hydrokinetic energy and convert its energy into the electricity kumar and saini 2016 the savonius turbine can be used in intermediate to shallow water depths tutar and veci 2016 oscillating water column devices and wave energy converters ram et al 2010 prasad et al 2014 the main driving force of the savonius rotor is drag force as concave surface has higher drag force than the convex surface hence making the rotor to rotate the betz limit of a drag base turbine which illustrates the maximum efficiency of an open flow turbine is approximately 59 3 so different techniques have been proposed by researchers to enhance the performance coefficient of the savonius turbines wong et al 2017 fujisawa and gotoh 1992 experimentally studied the flow in and around a savonius rotor by flow visualization it is shown that reducing the drag force of the returning blade can increase the net driving force this could be caused by deploying an obstacle in the flow path against the returning blade in fact the output power of a savonius rotor can be augmented by reducing the fluid resistance encountered by the convex surface of the returning blade as a consequence the resultant drag acting on the rotor leads to improvement in power output by reducing the reverse torque on the returning blade golecha et al 2011 hitherto various obstacle based augmentation techniques like curtain designs windshields convergent nozzle and deflector plates have been represented in different literature and the influence of utilizing an obstacle in front of a savonius turbine has been investigated roy and saha 2013 in the following some important researches are discussed with the aims of improving the low aerodynamic performance of savonius rotor and reducing the negative torque in the savonius rotor altan and atılgan 2010 investigated the performance of static torque of a conventional savonius rotor and designed a novel curtain arrangement to improve the turbine power coefficient afterward three different curtain lengths were examined both experimentally and numerically so it was observed that long curtain dimensions provide significantly higher static torque values from the study the curtain at its optimum angle increases the power coefficient by about 38 5 but reduces the operational range of the rotor golecha et al 2011 carried out an experimental investigation on the performance improvement of a modified savonius rotor by providing a deflector plate on the returning blade side at a tip speed ratio of 0 82 and in the presence of the deflector plate the maximum coefficient of power was found to be 0 21 for investigating the influence of deflector plate at the optimal position two and three stage modified savonius rotors were tested for two stage savonius rotor with deflector plate in 0 and 90 phase shift the maximum coefficient of power was improved by 42 and 31 respectively for the three stage modified savonius rotor with the deflector plate the maximum coefficient of power was enhanced by 17 mohamed et al 2011 worked on a concept to improve both savonius turbine output power and the static torque which demonstrates the self starting capability of the turbine they used an obstacle shielding at the returning blade side in order to achieve both objectives the geometry of the blade shape was optimized in the presence of the obstacle plate the optimization process was realized by numerical simulation utilizing an in house optimization code the output power coefficient was set as the target function and six free parameters which indicated three free points on the bucket to form the bucket shape were considered in the optimization process the results have shown that the power coefficient enhanced by almost 40 at the tip speed ratio of 0 7 in comparison with conventional savonius turbine furthermore the static torque was studied and found to be positive at any angle and high enough to obtain self starting conditions el askari et al el askary et al 2015 considered a new design to catch the incoming fluid flow to create flow jets towards the advancing bucket and prevent the returning bucket from meeting upstream fluid flow the study proposed three methods to control fluid flow direction in order to enhance the performance of the savonius rotor by reducing the negative torque and improving positive torque the suggested designs enhanced the performance of the savonius rotor so that one of the designs reached a power coefficient of 0 52 at the tip speed ratio of 1 the effect of a wind booster which is a device that controls the fluid flow around a vertical axis wind turbine on a savonius rotor has been studied by korprasertsak and leephakpreeda utilizing both real experiment and cfd simulation korprasertsak and leephakpreeda 2016 the results showed that the specially designed wind booster is able to increase the savonius rotor angular speed under no load conditions and to improve its performance at low speed fluid flow conditions the results also demonstrated that a savonius rotor incorporated with an optimized wind booster yields the power coefficient of 0 55 at its maximum peak yet this enhancement is highly dependent on the flow velocity kailash et al 2012 increased the net driving force of a savonius water turbine by reducing the reverse force on the returning blade this improvement has been made by providing a flow obstacle next to the returning blade besides the optimum position of this obstacle has been examined by an experimental setup the results revealed that utilizing the obstacle enhances the performance coefficient of the savonius hydrokinetic turbine to 0 21 at the tip speed ratio of 0 82 other similar techniques have also been used by researchers to increase the performance coefficients of the savonius water turbines a l manganhar manganhar et al 2019 suggested a rotor house to amplify the flow velocity magnitude inside a three blade savonius rotor zone a h elbatran elbatran et al 2017 used a ducted nozzle and increased the power coefficient of the savonius turbines b wahyudi and s adiwidodo wahyudi and adiwidodo 2017 used two different deflector tangential and radial with a savonius tandem blade and examined the improvement of the savonius hydrokinetic turbines performance due to the use of these barriers by numerical and experimental means the literature review demonstrated the role of utilizing an obstacle in the savonius turbine improvement such an improvement is more favorable in hydrokinetic savonius turbine which is encountered with a fixed water flow direction in comparison with the savonius wind turbine with an unpredictable flow direction although the aforementioned curtain designs would enhance the savonius turbine performance the ease of fabrication and installation have not been considered in their designs therefore in this paper a new design of an obstacle for improving the performance of the savonius hydrokinetic rotors is introduced this barrier has a simple design and is easy to install on the turbine set which makes it more functional in addition utilizing this barrier would further increase the generated power of the turbine furthermore several numerical studies have been conducted to optimize the length of the barrier in order to reach the best performance of the rotors 2 numerical methodology in this research the finite volume method is utilized for solving the conservation equations of the turbulent fluid flow on the savonius turbine to calculate the generated torque of the savonius turbine in the first step the turbine geometry was discretized using structured and unstructured meshes in the next step the conservation equations of mass and momentum along with the turbulence equations were solved numerically details of each of these equations and numerical methods are discussed below and finally the amount of torque was calculated by obtaining the amount of shear and compressive forces on the turbine surface momentum and mass conservation

turbulence model was applied this model was already successfully used in similar studies shaheen et al 2015 lanzafame et al 2014 the sst transition turbulence model is based on sst k ω transport equations coupled with two additional transport equations one for intermittency γ eq 6 and the other for transition reynolds number r e θ t eq 7 menter et al 2006a 2006b lodefier et al 2004 langtry et al 2006a 2006b sørensen 2009 the intermittency is defined as the fraction of time when the flow is turbulent and is equal to 1 and 0 in turbulent and laminar flow respectively the transition onset

implemented by menter and langtry menter et al 2006a 2006b langtry et al 2006a they used some proprietary empirical correlations to allow proper closure of the model and coupled these equations with the sst shear stress transport turbulence model which is a combination of the k ε and k ω models and uses the k ε model in the free flow and the k ω model close to the walls in the boundary layer of the stream these equations lead to a more realistic prediction of boundary layer behavior above all of the transition from laminar to turbulent since separated flow and stall are phenomena which are strictly related to boundary layer behavior the sst transitional model should be able to predict these phenomena better which is critical for savonius blades 2 2 calculation of performance

numerical model are evaluated based on the experimental data in 1977 a series of experimental tests on the two and three bucket savonius turbine were conducted by robert e sheldahl in sandia laboratories sheldahl et al 1978 therefore a two bucket savonius turbine geometry is opted from the report and utilized to develop and validate the introduced numerical model the selected geometry is shown in fig 1 and the turbine characteristics are listed in table 1 in the next step for domain discretization a 2d mesh with both quadrilateral and triangular elements was built the structure of the grid is shown in fig 2 the mesh consists of two parts the first is a rotating zone that is circumscribed by the interface and the other is the fixed domain no slip boundary condition is used in all the rotor walls the inlet condition same as the experimental condition is set with a uniform velocity of 7 m s corresponding to nominal reynolds number per unit length of 4 32 105 at the outlet the static gauge pressure considered to be zero and a free slip boundary condition was applied for the other two external boundaries the generated grid is built with a combination of the structured and unstructured elements the domain near the turbine s wall is discretized using unstructured triangular elements in that more density of mesh elements is imposed to the boundary layer of the buckets with rectangular cells so that y 1 which is required by the turbulence model the generated mesh in the fixed domain is built with rectangular cells to make the mesh size controllable and improve the mesh quality in the respective areas furthermore the grid independency has been assessed by a series of primary numerical simulations with various levels of refinement of mesh the mesh density was varied from 14000 to 220000 elements by adding about 30000 elements in each level and the static or nonrotating torques of the buckets at rotor angle of 0 is obtained from the numerical analysis comparing the calculated static torque in each level showed that a mesh with approximately 150 000 elements was sufficient due to the insensitivity of the obtained results which was below 1 by extra refinements in the next step the validation process was carried out at first a steady state flow simulation is done to set up the flow domain to reasonable parametric values the rotating reference frame technique is used in this step such that the convergence criteria for rms residuals of continuity momentum and turbulence quantities were set to 10 5 in the following fully implicit time advancement scheme is applied by using a sliding mesh model smm in order to visualize the unsteady characteristics of the wake flow behind the rotor and a transient sst turbulent model for analyzing the generated eddy the discretization methods for the equations are shown in table 2 due to the unsteady nature of the generated torque by the savonius turbine the time step size is selected corresponding to the turbine rotation of 1 00 so the torque values were recorded at each time step the process continued until the recorded torque showed quasi steady behavior finally the average quantities of the performance coefficients were obtained using eq 8 in the following the same process has been done for determining the torque and power coefficients at different tsrs obtained results of the numerical simulations and experimental data are shown in fig 3 the represented results in fig 3 show that the average of the relative errors between the numerical and experimental results are within approximately 6 the maximum deviation is generated at the tip speed ratio of 0 8 while the values obtained at lower and higher tip speed ratio show a lower percentage error in order to determine the accuracy of the results the coefficient of correlation r 2 is utilized which is calculated from eq 9 maindonald and braun 2006 9 r 2 1 ϕ e x p ϕ p r e d 2 ϕ e x p ϕ e x p 2 where 10 ϕ e x p i 1 n ϕ e x p r i m e n t a l n the value of the coefficient of correlation has been calculated about 0 95 which is a strong positive quantity and shows the good accuracy of the numerical results therefore it is acceptable to use the sst transition turbulence model and the other terms utilized in the process of the validation to predict the performance of a low reynolds number hydrokinetic savonius rotor 4 problem description a conventional savonius turbine is made up of two semi cylinders advancing and returning bucket between two horizontal discs with symmetrical position relative to the centerline the difference between the exerted forces on the convex surface of the reversing bucket and concave surface of the advancing bucket causes the savonius turbine to spin the more reduction of generated torque by the reversing bucket the more enhancement of the savonius turbine net efficiency this incident is more applicable in water channel flow with the fixed stream direction accordingly a deviation in fluid flow from the reversing bucket practically enhances the performance of a hydrokinetic savonius turbine in the present study a numerical analysis has been carried out to identify the influence of a deflector on hydrokinetic savonius turbine s performance one of the most important criteria for designing a deflector is its simple construction and installation to avoid complicating the primary savonius rotor fig 4 shows the basic design of the deflector this deflector is a quadrant surface and is designed to be fixed in front of the reversing bucket so the streamlines entering the convex surface would be diminished and the total net torque produced by the turbine would be enhanced the clearance between the barrier and the bucket is 0 05d that is referenced to the dimension of the stator disks of the savonius turbine 1 1d which was utilized in the experimental model the quadrant surface is a basic design for the power generated by the savonius turbine can be affected by the length of the barrier as shown in fig 4 the quadrant surface is divided into nine sectors to evaluate the influence of the barrier length on the rotor performance each sector has about 0 093 m length and covers π 18 radian of the quadrant barrier therefore changing the length of the barrier become conceivable by the presence or absence of each sector various layouts of the nine sectors of the barrier yield different effects on turbine performance accordingly each layout is entitled uniquely to categorize them in different cases in the numerical modeling process the number of the beginning and the end of each arc is used to name each of these cases for example case 3 6 contains all sectors of 3 4 5 and 6 in order to optimize the length of the barrier the numerical modeling process has been carried out with the aforementioned conditions in the validation section at three different tsrs of 0 4 0 8 and 1 2 the dimensions of the model turbine have been set same as the experimental test the conservative equations mass and momentum along with sst transitional turbulence model is utilized to simulate the effects of the different layout of the designed barrier on the savonius turbine performance the reynolds number of the fluid flow is considered to be identical to the reynolds number per unit length of the experimental model accordingly the water flow velocity is considered to be 0 48 m s the rotational speed of the turbine is also set based on the tsr of 0 4 0 8 and 1 2 in each sequence to reduce the computational cost in the optimization process a dynamic boundary condition is imposed on each sector of the barrier in this method the initial boundary condition of each sector is set as an interface between the two adjacent sub domains so no deviation on flow streamlines is appeared by the sector on the other hand each sector acts as a no slip wall if it is opted to influence the fluid flow the other terms of the numerical simulations like boundary conditions discretization methods and the procedure of the numerical analysis are set identical to the validation section 5 results and discussions the numerical model described previously employed to find the best layout of the barrier different lengths in various cases have been evaluated to optimize the dimensions of the barrier each case induces different impacts on rotor performance thus the net generated torque of each case is calculated over time and its characteristics are compared with the other cases fig 5 demonstrates the power coefficient of some cases at different tip speed ratios as it is shown in fig 5 setting up different layouts of the barrier alter the torque coefficient of the savonius turbine in comparison with the base case which is the conventional savonius turbine without any augmentation techniques the impact of different cases on the turbine performance varies at different tsrs the topmost power coefficient is achieved by case 4 6 which means deploying the barrier from section 4 to 6 at tsr of 0 8 however compared to case 4 6 case 3 8 and case 5 6 have a greater influence on turbine performance at tsr of 0 4 and 1 2 respectively in fact increasing the angular velocity of the turbine which yields higher tsr reduces the improvement rate induced by case 3 8 at tsr of 0 4 yet enhances the influence of the case 4 6 at tsr of 0 8 subsequently as the angular velocity increases the effect of case 4 6 reduces and case 5 6 becomes dominant in other words by increasing the tsr the optimum length of the barrier tends to dwindle and slightly shifts in a counter clockwise direction it is noteworthy that some cases like case 2 8 even decrease the torque coefficient of the savonius rotor comparing with the base case at tsr of 0 8 and 1 2 while these cases have a positive impact on turbine performance at tsr of 0 4 as it is shown in fig 5 by deploying case 4 6 at tsr of 0 8 the torque coefficient increases by 19 in comparison with the base case based on the literature review this enhancement is lower than some augmentation techniques which was proposed by other researchers nonetheless those techniques are not applicable except using some complex structures like specific blade profile long curtains or meander duct nuzzle in return deploying the circular barrier with case 4 6 layout which is fixed to the stator of the turbine not only does not impose any complexity to the turbine set but it also enhances the torque coefficient significantly in order to assess this enhancement the generated torque as a function of flow time and the torque coefficient as a function of azimuth angle are depicted in fig 6 for both case 4 6 and the base case as it is shown in fig 6 case 4 6 exhibits superior characteristics to the base case and increases the torque coefficient at almost all azimuth angles yet this enhancement is not uniform at each angle and becomes more enlightened in the vicinity of the torque maxima deploying the case 4 6 in front of the savonius turbine increases both the minimum and maximum of the generated torque curve the maximum and minimum value of the generated torque produced by the turbine is 31 1 and 0 6 n m in the base case respectively while utilizing the case 4 6 enhances these quantities to 37 7 and 2 9 n m respectively fig 7 shows the instantaneous pressure field in and around the savonius rotor deployed with the case 4 6 and the base case in the rotational angle of the minimum generated torque at tsr of 0 8 the primary effect of the barrier is reducing the negative drag force on the savonius turbine while all the illustrated streamlines flow through the reversing bucket in the base case the barrier case 4 6 diverts the fluid flow so diminishes the pressure distribution on the convex surface of the bucket and reduces the stagnation force on the rotor furthermore the barrier shifts the stagnation point toward the trailing edge of the reversing bucket this reduces the moment of the reversing bucket drag force on the turbine rotor and enhances the net generated torque besides relocation of the stagnation point intensifies the smooth pressure drop along the trailing edge of the reversing bucket this phenomenon expedites the accelerated flow incidence on the front side of the reversing blade so aggravates the pressure region developed on the concave side of the advancing blade and reinforces the lifting force on the turbine these factors lead to a higher torque generation induced by case 4 6 in comparison with the base case and enhance the net generated torque by almost four times at this rotational angle fig 8 shows the pressure contour of the case 4 6 and the base case in the rotational angle of the maximum generated torque at this spot as noted earlier the main effect of the barrier is the flow streamlines deflection away from the convex side of the reversing bucket such deviation decreases the stagnation flow rate through the reversing bucket so reduces the negative torque in addition the pressure distribution gradient over the barrier induces a vortex circulation aft the barrier the circulation of the vortex also helps to a more flow deviation which enhances the density of the streamlines through the advancing bucket and subsequently increases the high pressure distribution near the concave surface of the advancing bucket on the other hand it can be inferred from the torque coefficient polar graph fig 6 and also by comparing case 4 6 and the base case in fig 8 that utilizing case 4 6 results in a phase difference at the torque maxima in other words the azimuth angle of the maximum torque spot for the case 4 6 is greater than the base case this phenomenon reduces the relative angular difference between the tip velocity vector of the advancing bucket and the velocity vector of the free stream which yields a higher lift coefficient these factors enhance the net generated torque of the case 4 6 by about 21 at this rotational angle as it is shown in fig 5 other layouts also boost the performance of the savonius turbine yet the maximum enhancement is obtained by utilizing the case 4 6 both decreasing and increasing the length of the barrier with the case 4 6 layout are led to a lower torque coefficient and even less than the torque coefficient of the base case the remarkable thing is that while some protracted layouts have a lower power coefficient at tsr of 0 8 they have a better influence on turbine performance at other tsrs in comparison with the case 4 6 in the following in order to assess this phenomenon the effects of case 3 7 on the fluid flow and turbine performance is investigated and compared with case 4 6 the layout of case 3 7 has been designed by extending the case 4 6 with a sector in both counter clockwise and clockwise direction utilizing this barrier increases the power coefficient by about 6 percent in comparison with the base case at tsr of 0 8 this is about one third of the enhancement rate attained by case 4 6 fig 9 illustrates the comparison of the generated torque of the savonius rotor as a function of flow time between case 4 6 and the case 3 7 layouts the results indicate that the maximum and minimum generated torque is decreased significantly in the case 3 7 in comparison with the case 4 6 in order to assess the reduction of the maximum and minimum generated torque in the case 3 7 compared to the case 4 6 the turbulence intensity of these two cases are depicted in fig 10 as it is shown in fig 10 extending the barrier in a clockwise direction strengthens the vortex at the aft of the leading edge of the barrier it is considered that the formation of this vortex contributes to a higher pressure field contiguous to the advancing bucket however in case 3 7 the vortex detaches from the barrier by rotating the turbine according to fig 10 a3 convection of such circulation through the rotor along with the shedding vortex of the convex side of the reversing bucket disrupts the coanda like flow pattern along the advancing bucket concave side subsequently this decreases the drag coefficient of the advancing bucket the higher turbulence intensity along the concave side of the advancing bucket also weakens the overlap flow so reduces the amplitude of the lateral force on the other hand extending the barrier in a counter clockwise direction increases the turbulence intensity between the reversing bucket and the barrier this phenomenon which is illustrated in fig 10 a4 reduces the dragging flow which is the fluid flow from the convex side of the advancing bucket to the reversing bucket concave side and diminishes the returning effect of the reversing bucket these factors lead to a decrease in torque generation by case 3 7 in comparison with case 4 6 and supposed to be strengthened by adding extra sectors to case 3 7 so that results in a lower torque coefficient 6 conclusion in this study a circular barrier is set on the stator of a hydrokinetic savonius turbine without detracting its inherent simplicity this study aims to investigate the influence of this barrier on the performance of the savonius turbine the conservation equations of mass and momentum are solved using the finite volume method the sst transition model is utilized to describe the turbulence of the fluid flow around the savonius hydrokinetic rotor the validation process is carried out with sandia laboratories experimental data the correlation coefficient is calculated and demonstrated good agreement of the obtained results with experimental data for analyzing the influence of the barrier on turbine efficiency a quadrant barrier is deployed to deflect the fluid flow from the convex side of the reversing bucket afterward this quadrant barrier is divided into nine sectors and the effects of different layouts of these sectors on the turbine performances are investigated in distinct cases based on the results utilizing the barrier with the case 4 6 layout which means deploying the deflector from section 4 to 6 enhances the torque coefficient about 19 compared to the base case at the tip speed ratio of 0 8 the pressure contour has illustrated that utilizing the case 4 6 reduces average pressure distribution on the convex side of the reversing bucket and increases the number of streamlines entering the concave surface of the advancing bucket so the maximum and minimum of the generated torque are increased by about 400 and 21 respectively evaluating the other layouts have demonstrated that increasing the length of the barrier in a counter clockwise direction decreases the dragging flow so diminishes the returning effect of the reversing bucket besides increasing the length of the barrier in a clockwise direction intensifies the vortex shedding at the aft of the barrier and reduces the uniformity of the fluid flow through the advancing bucket and accordingly decreases the torque coefficient compared to the optimum layout credit authorship contribution statement hossein alizadeh data curation visualization writing original draft software methodology validation mohammad

21957,the international maritime organization imo has delineated several emission control areas ecas where ships must use more expensive low sulphur fuel to minimize total navigation costs shipping companies should optimize both route and speed for any shipping event there have been many studies on this topic which have optimized route and speed separately these studies can be divided into two categories according to route optimization strategy cell based and cell free the cell based approach limits the searching direction as the cell shapes are fixed the cell free approach cannot identify the time points when entering and leaving ecas this study proposed an improved cell based method that considers the eca regulations and weather conditions to simultaneously optimize the route and speed which can overcome the shortcomings in cell based and cell free approach finally a computational studies and comparative analysis with some other existing methods were performed the results show that the proposed method can effectively reduce the total costs and the ship emissions within ecas but might increase the total emissions of the whole shipping event keywords maritime transportation route and speed optimization emission control areas weather conditions 1 introduction maritime transportation is the main transportation mode for domestic and international trade it requires large amounts of energy and results in high gas emissions emissions from these ships have become an important source of air pollution especially for coastal areas according to the international maritime organization imo a specialized united nations agency approximately 2 2 of global co2 emissions were produced by ships in 2012 this level is projected to increase by 50 250 by 2050 as additional examples these ships yielded approximately 13 and 12 of global nox and sox emissions respectively in 2012 imo 2014 to reduce polluted emissions by the maritime transportation industry in 2008 the imo agreed on the latest version of annex vi this established a global limit on the sulphur content of a ship s fuel to 0 50 starting in 2020 imo also established four ecas emission control areas to reduce ship emissions including the baltic sea the north sea and english channel the north american coasts and the us caribbean coasts within these ecas there is even more stringent control of the sulphur emissions with a limit of 0 1 sulphur content in the ship s fuel in 2018 the chinese government designated china s entire coastal area at a distance of 12 nautical miles as ecas with a limit of 0 5 sulphur content in the ship s fuel and it will be changed to 0 1 after 2020 fig 1 shows the existing ecas one direct method used by shipping companies to comply with the sulphur regulations in ecas is switching fuel in this method ships burn marine gas oil mgo with 0 10 sulphur content within ecas the more commonly used and cheaper fuel type low sulphur fuel oil lsfo with 0 50 sulphur content is used outside the eca other measures such as installing scrubbers and replacing lsfo with liquefied natural gas lng have also been shown to be effective gu and wallace 2017 abadie et al 2017 acciaro 2014 however these require ship modifications leading to substantial fees moreover many ships are not constructed to use lng with the 2020 sulphur cap deadline approaching many ship companies have installed scrubbers however wastewater from the scrubber adversely affects the marine environment as such many countries such as china singapore and germany have ban the discharge of wastewater from scrubber and the ship wastewater control area can be called wca the wca is similar to the eca it means that ships need to use low sulphur content marine fuels in wca as there is currently no international regulation about wca we only focus on eca regulations in this paper shipping companies work to optimize lowing sailing costs for each ship the costs for each trip include fuel costs and time charter costs fuel costs can be divided into lsfo and mgo costs time charter costs are mainly determined by financial expenses depreciation and operating cost fuel consumption per time unit is approximately proportional to the third power of speed ronen 2011 as such fuel costs are sensitive to ship speed a low speed results in low fuel costs and high time charter costs fuel costs are also influenced by the proportion of the route that is within the ecas compared to the full route this is because the price per ton of mgo is higher than lsfo thus speed and route should be simultaneously optimized 2 literature review existing research about ecas can be divided into two types the influence of ecas and the methods used by shipping companies to decrease the costs of complying with the eca regulations research on the influence of ecas has often focused on the influence on emissions for example chen et al 2017 estimated ship emissions in 2014 using a bottom up method based on automatic identification system ais data other research related to the influence of eca s relates to their influence on port throughput for example chang et al 2014 assessed the noxious gases of vessel operations in a potential eca they later estimated the efficiency of a port in europe using envelopment analysis dea models with nonradial slacks based measure sbm data chang et al 2018 the results indicate that eca regulations block port throughput many studies have explored the use of speed adjustments and routing decisions to reduce the fuel switching costs required by eca regulations chen et al 2018 a b found that several ships choose to re route around the ecas to completely avoid their influence any ship route can be redesigned to bypass the special areas however the redesigned route may lead a long detour significantly deviating from the optimal route fagerholt and psaraftis 2015 established models based on simulated light refraction that optimize routes and speeds however they did not consider weather conditions for ships that sail in and out of ecas and that switch fuel whenever they cross an eca border fagerholt et al 2015 calculated the fuel costs for some alternative routes in the ecas and then selected the optimum route associated with the lowest fuel costs the method did not account for weather conditions and could not provide the optimal speed and route because there was a limited number of alternative routes many methods and programs had been proposed to determine the best route and speed without considering eca lee et al 2018 divide these parameters into two categories using a route optimization strategy cell based and cell free according to cell usage here a cell represents a small region generated from a grid the cell based method generates a path by connecting the center points of the cells and the cell free method does not use any cell to generate a path many studies have used a dijkstra algorithm a star algorithm and other cell based methods to generate the optimal route with fixed speed adjusting the speed on the optimal route afterwards joo et al 2012 an et al 2013 however the cell based method limits the searching direction as the cell shapes are fixed the speed optimization should be operated separately as the concept of time is not contained in addition optimizing independent objectives separately often fails to obtain global optimal solutions due to the potential interaction between the best route and the optimal speed some studies have also generated the optimal route and speed simultaneously using no cells these are called cell free methods hanssen and james 1960 proposed an isochrone method to determine an optimum route however this method can t effectively avoid land and islands roh 2013 proposed an improved isochrone method for ship route planning this method considers obstacles such as land zaccone et al 2018 used 3d dynamic programming to identify the optimal path and speed profile for a ship voyage based on weather forecast maps lee et al 2018 proposed a method similar to the isochrone algorithm called the es evolution strategy isochrone method it applies an evolutionary algorithm to formulate a route that comprises several nodes whereby the speed can be changed at each segment between the nodes typically the performance associated with planned routes and speeds based on cell free methods are better than cell based methods however cell free methods are similar to the isochrone method that is the time interval between adjacent route nodes is fixed they may not be able to generate an effective route and speed planning under the influence of eca regulations as they cannot identify the time points when entering and leaving ecas in summary several studies have worked to optimize speed and route however they have not considered both the influence of ecas and the changes in weather conditions moreover the existing methods have certain limitations when sailing in areas with eca this study addressed these gaps presenting a new method to optimize the speed and route within the limitations of eca constraints and changes in weather conditions the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 3 defines route and speed optimization problems including the associated mathematical formulas section 4 proposes a method to optimize the route using an advanced ant colony algorithm section 5 presents the optimization results of two case studies and section 6 summarizes the findings 3 problem description and mathematical formulation this section presents the optimization method for shipping speed and route section 3 1 describes the problems and section 3 2 describes the modeling assumptions the mathematical model is provided in section 3 3 3 1 problem description to accurately describe the problem this section defines and explains three types of routes the shortest route is the optimal route it covers the smallest distance from the departure port to the arrival port the weather driven route is a pre planned route that considers the weather forecast weather plays an important role in reducing vessel fuel costs shao et al 2012 these two types of routes shortest and weather driven are usually used to control the total costs of sailing in areas with no ecas weather driven route is a route that prevents the ship from sailing against the wind and waves and avoids the catastrophic wind and wave area under the influence of weather factors such as wind and waves the ship s sailing cost and time of weather driven route are lower than the shortest route since it has good weather conditions a third route may cover a longer distance than the shortest and weather driven routes however it may be the optimal route with the lowest sailing costs because it has an appropriate distance within the ecas where the ship burns more expensive fuel this indicates that a more effective route optimization method is needed to reduce ship sailing costs based on both eca regulations and weather conditions including wave height wave direction wave speed wind direction and speed optimizing speed is another way to reduce shipping costs without hull modifications as the fuel consumption per time unit is approximately proportional to the third power of speed the simplest way to reduce sailing costs is to keep a lowest speed within the maximum navigation time limitation however the time charter costs will significantly increase using the simplest method moreover eca regulations result in higher per unit fuel costs inside ecas than outside them fuel consumption is also driven by weather conditions along the route wang and meng 2012a b he et al 2017 therefore a more effective speed optimization method taking into account eca regulations and weather conditions is also needed to further reduce sailing costs there is a potential interaction between the best route and the optimal speed optimizing independent objectives separately often fails to obtain global optimal solutions therefore ship routes and speeds should be optimized simultaneously 3 2 modeling assumptions higher speeds may generate additional profit by saving time to complete more voyages however the amount of profit is uncertain as such we mainly focus on optimization models for individual voyages this section first presents and discusses the assumptions used to derive the optimization models for shipping route and speed under the influence of ecas the key assumptions are as follows 1 ships costs when docked and anchored at the port or anchorage are not included as those costs are irrelevant to the navigation wang et al 2013a b 2 mgo is set as the fuel type within ecas and lsfo is set as the fuel type for other locations 3 the time required to switch fuels is not considered as it is usually less than half an hour 4 a ship speed constraint is set based on the design speed and minimum speed wang 2013 psaraftis and kontovas 2013 the minimum speed is set to avoid engine stalling or non optimal fuel consumption 5 the optimal speed is from a discrete speed set as shipping companies often have fuel consumption data for a number of discrete speeds rather than basing them on a function andersson et al 2015 6 water temperature and density are assumed fixed value 3 3 mathematical model this subsection presents an integer programming model that calculates the total costs of any feasible route from the departure port to arrival port the following list summarizes the model notation sets v set of nodes on the feasible route a set of edges on

edge from node i to j f ij binary variable takes the value 1 if the edge e ij through the ecas decision variables e ij r binary variable takes the value 1 if the edge e ij is the rth edge along the route and 0 if otherwise b ij r binary variable takes the value 1 if the ship sailing rth edge with speed v ij along the route and 0 if otherwise this study assumes that a certain planned route consists of a series of end to end vectors from the departure port to arrival port the sum of the costs of each vector represents the total cost of the route each vector can be determined using the coordinates of the starting and ending nodes the optimal route can be determined as a series of nodes we establish v and a as the collection of nodes and edges to represent the feasible routes we can identify the optimal route by minimizing the total costs of all edges the cost of each feasible route is 1 t c o s t r 1 n e i j a c o s t i j e i j r the ship cost mainly includes fuel costs and time charter costs as such cost ij can be defined as 2 c o s t i j v i j y s i j v i j f i j c q 24 3 f i j γ f t p i j the cost per fuel unit differs inside and outside ecas as such eqs 1 3 are converted

constraint 5 indicates that the first node of each feasible route is the departure port s constraint 6 ensures that each feasible route terminates at the arrival port d constraint 7 specifies that each feasible route node except the start and end nodes includes one incoming and one outgoing edge constraint 8 sets a time limit for all feasible routes ship power mainly includes the following elements the power needed for still water conditions along the edge i j called p ij s the extra power required for waves along the edge i j called p ij w the power needed for wind along the edge i j called p ij a and the necessary auxiliary power called p aux which is a constant for a certain ship propeller efficiency along the edge i j called k ij drops when the engine output is reduced and when there is a significant increase in wave height lindstad et al 2013 2015 9 p i j k i j p i j s p i j w p i j a p aux 10 k i j 1 η a b v i j v d 11 p i j s c t s ρ w s v i j 3 2 m δ d w t 1 δ 12 p i j w

emissions we estimate the ship s exhaust emissions using the following mathematical formula based on previous studies winther et al 2014 chen et al 2017 2018 14 e α w l e f α l w m e f α m 15 w l r 1

respectively 4 solution methods the weather forecasting data are spatiotemporally discontinuous in addition ship speed cannot be changed in real time thus it is difficult to establish a continuous function associating ship cost with speed and route given this this section first breaks the navigation area into discrete cells and then presents a problem solving method to optimize the route based on the available environmental information 4 1 setting discrete navigation area the navigation area was divided into discrete grids with equal spacing r r 0 5 which is the spatial accuracy of weather prediction data together these grids provide a fast and efficient way to retrieve and summarize important information including water depth maritime wind speed wind direction wave speed wave direction and wave height fig 2 shows the grids in some parts of the bohai sea and the yellow sea in china to calculate the cost of a feasible route a method is needed to determine the weather condition and sailing distance within the eca in this study the discretized map with important information for each node is used the determination of whether the route passes through the grids or not is carried out in segments between adjacent nodes for example fig 3 shows that each route segment from p0 to p3 is divided into several portions with an interval of 0 5 then several checking points are made the blue grids where the checkpoint is located mark the grids that route passes through the information for each segment represents the average data of these grids in addition the sailing distance within and outside eca also can be determined by this method 4 2 environmental information each node contains static information including land boundaries water depth and eca range each node also contains dynamic information including wind direction and speed wave direction and speed and significant wave height if no dynamic data exist for a node the average values for the two neighboring nodes were used instead the study adopted the 1 60 bathymetry noaa digital bathymetric database to determine whether the water depth met ship draught requirements an edge is considered a no navigation area if the edge linking the nodes through the area has a water depth less than the sum of the ship draft and the under keel clearance ukc in particular the edges on landmasses are in a no navigation area the eca demarcation line was used to determine if the ship was within the eca for this study the eca boundary data along the china coast came from the implementation plan for ship emission control areas developed by ministry of transport of the people s republic of china the eca boundary data in europe comes from the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ship marpol developed by imo imo 2008 an edge is considered to be in the eca if the edge linking the node include the nodes runs through the eca the dynamic weather data used in this study include wind direction and speed wave direction and speed and significant wave height these data were obtained from the china marine environmental forecasting center and european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf via satellite communication while at sea dynamic information is not continuous in time and space dimensions as such the weather conditions for time or space instances where there is a lack of forecasting results these conditions were determined by interpolating the nearest time or space predictions the dynamic information was rebuilt regularly whenever newly updated data were available the data interval was 6 h based on forecasting data 4 3 optimization algorithm the dijkstra algorithm is a traditional algorithm for solving directed graph route optimization it calculates the cost to move from the current node to the adjacent node of the model and then selects the adjacent node with the lowest cost as the next node this approach expands to the outer layer until the end of the expansion the dijkstra algorithm generates the optimal cost of each grid node compared to the source node the a star is an improved algorithm based on the dijkstra algorithm it proposes a heuristic function which is the estimated cost distance from the node to the goal node the algorithm is a more rapid version of dijkstra s classic shortest path algorithm bell 2009 the dijkstra and a star algorithms must limit the searching direction because the cell shapes are fixed optimization of speed should be operated separately as the concept of time is not contained as fig 4 shows the shortest route from p1 to p2 is route2 however dijkstra and a star will tend to generate route1 which is longer than route2 based on an 8 adjacency integer lattice constraint cell free methods generate the optimal route and speed simultaneously without limiting the searching direction however it may not be able to generate an effective route and speed planning under the influence of eca regulations as they cannot identify the time points when entering and leaving ecas the proposed mathematical model in section 3 is an integer programming model which can be solved by cplex a mature solver of ibm however there are many feasible routes based on discrete grids for a certain navigation area which is an instance of large scale problems for example there are more than hundreds of thousands of integer variables for a navigation area with 500 discrete grids cplex solver can solve the proposed integer programming model when the problem cases are small in scale nevertheless when the problem cases are large in scale the model is too difficult to be solved using cplex directly zhen et al 2018 to overcome the identified limitations this study proposed a two step strategy the first step generate initial route based on dijkstra to reduce the size of the problem and then use cplex to optimize the route and speed based on the initial rout the detailed processes are in the following 1 use the dijkstra algorithm to generate an initial route with a directional constraint consisting of a series of segments 2 extract the turning nodes of the initial route based on the direction change according to the turning point the initial route is divided into n segments then as shown in fig 5 each segment is equally divided into several nodes define the set segment k to represent the nodes on the kth segment a node is selected on each segment to be a feasible route the cost and emissions of each feasible route can be calculated using equation 1 16 if node i belongs to segment k the next node j belongs to segment k 1 3 use the cplex to select an optimal route and speed from these feasible routes and determine the optimal speed at the same time the initial route based on dijkstra algorithm can effectively reduce the size of the problem and cplex a mature solver can find the best route and speed from the initial route 5 applications 5 1 definition of cases this section describes and discusses the results when the proposed method is applied to the ecas around china coast and the north sea table 1 lists the main parameters of the ship table 2 summarizes the two cases termed cases 1 and 2 case 1 is a route along the china coast the starting port and the arrival port are both within the eca case 2 is a route in europe with two ecas the north sea and baltic sea the bergen at norway is the departure port and is in the north sea neither of these cases have bad weather conditions the main purpose of the two cases is to assess whether the proposed method can effective reduce the total costs moreover case 1 was designed to analyze the impact of eca regulations case 2 was designed to analyze the impact of lsfo price changes in addition the input price of mgo was set to 750 usd ton for all test cases in addition to check the efficiency and the applicability of the proposed method a comparative test regarding the other methods was performed for two cases the weather conditions wind direction and speed wave direction and speed and wave height 24 h forecast data forecast data are obtained from the china marine environmental forecasting center case 1 and european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf via satellite communication while at sea case 2 for example fig 6 a and b show the wind direction and speed forecast data for the next 24 h of case 1 and case 2 respectively 5 2 results and discussion 5 2 1 case 1 fig 8 a shows the actual route the shortest route the weather route and the proposed route when the lsfo price is set 500 usd ton the shortest route covers the smallest distance from the departure port to the arrival port the weather route is a pre planned route that considers the weather forecast it is generated by the proposed method without considering the eca including speed optimization table 3 shows the detailed information for the results avoiding bad weather along the weather route ultimately saves costs as such it is the route with the smallest total cost before the issuance of eca regulations when considering eca regulations the proposed method yielded the optimal route and speed in terms of total cost the total cost was reduced by 15 507 dollars compared to the actual route even with the increase in total distance table 4 compares the ship emissions between the actual and proposed method the proposed method reduces the sailing distance and speed within the eca this reduces the fuel consumption in the eca therefore the proposed method can effectively simultaneous reduce total cost and ship emissions within the eca however the lsfo fuel consumption increased due to the longer sailing distance and acceleration outsides of eca by the proposed method thereby increasing global emissions fig 7 b visualizes the results of the four optimization methods for case 1 these four methods can effectively reduce the sailing distance within the eca thereby reducing the total cost based on the lower fuel consumption of mgo the es isochrone and proposed method performed a simultaneous optimization of the path and speed on the route table 5 shows detailed information about the results the proposed method yielded the optimal route reducing the total cost by nearly 17 compared to the actual route which is higher than other three methods 5 2 2 case 2 fig 8 a visualizes the results for the ship route planning for case 2 according to the five methods the actual route is the benchmark here the lsfo price is set 400 per ton table 6 shows the detailed information associated with the results the proposed method yielded the optimal route reducing the total cost by nearly 15 052 dollars compared to the actual route if the ship operator provides services for 50 such voyages during a year the cost is estimated to be reduced by nearly 800 000 per year which is of great value to shipping companies fig 8 b visualizes the results for the ship route planning for case 2 based on different lsfo prices the price difference between lsfo and mgo decreases as lsfo prices rise this may result in large changes in the ship s optimal route if the lsfo and mgo prices are the same the route generated by the proposed method is the weather route table 7 provides detailed information about the results of proposed method based on different lsfo prices the ship will reduce the total sailing distance and the lsfo fuel consumption as the lsfo prices rise this will lead to a corresponding increase in the sailing distance and mgo fuel consumption within the eca in addition the difference between the average speed inside and outside the eca will decrease as the lsfo prices rise table 8 compares different lsfo prices based on the optimal route and speed it shows that the lower lsfo price will reduce the sailing distance within the eca reducing eca s ship emissions in contrast due to the increase in total sailing distance and lsfo fuel consumption the total ship emissions will increase 6 concluding remarks many ship operators use low sulphur fuel e g marine gas oil within established emission control areas ecas to meet regulatory requirements because low sulphur fuel often costs more than the lsfo commonly used in ships many ship operators switch fuels and discharge lsfo outside the ecas to reduce operating costs existing methods to optimize ship speed and route rarely consider eca as such this study established a ship speed and route optimization model that considered the presence of ecas we analyzed two cases to verify the validity of the proposed method the results show that the proposed method can reduce the sailing distance and pollution emissions within the eca however it may increase the total sailing distance even with a longer distance the proposed method still can effectively reduce the ship s totally operating costs moreover with the sulphur cap approaching in 2020 may lead to fluctuations in lsfo prices therefore we analyze the optimal solutions generated by the proposed method under different lsfo prices the results show that the proposed method can provide the optimal route and speed plan for shipping companies at different lsfo prices this study may help shipping companies design ship speeds and routes to reduce ship costs in the context of eca from a policy perspective this study found that the eca setting may force shipping companies to select a longer route to avoid ecas potentially decreasing co2 nox and other emissions within the eca but increasing global emissions therefore in the long term when establishing ecas actual ship routes should be fully considered and new ships should be encouraged to use clean energy such as natural gas as fuel moreover this method is also suitable for the possible wca regulations in the future it only requires to modify the eca boundary information to wca boundary information credit authorship contribution statement dongfang ma conceptualization methodology software weihao ma data curation

21957,the international maritime organization imo has delineated several emission control areas ecas where ships must use more expensive low sulphur fuel to minimize total navigation costs shipping companies should optimize both route and speed for any shipping event there have been many studies on this topic which have optimized route and speed separately these studies can be divided into two categories according to route optimization strategy cell based and cell free the cell based approach limits the searching direction as the cell shapes are fixed the cell free approach cannot identify the time points when entering and leaving ecas this study proposed an improved cell based method that considers the eca regulations and weather conditions to simultaneously optimize the route and speed which can overcome the shortcomings in cell based and cell free approach finally a computational studies and comparative analysis with some other existing methods were performed the results show that the proposed method can effectively reduce the total costs and the ship emissions within ecas but might increase the total emissions of the whole shipping event keywords maritime transportation route and speed optimization emission control areas weather conditions 1 introduction maritime transportation is the main transportation mode for domestic and international trade it requires large amounts of energy and results in high gas emissions emissions from these ships have become an important source of air pollution especially for coastal areas according to the international maritime organization imo a specialized united nations agency approximately 2 2 of global co2 emissions were produced by ships in 2012 this level is projected to increase by 50 250 by 2050 as additional examples these ships yielded approximately 13 and 12 of global nox and sox emissions respectively in 2012 imo 2014 to reduce polluted emissions by the maritime transportation industry in 2008 the imo agreed on the latest version of annex vi this established a global limit on the sulphur content of a ship s fuel to 0 50 starting in 2020 imo also established four ecas emission control areas to reduce ship emissions including the baltic sea the north sea and english channel the north american coasts and the us caribbean coasts within these ecas there is even more stringent control of the sulphur emissions with a limit of 0 1 sulphur content in the ship s fuel in 2018 the chinese government designated china s entire coastal area at a distance of 12 nautical miles as ecas with a limit of 0 5 sulphur content in the ship s fuel and it will be changed to 0 1 after 2020 fig 1 shows the existing ecas one direct method used by shipping companies to comply with the sulphur regulations in ecas is switching fuel in this method ships burn marine gas oil mgo with 0 10 sulphur content within ecas the more commonly used and cheaper fuel type low sulphur fuel oil lsfo with 0 50 sulphur content is used outside the eca other measures such as installing scrubbers and replacing lsfo with liquefied natural gas lng have also been shown to be effective gu and wallace 2017 abadie et al 2017 acciaro 2014 however these require ship modifications leading to substantial fees moreover many ships are not constructed to use lng with the 2020 sulphur cap deadline approaching many ship companies have installed scrubbers however wastewater from the scrubber adversely affects the marine environment as such many countries such as china singapore and germany have ban the discharge of wastewater from scrubber and the ship wastewater control area can be called wca the wca is similar to the eca it means that ships need to use low sulphur content marine fuels in wca as there is currently no international regulation about wca we only focus on eca regulations in this paper shipping companies work to optimize lowing sailing costs for each ship the costs for each trip include fuel costs and time charter costs fuel costs can be divided into lsfo and mgo costs time charter costs are mainly determined by financial expenses depreciation and operating cost fuel consumption per time unit is approximately proportional to the third power of speed ronen 2011 as such fuel costs are sensitive to ship speed a low speed results in low fuel costs and high time charter costs fuel costs are also influenced by the proportion of the route that is within the ecas compared to the full route this is because the price per ton of mgo is higher than lsfo thus speed and route should be simultaneously optimized 2 literature review existing research about ecas can be divided into two types the influence of ecas and the methods used by shipping companies to decrease the costs of complying with the eca regulations research on the influence of ecas has often focused on the influence on emissions for example chen et al 2017 estimated ship emissions in 2014 using a bottom up method based on automatic identification system ais data other research related to the influence of eca s relates to their influence on port throughput for example chang et al 2014 assessed the noxious gases of vessel operations in a potential eca they later estimated the efficiency of a port in europe using envelopment analysis dea models with nonradial slacks based measure sbm data chang et al 2018 the results indicate that eca regulations block port throughput many studies have explored the use of speed adjustments and routing decisions to reduce the fuel switching costs required by eca regulations chen et al 2018 a b found that several ships choose to re route around the ecas to completely avoid their influence any ship route can be redesigned to bypass the special areas however the redesigned route may lead a long detour significantly deviating from the optimal route fagerholt and psaraftis 2015 established models based on simulated light refraction that optimize routes and speeds however they did not consider weather conditions for ships that sail in and out of ecas and that switch fuel whenever they cross an eca border fagerholt et al 2015 calculated the fuel costs for some alternative routes in the ecas and then selected the optimum route associated with the lowest fuel costs the method did not account for weather conditions and could not provide the optimal speed and route because there was a limited number of alternative routes many methods and programs had been proposed to determine the best route and speed without considering eca lee et al 2018 divide these parameters into two categories using a route optimization strategy cell based and cell free according to cell usage here a cell represents a small region generated from a grid the cell based method generates a path by connecting the center points of the cells and the cell free method does not use any cell to generate a path many studies have used a dijkstra algorithm a star algorithm and other cell based methods to generate the optimal route with fixed speed adjusting the speed on the optimal route afterwards joo et al 2012 an et al 2013 however the cell based method limits the searching direction as the cell shapes are fixed the speed optimization should be operated separately as the concept of time is not contained in addition optimizing independent objectives separately often fails to obtain global optimal solutions due to the potential interaction between the best route and the optimal speed some studies have also generated the optimal route and speed simultaneously using no cells these are called cell free methods hanssen and james 1960 proposed an isochrone method to determine an optimum route however this method can t effectively avoid land and islands roh 2013 proposed an improved isochrone method for ship route planning this method considers obstacles such as land zaccone et al 2018 used 3d dynamic programming to identify the optimal path and speed profile for a ship voyage based on weather forecast maps lee et al 2018 proposed a method similar to the isochrone algorithm called the es evolution strategy isochrone method it applies an evolutionary algorithm to formulate a route that comprises several nodes whereby the speed can be changed at each segment between the nodes typically the performance associated with planned routes and speeds based on cell free methods are better than cell based methods however cell free methods are similar to the isochrone method that is the time interval between adjacent route nodes is fixed they may not be able to generate an effective route and speed planning under the influence of eca regulations as they cannot identify the time points when entering and leaving ecas in summary several studies have worked to optimize speed and route however they have not considered both the influence of ecas and the changes in weather conditions moreover the existing methods have certain limitations when sailing in areas with eca this study addressed these gaps presenting a new method to optimize the speed and route within the limitations of eca constraints and changes in weather conditions the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 3 defines route and speed optimization problems including the associated mathematical formulas section 4 proposes a method to optimize the route using an advanced ant colony algorithm section 5 presents the optimization results of two case studies and section 6 summarizes the findings 3 problem description and mathematical formulation this section presents the optimization method for shipping speed and route section 3 1 describes the problems and section 3 2 describes the modeling assumptions the mathematical model is provided in section 3 3 3 1 problem description to accurately describe the problem this section defines and explains three types of routes the shortest route is the optimal route it covers the smallest distance from the departure port to the arrival port the weather driven route is a pre planned route that considers the weather forecast weather plays an important role in reducing vessel fuel costs shao et al 2012 these two types of routes shortest and weather driven are usually used to control the total costs of sailing in areas with no ecas weather driven route is a route that prevents the ship from sailing against the wind and waves and avoids the catastrophic wind and wave area under the influence of weather factors such as wind and waves the ship s sailing cost and time of weather driven route are lower than the shortest route since it has good weather conditions a third route may cover a longer distance than the shortest and weather driven routes however it may be the optimal route with the lowest sailing costs because it has an appropriate distance within the ecas where the ship burns more expensive fuel this indicates that a more effective route optimization method is needed to reduce ship sailing costs based on both eca regulations and weather conditions including wave height wave direction wave speed wind direction and speed optimizing speed is another way to reduce shipping costs without hull modifications as the fuel consumption per time unit is approximately proportional to the third power of speed the simplest way to reduce sailing costs is to keep a lowest speed within the maximum navigation time limitation however the time charter costs will significantly increase using the simplest method moreover eca regulations result in higher per unit fuel costs inside ecas than outside them fuel consumption is also driven by weather conditions along the route wang and meng 2012a b he et al 2017 therefore a more effective speed optimization method taking into account eca regulations and weather conditions is also needed to further reduce sailing costs there is a potential interaction between the best route and the optimal speed optimizing independent objectives separately often fails to obtain global optimal solutions therefore ship routes and speeds should be optimized simultaneously 3 2 modeling assumptions higher speeds may generate additional profit by saving time to complete more voyages however the amount of profit is uncertain as such we mainly focus on optimization models for individual voyages this section first presents and discusses the assumptions used to derive the optimization models for shipping route and speed under the influence of ecas the key assumptions are as follows 1 ships costs when docked and anchored at the port or anchorage are not included as those costs are irrelevant to the navigation wang et al 2013a b 2 mgo is set as the fuel type within ecas and lsfo is set as the fuel type for other locations 3 the time required to switch fuels is not considered as it is usually less than half an hour 4 a ship speed constraint is set based on the design speed and minimum speed wang 2013 psaraftis and kontovas 2013 the minimum speed is set to avoid engine stalling or non optimal fuel consumption 5 the optimal speed is from a discrete speed set as shipping companies often have fuel consumption data for a number of discrete speeds rather than basing them on a function andersson et al 2015 6 water temperature and density are assumed fixed value 3 3 mathematical model this subsection presents an integer programming model that calculates the total costs of any feasible route from the departure port to arrival port the following list summarizes the model notation sets v set of nodes on the feasible route a set of edges on the feasible route y set of alternative speed scheme parameter i j two adjacent positions where shipping speed will change s departure port d arrival port n number of route segments t time limit for transportation requirements v ij ship speed along the edge e ij f ij fuel consumption along the edge i j c the cost per fuel unit q time charter costs per day s ij the distance of the edge i j γ ft

edge from node i to j f ij binary variable takes the value 1 if the edge e ij through the ecas decision variables e ij r binary variable takes the value 1 if the edge e ij is the rth edge along the route and 0 if otherwise b ij r binary variable takes the value 1 if the ship sailing rth edge with speed v ij along the route and 0 if otherwise this study assumes that a certain planned route consists of a series of end to end vectors from the departure port to arrival port the sum of the costs of each vector represents the total cost of the route each vector can be determined using the coordinates of the starting and ending nodes the optimal route can be determined as a series of nodes we establish v and a as the collection of nodes and edges to represent the feasible routes we can identify the optimal route by minimizing the total costs of all edges the cost of each feasible route is 1 t c o s t r 1 n e i j a c o s t i j e i j r the ship cost mainly includes fuel costs and time charter costs as such cost ij can be defined as 2 c o s t i j v i j y s i j v i j f i j c q 24 3 f i j γ f t p i j the cost per fuel unit differs inside and outside ecas as such eqs 1 3 are converted

constraint 5 indicates that the first node of each feasible route is the departure port s constraint 6 ensures that each feasible route terminates at the arrival port d constraint 7 specifies that each feasible route node except the start and end nodes includes one incoming and one outgoing edge constraint 8 sets a time limit for all feasible routes ship power mainly includes the following elements the power needed for still water conditions along the edge i j called p ij s the extra power required for waves along the edge i j called p ij w the power needed for wind along the edge i j called p ij a and the necessary auxiliary power called p aux which is a constant for a certain ship propeller efficiency along the edge i j called k ij drops when the engine output is reduced and when there is a significant increase in wave height lindstad et al 2013 2015 9 p i j k i j p i j s p i j w p i j a p aux 10 k i j 1 η a b v i j v d 11 p i j s c t s ρ w s v i j 3 2 m δ d w t 1 δ 12 p i j w

emissions we estimate the ship s exhaust emissions using the following mathematical formula based on previous studies winther et al 2014 chen et al 2017 2018 14 e α w l e f α l w m e f α m 15 w l r 1

as co2 sox nox pm10 pm2 5 w l and w m are the work in kw h for engine by using lsfo and mgo respectively ef α l and ef α m are the emission factor of substance α by using lsfo and mgo in g kw h respectively 4 solution methods the weather forecasting data are spatiotemporally discontinuous in addition ship speed cannot be changed in real time thus it is difficult to establish a continuous function associating ship cost with speed and route given this this section first breaks the navigation area into discrete cells and then presents a problem solving method to optimize the route based on the available environmental information 4 1 setting discrete navigation area the navigation area was divided into discrete grids with equal spacing r r 0 5 which is the spatial accuracy of weather prediction data together these grids provide a fast and efficient way to retrieve and summarize important information including water depth maritime wind speed wind direction wave speed wave direction and wave height fig 2 shows the grids in some parts of the bohai sea and the yellow sea in china to calculate the cost of a feasible route a method is needed to determine the weather condition and sailing distance within the eca in this study the discretized map with important information for each node is used the determination of whether the route passes through the grids or not is carried out in segments between adjacent nodes for example fig 3 shows that each route segment from p0 to p3 is divided into several portions with an interval of 0 5 then several checking points are made the blue grids where the checkpoint is located mark the grids that route passes through the information for each segment represents the average data of these grids in addition the sailing distance within and outside eca also can be determined by this method 4 2 environmental information each node contains static information including land boundaries water depth and eca range each node also contains dynamic information including wind direction and speed wave direction and speed and significant wave height if no dynamic data exist for a node the average values for the two neighboring nodes were used instead the study adopted the 1 60 bathymetry noaa digital bathymetric database to determine whether the water depth met ship draught requirements an edge is considered a no navigation area if the edge linking the nodes through the area has a water depth less than the sum of the ship draft and the under keel clearance ukc in particular the edges on landmasses are in a no navigation area the eca demarcation line was used to determine if the ship was within the eca for this study the eca boundary data along the china coast came from the implementation plan for ship emission control areas developed by ministry of transport of the people s republic of china the eca boundary data in europe comes from the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ship marpol developed by imo imo 2008 an edge is considered to be in the eca if the edge linking the node include the nodes runs through the eca the dynamic weather data used in this study include wind direction and speed wave direction and speed and significant wave height these data were obtained from the china marine environmental forecasting center and european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf via satellite communication while at sea dynamic information is not continuous in time and space dimensions as such the weather conditions for time or space instances where there is a lack of forecasting results these conditions were determined by interpolating the nearest time or space predictions the dynamic information was rebuilt regularly whenever newly updated data were available the data interval was 6 h based on forecasting data 4 3 optimization algorithm the dijkstra algorithm is a traditional algorithm for solving directed graph route optimization it calculates the cost to move from the current node to the adjacent node of the model and then selects the adjacent node with the lowest cost as the next node this approach expands to the outer layer until the end of the expansion the dijkstra algorithm generates the optimal cost of each grid node compared to the source node the a star is an improved algorithm based on the dijkstra algorithm it proposes a heuristic function which is the estimated cost distance from the node to the goal node the algorithm is a more rapid version of dijkstra s classic shortest path algorithm bell 2009 the dijkstra and a star algorithms must limit the searching direction because the cell shapes are fixed optimization of speed should be operated separately as the concept of time is not contained as fig 4 shows the shortest route from p1 to p2 is route2 however dijkstra and a star will tend to generate route1 which is longer than route2 based on an 8 adjacency integer lattice constraint cell free methods generate the optimal route and speed simultaneously without limiting the searching direction however it may not be able to generate an effective route and speed planning under the influence of eca regulations as they cannot identify the time points when entering and leaving ecas the proposed mathematical model in section 3 is an integer programming model which can be solved by cplex a mature solver of ibm however there are many feasible routes based on discrete grids for a certain navigation area which is an instance of large scale problems for example there are more than hundreds of thousands of integer variables for a navigation area with 500 discrete grids cplex solver can solve the proposed integer programming model when the problem cases are small in scale nevertheless when the problem cases are large in scale the model is too difficult to be solved using cplex directly zhen et al 2018 to overcome the identified limitations this study proposed a two step strategy the first step generate initial route based on dijkstra to reduce the size of the problem and then use cplex to optimize the route and speed based on the initial rout the detailed processes are in the following 1 use the dijkstra algorithm to generate an initial route with a directional constraint consisting of a series of segments 2 extract the turning nodes of the initial route based on the direction change according to the turning point the initial route is divided into n segments then as shown in fig 5 each segment is equally divided into several nodes define the set segment k to represent the nodes on the kth segment a node is selected on each segment to be a feasible route the cost and emissions of each feasible route can be calculated using equation 1 16 if node i belongs to segment k the next node j belongs to segment k 1 3 use the cplex to select an optimal route and speed from these feasible routes and determine the optimal speed at the same time the initial route based on dijkstra algorithm can effectively reduce the size of the problem and cplex a mature solver can find the best route and speed from the initial route 5 applications 5 1 definition of cases this section describes and discusses the results when the proposed method is applied to the ecas around china coast and the north sea table 1 lists the main parameters of the ship table 2 summarizes the two cases termed cases 1 and 2 case 1 is a route along the china coast the starting port and the arrival port are both within the eca case 2 is a route in europe with two ecas the north sea and baltic sea the bergen at norway is the departure port and is in the north sea neither of these cases have bad weather conditions the main purpose of the two cases is to assess whether the proposed method can effective reduce the total costs moreover case 1 was designed to analyze the impact of eca regulations case 2 was designed to analyze the impact of lsfo price changes in addition the input price of mgo was set to 750 usd ton for all test cases in addition to check the efficiency and the applicability of the proposed method a comparative test regarding the other methods was performed for two cases the weather conditions wind direction and speed wave direction and speed and wave height 24 h forecast data forecast data are obtained from the china marine environmental forecasting center case 1 and european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf via satellite communication while at sea case 2 for example fig 6 a and b show the wind direction and speed forecast data for the next 24 h of case 1 and case 2 respectively 5 2 results and discussion 5 2 1 case 1 fig 8 a shows the actual route the shortest route the weather route and the proposed route when the lsfo price is set 500 usd ton the shortest route covers the smallest distance from the departure port to the arrival port the weather route is a pre planned route that considers the weather forecast it is generated by the proposed method without considering the eca including speed optimization table 3 shows the detailed information for the results avoiding bad weather along the weather route ultimately saves costs as such it is the route with the smallest total cost before the issuance of eca regulations when considering eca regulations the proposed method yielded the optimal route and speed in terms of total cost the total cost was reduced by 15 507 dollars compared to the actual route even with the increase in total distance table 4 compares the ship emissions between the actual and proposed method the proposed method reduces the sailing distance and speed within the eca this reduces the fuel consumption in the eca therefore the proposed method can effectively simultaneous reduce total cost and ship emissions within the eca however the lsfo fuel consumption increased due to the longer sailing distance and acceleration outsides of eca by the proposed method thereby increasing global emissions fig 7 b visualizes the results of the four optimization methods for case 1 these four methods can effectively reduce the sailing distance within the eca thereby reducing the total cost based on the lower fuel consumption of mgo the es isochrone and proposed method performed a simultaneous optimization of the path and speed on the route table 5 shows detailed information about the results the proposed method yielded the optimal route reducing the total cost by nearly 17 compared to the actual route which is higher than other three methods 5 2 2 case 2 fig 8 a visualizes the results for the ship route planning for case 2 according to the five methods the actual route is the benchmark here the lsfo price is set 400 per ton table 6 shows the detailed information associated with the results the proposed method yielded the optimal route reducing the total cost by nearly 15 052 dollars compared to the actual route if the ship operator provides services for 50 such voyages during a year the cost is estimated to be reduced by nearly 800 000 per year which is of great value to shipping companies fig 8 b visualizes the results for the ship route planning for case 2 based on different lsfo prices the price difference between lsfo and mgo decreases as lsfo prices rise this may result in large changes in the ship s optimal route if the lsfo and mgo prices are the same the route generated by the proposed method is the weather route table 7 provides detailed information about the results of proposed method based on different lsfo prices the ship will reduce the total sailing distance and the lsfo fuel consumption as the lsfo prices rise this will lead to a corresponding increase in the sailing distance and mgo fuel consumption within the eca in addition the difference between the average speed inside and outside the eca will decrease as the lsfo prices rise table 8 compares different lsfo prices based on the optimal route and speed it shows that the lower lsfo price will reduce the sailing distance within the eca reducing eca s ship emissions in contrast due to the increase in total sailing distance and lsfo fuel consumption the total ship emissions will increase 6 concluding remarks many ship operators use low sulphur fuel e g marine gas oil within established emission control areas ecas to meet regulatory requirements because low sulphur fuel often costs more than the lsfo commonly used in ships many ship operators switch fuels and discharge lsfo outside the ecas to reduce operating costs existing methods to optimize ship speed and route rarely consider eca as such this study established a ship speed and route optimization model that considered the presence of ecas we analyzed two cases to verify the validity of the proposed method the results show that the proposed method can reduce the sailing distance and pollution emissions within the eca however it may increase the total sailing distance even with a longer distance the proposed method still can effectively reduce the ship s totally operating costs moreover with the sulphur cap approaching in 2020 may lead to fluctuations in lsfo prices therefore we analyze the optimal solutions generated by the proposed method under different lsfo prices the results show that the proposed method can provide the optimal route and speed plan for shipping companies at different lsfo prices this study may help shipping companies design ship speeds and routes to reduce ship costs in the context of eca from a policy perspective this study found that the eca setting may force shipping companies to select a longer route to avoid ecas potentially decreasing co2 nox and other emissions within the eca but increasing global emissions therefore in the long term when establishing ecas actual ship routes should be fully considered and new ships should be encouraged to use clean energy such as natural gas as fuel moreover this method is also suitable for the possible wca regulations in the future it only requires to modify the eca boundary information to wca boundary information credit authorship contribution statement dongfang ma conceptualization methodology software weihao ma data curation

21958,the residual ultimate strength of stiffened plates with dent damage under compressive load was investigated by using the commercial software abaqus the influences of some important factors such as the dent depth dent size and dent angle in association with the stiffened panel s ultimate limit state were discussed in detail assuming that the stiffener is always perpendicular to the involved plate elements in the dent producing process a simple formula is proposed to represent the lateral deflection of the stiffeners and the dent based on the numerical results the reduction factors of the compressive ultimate strength of stiffened plates are expressed as functions of the relative dent depth and dent length in addition the relationship between the residual ultimate strength of the stiffened plates and the dent inclination is also presented by a cosine function keywords stiffened plate dent damage ultimate strength longitudinal thrust nonlinear fem 1 introduction the plate and stiffened plate elements serve as the basic units of hull structure the local plate structures first have local buckling failure under the action of external loads next to the collapse failure of hull girders when the ship hull is subjected to vertical bending moment the deck and bottom plate structures are subjected to tensile and compressive loads the deck or bottom plate structures primarily exhibit buckling or yielding behaviors thus it is of important significance to analyze the ultimate bearing capacity of stiffened plate structure under compressive load for the safe design of ship structures the general service life of the ships after their construction averages more than 20 years during the operation process ships may experience adverse sea conditions some accidental events may occur in the actual operational cases such as grounding collision and cargo falling that will cause large plastic deflection of ship local plate elements in contrast to the cracking damage the produced dents do not destroy the component continuity of the hull structures compared to ship corrosion the dents also have no significant reduction effects on the plate thickness of the local damaged region of hull structures however the amplitude of plastic deformation related to local dents can be several times larger than that of the structural initial deflection caused by the welding fabrication in recent years many collision tests have been conducted on ship plate structures and the damage characteristics of local structures e g plates and stiffened plates subjected to collision impact have been analyzed paik et al paik and seo 2007 studied the fracture behavior of ship panels under impact or grounding load by experimental tests and numerical methods the progressive structural crashworthiness of ships and ship shaped offshore structures under collisions or grounding was analyzed by evaluating the accidental energy absorption capability of ship structures cho and lee 2009 conducted a series of lateral impact experiments for 33 stiffened plates to analyze the structural damage behavior of stiffened plate structures under grounding damage the test results illustrated that the depth of the dent generated by the stamping striker can be 10 times larger than the plate thickness yang and wang yang and wang 2016 yang et al 2018 studied the dynamic response and dynamic ultimate strength of stiffened plate under in plane impact loading and the influences of some parameters were discussed in detail liu and guedes soares liu and guedes soares 2019 have been conducted to studied the plastic dynamic response and failure of clamped struck rectangular steel plates by quasi static punching tests and low velocity impact tests a simplified method was proposed to evaluate the material strain rate effect at varied plastic strains in the simulations by summarizing results of these collision impact tests it can be found that the hull structure is easily involved in local large plastic deformation under the impacting of rigid objects when the punching energy exceeds the energy absorbing capability of plate structures the stiffened plate will be torn out and fracture behavior of local plate will occur otherwise the plate elements will undergo large plastic deformation and the stiffeners will undergo sharp lateral deflection during the lateral impacting process of the indenters dow and smith 1984 firstly studied the buckling and post buckling behavior of a slender rectangular plate with local initial deformation under uniaxial compression by numerical methods it was pointed out that the amplitude of local defects was one of the main parameters that affecting the plate collapse behavior harding and onoufriou 1995 carried out 9 experiments to analyze the axial compressive strength of stiffened cylindrical shell with dents and different dent sizes were considered in their experiment paik et al paik et al 2003 paik 2005 studied the effect of dent shape dent size depth diameter and dent position on the ultimate strength of simply supported plates under axial compression and shear loads by nonlinear finite element method they found that the dent moving towards the unloaded plate edge had the largest effect on the plate s ultimate strength with reduction of 20 compared to the central dent prabu et al 2007 investigated the influence of different dents on the buckling strength of steel cylindrical shells using the numerical method they found that when the dent length was small changing the size and inclination of the dents had little effect on the residual strength of cylinder specimens luís et al 2008 analyzed the ultimate strength of a simple plate with local dent damage under compressive loads guedes soares et al guedes soares et al 2008 illustrated that the effect of local defects mainly depends on the shape of the dent damage and the amplitude of the plastic deformation while the influence of dent location is related to the magnitude of the damaged area witkowska and guedes soares witkowska and guedes soares 2009a witkowska and guedes soares 2015 studied the effect of local damage of stiffeners on the ultimate strength of stiffened panels taking into account changes in significant parameters including the dent position dent size and number of dents it was found that local damage on the stiffeners changed the failure mode of the stiffened plate under compression the position and initial overall deformation of the dent are two main factors that decrease the residual strength of the stiffened plates raviprakash et al raviprakash et al 2011 raviprakash and prabualagumurthi 2012 selected various dent parameters including dent length dent depth and dent orientation to evaluate the residual ultimate strength of dented plates under uniaxial compressive load they indicated that the dent effect was in some degree magnified as the plate thickness increased lang and kwon 2012 studied the producing mechanism of the dent impacting on the aircraft plate using the finite element method the material property of aluminum alloy 2024 t3 was taken into account xu and guedes soares xu and guedes soares 2013 xu and guedes soares 2015 used quasi static loading process to analyze the generation of punching dents the relationship between dent depth and punching load was given li et al 2014 investigated the residual ultimate strength of 2024 t3 aluminum plate under the action of compressive load by the drop weight impacting tests ghazijahani et al 2014 analyzed the buckling and post buckling behavior of cylindrical shell structures with dent damage under the action of uniform external pressure and axial compressive load it was found that the buckling behavior of cylindrical shells first occurred near the dent damage the transverse dents perpendicular to the direction of the compressive load have much greater effect on the cylindrical shell than the vertical dents or inclined dents saad eldeen et al 2016a studied the effect of local dents on the ultimate strength of steel compressive plates they found that when the direction of dent deformation is opposite to that of the initial imperfection the influence of the dent on the ultimate strength of the plate was weakened saad eldeen et al 2015 used a box girder model simplified from a single hull oil tanker to analyze the effect of corrosion and dent damage on the vertical bending performance of ship hull structures by changing the dent position and depth they found that the dent had the greatest effect on the girder s ultimate strength when it was near the edge or center of the deck plate peroumal et al 2015 compared the effects of the overall geometric imperfection and that of local dent on the plate s buckling strength they indicated that the dent damage was more significant only when the thicker plate was applied li et al 2015 employed the axial tensile tests to analyze the fracture behavior of the 2024 t3 aluminum alloy plate with dent damage and found that the dented plate was more vulnerable to fracture failure than the intact one cerik 2015 proposed simplified empirical formula to predict the residual strength of orthogonally stiffened cylindrical shell subjected to axial compressive load based on the experimental and numerical simulation results saad eldeen et al 2016b investigated the relationship between ultimate strength and plate thickness for plates with different shapes of dents shapes they defined the toughness modulus to evaluate the material s ability to absorb energy and resist plastic deformation when a stiffened plate is subjected to a compressive load the influence of the stiffeners may lead to different buckling failure modes of the plate structures the local plate deformation in the dent area however will completely change the collapse failure mode of the stiffened plate elements and sharply reduce the compressive ultimate strength of the stiffened structures without breaking the integrality of hull structure moreover large deformation is not only introduced to the plate element during the dent producing process but also to the corresponding stiffener elements because of the deflection of local plate thus it is necessary to analyze the influence of the dents on the buckling behavior of compressive stiffened plates and evaluate the ultimate strength of damaged structure considering the lateral deformation of local stiffeners as a result this paper considers the influence of the main dent parameters including the dent depth d d dent size transverse width d w and longitudinal length d l and dent angle θ on the ultimate strength of stiffened plates under uniaxial compression load the lateral deflection of the stiffener webs caused by the local dent has been considered to analyze the post buckling behavior of the compressive stiffened panel based on the calculated numerical data simple equations are given to assess the residual ultimate strength of the plate structures as functions of the dent depth and dent size 2 finite element model of stiffened plate the stiffened plate considered in this paper is obtained from the central part of the deck structures of one ordinary vessel and the models of 1 2 1 1 2 bays in the longitudinal direction are adopted in the fe analyses as shown in fig 1 the dotted lines represent the position of transverse beams to simplify the calculation the transverse members are substituted by the corresponding boundary conditions and the dent is initially assumed to be located in the central region of the stiffened model wherein d w is the dent transverse width d l is the dent longitudinal length and s 1 and s 2 are the distance from the dent to the corresponding stiffened plate boundary the geometry dimensions applied in the stiffened plate model are as follows the main geometrical dimensions of plate panels are a longitudinal span b stiffener spacing and t plate thickness to vary the column slenderness ratio λ three different stiffener sizes are considered as shown in table 1 h w and t w are the web height and thickness for tee stiffeners h f and t f are the flange width and thickness zhang and khan 2009 performed a review on the structural designs of 12 contemporary double hull oil tankers and 10 bulk carriers with length between 150 m and 400 m the aspect ratio a b of plates in the midship region was found to be 3 5 to 6 7 for tanker decks and bottoms and 4 6 to 6 3 for bulk carrier decks and 3 0 to 4 5 for bulk carrier bottoms therefore the plate aspect ratio is changed from 3 3 to 10 with stiffener span from 300 mm to 900 mm in this paper the material is assumed to behave in an elastic perfectly plastic manner with a certain yield stress by many authors in the fem analysis that has been proven reasonable thus no material hardening effect is considered in this paper the high tensile strength steel has been widely applied in the ship construction process especially in warship structures thus the materials of the plates and stiffeners are taken as the same with yield stress of σ y 590 m p a the young s modulus is taken as e 206000 n m m 2 and poisson s ratio is taken as λ 0 3 the initial deformation imperfection of stiffened plates will be introduced by the fillet welding in the real ship structures this imperfection has significant influence on the ultimate strength behavior of stiffened panels including the ultimate strength values other initial imperfection such as the welding residual stress may also have some effects on the collapse behavior of plate structures however it is not considered in present study the shape of initial deflections are considered corresponding to the buckling modes of stiffened plates including the plate initial deflection column type initial distortions of stiffeners with attached plating and sideways initial distortions of independent stiffeners as following hughes and paik 2010 the plate initial deflection w o p 1 w o p δ o sin m π z a sin π x b m is the buckling half wave number in the longitudinal direction which is taken as a minimum integer corresponding to a b which must satisfy the following equation for plates under only longitudinal thrust 2 a b m m 1 column type initial deflection of stiffeners w o s 3 w o s 0 0015 a sin π z a sin π x b 0 where b 0 is the transverse span between longitudinal girders it is taken as b 0 7500 m m in this paper sideways initial deflection of independent stiffeners v o s 4 v o s 0 0015 a h w y sin π z a where h w is the stiffener s web height the maximum amplitude of local plate deflection δ o is taken as a function of the slenderness ratio β in an average level smith et al 1988 5 δ o 0 1 β o 2 t β is the plate slenderness ratio expressed as follows 6 β b t p σ y e the nonlinear finite element analysis is conducted by employing the commercial software abaqus 6 13 the nonlinear shell finite element s4r is used for modeling plate and stiffener elements as a general four nodes shell element including both reduced integral method and hourglass control mode which is suitable for large deformation analysis the newton raphson algorithm is applied as a method of incremental solution to trace the proper collapse and post buckling process in structural nonlinear analysis the finite element model is shown in fig 2 the displacement controlled method has been adopted for load applying with respect to the boundary conditions of stiffened plate under compression in the issc report 2012 issc 2012 this paper adopts the boundary conditions presented in table 2 the simplified boundary condition shown in table 2 has been widely used for 1 2 1 1 2 bay models zhang and khan 2009 issc 2012 tanaka et al 2014 xu et al 2013 ao et al 2019 the constant forced displacement has been applied at the nodes of edge a1 b1 and a2 b2 oppositely during the non linear fe analysis due to the opposite loading no rigid body motion will happen in the z direction actually edges a a1 and b b1 are elastically supported by stiffeners it is assumed to be simply supported in this paper the dof constraint is directly applied on edge nodes the element sizes of 15 30 50 mm are selected as comparison to determine the available mesh size to provide accurate results the difference ratio of ultimate stress is within 1 for these three sizes 364 2 mpa for 15 mm 365 4 mpa for 30 mm 368 0 mpa for 50 mm thus 17 mesh elements between stiffeners and 108 elements between transverse members is taken for the plate 7 mesh elements for the stiffener webs and 4 elements for the stiffener flanges in the cross section the general fine grid size is adopted as 28 mm for providing valid numerical results the ultimate strength of intact stiffened plate obtained by the fe method is compared with that by the empirical methods zhang and khan 2009 as shown in table 3 the stiffener type t2 is applied the max error is 1 54 indicating that the value of the ultimate strength obtained by the fe approach in this paper is valid the ultimate strength obtained by the fe approach used in this paper is also compared with the result by the stiffened panel test xu and guedes soares 2012 the size of the test model is a b 300 150 m m for the plate and 30 8 m m for the stiffener the yield stress is 469 mpa the collapse failure mode 2 b in the transverse direction is shown as following it can be seen from fig 3 that the failure mode obtained by the finite element method used in this paper is exactly the same compared to the experimental result meanwhile the stiffness of the load displacement curve in fe analysis changes similarly compared to that of the experimental curves during the loading process shown in fig 4 the ultimate stress obtained by the fe approach for the test model with the same boundary condition applied in this paper is 385 6 mpa with 0 3 error compared to the test result of 386 8 mpa 3 plate dent damage in numerical analysis the dent damage can be introduced to the intact plates in two forms most of the previous research investigated the influence of a dent by changing the positions of the element nodes with simple equations of dent shape alternatively the dent was simulated by the indenter crushing through the quasi static method according to the previous summary of the dent shape paik et al paik et al 2003 paik 2005 prabu et al 2007 raviprakash et al 2012 this paper considers three types of dent shapes for comparison as the conical dent the exponential dent and the sine dent the cross sections of these three types of dent shapes are shown in fig 5 it can be seen from fig 5 that when the dent depth d d longitudinal length d l and transverse width d w are the same the conical dent and sine dent have the same sectional area in contrast the section area of the exponential dent is relatively smaller the non dimensional coefficient η d is proposed to describe the difference of dent plastic deformations corresponding to different dent shapes expressed as η d v d d d a d e n t v d is the volume of the dent deformation a d e n t is the dent projected area to the plate it implied that the exponential dent had the least plastic deformation with same dent dimensions η d 0 11 for exponential dent η d 0 32 for conical and sine dent conical dent 7 w d d d 1 z 0 5 d l 1 x 0 5 d w 0 5 d w x 0 5 d w 0 5 d l z 0 5 d l exponential dent 8 w d d d e 6 z d l 2 e 6 x d w 2 0 5 d w x 0 5 d w 0 5 d l z 0 5 d l sine dent 9 w d d d sin 2 π z 0 5 d l d l sin 2 π x 0 5 d w d w 0 5 d w x 0 5 d w 0 5 d l z 0 5 d l in the above equations w d is the dent plastic deformation in y direction d d is the dent depth d l is the longitudinal length and d w is the transverse width of dent fig 6 shows the comparison of the influence of different dents on the ultimate strength of the stiffened plate with respect to different dent depths the obtained results indicate that the sine dent has the most significant reduction on the ultimate strength of stiffened plate this observation is reasonable because the deflection volume of the exponential dent η d is smaller than that of the other two types of dents with the same shape parameters as a result we adopted the sine dent as the local dent shape for the subsequent dent parameter studies with conservative evaluation of the ultimate strength when a local damage is produced by the fall and strike of an object the residual plastic deformation of the plate structure will be modified by the shape of the indenter xu and guedes soares xu and guedes soares 2013 suggested that the residual plastic deformation of the plates to be separated in two parts namely local dent deflection and global dent deflection in this paper we followed their studies and assumed the amplitude of the global deflection of the dent was equal to that of the local deflection in this case the form of the dent can be expressed as follows the local dent deflection w d l 10 w d l d d 2 sin 2 π x d w sin 2 π z d l 0 5 d w x 0 5 d w 0 5 d l z 0 5 d l the global dent deflection w d g 11 w d g d d 2 sin π z a sin π x b 0 the whole dent is obtained by 12 w d w d l w d g fig 7 shows the von mises stress distribution of the compressive stiffened plate at the ultimate state it is observed that the stress distribution pattern of compressed stiffened plate with dent damage is quite different from that of the stiffened plate without the dent because of the presence of the dent the collapse failure zone of stiffened plate in the ultimate state is concentrated at the dent position instead of being distributed over the whole panel in the buckling process of the compressive stiffened plate the maximum stress of the plate structures first appears at the joint of the dent and the stiffened web and then expands to the local panel connected with the dent as the external load gradually grows the stress and displacement curves of typical positions were given as comparison for stiffened plates with and without dents fig 8 shows the positions of these picked nodes it can be seen from fig 9 that the stiffener plate attached node b in the central place has the largest mises equivalent stress for stiffened plate with dent damage the von mises stress distribution along the line 1 is quite different from that along line 2 for dented stiffened plates during the collapse process however the stress distribution is almost the same in line 1 and line 2 for stiffened plates without dents in addition the largest stress first appears in plate node c for no dent models in the buckling process from fig 10 we can see that the vertical displacements of nodes located in line 1 are obviously larger than that in line 2 for dented stiffened plates while it changes little of node displacements in line 1 compared to line 2 in the elastic stage for intact stiffened plates in the pre buckling stage the plate has slight displacement tracking the initial deflection as a result the vertical displacement initially approaches to negative value at node c1 however the stiffened plate will have collapse failure after reaching the ultimate state the node near the collapse region will have large vertical displacement then the vertical displacement of node c1 changes to positive value 4 lateral deformation of stiffeners caused by dents test results illustrated that the impact of wedge shape indenters not only produces dent deflection at the local stiffened plate but also causes obvious lateral deformation to the stiffener webs in the crushed region cho and lee 2009 liu et al 2015a 2015b as the stiffeners can remarkably enhance the ability of stiffened plate to resist external load and significantly change the collapse failure mode of plate structures it is necessary to consider the lateral deformation of local stiffeners generated by the dents in analyzing the ultimate strength of dent stiffened plates witkowska and guedes soares witkowska and guedes soares 2009b used fe tools to analyze the buckling behavior and ultimate strength of stiffened plates considering the influence of the welding residual deflection and local damage on the stiffeners the local damage of stiffeners can be expressed by the following formula 13 w l w l 0 sin 2 π z l w sin 2 π y 2 h w where w l 0 is the damage amplitude lateral depth l w is the length of local damage and h w is the web height of stiffeners the stiffener warping due to the global dent deflection is much smaller than that of local dent deflection in this regard stiffener global deflection due to denting is superposed by the column type deflection of stiffeners substituting eq 10 into eq 13 this paper gives the expression for the local lateral deformation of the stiffeners corresponding to the local dent deflection w d l as follows 14 w s t f f w s sin 2 π z d l sin 2 π y d d 2 sin 2 π x 1 d l sin 2 π z d w 2 h w where w s is the amplitude of stiffener lateral deformation and x 1 is the transverse coordinate of the stiffener fig 11 shows a schematic diagram of the stiffened plate considering both the local plate deformation and the stiffener lateral deformation caused by dents assuming that the stiffener is still vertical to the local plate in the process of large plastic deformation the amplitude of lateral deflection of the stiffeners w s will be linearly related to the height of the dent deflection h s at the coordinate of stiffeners expressed as w s h s h w d p fig 12 shows that the value of the residual ultimate strength of the stiffened plate is decreasing as the amplitude of lateral deflection of the stiffeners caused by dents increases in this part the dent depth is taken as d d 84 m m and the dent size is taken as d l d w 1500 m m therefore h s is taken as h s 63 m m the amplitude of lateral deflection of the local stiffener is changed in the range of w s 0 12 5 25 37 5 50 62 5 and 75 mm compared to the influence of the panel deflection caused by the dents on the ultimate strength of stiffened plates the effect of lateral deflection of the stiffeners is relatively small with the greatest decrease of 6 9 the collapse failure mode of the stiffened panel will be very different with respect to different plate thicknesses under the action of compressive load when the stiffeners are the same considering this the effect of the local deflection of the stiffeners on the buckling behavior and ultimate strength may be different for stiffened plates with various plate thicknesses fig 13 shows the difference ratio of ultimate strength for the stiffened plates with three types of the local stiffener damage w s 25 50 75 mm it can be seen from fig 13 that the influence of the lateral deflection of the stiffener on ultimate strength of the panels is significantly improved when the thickness of stiffened plate is too large or small due to the change of the plate thickness the error band of residual ultimate strength of the whole stiffened plate caused by the lateral deflection of the stiffener can be up to 18 5 fig 14 presents the deformation distribution of dent stiffened plates at the ultimate limit state under compressive loads it can be seen that the dominant plastic deformation in the collapse process of stiffened plates transfers from the local plate elements to the damaged stiffeners when considering large local stiffener deflection 5 results of the finite element analysis in contrast to cracking the area of the net section of stiffened plate is not changed due to dent damage in case that the ship plate is not ruptured thus the residual ultimate strength of damaged stiffened plate cannot be easily obtained by using the net section theory moreover the presence of the dent will not cause the reduction of the plate thickness in the locally damaged region compared to the corrosion effect in fact the production process of the dent is not only coupled with large deformation of local structures but also has residual stress existing in the striking area xu and guedes soares xu and guedes soares 2015 employed the quasi static method to simulate the indenter punching process and found that the introduced residual stress caused by dents has little influence on the ultimate strength of stiffened plate with mean error of approximately 2 furthermore the residual stress caused by dents may be both the tensile stress as well as compressive stress in case of the former the bearing capacity of the stiffened plate to resist the compressive load is increased otherwise the compressive strength of the stiffened panel is decreased therefore this paper does not consider the influence of residual stress in the producing process of the dents as well as that caused by the welding procedure the dents were created by changing the coordinate value of the corresponding nodes using different forms of dent shape function 5 1 influence of initial deflection in order to investigate the effects of initial distortion on the ultimate strength of dented stiffened plates the amplitude of the initial geometric imperfection was assumed to change equally with an increment coefficient n in the form of n 0 01 β 2 t smith et al 1988 pointed out that the amplitude of severe initial deflection 0 03 β 2 t could be three times of average initial deflection 0 01 β 2 t therefore the constant coefficient n is taken as 0 5 1 1 5 2 three types of initial deflection shapes have been considered as discussed before in section 2 eqs 1 4 table 4 shows the average ultimate stress of dented plates for different cases the plate thickness was taken as t 14 mm and dl dw it can be seen that the severe initial deflection has greatly reduced the ultimate strength of stiffened plates of no dent however the average ultimate stress of stiffened plate with larger dent changes little as the initial deflection amplitude increases therefore we only considered one amplitude of the initial distortion for the dented stiffened plates taken as δ 0 0 01 β 2 t 5 2 influence of dent size and depth the dominant parameters of dent damage include the vertical projection size of the dent and the dent depth cho and lee 2009 analyzed the damage extent of a stiffened plate by using the lateral impact experimental method their test results found that for the stiffened plate the maximum amplitude of the local plastic deformation caused by collision can be up to 22 77 times the plate thickness t p to facilitate the analysis firstly the longitudinal length d l and transverse width d w of the dent are assumed to be the same taken as d l d w 500 1000 and 1500 mm the dent depth d d is taken as d d 28 56 84 112 140 mm when different plate thicknesses are applied the failure modes of the stiffened panel under compressive load will change the thickness of the stiffened plate is chosen in the range of t p 10 14 18 and 22 mm three stiffener sizes are considered namely as t1 t2 t3 given in table 1 the lateral plastic deformation of the local stiffeners has been considered and the amplitude of the lateral deformation is determined by w s h s h w d p figs 15 17 shows the influence of dent size and depth on the residual ultimate strength of stiffened plate with respect to different plate thicknesses it is observed from the results that both the dent size and dent depth have great effect on the ultimate strength of the stiffened plate when the dent length and depth reach the value dd 140 mm and dl dw 1500 mm the residual ultimate stress of the stiffened plate is significantly reduced to 234 6 mpa 285 2 mpa 297 3 mpa for t1 t2 t3 it is about 61 2 64 8 65 1 the value of that without dents the dent size and the dent depth should be considered together for the assessment of the residual ultimate strength of dented stiffened structures in this section both local and global dent deflections as expressed in eqs 10 12 are considered thus the size of the local dent deflection has less effect than the dent depth on the residual ultimate strength of the stiffened plate anyway the dent depth plays much more important role if the dent depth is much too small for example d d t 14 m m d l d w 1500 m m the residual ultimate stress is 411 9 mpa the difference ratio is only 3 compared to that without dent when the plate aspect ratio a b decreases the influence of dent damage on the ultimate strength of stiffened plate will be smaller the residual ultimate strength σ u σ u 0 is 0 63 0 65 0 66 0 70 for a b 10 6 4 3 3 3 with the dent d w d l 3 b and d d 140 m m therefore the variables related to plate aspect ratio and stiffener sizes are included the reduction factor r u is proposed to evaluate the residual ultimate strength for dented stiffened plates as a function of dent depth and width using the matlab tools 15 r u σ u σ u 0 5 874 d d 1000 2 d 1 d d 1000 0 995 16 d 1 0 0637 d w b 2 0 498 d w b 0 131 0 788 b a d 2 17 d 2 2 235 i s a s 2 2 7 053 i s a s 2 7 792 where σ u is the ultimate strength of dented stiffened plate with dent damage σ u 0 is the ultimate strength of stiffened plate without dent damage i s and a s are the geometrical moment of inertia and sectional area of one stiffener in order to verify the validity of the proposed formulae more fe results were obtained by changing the stiffener span b to 300 mm and 900 mm the stiffened plate of a bulk carrier with a b 2550 850 m m was also considered plate thickness changing from 11 mm to 22 mm issc 2012 the stiffener size was taken as t 4 235 10 90 15 m m in additional flat type of stiffener f1 with size of 260 2 12 4 mm was also considered table 5 shows the details of the accessorial results in appendix a the total number of fe results is 330 compared to 330 obtained results shown in fig 18 and fig 19 the proposed formula is clarified to be effective with 85 7 of results within 5 error band and all in 10 error band the average value is 1 01 and the coefficient of variation cov is 3 1 the residual ultimate strength of dented stiffened plate can be calculated by using eq 15 it should be noticed that both the local global dent deflection and lateral deformation of the stiffeners has been considered in the finite element analysis as a result the predicted result by eq 15 will be smaller than that without considering the lateral deformation of the stiffeners the plate slenderness ratios of considered stiffened plates are changing from 1 146 to 4 81 therefore the proposed formula is only available for stiffened plates with plate slenderness ratio β in the range of 1 5 the proposed formula was also validated with 119 results of xu and guedes soares s research xu and guedes soares 2013 xu and guedes soares 2015 their model is described as following fb2a2 flat bar fb2a2 frame spacing a 2 200 mm 3 300 mm 4 400 mm etc fb2a2 a two stiffeners in the transverse direction b four stiffeners in the transverse direction fb2a2 2 two spans in the longitudinal direction 1 2 1 1 2 3 three spans in the longitudinal direction the yield stress is 483 mpa the plate thickness is 4 mm with flat stiffener f 2 30 8 m m the results of references are shown in table 6 in their papers the dents were introduced directly by simulating the process of the indenters impacting on the plates as a result the dent size with same dent depth could be quite different for models with various frame spacing a the compared results are shown in fig 20 and fig 21 the max error is 9 4 all the compared results are within 10 error band and 84 8 of the results are within 5 the average value of reference formula is 1 01 and the coefficient of variation cov is 3 2 which indicates the formula valid 5 3 change as dent angle to simplify the fe analysis it is assumed that longitudinal length d l is equal to the transverse width d w when analyzing the influence of dent parameters on the ultimate strength of the stiffened plate in this case the vertical projection shape of the dent to the plate is a square shape round square dent however the longitudinal and transverse dimension of the dent produced in collision or grounding accident may not be the same in this case the dent will be a slender one when the dent rotates to a certain angle along vertical axis the collapse failure mode of the stiffened panel may be quite different in contrast to that with the round square dents therefore it is necessary to evaluate the effects of the dent angle on the ultimate strength and the post buckling behavior of compressive stiffened plate for the dent with different aspect ratio d w d l in order to analyze the influence of the dent angles on the ultimate strength of stiffened plates only local dent deformation w d l was considered in this section the dent aspect ratio d w d l changes as 250 1500 750 1500 and 1250 1500 the dent angle θ is defined between the long edge of the dent and the longitudinal direction of the stiffened plate as shown in fig 1 and taken in the range of 0 15 30 45 60 75 and 90 fig 22 shows that the relationship between the residual ultimate strength of the stiffened plate and the dent angle can be expressed by a cosine function as the aspect ratio of the dent increases the influence of the dent angle on the residual ultimate strength becomes much more obvious when the dent angle is zero the dent direction is the same as that of the compressive load such a dent is called a vertical dent the vertical dent has the minimum influence on the ultimate strength of the stiffened plate when the short edge is small enough for the vertical dent the dent slightly increased the ability of the stiffened plate to resist compression deflection at the dent angle setting of θ 90 the dent direction is perpendicular to the load direction such a dent is called a transverse dent in this case the equivalent length of the dent vertical to the external load reaches the peak value and the ultimate strength of stiffened plate reduces to the minimum value due to the variation in the dent angle the difference can be as large as 62 5 fig 23 shows the influence of the dent angle on the ultimate strength of the stiffened plate corresponding to different plate thicknesses it can be observed that the ultimate stress of the compressive stiffened plate can still be expressed as trigonometric function of the dent angle despite the change in plate thickness when different plate thicknesses are adopted the residual ultimate strength of stiffened plate does not change significantly with max error less than 5 thus the effect of dent inclination on the ultimate strength of the stiffened plate is mainly determined by the aspect ratio d w d l of the dent the dent depth d d and the dent angle θ rather than the plate thickness fig 24 shows the mises stress distribution of the dent stiffened plate with various dent angles at the ultimate limit state it can be seen that the dent has greatly changed the stress distribution of stiffened structures compared to the intact panel the local collapse failure mode caused by the dent becomes much more obvious with the increase in the dent angle based on the above fe results the residual factor r u is given to present the relationship between the residual ultimate strength of the stiffened plate and the dent angle as below 18 r u σ u σ u 0 a 1 c o s 2 θ c 1 where σ u 0 is the ultimate strength of intact stiffened plate the coefficients a 1 and c 1 are functions related to the dent aspect ratio and the depth expressed by the following formula 19 a 1 c 1 f d w d l d d when the dent depth is chosen as a constant value for example d d 140 mm the coefficients a 1 and c 1 can be respectively established as functions of dent aspect ratio d w d l using the least square method the coefficients are confirmed as when θ 45 20 a 1 0 4056 d w d l 2 0 3933 21 c 1 0 1314 d w d l 2 0 2412 d w d l 0 6892 when θ 45 22 a 1 0 1554 d w d l 2 0 5137 d w d l 0 341 23 c 1 0 04455 d w d l 2 0 1146 d w d l 0 6508 the average value of fem formula results is 1 0 and the coefficient of variation cov is 1 8 as discussed in the previous section the effect of the dent angle on the ultimate strength of stiffened plate becomes much larger when the aspect ratio d w d l decreases the ultimate stress σ u σ u 0 reduced from 1 to 0 38 for d w d l 250 1500 and from 0 69 to 0 59 for d w d l 1250 1500 however when the dent is perpendicular or parallel to the external load orientation transverse dent or longitudinal dent the effects of the dent on the ultimate strength of the stiffened plate may be different by changing the aspect ratios of the dents fig 25 shows the stress strain curve of the stiffened plate under the action of compression with longitudinal and transverse dent corresponding to different dent aspect ratios d w d l it can be seen that the residual ultimate strength of the stiffened plates becomes smaller when the aspect ratio increases this phenomenon occurs because the dent projecting length vertical to the load orientation increases when the dent aspect ratio increases however for the transverse dent cases when the dent aspect ratio increases the dent becomes slenderer as a result the local plate buckling effects caused by the dents will be more obvious leading to the smaller value of the ultimate strength of the stiffened plate fig 26 presents the average stress strain curves of stiffened plates corresponding to different dent lengths d l when the dent width d w is adopted as a small one for example d w 0 5 b σ u o is the average ultimate stress for intact stiffened plate it can be seen from fig 26 that the value of the longitudinal length d l has little influence on the residual strength of the stiffened structures with a maximum error of 2 when the transverse width d w is small in this case the ultimate compressive stress of stiffened plate is roughly the same compared to that of the intact stiffened plates implying that the effect the dent presents on stiffened plate is negligible thus the effect of the primary dent size on the ultimate strength of the stiffened plate mainly depends on the dent projecting length which is perpendicular with the compressive load direction in case that the equivalent projecting length is too small the dent will have no effect on the ultimate bearing capacity of the stiffened plate fig 27 show the mises stress distributions of stiffened plates at the ultimate limit state corresponding to different longitudinal lengths and transverse widths of the dents it can be seen that the area of failure region of the stiffened plate increases gradually when the longitudinal length d l becomes larger implying that reducing effect caused by the dent damage is decreasing in contrast fig 28 shows that the stress distribution of the stiffened plate at the ultimate state when the transverse width d w is tiny the stress distribution of stiffened plates in the collapsed state is similar that of the intact stiffened plates it indicates that the transverse width of the dent is much more significant than the longitudinal length 5 4 influence of the dent position during the operation of the real ship the local dent damage is produced randomly the dent is not always located at the central span of stiffened panel the buckling failure modes of the stiffened plate may be different depending on the dent location as a result this paper considered the effect of the dent position on the ultimate strength of the stiffened plate by changing the dent location in the longitudinal direction s 1 and the transverse direction s 2 figs 29 30 present the average stress strain curves of the stiffened plate under the compressive stress with respect to different dent distances moving in the longitudinal and transverse orientation respectively it shows in fig 29 that the dent longitudinal position has little influence on the ultimate strength of the stiffened plate with the error of 2 1 thus the displacement of the dent in the longitudinal direction has insignificant effect on the residual strength of stiffened plate in case that the dent moving in the transverse direction of the stiffened panel the stiffened panel will steps into the post buckling state earlier and the residual ultimate stress of stiffened plate becomes smaller when the dent is closer to the unloaded edge with the change in the horizontal position of the dent the ultimate compressive stress has the reduction of 7 1 6 conclusions casual accidents such as grounding collision and object falling that occur during the ship operation period would introduce dent damage to the local plate elements of the hull structures compared to the welding induced deflection during the ship construction process the amplitude of the dent plastic deflection will be significantly much larger this paper employed the nonlinear finite element method to analyze the influence of dent damage on the ultimate strength of a stiffened plate the dominating dent parameters considered include dent depth dent size dent angle and plate thickness considering that the plate large deformation induced by dents is always coupled with lateral deflection of related stiffeners this paper proposed a simple equation to simulate the local damage of stiffeners caused by dents and analyzed the influence of lateral deflection of the stiffeners on residual ultimate strength of stiffened plate based on the finite element results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the comparative analysis regarding the dent shape of exponential conical and sine shape illustrates that the influence of dent shape on the ultimate strength of a stiffened plate is determined mainly by the volume of dent plastic deformation the non dimensional coefficient η d was proposed when the related coefficient η d is larger the dent will more significantly reduce the ultimate strength of stiffened plates 2 assuming that the stiffener is still vertical to the local plate in the process of large plastic deformation this paper proposes a simple formula to represent the local lateral deflection of stiffeners as well as the dent the residual ultimate strength of stiffened plate is found to have the largest reduction of 18 5 via the influence of the lateral deflection of the stiffener with respect to various plate thicknesses 3 the dent depth and dent size are two main parameters that have crucial influences on the ultimate strength for stiffened plates when the two considered factors are too small the dent damage will have little effect on the residual ultimate strength of the stiffened plate this paper proposes the reduction factor of the ultimate strength for stiffened plates with dent damage as functions of the relative dent depth and width both the local global dent deflection and lateral deformation of the stiffeners corresponding to the dents have been counted in the comparison of the proposed reduction factor with most of the finite element results reveals an error band within 5 4 it can be illustrated that the dent angle has a much greater influence on the ultimate strength of compressive stiffened plates when larger dent aspect ratios are adopted the relationship between the dent inclination and the residual ultimate strength of stiffened plates can be represented by a cosine function for a slender dent with the same inclined angle changing the plate thickness has slight effect on the ultimate strength of the panel under compressive load with a maximum difference of 5 it implies that the transverse width d w of the dent has much more significant influence on the residual ultimate strength of stiffened plates than the longitudinal length d l 5 compared to the longitudinal location of the dents the transverse position of the dent has a greater effect on the ultimate strength of the panel when the dent is closer to the unloaded edge the ultimate strength becomes smaller for dented stiffened plates credit author statement lei ao conceptualization data

21958,the residual ultimate strength of stiffened plates with dent damage under compressive load was investigated by using the commercial software abaqus the influences of some important factors such as the dent depth dent size and dent angle in association with the stiffened panel s ultimate limit state were discussed in detail assuming that the stiffener is always perpendicular to the involved plate elements in the dent producing process a simple formula is proposed to represent the lateral deflection of the stiffeners and the dent based on the numerical results the reduction factors of the compressive ultimate strength of stiffened plates are expressed as functions of the relative dent depth and dent length in addition the relationship between the residual ultimate strength of the stiffened plates and the dent inclination is also presented by a cosine function keywords stiffened plate dent damage ultimate strength longitudinal thrust nonlinear fem 1 introduction the plate and stiffened plate elements serve as the basic units of hull structure the local plate structures first have local buckling failure under the action of external loads next to the collapse failure of hull girders when the ship hull is subjected to vertical bending moment the deck and bottom plate structures are subjected to tensile and compressive loads the deck or bottom plate structures primarily exhibit buckling or yielding behaviors thus it is of important significance to analyze the ultimate bearing capacity of stiffened plate structure under compressive load for the safe design of ship structures the general service life of the ships after their construction averages more than 20 years during the operation process ships may experience adverse sea conditions some accidental events may occur in the actual operational cases such as grounding collision and cargo falling that will cause large plastic deflection of ship local plate elements in contrast to the cracking damage the produced dents do not destroy the component continuity of the hull structures compared to ship corrosion the dents also have no significant reduction effects on the plate thickness of the local damaged region of hull structures however the amplitude of plastic deformation related to local dents can be several times larger than that of the structural initial deflection caused by the welding fabrication in recent years many collision tests have been conducted on ship plate structures and the damage characteristics of local structures e g plates and stiffened plates subjected to collision impact have been analyzed paik et al paik and seo 2007 studied the fracture behavior of ship panels under impact or grounding load by experimental tests and numerical methods the progressive structural crashworthiness of ships and ship shaped offshore structures under collisions or grounding was analyzed by evaluating the accidental energy absorption capability of ship structures cho and lee 2009 conducted a series of lateral impact experiments for 33 stiffened plates to analyze the structural damage behavior of stiffened plate structures under grounding damage the test results illustrated that the depth of the dent generated by the stamping striker can be 10 times larger than the plate thickness yang and wang yang and wang 2016 yang et al 2018 studied the dynamic response and dynamic ultimate strength of stiffened plate under in plane impact loading and the influences of some parameters were discussed in detail liu and guedes soares liu and guedes soares 2019 have been conducted to studied the plastic dynamic response and failure of clamped struck rectangular steel plates by quasi static punching tests and low velocity impact tests a simplified method was proposed to evaluate the material strain rate effect at varied plastic strains in the simulations by summarizing results of these collision impact tests it can be found that the hull structure is easily involved in local large plastic deformation under the impacting of rigid objects when the punching energy exceeds the energy absorbing capability of plate structures the stiffened plate will be torn out and fracture behavior of local plate will occur otherwise the plate elements will undergo large plastic deformation and the stiffeners will undergo sharp lateral deflection during the lateral impacting process of the indenters dow and smith 1984 firstly studied the buckling and post buckling behavior of a slender rectangular plate with local initial deformation under uniaxial compression by numerical methods it was pointed out that the amplitude of local defects was one of the main parameters that affecting the plate collapse behavior harding and onoufriou 1995 carried out 9 experiments to analyze the axial compressive strength of stiffened cylindrical shell with dents and different dent sizes were considered in their experiment paik et al paik et al 2003 paik 2005 studied the effect of dent shape dent size depth diameter and dent position on the ultimate strength of simply supported plates under axial compression and shear loads by nonlinear finite element method they found that the dent moving towards the unloaded plate edge had the largest effect on the plate s ultimate strength with reduction of 20 compared to the central dent prabu et al 2007 investigated the influence of different dents on the buckling strength of steel cylindrical shells using the numerical method they found that when the dent length was small changing the size and inclination of the dents had little effect on the residual strength of cylinder specimens luís et al 2008 analyzed the ultimate strength of a simple plate with local dent damage under compressive loads guedes soares et al guedes soares et al 2008 illustrated that the effect of local defects mainly depends on the shape of the dent damage and the amplitude of the plastic deformation while the influence of dent location is related to the magnitude of the damaged area witkowska and guedes soares witkowska and guedes soares 2009a witkowska and guedes soares 2015 studied the effect of local damage of stiffeners on the ultimate strength of stiffened panels taking into account changes in significant parameters including the dent position dent size and number of dents it was found that local damage on the stiffeners changed the failure mode of the stiffened plate under compression the position and initial overall deformation of the dent are two main factors that decrease the residual strength of the stiffened plates raviprakash et al raviprakash et al 2011 raviprakash and prabualagumurthi 2012 selected various dent parameters including dent length dent depth and dent orientation to evaluate the residual ultimate strength of dented plates under uniaxial compressive load they indicated that the dent effect was in some degree magnified as the plate thickness increased lang and kwon 2012 studied the producing mechanism of the dent impacting on the aircraft plate using the finite element method the material property of aluminum alloy 2024 t3 was taken into account xu and guedes soares xu and guedes soares 2013 xu and guedes soares 2015 used quasi static loading process to analyze the generation of punching dents the relationship between dent depth and punching load was given li et al 2014 investigated the residual ultimate strength of 2024 t3 aluminum plate under the action of compressive load by the drop weight impacting tests ghazijahani et al 2014 analyzed the buckling and post buckling behavior of cylindrical shell structures with dent damage under the action of uniform external pressure and axial compressive load it was found that the buckling behavior of cylindrical shells first occurred near the dent damage the transverse dents perpendicular to the direction of the compressive load have much greater effect on the cylindrical shell than the vertical dents or inclined dents saad eldeen et al 2016a studied the effect of local dents on the ultimate strength of steel compressive plates they found that when the direction of dent deformation is opposite to that of the initial imperfection the influence of the dent on the ultimate strength of the plate was weakened saad eldeen et al 2015 used a box girder model simplified from a single hull oil tanker to analyze the effect of corrosion and dent damage on the vertical bending performance of ship hull structures by changing the dent position and depth they found that the dent had the greatest effect on the girder s ultimate strength when it was near the edge or center of the deck plate peroumal et al 2015 compared the effects of the overall geometric imperfection and that of local dent on the plate s buckling strength they indicated that the dent damage was more significant only when the thicker plate was applied li et al 2015 employed the axial tensile tests to analyze the fracture behavior of the 2024 t3 aluminum alloy plate with dent damage and found that the dented plate was more vulnerable to fracture failure than the intact one cerik 2015 proposed simplified empirical formula to predict the residual strength of orthogonally stiffened cylindrical shell subjected to axial compressive load based on the experimental and numerical simulation results saad eldeen et al 2016b investigated the relationship between ultimate strength and plate thickness for plates with different shapes of dents shapes they defined the toughness modulus to evaluate the material s ability to absorb energy and resist plastic deformation when a stiffened plate is subjected to a compressive load the influence of the stiffeners may lead to different buckling failure modes of the plate structures the local plate deformation in the dent area however will completely change the collapse failure mode of the stiffened plate elements and sharply reduce the compressive ultimate strength of the stiffened structures without breaking the integrality of hull structure moreover large deformation is not only introduced to the plate element during the dent producing process but also to the corresponding stiffener elements because of the deflection of local plate thus it is necessary to analyze the influence of the dents on the buckling behavior of compressive stiffened plates and evaluate the ultimate strength of damaged structure considering the lateral deformation of local stiffeners as a result this paper considers the influence of the main dent parameters including the dent depth d d dent size transverse width d w and longitudinal length d l and dent angle θ on the ultimate strength of stiffened plates under uniaxial compression load the lateral deflection of the stiffener webs caused by the local dent has been considered to analyze the post buckling behavior of the compressive stiffened panel based on the calculated numerical data simple equations are given to assess the residual ultimate strength of the plate structures as functions of the dent depth and dent size 2 finite element model of stiffened plate the stiffened plate considered in this paper is obtained from the central part of the deck structures of one ordinary vessel and the models of 1 2 1 1 2 bays in the longitudinal direction are adopted in the fe analyses as shown in fig 1 the dotted lines represent the position of transverse beams to simplify the calculation the transverse members are substituted by the corresponding boundary conditions and the dent is initially assumed to be located in the central region of the stiffened model wherein d w is the dent transverse width d l is the dent longitudinal length and s 1 and s 2 are the distance from the dent to the corresponding stiffened plate boundary the geometry dimensions applied in the stiffened plate model are as follows the main geometrical dimensions of plate panels are a longitudinal span b stiffener spacing and t plate thickness to vary the column slenderness ratio λ three different stiffener sizes are considered as shown in table 1 h w and t w are the web height and thickness for tee stiffeners h f and t f are the flange width and thickness zhang and khan 2009 performed a review on the structural designs of 12 contemporary double hull oil tankers and 10 bulk carriers with length between 150 m and 400 m the aspect ratio a b of plates in the midship region was found to be 3 5 to 6 7 for tanker decks and bottoms and 4 6 to 6 3 for bulk carrier decks and 3 0 to 4 5 for bulk carrier bottoms therefore the plate aspect ratio is changed from 3 3 to 10 with stiffener span from 300 mm to 900 mm in this paper the material is assumed to behave in an elastic perfectly plastic manner with a certain yield stress by many authors in the fem analysis that has been proven reasonable thus no material hardening effect is considered in this paper the high tensile strength steel has been widely applied in the ship construction process especially in warship structures thus the materials of the plates and stiffeners are taken as the same with yield stress of σ y 590 m p a the young s modulus is taken as e 206000 n m m 2 and poisson s ratio is taken as λ 0 3 the initial deformation imperfection of stiffened plates will be introduced by the fillet welding in the real ship structures this imperfection has significant influence on the ultimate strength behavior of stiffened panels including the ultimate strength values other initial imperfection such as the welding residual stress may also have some effects on the collapse behavior of plate structures however it is not considered in present study the shape of initial deflections are considered corresponding to the buckling modes of stiffened plates including the plate initial deflection column type initial distortions of stiffeners with attached plating and sideways initial distortions of independent stiffeners as following hughes and paik 2010 the plate initial deflection w o p 1 w o p δ o sin m π z a sin π x b m is the buckling half wave number in the longitudinal direction which is taken as a minimum integer corresponding to a b which must satisfy the following equation for plates under only longitudinal thrust 2 a b m m 1 column type initial deflection of stiffeners w o s 3 w o s 0 0015 a sin π z a sin π x b 0 where b 0 is the transverse span between longitudinal girders it is taken as b 0 7500 m m in this paper sideways initial deflection of independent stiffeners v o s 4 v o s 0 0015 a h w y sin π z a where h w is the stiffener s web height the maximum amplitude of local plate deflection δ o is taken as a function of the slenderness ratio β in an average level smith et al 1988 5 δ o 0 1 β o 2 t β is the plate slenderness ratio expressed as follows 6 β b t p σ y e the nonlinear finite element analysis is conducted by employing the commercial software abaqus 6 13 the nonlinear shell finite element s4r is used for modeling plate and stiffener elements as a general four nodes shell element including both reduced integral method and hourglass control mode which is suitable for large deformation analysis the newton raphson algorithm is applied as a method of incremental solution to trace the proper collapse and post buckling process in structural nonlinear analysis the finite element model is shown in fig 2 the displacement controlled method has been adopted for load applying with respect to the boundary conditions of stiffened plate under compression in the issc report 2012 issc 2012 this paper adopts the boundary conditions presented in table 2 the simplified boundary condition shown in table 2 has been widely used for 1 2 1 1 2 bay models zhang and khan 2009 issc 2012 tanaka et al 2014 xu et al 2013 ao et al 2019 the constant forced displacement has been applied at the nodes of edge a1 b1 and a2 b2 oppositely during the non linear fe analysis due to the opposite loading no rigid body motion will happen in the z direction actually edges a a1 and b b1 are elastically supported by stiffeners it is assumed to be simply supported in this paper the dof constraint is directly applied on edge nodes the element sizes of 15 30 50 mm are selected as comparison to determine the available mesh size to provide accurate results the difference ratio of ultimate stress is within 1 for these three sizes 364 2 mpa for 15 mm 365 4 mpa for 30 mm 368 0 mpa for 50 mm thus 17 mesh elements between stiffeners and 108 elements between transverse members is taken for the plate 7 mesh elements for the stiffener webs and 4 elements for the stiffener flanges in the cross section the general fine grid size is adopted as 28 mm for providing valid numerical results the ultimate strength of intact stiffened plate obtained by the fe method is compared with that by the empirical methods zhang and khan 2009 as shown in table 3 the stiffener type t2 is applied the max error is 1 54 indicating that the value of the ultimate strength obtained by the fe approach in this paper is valid the ultimate strength obtained by the fe approach used in this paper is also compared with the result by the stiffened panel test xu and guedes soares 2012 the size of the test model is a b 300 150 m m for the plate and 30 8 m m for the stiffener the yield stress is 469 mpa the collapse failure mode 2 b in the transverse direction is shown as following it can be seen from fig 3 that the failure mode obtained by the finite element method used in this paper is exactly the same compared to the experimental result meanwhile the stiffness of the load displacement curve in fe analysis changes similarly compared to that of the experimental curves during the loading process shown in fig 4 the ultimate stress obtained by the fe approach for the test model with the same boundary condition applied in this paper is 385 6 mpa with 0 3 error compared to the test result of 386 8 mpa 3 plate dent damage in numerical analysis the dent damage can be introduced to the intact plates in two forms most of the previous research investigated the influence of a dent by changing the positions of the element nodes with simple equations of dent shape alternatively the dent was simulated by the indenter crushing through the quasi static method according to the previous summary of the dent shape paik et al paik et al 2003 paik 2005 prabu et al 2007 raviprakash et al 2012 this paper considers three types of dent shapes for comparison as the conical dent the exponential dent and the sine dent the cross sections of these three types of dent shapes are shown in fig 5 it can be seen from fig 5 that when the dent depth d d longitudinal length d l and transverse width d w are the same the conical dent and sine dent have the same sectional area in contrast the section area of the exponential dent is relatively smaller the non dimensional coefficient η d is proposed to describe the difference of dent plastic deformations corresponding to different dent shapes expressed as η d v d d d a d e n t v d is the volume of the dent deformation a d e n t is the dent projected area to the plate it implied that the exponential dent had the least plastic deformation with same dent dimensions η d 0 11 for exponential dent η d 0 32 for conical and sine dent conical dent 7 w d d d 1 z 0 5 d l 1 x 0 5 d w 0 5 d w x 0 5 d w 0 5 d l z 0 5 d l exponential dent 8 w d d d e 6 z d l 2 e 6 x d w 2 0 5 d w x 0 5 d w 0 5 d l z 0 5 d l sine dent 9 w d d d sin 2 π z 0 5 d l d l sin 2 π x 0 5 d w d w 0 5 d w x 0 5 d w 0 5 d l z 0 5 d l in the above equations w d is the dent plastic deformation in y direction d d is the dent depth d l is the longitudinal length and d w is the transverse width of dent fig 6 shows the comparison of the influence of different dents on the ultimate strength of the stiffened plate with respect to different dent depths the obtained results indicate that the sine dent has the most significant reduction on the ultimate strength of stiffened plate this observation is reasonable because the deflection volume of the exponential dent η d is smaller than that of the other two types of dents with the same shape parameters as a result we adopted the sine dent as the local dent shape for the subsequent dent parameter studies with conservative evaluation of the ultimate strength when a local damage is produced by the fall and strike of an object the residual plastic deformation of the plate structure will be modified by the shape of the indenter xu and guedes soares xu and guedes soares 2013 suggested that the residual plastic deformation of the plates to be separated in two parts namely local dent deflection and global dent deflection in this paper we followed their studies and assumed the amplitude of the global deflection of the dent was equal to that of the local deflection in this case the form of the dent can be expressed as follows the local dent deflection w d l 10 w d l d d 2 sin 2 π x d w sin 2 π z d l 0 5 d w x 0 5 d w 0 5 d l z 0 5 d l the global dent deflection w d g 11 w d g d d 2 sin π z a sin π x b 0 the whole dent is obtained by 12 w d w d l w d g fig 7 shows the von mises stress distribution of the compressive stiffened plate at the ultimate state it is observed that the stress distribution pattern of compressed stiffened plate with dent damage is quite different from that of the stiffened plate without the dent because of the presence of the dent the collapse failure zone of stiffened plate in the ultimate state is concentrated at the dent position instead of being distributed over the whole panel in the buckling process of the compressive stiffened plate the maximum stress of the plate structures first appears at the joint of the dent and the stiffened web and then expands to the local panel connected with the dent as the external load gradually grows the stress and displacement curves of typical positions were given as comparison for stiffened plates with and without dents fig 8 shows the positions of these picked nodes it can be seen from fig 9 that the stiffener plate attached node b in the central place has the largest mises equivalent stress for stiffened plate with dent damage the von mises stress distribution along the line 1 is quite different from that along line 2 for dented stiffened plates during the collapse process however the stress distribution is almost the same in line 1 and line 2 for stiffened plates without dents in addition the largest stress first appears in plate node c for no dent models in the buckling process from fig 10 we can see that the vertical displacements of nodes located in line 1 are obviously larger than that in line 2 for dented stiffened plates while it changes little of node displacements in line 1 compared to line 2 in the elastic stage for intact stiffened plates in the pre buckling stage the plate has slight displacement tracking the initial deflection as a result the vertical displacement initially approaches to negative value at node c1 however the stiffened plate will have collapse failure after reaching the ultimate state the node near the collapse region will have large vertical displacement then the vertical displacement of node c1 changes to positive value 4 lateral deformation of stiffeners caused by dents test results illustrated that the impact of wedge shape indenters not only produces dent deflection at the local stiffened plate but also causes obvious lateral deformation to the stiffener webs in the crushed region cho and lee 2009 liu et al 2015a 2015b as the stiffeners can remarkably enhance the ability of stiffened plate to resist external load and significantly change the collapse failure mode of plate structures it is necessary to consider the lateral deformation of local stiffeners generated by the dents in analyzing the ultimate strength of dent stiffened plates witkowska and guedes soares witkowska and guedes soares 2009b used fe tools to analyze the buckling behavior and ultimate strength of stiffened plates considering the influence of the welding residual deflection and local damage on the stiffeners the local damage of stiffeners can be expressed by the following formula 13 w l w l 0 sin 2 π z l w sin 2 π y 2 h w where w l 0 is the damage amplitude lateral depth l w is the length of local damage and h w is the web height of stiffeners the stiffener warping due to the global dent deflection is much smaller than that of local dent deflection in this regard stiffener global deflection due to denting is superposed by the column type deflection of stiffeners substituting eq 10 into eq 13 this paper gives the expression for the local lateral deformation of the stiffeners corresponding to the local dent deflection w d l as follows 14 w s t f f w s sin 2 π z d l sin 2 π y d d 2 sin 2 π x 1 d l sin 2 π z d w 2 h w where w s is the amplitude of stiffener lateral deformation and x 1 is the transverse coordinate of the stiffener fig 11 shows a schematic diagram of the stiffened plate considering both the local plate deformation and the stiffener lateral deformation caused by dents assuming that the stiffener is still vertical to the local plate in the process of large plastic deformation the amplitude of lateral deflection of the stiffeners w s will be linearly related to the height of the dent deflection h s at the coordinate of stiffeners expressed as w s h s h w d p fig 12 shows that the value of the residual ultimate strength of the stiffened plate is decreasing as the amplitude of lateral deflection of the stiffeners caused by dents increases in this part the dent depth is taken as d d 84 m m and the dent size is taken as d l d w 1500 m m therefore h s is taken as h s 63 m m the amplitude of lateral deflection of the local stiffener is changed in the range of w s 0 12 5 25 37 5 50 62 5 and 75 mm compared to the influence of the panel deflection caused by the dents on the ultimate strength of stiffened plates the effect of lateral deflection of the stiffeners is relatively small with the greatest decrease of 6 9 the collapse failure mode of the stiffened panel will be very different with respect to different plate thicknesses under the action of compressive load when the stiffeners are the same considering this the effect of the local deflection of the stiffeners on the buckling behavior and ultimate strength may be different for stiffened plates with various plate thicknesses fig 13 shows the difference ratio of ultimate strength for the stiffened plates with three types of the local stiffener damage w s 25 50 75 mm it can be seen from fig 13 that the influence of the lateral deflection of the stiffener on ultimate strength of the panels is significantly improved when the thickness of stiffened plate is too large or small due to the change of the plate thickness the error band of residual ultimate strength of the whole stiffened plate caused by the lateral deflection of the stiffener can be up to 18 5 fig 14 presents the deformation distribution of dent stiffened plates at the ultimate limit state under compressive loads it can be seen that the dominant plastic deformation in the collapse process of stiffened plates transfers from the local plate elements to the damaged stiffeners when considering large local stiffener deflection 5 results of the finite element analysis in contrast to cracking the area of the net section of stiffened plate is not changed due to dent damage in case that the ship plate is not ruptured thus the residual ultimate strength of damaged stiffened plate cannot be easily obtained by using the net section theory moreover the presence of the dent will not cause the reduction of the plate thickness in the locally damaged region compared to the corrosion effect in fact the production process of the dent is not only coupled with large deformation of local structures but also has residual stress existing in the striking area xu and guedes soares xu and guedes soares 2015 employed the quasi static method to simulate the indenter punching process and found that the introduced residual stress caused by dents has little influence on the ultimate strength of stiffened plate with mean error of approximately 2 furthermore the residual stress caused by dents may be both the tensile stress as well as compressive stress in case of the former the bearing capacity of the stiffened plate to resist the compressive load is increased otherwise the compressive strength of the stiffened panel is decreased therefore this paper does not consider the influence of residual stress in the producing process of the dents as well as that caused by the welding procedure the dents were created by changing the coordinate value of the corresponding nodes using different forms of dent shape function 5 1 influence of initial deflection in order to investigate the effects of initial distortion on the ultimate strength of dented stiffened plates the amplitude of the initial geometric imperfection was assumed to change equally with an increment coefficient n in the form of n 0 01 β 2 t smith et al 1988 pointed out that the amplitude of severe initial deflection 0 03 β 2 t could be three times of average initial deflection 0 01 β 2 t therefore the constant coefficient n is taken as 0 5 1 1 5 2 three types of initial deflection shapes have been considered as discussed before in section 2 eqs 1 4 table 4 shows the average ultimate stress of dented plates for different cases the plate thickness was taken as t 14 mm and dl dw it can be seen that the severe initial deflection has greatly reduced the ultimate strength of stiffened plates of no dent however the average ultimate stress of stiffened plate with larger dent changes little as the initial deflection amplitude increases therefore we only considered one amplitude of the initial distortion for the dented stiffened plates taken as δ 0 0 01 β 2 t 5 2 influence of dent size and depth the dominant parameters of dent damage include the vertical projection size of the dent and the dent depth cho and lee 2009 analyzed the damage extent of a stiffened plate by using the lateral impact experimental method their test results found that for the stiffened plate the maximum amplitude of the local plastic deformation caused by collision can be up to 22 77 times the plate thickness t p to facilitate the analysis firstly the longitudinal length d l and transverse width d w of the dent are assumed to be the same taken as d l d w 500 1000 and 1500 mm the dent depth d d is taken as d d 28 56 84 112 140 mm when different plate thicknesses are applied the failure modes of the stiffened panel under compressive load will change the thickness of the stiffened plate is chosen in the range of t p 10 14 18 and 22 mm three stiffener sizes are considered namely as t1 t2 t3 given in table 1 the lateral plastic deformation of the local stiffeners has been considered and the amplitude of the lateral deformation is determined by w s h s h w d p figs 15 17 shows the influence of dent size and depth on the residual ultimate strength of stiffened plate with respect to different plate thicknesses it is observed from the results that both the dent size and dent depth have great effect on the ultimate strength of the stiffened plate when the dent length and depth reach the value dd 140 mm and dl dw 1500 mm the residual ultimate stress of the stiffened plate is significantly reduced to 234 6 mpa 285 2 mpa 297 3 mpa for t1 t2 t3 it is about 61 2 64 8 65 1 the value of that without dents the dent size and the dent depth should be considered together for the assessment of the residual ultimate strength of dented stiffened structures in this section both local and global dent deflections as expressed in eqs 10 12 are considered thus the size of the local dent deflection has less effect than the dent depth on the residual ultimate strength of the stiffened plate anyway the dent depth plays much more important role if the dent depth is much too small for example d d t 14 m m d l d w 1500 m m the residual ultimate stress is 411 9 mpa the difference ratio is only 3 compared to that without dent when the plate aspect ratio a b decreases the influence of dent damage on the ultimate strength of stiffened plate will be smaller the residual ultimate strength σ u σ u 0 is 0 63 0 65 0 66 0 70 for a b 10 6 4 3 3 3 with the dent d w d l 3 b and d d 140 m m therefore the variables related to plate aspect ratio and stiffener sizes are included the reduction factor r u is proposed to evaluate the residual ultimate strength for dented stiffened plates as a function of dent depth and width using the matlab tools 15 r u σ u σ u 0 5 874 d d 1000 2 d 1 d d 1000 0 995 16 d 1 0 0637 d w b 2 0 498 d w b 0 131 0 788 b a d 2 17 d 2 2 235 i s a s 2 2 7 053 i s a s 2 7 792 where σ u is the ultimate strength of dented stiffened plate with dent damage σ u 0 is the ultimate strength of stiffened plate without dent damage i s and a s are the geometrical moment of inertia and sectional area of one stiffener in order to verify the validity of the proposed formulae more fe results were obtained by changing the stiffener span b to 300 mm and 900 mm the stiffened plate of a bulk carrier with a b 2550 850 m m was also considered plate thickness changing from 11 mm to 22 mm issc 2012 the stiffener size was taken as t 4 235 10 90 15 m m in additional flat type of stiffener f1 with size of 260 2 12 4 mm was also considered table 5 shows the details of the accessorial results in appendix a the total number of fe results is 330 compared to 330 obtained results shown in fig 18 and fig 19 the proposed formula is clarified to be effective with 85 7 of results within 5 error band and all in 10 error band the average value is 1 01 and the coefficient of variation cov is 3 1 the residual ultimate strength of dented stiffened plate can be calculated by using eq 15 it should be noticed that both the local global dent deflection and lateral deformation of the stiffeners has been considered in the finite element analysis as a result the predicted result by eq 15 will be smaller than that without considering the lateral deformation of the stiffeners the plate slenderness ratios of considered stiffened plates are changing from 1 146 to 4 81 therefore the proposed formula is only available for stiffened plates with plate slenderness ratio β in the range of 1 5 the proposed formula was also validated with 119 results of xu and guedes soares s research xu and guedes soares 2013 xu and guedes soares 2015 their model is described as following fb2a2 flat bar fb2a2 frame spacing a 2 200 mm 3 300 mm 4 400 mm etc fb2a2 a two stiffeners in the transverse direction b four stiffeners in the transverse direction fb2a2 2 two spans in the longitudinal direction 1 2 1 1 2 3 three spans in the longitudinal direction the yield stress is 483 mpa the plate thickness is 4 mm with flat stiffener f 2 30 8 m m the results of references are shown in table 6 in their papers the dents were introduced directly by simulating the process of the indenters impacting on the plates as a result the dent size with same dent depth could be quite different for models with various frame spacing a the compared results are shown in fig 20 and fig 21 the max error is 9 4 all the compared results are within 10 error band and 84 8 of the results are within 5 the average value of reference formula is 1 01 and the coefficient of variation cov is 3 2 which indicates the formula valid 5 3 change as dent angle to simplify the fe analysis it is assumed that longitudinal length d l is equal to the transverse width d w when analyzing the influence of dent parameters on the ultimate strength of the stiffened plate in this case the vertical projection shape of the dent to the plate is a square shape round square dent however the longitudinal and transverse dimension of the dent produced in collision or grounding accident may not be the same in this case the dent will be a slender one when the dent rotates to a certain angle along vertical axis the collapse failure mode of the stiffened panel may be quite different in contrast to that with the round square dents therefore it is necessary to evaluate the effects of the dent angle on the ultimate strength and the post buckling behavior of compressive stiffened plate for the dent with different aspect ratio d w d l in order to analyze the influence of the dent angles on the ultimate strength of stiffened plates only local dent deformation w d l was considered in this section the dent aspect ratio d w d l changes as 250 1500 750 1500 and 1250 1500 the dent angle θ is defined between the long edge of the dent and the longitudinal direction of the stiffened plate as shown in fig 1 and taken in the range of 0 15 30 45 60 75 and 90 fig 22 shows that the relationship between the residual ultimate strength of the stiffened plate and the dent angle can be expressed by a cosine function as the aspect ratio of the dent increases the influence of the dent angle on the residual ultimate strength becomes much more obvious when the dent angle is zero the dent direction is the same as that of the compressive load such a dent is called a vertical dent the vertical dent has the minimum influence on the ultimate strength of the stiffened plate when the short edge is small enough for the vertical dent the dent slightly increased the ability of the stiffened plate to resist compression deflection at the dent angle setting of θ 90 the dent direction is perpendicular to the load direction such a dent is called a transverse dent in this case the equivalent length of the dent vertical to the external load reaches the peak value and the ultimate strength of stiffened plate reduces to the minimum value due to the variation in the dent angle the difference can be as large as 62 5 fig 23 shows the influence of the dent angle on the ultimate strength of the stiffened plate corresponding to different plate thicknesses it can be observed that the ultimate stress of the compressive stiffened plate can still be expressed as trigonometric function of the dent angle despite the change in plate thickness when different plate thicknesses are adopted the residual ultimate strength of stiffened plate does not change significantly with max error less than 5 thus the effect of dent inclination on the ultimate strength of the stiffened plate is mainly determined by the aspect ratio d w d l of the dent the dent depth d d and the dent angle θ rather than the plate thickness fig 24 shows the mises stress distribution of the dent stiffened plate with various dent angles at the ultimate limit state it can be seen that the dent has greatly changed the stress distribution of stiffened structures compared to the intact panel the local collapse failure mode caused by the dent becomes much more obvious with the increase in the dent angle based on the above fe results the residual factor r u is given to present the relationship between the residual ultimate strength of the stiffened plate and the dent angle as below 18 r u σ u σ u 0 a 1 c o s 2 θ c 1 where σ u 0 is the ultimate strength of intact stiffened plate the coefficients a 1 and c 1 are functions related to the dent aspect ratio and the depth expressed by the following formula 19 a 1 c 1 f d w d l d d when the dent depth is chosen as a constant value for example d d 140 mm the coefficients a 1 and c 1 can be respectively established as functions of dent aspect ratio d w d l using the least square method the coefficients are confirmed as when θ 45 20 a 1 0 4056 d w d l 2 0 3933 21 c 1 0 1314 d w d l 2 0 2412 d w d l 0

as discussed in the previous section the effect of the dent angle on the ultimate strength of stiffened plate becomes much larger when the aspect ratio d w d l decreases the ultimate stress σ u σ u 0 reduced from 1 to 0 38 for d w d l 250 1500 and from 0 69 to 0 59 for d w d l 1250 1500 however when the dent is perpendicular or parallel to the external load orientation transverse dent or longitudinal dent the effects of the dent on the ultimate strength of the stiffened plate may be different by changing the aspect ratios of the dents fig 25 shows the stress strain curve of the stiffened plate under the action of compression with longitudinal and transverse dent corresponding to different dent aspect ratios d w d l it can be seen that the residual ultimate strength of the stiffened plates becomes smaller when the aspect ratio increases this phenomenon occurs because the dent projecting length vertical to the load orientation increases when the dent aspect ratio increases however for the transverse dent cases when the dent aspect ratio increases the dent becomes slenderer as a result the local plate buckling effects caused by the dents will be more obvious leading to the smaller value of the ultimate strength of the stiffened plate fig 26 presents the average stress strain curves of stiffened plates corresponding to different dent lengths d l when the dent width d w is adopted as a small one for example d w 0 5 b σ u o is the average ultimate stress for intact stiffened plate it can be seen from fig 26 that the value of the longitudinal length d l has little influence on the residual strength of the stiffened structures with a maximum error of 2 when the transverse width d w is small in this case the ultimate compressive stress of stiffened plate is roughly the same compared to that of the intact stiffened plates implying that the effect the dent presents on stiffened plate is negligible thus the effect of the primary dent size on the ultimate strength of the stiffened plate mainly depends on the dent projecting length which is perpendicular with the compressive load direction in case that the equivalent projecting length is too small the dent will have no effect on the ultimate bearing capacity of the stiffened plate fig 27 show the mises stress distributions of stiffened plates at the ultimate limit state corresponding to different longitudinal lengths and transverse widths of the dents it can be seen that the area of failure region of the stiffened plate increases gradually when the longitudinal length d l becomes larger implying that reducing effect caused by the dent damage is decreasing in contrast fig 28 shows that the stress distribution of the stiffened plate at the ultimate state when the transverse width d w is tiny the stress distribution of stiffened plates in the collapsed state is similar that of the intact stiffened plates it indicates that the transverse width of the dent is much more significant than the longitudinal length 5 4 influence of the dent position during the operation of the real ship the local dent damage is produced randomly the dent is not always located at the central span of stiffened panel the buckling failure modes of the stiffened plate may be different depending on the dent location as a result this paper considered the effect of the dent position on the ultimate strength of the stiffened plate by changing the dent location in the longitudinal direction s 1 and the transverse direction s 2 figs 29 30 present the average stress strain curves of the stiffened plate under the compressive stress with respect to different dent distances moving in the longitudinal and transverse orientation respectively it shows in fig 29 that the dent longitudinal position has little influence on the ultimate strength of the stiffened plate with the error of 2 1 thus the displacement of the dent in the longitudinal direction has insignificant effect on the residual strength of stiffened plate in case that the dent moving in the transverse direction of the stiffened panel the stiffened panel will steps into the post buckling state earlier and the residual ultimate stress of stiffened plate becomes smaller when the dent is closer to the unloaded edge with the change in the horizontal position of the dent the ultimate compressive stress has the reduction of 7 1 6 conclusions casual accidents such as grounding collision and object falling that occur during the ship operation period would introduce dent damage to the local plate elements of the hull structures compared to the welding induced deflection during the ship construction process the amplitude of the dent plastic deflection will be significantly much larger this paper employed the nonlinear finite element method to analyze the influence of dent damage on the ultimate strength of a stiffened plate the dominating dent parameters considered include dent depth dent size dent angle and plate thickness considering that the plate large deformation induced by dents is always coupled with lateral deflection of related stiffeners this paper proposed a simple equation to simulate the local damage of stiffeners caused by dents and analyzed the influence of lateral deflection of the stiffeners on residual ultimate strength of stiffened plate based on the finite element results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the comparative analysis regarding the dent shape of exponential conical and sine shape illustrates that the influence of dent shape on the ultimate strength of a stiffened plate is determined mainly by the volume of dent plastic deformation the non dimensional coefficient η d was proposed when the related coefficient η d is larger the dent will more significantly reduce the ultimate strength of stiffened plates 2 assuming that the stiffener is still vertical to the local plate in the process of large plastic deformation this paper proposes a simple formula to represent the local lateral deflection of stiffeners as well as the dent the residual ultimate strength of stiffened plate is found to have the largest reduction of 18 5 via the influence of the lateral deflection of the stiffener with respect to various plate thicknesses 3 the dent depth and dent size are two main parameters that have crucial influences on the ultimate strength for stiffened plates when the two considered factors are too small the dent damage will have little effect on the residual ultimate strength of the stiffened plate this paper proposes the reduction factor of the ultimate strength for stiffened plates with dent damage as functions of the relative dent depth and width both the local global dent deflection and lateral deformation of the stiffeners corresponding to the dents have been counted in the comparison of the proposed reduction factor with most of the finite element results reveals an error band within 5 4 it can be illustrated that the dent angle has a much greater influence on the ultimate strength of compressive stiffened plates when larger dent aspect ratios are adopted the relationship between the dent inclination and the residual ultimate strength of stiffened plates can be represented by a cosine function for a slender dent with the same inclined angle changing the plate thickness has slight effect on the ultimate strength of the panel under compressive load with a maximum difference of 5 it implies that the transverse width d w of the dent has much more significant influence on the residual ultimate strength of stiffened plates than the longitudinal length d l 5 compared to the longitudinal location of the dents the transverse position of the dent has a greater effect on the ultimate strength of the panel when the dent is closer to the unloaded edge the ultimate strength becomes smaller for dented stiffened plates credit author statement lei ao conceptualization data

21959,the model test is important in the design and analysis of floating offshore wind turbines however the rotor thrust generated by the scaled model blades will be far less than the froude scaled value in the wave basin test which has a significant effect on motion responses of floating offshore wind turbines thus in order to improve the reliability of model tests it is essential to simulate the rotor thrust accurately based on the aerodynamic similarity in the present study four parametric models were developed to define the geometry of model blades and they were integrated separately into the optimization model to reach the design criteria considering the weight control the model blade defined by high order design method was tested it was demonstrated that the deviation between the experimental and numerical model blades under the rated condition was very small only 3 16 under the same condition the model blade with aerodynamic similarity could improve the rotor thrust by 106 33 compared with the froude scaled model blade simultaneously high order redesign method can significantly reduce the blade weight thus the high order redesign method is considered to be an effective way to eliminate the scale effect in the model tests of floating offshore wind turbines keywords floating offshore wind turbine model test model blade with aerodynamic similarity scale effect 1 introduction wind energy is taking an increasingly important role among the renewable and clean energy sources because of its cleanliness and large potential amount it is predicted that the wind energy will contribute to 5 of the worldwide energy consumption by 2020 herbert et al 2007 in addition to the north america and some european countries asian countries like china also made a great effort to develop wind energy related technique leung and yang 2012 in china the wind energy has attracted more attention zhao et al 2016 which is highly encouraged by the government we re glad to see that a great deal of incentive policies have been made to promote its development xia and song 2009 floating offshore wind turbines have been undergoing rapid development during recent decades this is because the offshore wind has several advantages including its abundant reserves and consistency less visual impact or noise and the variability on market price breton and moe 2009 ederer 2015 zhou et al 2017 kausche et al 2018 it is predicted that in 2050 nearly 5 5 of the worldwide electricity will be generated by the offshore wind esteban and leary 2012 nowadays in many european countries such as denmark germany uk the offshore wind energy has already been one of the important energy resources jensen et al 2018 onea and rusu 2018 salvador et al 2018 model tests of floating offshore wind turbines can simulate the working features and dynamic response of the prototype by choosing a reasonable scale the experimental data is also a good evidence to verify the accuracy of numerical calculations to date there are some well known model tests for floating wind systems such as wind float test conducted in the uc berkeley s ship model testing facility roddier et al 2010 deepcwind test conducted in the marin s offshore basin coulling et al 2013 and so on similarity theory is commonly employed in the model tests to correctly reveal the motion characteristics of the prototype in a wave basin with limited space yang et al 2008 in practice the froude and reynolds scaling laws are typically adopted in the wave basin tests and wind tunnel tests respectively çengel and cimbala 2013 newman 1977 but it is mathematically impossible to guarantee that the model tests of floating offshore wind turbines could satisfy the froude and reynolds scaling laws simultaneously thus the froude scaling laws are adopted by many of the floating wind turbine tests to ensure that wave forces and inertial effects could be accurately scaled martin 2011 however it should be noted that by ignoring the reynolds scaling law for the wind system the aerodynamic performance between the model and prototype shows a great discrepancy that is reynolds scale effect it is mainly due to the different order of reynolds number for floaters and wind turbines when the froude scaling law is enforced and owing to the reynolds scale effect the rotor thrust and torque generated by scaled model blade is much less than the desired values aerodynamic similarity between these two systems should be satisfied in the model tests to eliminate the reynolds scale effect as for wind turbines aerodynamic characteristics mainly include rotor thrust and torque at the same time the rotor thrust is considered critical as it directly affects the response and global motions of the floating model martin 2011 thus aerodynamic thrust similarity can be used instead of aerodynamic similarity several methods have been employed to achieve aerodynamic thrust similarity in the floating offshore wind turbine model tests these methods can be mainly divided into four categories by enhancing the wind speed using actuator discs increasing the blade roughness and redesigning model blades to enhance the wind speed is widely adopted in the deepcwind test coulling et al 2013 martin et al 2012 the hybrid model test hall and goupee 2018 and the spar type floating wind turbine model test duan et al 2016 however it does not meet the requirements of kinematic similarity which means that the tip speed ratio tsr of two systems is inconsistent moreover it may exert an undesirable drag on the tower and nacelle to place the actuator discs on the model is another common method used in the windfloat test roddier et al 2010 the spar torus combination model test wan et al 2015 and the model test conducted in harbin institute of technology zhou et al 2017 it needs many discs of different sizes for various conditions and generally simulates poor aerodynamic properties such as gyroscopic effect to increase the blade roughness is a method to change the process of original transitions from laminar to turbulent boundary layer flow in the deepcwind test martin et al 2012 nevertheless this method yields some erratic aerodynamic performances besides the major methods listed above an electric ducted fan with software in the loop sil was employed in the model test carried out in the kelvin hydrodynamics laboratory at the university of strathclyde oguz et al 2018 this new method is still in the exploration stage and has not been widely used and it also ignores the aerodynamics of other components hence methods to eliminate the reynolds scale effect discussed above more or less have some disadvantages in designing model test for floating offshore wind turbines to redesign model blades is a method to match model blades with the prototype based on the aerodynamic similarity by optimizing the blade geometrical profiles at the same time it is also important to minimize the weight of the model blade which is helpful to solve the severe overweight problem of the model rotor nacelle assembly rna system in designing the scaled wind turbine model martin 2011 thus minimizing the weight of model blade also should be included in this method redesign methods for wind turbine blades was widely employed in the model tests conducted in shanghai jiao tong university du et al 2016 zhao et al 2012 chen et al 2018 the university of maine fowler et al 2013 politecnico di milano bayati et al 2017 university of stuttgart borisade et al 2018 and osaka prefecture university nihei and fujioka 2010 it should be noted that there are more than one optimization model that could meet experimental requirements however it is not clear how different optimization methods affect the results especially the blade weight simultaneously there are few publications on the introduction and comparative analysis of redesign methods thus it is of great significance to systematically state and compare the redesign methods of floating offshore wind turbine model blades in the present study the redesigning method for the wind turbine blade in model test is discussed in details it mainly contains parametric blade shape models of different order a comprehensive model with optimization requirements and the rotor thrust calculation the parametric blade shape models are developed to characterize the curve of blades shape and an optimization model is built to redesign the blades under the rated condition by the software aerodyn by considering several design requirements comprehensively four types of model blades with aerodynamic similarity were obtained by different methods regarding the light weight as the first priority the blade obtained by the high order method was finally selected and manufactured using the carbon fiber it was further tested to analyze the rotor thrust with the original scaled model blade the structure of this paper is as follow in section 2 the redesign methods for wind turbine blades based on the aerodynamic similarity and the experiment set up for model blades are introduced in section 3 the numerical and experimental results are presented and analyzed finally the main conclusions of this paper are drawn in section 4 2 methodology 2 1 wind turbine and blade model as the study is about eliminating the scale effect by unmatched reynolds number in the model tests of floating offshore wind turbines it is necessary to first define the basic parameters of the prototype and model wind turbines shown in table 1 in this paper a 6 mw floating offshore wind turbine was introduced the geometric scaling factor for the model was 1 65 3th and scaling factors of different physical quantities were determined based on the similarity theory in the following study under the rated condition these basic parameters of the model wind turbine will remain the same 2 2 parametric model of blades in order to ensure the continuity of the chord length and twist angle distributions of the blade during the optimization to parameterize them with polynomials is widely adopted which is the first step of the redesign method in this paper there are four models with different orders of polynomials consisting of parametric models with eight four two and single parameter s among them the parameterization with eight and four parameters are considered as high order methods 2 2 1 eight parameter model fourth order and second order polynomials are assumed to fit the chord length and twist angle distributions respectively to ensure the continuity requirements based on the previous work of our team du et al 2016 the chord length and twist angle distributions of the original scaled model blade is also fitted and compared with the optimized ones the polynomials for the chord length and twist angle are assumed as follow 1 c a 01 x 4 a 11 x 3 a 21 x 2 a 31 x a 41 θ b 01 x 2 b 11 x b 21 where a 01 a 11 a 21 a 31 a 41 b 01 b 11 b 21 are the optimization parameters x is the relative position of the blade element on the blade c and θ are functions of the chord length and twist angle 2 2 2 four parameter model bessel curve is a basic tool for computer graphics and is commonly used in industrial fields bartels et al 1987 in this model the third order bessel curve was used to define the distribution of chord length and twist angle the shape of bessel curve is determined by the control points bézier 1972 forrest 1972 the formula is 2 b t p 0 1 t 3 3 p 1 t 1 t 2 3 p 2 t 2 1 t p 3 t 3 t 0 1 eight control points were arranged to define the model blade the positions of initial points were assumed to be at the root 37 of the total length 72 of the total length and tip of the model blade according to the above equation and the original scaled model blade shape the coordinates of initial control points were determined it should be noted that this model could differ from the geometries of the original scaled model blade transverse coordinates of control points remained unchanged along the model blade while the vertical coordinates of two middle control points were adjusted to adapt to the change of the curve shape thus there are four optimization variables y a 1 y a 2 y b 1 y b 2 which are the vertical coordinates of p a 1 p a 2 p b 1 p b 2 the parameterized formulas of the chord length and twist angle are 3 x c t x a 0 1 t 3 3 x a 1 t 1 t 2 3 x a 2 t 2 1 t x a 3 t 3 c t y a 0 1 t 3 3 y a 1 t 1 t 2 3 y a 2 t 2 1 t y a 3 t 3 4 x θ t x b 0 1 t 3 3 x b 1 t 1 t 2 3 x b 2 t 2 1 t x b 3 t 3 θ t y b 0 1 t 3 3 y b 1 t 1 t 2 3 y b 2 t 2 1 t y b 3 t 3 2 2 3 two parameter model geometric similarity of model blades mainly takes chord length and twist angle into consideration however in the parametric models with eight and four parameters the geometric similarity was not achieved in order to satisfy such requirements the present study further develops the parametric model into the two parameter one in this model the 4th order polynomial chosen for the chord length is consistent with that of the eight parameter model to further improve the geometric similarity the chord length was scaled up by a scaling factor α as for the twist angle the change of the model blade is assumed to be linear thus the change of twist angle was based on the scaled model blade it was constant in root and increased by β on the tip while the other positions were linearly increased the parameterized formulas of the chord length and twist angle are 5 c α a 00 x 4 a 10 x 3 a 20 x 2 a 30 x a 40 θ b 00 x 2 b 10 x b 20 β x 1 19 where the parameters α β are the variables to be optimized 2 2 4 single parameter model in this method twist angles remain constant during the optimization process in order to better satisfy the requirements of geometric similarity than the two parameter model the curve proposed to fit the chord length was consistent with that of the two parameter model which is still with a scaling factor α the parameterized formulas of chord length and twist angle are 6 c x α a 00 x 4 a 10 x 3 a 20 x 2 a 30 x a 40 θ x b 00 x 2 b 10 x b 20 2 3 bem and rotor thrust the blade element momentum bem theory is employed to calculate the rotor thrust which actually originates from two theories the blade element theory and the momentum theory leishman 2006 regarding the wide application of these theories to calculate rotor thrust hansen et al 2006 this paper directly employs a commonly used software aerodyn to achieve the rotor thrust calculation it is a software to simulate the aerodynamic performance of horizontal axis wind turbines released by the national renewable energy laboratory nrel moriarty and hansen 2005 to calculate the rotor thrust it will ask for the files of environmental conditions wind turbine parameters and lift and drag coefficients before the calculation the airfoil of the blade needs to be defined the poor aerodynamic performance of the airfoils at low reynolds number which causes the mismatch of the aerodynamic loadings could be highly improved by selecting naca4412 in model test it is the only type of airfoil used all through the present study according to the momentum theory the encounter velocity of airfoil is defined as 7 v r e l 1 a v 1 2 1 a ω r 2 where a and a are axial and tangential induction factors respectively ω is the rotational speed and r is the radius of the airfoil section and v 1 is incoming free stream velocity the local flow angle and the local angle of attack are equivalent to 8 ϕ a r c t a n 1 a v 1 1 a ω r 9 α b e m ϕ θ where θ is twist angle of airfoil section the rotor thrust is defined as 10 f 0 r 1 2 z ρ c v r e l 2 c n d r where z is number of blades c is chord length of the airfoil section ρ is air density r is radius of the rotor and c n is defined by lift and drag coefficients 11 c n c l c o s ϕ c d s i n ϕ in this paper we obtained lift coefficient c l and drag coefficient c d at different reynolds numbers by ansys fluent and more details can be found in reference chen et al 2018 2 4 optimization model after defining the four parametric models and the rotor thrust calculation method in the above sections the next step is to develop the optimization model in the model the objective function is the weight of model blades this is because the motor and gearbox assembly used to maintain a constant rotor speed are always overweight in model tests martin 2011 and we need to minimize the blade weight to reduce the overall mass of the model rna system based on the consideration of simplifying the fabricating processes of the model blade we chose the material sprint st 94 rc200t for blade layup recommended by reference martin 2011 and adopted only single layer of sprint st 94 rc200t to fabricate the model blade with a uniform thickness of 0 253 mm therefore the weight of model blades is proportional to the surface area of the blades simultaneously owing to the surface area which varies directly with the chord length a custom variable weight parameter wp can be used to determine the blade weight qualitatively in the model tests du et al 2016 since our optimization goal is to minimize the blade weight the objective function is to determine the wp minimum 12 w p 0 r 2 π r c r d r i 1 e n 2 π c i r i d r i where en is the number of the blade elements and c r is the chord length at different radius regarding optimization variables this paper mainly considers the chord length and the twist angle this is because the shape of blades is mainly determined by four parameters blade length airfoil type the twist angle and the chord length of selected airfoil in which the blade length is a fixed value and the use of a single airfoil for model blades facilitates its design and production in section 2 2 we introduce four methods to represent the chord length and the twist angle of model blades and in each method the variables that control the chord length and the twist angle distribution along the blade are different thus there are specific optimization models for each method in order to determine the uniform optimization model we use σ to represent all optimization variables σ is an n dimensional vector and n is related to the parametric method of model blades for example σ is an 8 dimensional vector in eight parameter model the optimization model is 13 m i n i 1 e n 2 π c i r i d r i s t f c σ θ σ f t a r g e t ε l b σ u b σ r n where is the optimization variable by parameterized formulas l b and u b are respectively lower and upper boundaries for the optimization variables ε is accuracy requirements f is obtained in section 2 3 s t means subject to and f c θ means the rotor thrust is a function of chord length and twist angle in the optimization process as optimization variables σ changes the distribution of the chord length and the twist angle along the blade will change which will cause the shape of blades to change and ultimately affect the rotor thrust it should be noted that the change of σ should be within a certain range l b σ u b and also satisfy f c θ f t a r g e t ε this trial and error process stops until the model blade reach the lightest weight under those constraint conditions the optimized model blade is considered as the model blade with aerodynamic similarity 2 5 model test the model test is a key part of the design and analysis process of floating offshore wind turbines it provides the solid evidence to verify the accuracy of the numerical results thus after the optimized model blade is obtained by the redesign method the experiment is conducted to analyze the rotor thrust of the optimized model blades it was carried out in the state key laboratory of ocean engineering shanghai jiao tong university however it should be noted that the floating platform was not included and the test was conducted in the onshore experimental area the schematic figure and the photo to explain the experimental setup are shown in fig 1 the wind turbine model was installed in the middle position which is 4 m in front of the wind generation system this position was obtained by model tests and the turbulence intensity is less than 10 and if you want more information about this part please see the reference meng et al 2019 in the model test these blades were made of carbon fiber the data of the scaled model blade geometric properties was based on the optimized fitting data introduced in section 2 4 as for the model blade based on the aerodynamic similarity the data was obtained from the high order redesign method the wind generation system was 3 3 m with 16 fans and rectifier fins and grids were employed to improve the quality of wind in front of these fans meng et al 2019 a series of model instrumentations were set to test the rotor thrust accurately which are shown in fig 2 in order to simulate the operation of the wind turbine the wind and rotor speeds were set at specific values based on the experimental conditions table 2 shows the prototype conditions which were simulated in the model test the wind speed was achieved by wind generation machine and the rotor speed was realized by the motor and gearbox when the wind turbine model operated the rotor thrust was tested by the six axis force gauge when the device received the force signals it would send the values of the rotor thrust to the computer by the data line 3 results 3 1 geometric profile change four model blades with aerodynamic similarity can be numerically generated by the methods introduced in section 2 these blades can eliminate the scale effect under the rated condition after the numerical computation the comparison figures of chord length and twist angle distributions between the original scaled and optimized model blades are shown in figs 3 4 results are classified according to the parametric models in fig 3 the model blades obtained with aerodynamic similarity by the methods of eight two and single parameters are compared with the scaled model blade represented by the polynomial curve in fig 4 the model blade obtained by four parameter method is compared with the scaled model blade represented by the bessel curve as shown in fig 3 the chord length of the model blades with aerodynamic similarity increased compared with the scaled model blade the longest chord length occurred at the root area of the model blade for the single parameter method the maximum value is 0 18 m at 16 total length of the blade this is because the chord length at the root area is large than other positions compared with three redesign methods the tip area of the model blade has the greatest impact on the rotor thrust as for the twist angle the area with large changing rate is mainly at the tip of the model blade where it decreases this can be explained by the change of the chord length when the change of the chord length tuned the rotor thrust under the desired value the twist angle needs to be decreased to increase the rotor thrust as in fig 4 the major varying regions are also concentrated near the tip of the blade compared with the scaled model blade the positions with maximum change of the chord length and twist angle are related to the two middle control points positions when the middle control points are set at 37 and 72 total length of the blade the maximum changes of the chord length and twist angle are at 97 and 70 total length of the blade 3 2 comparison of weight as mentioned above controlling the weight of model blades is very important for model tests of floating offshore wind turbines which can reduce the gap with the target value when scaling overall mass and the optimization goal is to find the weight as light as possible although each of the four model blades is already the lightest weight blade obtained by optimization methods they are not all the same thus the weight parameters of four blades were calculated and the comparison is shown in fig 5 according to fig 5 the weight parameter gradually decreases as the order of optimization methods increases the parameter of eight parameter method is only 0 27 while single parameter method is 0 38 this is because the high order redesign methods could represent the blade shape more accurate than the low order methods since the weight of blades is only related to the chord length the twist angle is ignored here the high order method can better concentrate the chord length growth area mainly on the tip of the blade which has the maximum impact on rotor thrust by reducing or not changing the chord length of less impact zone thus high order design method can effectively reduce the weight of blades which is beneficial for the experiment thus the eight parameter method is good enough for the present study 3 3 rotor thrust improvement the model blade with aerodynamic similarity by high order redesign method and the original scaled model blade were fabricated the blade shapes are shown in the fig 6 the chord length of the optimized blade is larger than the scaled model blade especially in the tip area then these two model blades were tested under the conditions given in table 2 with the method in section 2 5 for the measurement of the rotor thrust the experimental results are shown in figs 7 and 8 and desired values at different tip speed ratios are derived by scaling down prototype values of a 6 mw floating offshore wind turbine fig 7 is the comparison figure between experimental data by model blades and the desired value fig 8 a represents the comparison between the experimental data and the desired value under the rated condition fig 8 b reflects the discrepancy in the numerically calculation and experiment as shown in fig 7 the experiment intuitively shows the scale effect in the model test of floating offshore wind turbines and the redesign method effectually eliminates this phenomenon combined with fig 8 a the rotor thrust of model blade with aerodynamic similarity is 3 26 n under the rated condition which is only 1 88 different from the desired value 3 20 n it can improve the rotor thrust by 106 33 compared with the experiment of the scaled model blade 1 58 n in addition to the rated condition the pitch adjustment was employed to make up for the discrepancy of the rotor thrust occurred in other experimental conditions because the pitch adjustment is not the research focus in this study it was simply achieved by the manual operation in the model test the accuracy of the numerical model determines whether the optimized blades meet requirements of model tests thus it is necessary to verify the numerical calculations by the experiment as shown in fig 8 b numerical results are reliable compared with the experimental data the numerical and experimental result of the scaled model blade is 1 53 n and 1 58 n respectively between which the difference is 3 16 similarly the discrepancy between these two in the optimized model blade is 1 52 4 conclusions in this study the high order redesign methods for wind turbine blade optimization based on the aerodynamic similarity are developed to eliminate the scale effect in the model tests of floating offshore wind turbines the goal of this method is to obtain an optimized blade with the lightest weight when considering the aerodynamic similarity four model blades are numerically investigated by the software aerodyn one of the model blades by high order redesign method was tested and compared with the scaled model blade some key conclusions are listed as follow a high order redesign method can significantly eliminate the scale effect in froude scale wind wave basin tests of floating offshore wind turbines it can numerically design model blades with the aerodynamic similarity under the rated condition and largely improve the rotor thrust through the experimental results of optimized and scaled model blades b high order redesign methods effectively reduce the blade weight than low order methods which ensures that the overall mass is accurately scaled in other words this method could represent the shape of blades better than other methods mentioned in this paper c numerical models can be employed to redesign model blades with aerodynamic similarity since it is of a high accuracy by comparing the numerical calculation with the experimental results of both the optimized and scaled model blades under the rated condition high order redesign method can eliminate the scale effect and reduce blade weight it has proved to be an efficient solution in froude scale wind wave basin tests of floating offshore wind turbines next the model test for the model blades with aerodynamic similarity by the other high order redesign methods will be conducted and compared with the existing results more innovative ways to eliminate the scale effect and the model blades of thrust and torque similarities will be the focus of the

21959,the model test is important in the design and analysis of floating offshore wind turbines however the rotor thrust generated by the scaled model blades will be far less than the froude scaled value in the wave basin test which has a significant effect on motion responses of floating offshore wind turbines thus in order to improve the reliability of model tests it is essential to simulate the rotor thrust accurately based on the aerodynamic similarity in the present study four parametric models were developed to define the geometry of model blades and they were integrated separately into the optimization model to reach the design criteria considering the weight control the model blade defined by high order design method was tested it was demonstrated that the deviation between the experimental and numerical model blades under the rated condition was very small only 3 16 under the same condition the model blade with aerodynamic similarity could improve the rotor thrust by 106 33 compared with the froude scaled model blade simultaneously high order redesign method can significantly reduce the blade weight thus the high order redesign method is considered to be an effective way to eliminate the scale effect in the model tests of floating offshore wind turbines keywords floating offshore wind turbine model test model blade with aerodynamic similarity scale

offshore wind turbines can simulate the working features and dynamic response of the prototype by choosing a reasonable scale the experimental data is also a good evidence to verify the accuracy of numerical calculations to date there are some well known model tests for floating wind systems such as wind float test conducted in the uc berkeley s ship model testing facility roddier et al 2010

angle the shape of bessel curve is determined by the control points bézier 1972 forrest 1972 the formula is 2 b t p 0 1 t 3 3 p 1 t 1 t 2 3 p 2 t 2 1 t p 3 t 3 t 0 1 eight control points were arranged to define the model blade the positions of initial points were assumed to be at the root 37 of the total length 72 of the total length and tip of the model blade according to the above equation and the original scaled model blade shape the coordinates of initial control points were determined it should be noted that this model could differ from the geometries of the original scaled model blade transverse coordinates of control points remained unchanged along the model blade while the vertical coordinates of two middle control points were adjusted to adapt to the change of the curve shape thus there are four optimization variables y a 1 y a 2 y b 1 y b 2 which are the vertical coordinates of p a 1 p a 2 p b 1 p b 2 the parameterized formulas of the chord length and twist angle are 3 x c t x a 0 1 t 3 3 x a 1 t 1 t 2 3 x a 2 t 2 1 t x a 3 t 3 c t y a 0 1 t 3 3 y a 1 t 1 t 2 3 y a 2 t 2 1 t y a 3 t 3 4 x θ t x b 0 1 t 3 3 x b 1 t 1 t 2 3 x b 2 t 2 1 t x b 3 t 3 θ t y b 0 1 t 3 3 y b 1 t 1 t 2 3 y b 2 t 2 1 t y b 3 t 3 2 2 3 two parameter model geometric similarity of model blades mainly takes chord length and twist angle into consideration however in the parametric models with eight and four parameters the geometric similarity was not achieved in order to satisfy such requirements the present study further develops the parametric model into the two parameter one in this model the 4th order polynomial chosen for the chord length is consistent with that of the eight parameter model to further improve the geometric similarity the chord length was scaled up by a scaling factor α as for the twist angle the change of the model blade is assumed to be linear thus the change of twist angle was based on the scaled model blade it was constant in root and increased by β on the tip while the other positions were linearly increased the parameterized formulas of the chord length and twist angle are 5 c α a 00 x 4 a 10 x 3 a 20 x 2 a 30 x a 40 θ b 00 x 2 b 10 x b 20 β x 1 19 where the parameters α β are the variables to be optimized 2 2 4 single parameter model in this method twist angles remain constant during the optimization process in order to better satisfy the requirements of geometric similarity than the two parameter model the curve proposed to fit the chord length was consistent with that of the two parameter model which is still with a scaling factor α the parameterized formulas of chord length and twist angle are 6 c x α a 00 x 4 a 10 x 3 a 20 x 2 a 30 x a 40 θ x b 00 x 2 b 10 x b 20 2 3 bem and rotor thrust the blade element momentum bem theory is employed to calculate the rotor thrust which actually originates from two theories the blade element theory and the momentum theory leishman 2006 regarding the wide application of these theories to calculate rotor thrust hansen et al 2006 this paper directly employs a commonly used software aerodyn to achieve the rotor thrust calculation it is a software to simulate the aerodynamic performance of horizontal axis wind turbines released by the national renewable energy laboratory nrel moriarty and hansen 2005 to calculate the rotor thrust it will ask for the files of environmental conditions wind turbine parameters and lift and drag coefficients before the calculation the airfoil of the blade needs to be defined the poor aerodynamic performance of the airfoils at low reynolds number which causes the mismatch of the aerodynamic loadings could be highly improved by selecting naca4412 in model test it is the only type of airfoil used all through the present study according to the momentum theory the encounter velocity of airfoil is defined as 7 v r e l 1 a v 1 2 1 a ω r 2 where a and a are axial and tangential induction factors respectively ω is the rotational speed and r is the radius of the airfoil section and v 1 is incoming free stream velocity the local flow angle and the local angle of attack are equivalent to 8 ϕ a r c t a n 1 a v 1 1 a ω r 9 α b e m ϕ θ where θ is twist angle of airfoil section the rotor thrust is defined as 10 f 0 r 1 2 z ρ c v r e l 2 c n d r where z is number of blades c is chord length of the airfoil section ρ is air density r is radius of the rotor and c n is defined by lift and drag coefficients 11 c n c l c o s ϕ c d s i n ϕ in this paper we obtained lift coefficient c l and drag coefficient c d at different reynolds numbers by ansys fluent and more details can be found in reference chen et al 2018 2 4 optimization model after defining the four parametric models and the rotor thrust calculation method in the above sections the next step is to develop the optimization model in the model the objective function is the weight of model blades this is because the motor and gearbox assembly used to maintain a constant rotor speed are always overweight in model tests martin 2011 and we need to minimize the blade weight to reduce the overall mass of the model rna system based on the consideration of simplifying the fabricating processes of the model blade we chose the material sprint st 94 rc200t for blade layup recommended by reference martin 2011 and adopted only single layer of sprint st 94 rc200t to fabricate the model blade with a uniform thickness of 0 253 mm therefore the weight of model blades is proportional to the surface area of the blades simultaneously owing to the surface area which varies directly with the chord length a custom variable weight parameter wp can be used to determine the blade weight qualitatively in the model tests du et al 2016 since our optimization goal is to minimize the blade weight the objective function is to determine the wp minimum 12 w p 0 r 2 π r c r d r i 1 e n 2 π c i r i d r i where en is the number of the blade elements and c r is the chord length at different radius regarding optimization variables this paper mainly considers the chord length and the twist angle this is because the shape of blades is mainly determined by four parameters blade length airfoil type the twist angle and the chord length of selected airfoil in which the blade length is a fixed value and the use of a single airfoil for model blades facilitates its design and production in section 2 2 we introduce four methods to represent the chord length and the twist angle of model blades and in each method the variables that control the chord length and the twist angle distribution along the blade are different thus there are specific optimization models for each method in order to determine the uniform optimization model we use σ to represent all optimization variables σ is an n dimensional vector and n is related to the parametric method of model blades for example σ is an 8 dimensional vector in eight parameter model the optimization model is 13 m i n i 1 e n 2 π c i r i d r i s t f c σ θ σ f t a r g e t ε l b σ u b σ r n where is the optimization variable by parameterized formulas l b and u b are respectively lower and upper boundaries for the optimization variables ε is accuracy requirements f is obtained in section 2 3 s t means subject to and f c θ means the rotor thrust is a function of chord length and twist angle in the optimization process as optimization variables σ changes the distribution of the chord length and the twist angle along the blade will change which will cause the shape of blades to change and ultimately affect the rotor thrust it should be noted that the change of σ should be within a certain range l b σ u b and also satisfy f c θ f t a r g e t ε this trial and error process stops until the model blade reach the lightest weight under those constraint conditions the optimized model blade is considered as the model blade with aerodynamic similarity 2 5 model test the model test is a key part of the design and analysis process of floating offshore wind turbines it provides the solid evidence to verify the accuracy of the numerical results thus after the optimized model blade is obtained by the redesign method the experiment is conducted to analyze the rotor thrust of the optimized model blades it was carried out in the state key laboratory of ocean engineering shanghai jiao tong university however it should be noted that the floating platform was not included and the test was conducted in the onshore experimental area the schematic figure and the photo to explain the experimental setup are shown in fig 1 the wind turbine model was installed in the middle position which is 4 m in front of the wind generation system this position was obtained by model tests and the turbulence intensity is less than 10 and if you want more information about this part please see the reference meng et al 2019 in the model test these blades were made of carbon fiber the data of the scaled model blade geometric properties was based on the optimized fitting data introduced in section 2 4 as for the model blade based on the aerodynamic similarity the data was obtained from the high order redesign method the wind generation system was 3 3 m with 16 fans and rectifier fins and grids were employed to improve the quality of wind in front of these fans meng et al 2019 a series of model instrumentations were set to test the rotor thrust accurately which are shown in fig 2 in order to simulate the operation of the wind turbine the wind and rotor speeds were set at specific values based on the experimental conditions table 2 shows the prototype conditions which were simulated in the model test the wind speed was achieved by wind generation machine and the rotor speed was realized by the motor and gearbox when the wind turbine model operated the rotor thrust was tested by the six axis force gauge when the device received the force signals it would send the values of the rotor thrust to the computer by the data line 3 results 3 1 geometric profile change four model blades with aerodynamic similarity can be numerically generated by the methods introduced in section 2 these blades can eliminate the scale effect under the rated condition after the numerical computation the comparison figures of chord length and twist angle distributions between the original scaled and optimized model blades are shown in figs 3 4 results are classified according to the parametric models in fig 3 the model blades obtained with aerodynamic similarity by the methods of eight two and single parameters are compared with the scaled model blade represented by the polynomial curve in fig 4 the model blade obtained by four parameter method is compared with the scaled model blade represented by the bessel curve as shown in fig 3 the chord length of the model blades with aerodynamic similarity increased compared with the scaled model blade the longest chord length occurred at the root area of the model blade for the single parameter method the maximum value is 0 18 m at 16 total length of the blade this is because the chord length at the root area is large than other positions compared with three redesign methods the tip area of the model blade has the greatest impact on the rotor thrust as for the twist angle the area with large changing rate is mainly at the tip of the model blade where it decreases this can be explained by the change of the chord length when the change of the chord length tuned the rotor thrust under the desired value the twist angle needs to be decreased to increase the rotor thrust as in fig 4 the major varying regions are also concentrated near the tip of the blade compared with the scaled model blade the positions with maximum change of the chord length and twist angle are related to the two middle control points positions when the middle control points are set at 37 and 72 total length of the blade the maximum changes of the chord length and twist angle are at 97 and 70 total length of the blade 3 2 comparison of weight as mentioned above controlling the weight of model blades is very important for model tests of floating offshore wind turbines which can reduce the gap with the target value when scaling overall mass and the optimization goal is to find the weight as light as possible although each of the four model blades is already the lightest weight blade obtained by optimization methods they are not all the same thus the weight parameters of four blades were calculated and the comparison is shown in fig 5 according to fig 5 the weight parameter gradually decreases as the order of optimization methods increases the parameter of eight parameter method is only 0 27 while single parameter method is 0 38 this is because the high order redesign methods could represent the blade shape more accurate than the low order methods since the weight of blades is only related to the chord length the twist angle is ignored here the high order method can better concentrate the chord length growth area mainly on the tip of the blade which has the maximum impact on rotor thrust by reducing or not changing the chord length of less impact zone thus high order design method can effectively reduce the weight of blades which is beneficial for the experiment thus the eight parameter method is good enough for the present study 3 3 rotor thrust improvement the model blade with aerodynamic similarity by high order redesign method and the original scaled model blade were fabricated the blade shapes are shown in the fig 6 the chord length of the optimized blade is larger than the scaled model blade especially in the tip area then these two model blades were tested under the conditions given in table 2 with the method in section 2 5 for the measurement of the rotor thrust the experimental results are shown in figs 7 and 8 and desired values at different tip speed ratios are derived by scaling down prototype values of a 6 mw floating offshore wind turbine fig 7 is the comparison figure between experimental data by model blades and the desired value fig 8 a represents the comparison between the experimental data and the desired value under the rated condition fig 8 b reflects the discrepancy in the numerically calculation and experiment as shown in fig 7 the experiment intuitively shows the scale effect in the model test of floating offshore wind turbines and the redesign method effectually eliminates this phenomenon combined with fig 8 a the rotor thrust of model blade with aerodynamic similarity is 3 26 n under the rated condition which is only 1 88 different from the desired value 3 20 n it can improve the rotor thrust by 106 33 compared with the experiment of the scaled model blade 1 58 n in addition to the rated condition the pitch adjustment was employed to make up for the discrepancy of the rotor thrust occurred in other experimental conditions because the pitch adjustment is not the research focus in this study it was simply achieved by the manual operation in the model test the accuracy of the numerical model determines whether the optimized blades meet requirements of model tests thus it is necessary to verify the numerical calculations by the experiment as shown in fig 8 b numerical results are reliable compared with the experimental data the numerical and experimental result of the scaled model blade is 1 53 n and 1 58 n respectively between which the difference is 3 16 similarly the discrepancy between these two in the optimized model blade is 1 52 4 conclusions in this study the high order redesign methods for wind turbine blade optimization based on the aerodynamic similarity are developed to eliminate the scale effect in the model tests of floating offshore wind turbines the goal of this method is to obtain an optimized blade with the lightest weight when considering the aerodynamic similarity four model blades are numerically investigated by the software aerodyn one of the model blades by high order redesign method was tested and compared with the scaled model blade some key conclusions are listed as follow a high order redesign method can significantly eliminate the scale effect in froude scale wind wave basin tests of floating offshore wind turbines it can numerically design model blades with the aerodynamic similarity under the rated condition and largely improve the rotor thrust through the experimental results of optimized and scaled model blades b high order redesign methods effectively reduce the blade weight than low order methods which ensures that the overall mass is accurately scaled in other words this method could represent the shape of blades better than other methods mentioned in this paper c numerical models can be employed to redesign model blades with aerodynamic similarity since it is of a high accuracy by comparing the numerical calculation with the experimental results of both the optimized and scaled model blades under the rated condition high order redesign method can eliminate the scale effect and reduce blade weight it has proved to be an efficient solution in froude scale wind wave basin tests of floating offshore wind turbines next the model test for the model blades with aerodynamic similarity by the other high order redesign methods will be conducted and compared with the existing results more innovative ways to eliminate the scale effect and the model blades of thrust and torque similarities will be the focus of the
