2500,we propose a stochastic approach for simulation of realistic continuous snow depth time series using a snow depth estimation model and a stochastic weather generation model the snow depth estimation model consists of three steps defining the precipitation type estimating the snow ratio and estimating the decreased snow depth first air temperature and relative humidity are used as indices to determine the type of precipitation when precipitation occurs when the type is identified as snow the snow ratio is estimated converting the precipitation depth into depth of fresh snow here the snow ratio is estimated through sigmoidal relationship with the air temperature lastly the amount of decreased snow depth was estimated using a novel temperature index snowmelt equation that can consider depth dependent melting of snowpack the model was applied to four meteorological stations of korea and yielded high nash sutcliffe efficiency values which ranged between 0 745 and 0 875 for calibration and ranged between 0 432 and 0 753 for validation this calibrated snow depth estimation model was then applied to synthetic weather data precipitation temperature and relative humidity that was generated by stochastic weather generation model to simulate continuous snow depth time series the simulated snow depth data accurately reproduced standard and extreme value statistics of the observed data the latter of which were consistent with the current korean building code this model can be widely used not only in the field of snow related risk analysis but also in data simulation for ungauged areas and future trend study using the climate projection keywords snow depth maximum snow depth weather generation stochastic snow model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction extreme snow events are detrimental to human society excessively accumulated snow causes structural geis et al 2012 and functional world meteorological organization wmo 2021 failure of important infrastructures of which impact proliferates towards the various economic sectors of a country and the globe for example unprecedented severe winter storm of 2021 texas exacerbated the global chip shortage bbc news 2021 and the subsequent slowdown of manufacturing industry that was initiated by the covid19 the great 2008 chinese storm zhou et al 2011 caused the full or partial collapse of 2 2 million houses which costed 129 casualties and 1 7 displaced populations the direct and indirect economic damages of both events were assessed to be 300 asce 2022 and 20 billion usd zhou et al 2011 respectively accumulation and melting of snow also pose significant impact on daily lives of millions of people by adding great variability water resources barnett et al 2005 and causing floods yan et al 2018 li et al 2019 yan et al 2020 cho and jacobs 2020 some studies argue that the extreme snow events are associated with the global warming liu et al 2012 cohen et al 2014 so their adverse impact is likely to increase in the future therefore measures should be taken to prepare for the extreme snow events and the subsequent disasters of which fundamental step should be accurate prediction of temporal behavior of snowpacks for this observation and analysis of weather variables related to snowfall are essential representative weather variables for the analysis include snow depth snow water equivalent and snow load data of these data for snow water equivalent and snow load have traditionally been observed less than snow depth data because it requires much more time and cost ntokas et al 2021 for this reason the snow water equivalent and snow load have often been estimated by multiplying the relatively well observed snow depth and the estimated snow density jonas et al 2009 sturm et al 2010 however compared to other meteorological data such as precipitation temperature and wind speed the snow depth is observed less frequently https web kma go kr eng biz observation 02 jsp if there is no observed snow depth data simulation methods can be considered for estimation of snow depth the snow depth can be estimated from the existing snow depth fresh snow depth and decreased depth accounting for the melted snow the simulation method is divided into two different categories physics based and statistical method a physics based model simulates snow depth by expressing snow processes such as thermal diffusion phase change and metamorphism in the snowpack in terms of the physics based equations le roux et al 2020 while physics models have a firm scientific basis they are based on many assumptions conceptualizing complex physical processes of snow accumulation and melting e g tuzet et al 2017 which entails accumulation of uncertainties as simulation progresses over time perona et al 2007 in addition they require various types of meteorological input data such as precipitation long shortwave radiation air temperature wind speed and humidity which is often difficult to obtain a stochastic method is based on a statistical relationship between snow depth and various weather variables lee et al 2019 and has advantage of simulating the snow depth with relatively few input data and low computational cost lee et al 2020 developed a markov chain model that defined a transition probability from current snow depth cluster to another to establish a heavy snowfall alarm model this model can only predict increasing snow depth over time and it accurately predicted the time series in seoul r2 0 957 adib et al 2021 using the wavelet transformation resolved snow depth time series into linear and nonlinear components and simulated those components with an arima model and a neuro fuzzy model respectively to predict the snow depth woody et al 2009 predicted the one day ahead snow depth using a storage model assuming the seasonal mean component as a periodic function lee et al 2019 predicted the daily maximum fresh snow depth by an artificial neural network model using the observed daily precipitation average temperature and minimum temperature as input parameters for the model as mentioned above most studies related to the snow depth simulation focus on either short term forecasting woody et al 2020 or simulation of the fresh snow depth kim et al 2014 park et al 2014 research regarding the simulation of a continuous snow depth time series is rare because it is difficult to simulate not only the fresh snow depth but also the existing snow depth and the decreased snow depth simultaneously perona et al 2007 assumed a poisson based stochastic accumulation process and a deterministic linear decay process by dividing the snow period into the accumulation and decay periods to simulate the snow depth change yin et al 2011 simulated the snow load for three observation sites in the united states using the filtered poisson process model assuming the frequency amplitude duration and total event period of the snow load as poisson and lognormal probability distributions as a result of this study empirical cumulative probability function of the daily snow load and the annual maximum snow load was simulated similarly to the observed values however it inherently includes uncertainty from not actually measuring the snow load value but rather using the estimation from snow water equivalent croce et al 2018a b classified seven categories of weather conditions that induce snow load change fitted the relationship between daily maximum minimum temperature and precipitation with a conditional probability function for each classification and simulated snow load time series by generating random numbers at each time step however there are limitations in this approach because it does not validate the results with observations and cannot consider various combinations of weather variables as input parameters in this study we propose new stochastic approach to simulate the continuous snow depth time series the process can be summarized in three major steps as follows 1 snow depth estimation algorithm that simulates the occurrence accumulation and decreased snow depth 2 validation with the observed snow depth from the validation period and 3 synthetic weather variable simulation using a stochastic weather generation model for the final simulation of the synthetic snow depth time series this study is distinct from previous studies in that it was designed to use minimum number of weather variables temperature precipitation relative humidity to increase the applicability of the model the performance of the model can be evaluated intuitively by directly comparing it with the observed snow depth data and a stochastic weather generation model is introduced to accurately reproduce statistical characteristics of the observed weather variables allowing combination of various weather variables to be considered and enabling monte carlo based risk analysis this approach also can be applied to the climate change studies and be used to simulate synthetic data for ungauged areas rest of this paper is organized as follows the study sites and weather data are described in section 2 the methodology about the snow depth estimation algorithm validation and stochastic weather generation model is described in section 3 the results from the model validation as well as the simulated snow depth data corresponding to the synthetic input weather data are presented in section 4 section 5 discusses the expansion of the equation for the decreased snow depth and ending with conclusions of the research in section 6 2 study site and meteorological data there are seven synoptic weather stations with maximum snow depth records greater than 100 cm in republic of korea fig 1 all stations except ulleungdo 115 station are in the far east mountainous region or yeongdong region in this region as the cold and dry air from the asian continent passes through the east sea heat and moisture are supplied from the relatively warm seawater resulting in unstable lower boundary layer heavy snowfall events occur when this unstable air is blown by the northeast air current into the yeongdong region with highly complex mountainous topography lee and lee 1994 station information is described in table 1 the maximum of the daily maximum snow depth observed at each station ranged from 293 6 to 102 9 cm while the starting time of observation differs by the stations the time resolution for the observation was uniformly improved to 3 h since 1982 among seven stations bukgangneung 104 and samcheok 214 were excluded for application because of the short observation periods for bukgangeung 12 years and the absence of hourly snow depth observation for samcheok because there was no solar radiation observation in sokcho 90 and donghae 106 solar radiation data from gangneung 105 was used lastly ulleungdo 115 was excluded because of the lack of solar radiation observation data which could not be inferred either because there is no nearby station the weather data hourly temperature precipitation relative humidity snow depth and 3 hour fresh snow depth in the winter period were used to calibrate and validate the model in section 3 4 and section 4 1 3 methodology a flowchart showing the overall picture of the proposed methodology is shown in fig 2 the process of simulating synthetic snow depth time series consists of three general steps as follows 1 calibration of the snow depth estimation algorithm i e 1st 3rd steps in fig 2 2 validation of this algorithm i e 4th step and 3 simulation of a synthetic weather variable time series through the weather generation model i e 5th step afterward a synthetic snow depth time series is simulated by applying a snow depth estimation algorithm to the simulated synthetic weather time series from the previous steps i e 6th step the snow depth estimation algorithm calibration and validation of the model and weather generation model were explained in sections 3 1 3 2 and 3 3 respectively 3 1 snow depth estimation algorithm to estimate the total change of a snow depth gain and loss of snow need to be simulated first to estimate the increase in snow depth i e gain it is necessary to identify the precipitation type such as rain snow and sleet when winter precipitation occurs if the type of precipitation is identified as snow the snow ratio sr which is the ratio of the depth of snowfall to the depth of precipitation as shown in equation 1 is estimated the increase in snow depth is estimated by multiplying the estimated sr by the depth of precipitation korea meteorological adaministration kma 2011 the amount of decreased snow depth i e loss can be estimated by simulating the melting of the accumulated snow and the changes in its shape 1 s r s n o w f a l l d e p t h m m p r e c i p i t a t i o n d e p t h m m 3 1 1 discrimination of precipitation type to determine the type of precipitation on the ground matsuo et al 1981 derived a relationship between type of precipitation and surface meteorological data from the observation data of wajima matsumoto and nikko stations in japan temperature and relative humidity were suggested as the meteorological variables for determining the precipitation type and the critical relative humidity at which snow occurs was proposed as a linear function of temperature the kma adopted this concept and proposed a shifted matsuo scheme lee et al 2014 korea meteorological adaministration kma 2011 to fit the korean meteorological data the kma then presented five conditions for the additional discrimination of precipitation types listed in table 2 used for the snow forecasts in this study the type of precipitation was determined based on this criterion to evaluate its performance using the test weather stations data subsection 3 4 1 3 1 2 estimation of the snow ratio in general in order to estimate snow depth a process of converting the predicted or observed precipitation depth into the snow depth is required for this the sr from equation 1 is applied which can vary from 3 to 100 depending on the weather conditions roebber et al 2003 in korea meteorological adaministration kma 2011 four conditions according to the temperature reference on the ground below or above 0 c and the temperature reference at 850 hpa below or above 8 c were considered to estimate the sr then the relationship between precipitation and sr at each condition was analyzed using the observation data this classification method is based on observation that 1 precipitation occurs and evolves at an altitude of 850 hpa or higher 2 a large amount of supercooled water exist in the humid air below 10 c and 3 the size of the snow may increase due to this supercooled water hindman and johnson 1972 pruppacher 1995 the above method provided a satisfactory prediction performance with a correlation coefficient of 0 86 for all cases however meteorological variables such as temperature at an altitude of 850 hpa are not suitable for use in this study because upper air observations are required which are difficult to acquire and those data cannot be simulated with stochastic weather generation models in addition studies using artificial neural networks to estimate the sr roebber et al 2003 also required upper air observation data meanwhile lee et al 2005 proposed a model to estimate the sr by expressing sr as a function of surface air temperature by adopting a sigmoidal nonlinear regression equation ratkowsky 1990 as shown in equation 2 2 s r a 1 e x p t b c where a b c are parameters of the sigmoid function as a result of prediction using this model a correlation coefficient of 0 55 was recorded in 17 cases of snow events although this result is less accurate than the method using upper air observation data the alternative use of the regression model is reasonable because the purpose of this study is to analyze the trend of long term snow depth using available weather data not to develop an accurate short term forecast model accordingly the regression model equation 2 was chosen to estimate the snow ratio 3 1 3 estimation of the decreased snow depth the amount of decreased snow depth can be simulated with a physics based model that considers the temperature distribution inside the snowpack interaction between snow layers and other various external weather conditions such as temperature radiation and humidity however the amount of decreased snow depth is rarely simulated by statistical or empirical method alone and for this reason previous studies on the simulation of snow depth other than the physics based model focused on estimating the fresh snow depth or probable maximum snow depth croce et al 2018a b simulated the amount of snow load reduction by assuming it is proportional to the daily maximum temperature on the other hand many studies have been conducted to estimate the snowmelt which is the depth of the water resulting from melting of snow rather than the decrease in snow depth because snowmelt accounts for significant portion of the water resources in snowmelt dominated region barnett et al 2005 and contributes to flood yan et al 2018 li et al 2019 yan et al 2020 cho and jacobs 2020 snowmelt estimation methods are in general divided into an energy balance method and a temperature index method the energy balance method is a method of calculating the energy flux in the snowpack by considering all terms of the energy balance equation resulting the method to be very accurate but data intensive and may not be applicable depending on the station nrcs 2004 on the other hand the temperature index method uses only temperature data to estimate the snowmelt as shown in equation 3 3 m c m t t b where m is snowmelt mm day cm is degree day coefficient mm degree day c t is mean daily air temperature c and tb is base temperature c despite this simplification the temperature index method shows good performance because the temperature variable itself shows high correlation with various energy balance factors often showing even better performance than the energy balance method at a watershed scale hock 2003 in this study the amount of decreased snow depth is simulated by the temperature index method with couple of assumptions first assumption is that the sr of the snowpack does not change over time and keeps its value when snow occurs second is that snow melting occurs sequentially from the upper layer of snow using these assumptions the parameters of the snowmelt formula can be calibrated and the snowmelt depth simulated by the formula can be converted into the decreased snow depth the details are described in the next section section 3 2 3 2 model calibration and validation the observed snowmelt data are needed to calibrate the parameters of the snowmelt formula because only few stations measure snowmelt and this study site is no exception however we used decreased snow depth due to snowmelt for calibration of the parameters this was done by applying the decreased snow depth to the observed increasing snow depth time series here the observed increasing snow depth time series means a time series in which the amount of snow depth decrease is removed from the observed snow depth time series i e the time series only accumulating the fresh snow depth over time without accounting for the loss for example when n fresh snowfalls occur without considering the melting of the snow a snowpack profile will be formed as shown in fig 3 weather variables available include 3 hour fresh snow depth precipitation snow depth and temperature the observed sr can be obtained by dividing 3 hour fresh snow depth by the precipitation depth then the decreased snow depth δ can be expressed as a function of snowmelt and sr equation 4 4 δ m s r x where δ is decreased snow depth mm and s r x is snow ratio of xth snow layer top layer by subtracting this term from the observed increasing snow depth time series a simulated snow depth time series can be made however since changes in snow density during snow processes such as compaction and refreezing cannot be considered it was assumed that the sr value does not change over time in addition since sr values of the snow layers are different and temperature distribution in snowpack is not provided it was assumed that the snowmelt occurs sequentially from the upper layer of snow in equation 3 the degree day coefficient cm and the base temperature tb are parameters and optimal parameters that best simulates the observed snow depth time series can be obtained through parameter optimization the parameters were optimized to maximize the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse equation 5 of the simulated snow depth using the particle swarm optimization method cho et al 2011 5 n s e 1 t 1 t h s t m h s t o 2 t 1 t h s t o h s 2 where h s t m and h s t o are respectively simulated and observed snow depth at t time step and h s is mean observed snow depth because the 4 test stations have different length of observation half of available data at each station were used for the calibration and the remaining data were used for the validation table 3 during the validation period discrimination of the precipitation type estimation of the sr and estimation of the decreased snow depth algorithms were all applied and the algorithm performance was evaluated by simulating the time series of snow depth only with the observed precipitation temperature and relative humidity equations 7 and 8 show expressions used to simulate the snow depth 7 h s i h s i 1 h f s i δ i h s i 1 h f s i δ i 0 h s i 1 h f

depth mm and subscript i means time step 3 3 weather generation model after calibration of the snow estimation algorithm synthetic weather time series data was required for simulation of the synthetic snow depth time series a weather generation model which simulates synthetic weather data that reproduces the statistical characteristics of observed weather data is extensively used in many fields such as crop productivity priya and shibasaki 2001 supit et al 2012 flood risk analysis kim et al 2013b park et al 2015 kim et al 2017 park et al 2021 dao et al 2021 climate change de luca et al 2020 thorndahl and andersen 2021 rainfall disaggregation koutsoyiannis and onof 2001 and water resource management fowler et al 2000 faramarzi et al 2009 weather generation models have been developed for the past few decades and are classified into three types fatichi et al 2011 first type is a model that simulates a daily or annual time series using an empirical statistical method statistical characteristics and autocorrelation of the observed weather variables are directly inferred e g markov chain model second is a physics based weather forecast model which simulates weather data by solving nonlinear partial differential equations that express weather dynamics third is a mechanistic model designed to explain various meteorological physics processes such as cells and clusters of rainfall and temperature dependence on long wave radiation in this study last stochastic model was selected as the weather generation model to simulate the synthetic snow depth data through long term meteorological variable simulation using the hourly observation data the model by kim and onof 2020 was chosen for precipitation simulation and the awe gen model fatichi et al 2011 were selected for the weather variables simulation because they reproduce not only standard statistical characteristics but also extreme characteristics of the observed data 3 3 1 simulation of the precipitation the kim and onof 2020 model was used to simulate the precipitation the basic structure of the model is the poisson cluster rainfall generation model onof and wang 2020 chen et al 2021 which assumes the storms including rain cells arrive following the poisson process in addition to the arrival of the storms the duration of the storm as well as the arrival duration and intensity of the rain cell are defined using different probability distribution functions with 5 to 8 parameters depending on the type of probability distribution unlike the traditional poisson cluster rainfall model this rainfall model can accurately reproduce the extreme characteristics this is because 1 the chosen model is based on a mathematical structure that can reproduce the first to third order statistical characteristics of the observation data 2 it considers the inverse relationship between rain cell duration and intensity enabling the reproduction of short term concentrated rainfall events 3 it adopted gamma distribution to simulate the intensity of the rain cell and 4 it has two additional modules to consider autocorrelation structure of rainstorms and monthly rainfall for this reason the kim and onof 2020 model shows improved performance in reproducing the extreme values as well as various statistical characteristics of the observed rainfall over a wide range of time scales compared to traditional models the model parameters were calibrated using precipitation data for each test station 3 3 2 simulation of the weather variables the snow depth estimation algorithm requires temperature and relative humidity as weather variables in addition to the precipitation advanced weather genarator awe gen fatichi et al 2011 was used to simulate these variables the awe gen model which is an improved version of the model by ivanov et al 2007 simulates weather variables through a physics stochastic approach some of the improvements by the awe gen include capabilities in 1 simulating vapor pressure instead of dew point temperature 2 simulating diurnal cycle of wind speed 3 simulating shortwave radiation including the concept of photosynthetic active radiation and 4 reproducing the temporal variability of atmospheric pressure the awe gen model was validated for 10 stations in the united states and italy with various climates and was found to well reproduce the extreme values and interannual variability in addition to the standard statistics of the observed weather data in this study a 200 year synthetic weather time series was simulated using the kim and onof 2020 model and the awe gen model note that the rainfall generation module of the awe gen was first replaced with that of kim and onof 2020 and then the awe gen was run to acquire all weather variables through this approach the unidirectional dependence structure between the weather variables that was explicitly considered by the awe gen can be secured in the synthetically generated weather variables while also keeping the auto correlative structure of the synthetic rainfall that kim and onof 2020 secures three variables precipitation temperature and relative humidity were utilized for the synthetic snow depth simulation 3 4 calibration and validation of the snow depth estimation algorithm 3 4 1 validation of the precipitation type discrimination method to validate the criteria for discriminating the precipitation type presented in section 3 1 1 a confusion matrix was generated using the winter observation data january february march november and december for the entire periods including both the calibration and validation period the matrix for sokcho 90 was presented in table 4 in the actual class when a 3 hour fresh snow depth is greater than 0 cm it was counted an occurrence of snow in the predictive class 3 types snow accumulation snow sleet snow dominant were considered as the occurrences of snow among the 5 types listed in table 2 as a result of this analysis the specificity of the predictive model was 0 805 959 959 232 and the sensitivity was 0 998 132 815 298 132 815 to analyze the events that actually affect the increase in snow depth same analysis approach was applied to the events except for the snow events with fresh snow depth greater than 0 cm and lower than 1 cm as a result of the second analysis the specificity increased to 0 868 574 574 87 as shown in table 4 sensitivity and specificity at the test stations were summarized in table 5 these results show that it is possible to apply the discrimination method of precipitation type to the test stations some of which were not validated in the previous study lee et al 2014 3 4 2 fitting the sr estimation function lee et al 2005 expressed the sr as a sigmoid function equation 2 of surface air temperature a decreasing tendency of the sr with increase in precipitation rate was found in that study and they fitted two sigmoid functions according to general and heavy snow events here a general snow event represents an event with 3 hour precipitation of 1 mm or more and less than 5 mm and a heavy snow event represents an event with 3 hour precipitation of 5 mm or more two sigmoid functions for these two events were fitted to the winter data at the test stations the observed sr data were obtained by dividing the 3 hour fresh snow depth by the 3 hour precipitation and the 3 hour average temperature was used as the surface air temperature a graphical result of fitting the sr estimation function for sokcho 90 is presented in fig 4 and all fitting results at the test stations are summarized in table 6 as a result of fitting the functions coefficients of determination ranged from 0 08 to 0 68 according to the precipitation rate although using these results may not be suitable for the short term forecast with accurate numerical prediction effect caused by the sr estimation error on simulating the long term trend of snow depth is relatively small nonetheless it is necessary to simulate the low frequency extreme events in a long term trend so the error term ε of the sr estimation function was introduced to account for the uncertainty of the sr estimation as shown in equation 9 9 s r a 1 e x p t b c ε to generate the error term ε we first found the optimal distribution of the errors which is the difference between the observed and estimated values in the sr estimation equation three theoretical distributions normal logistic and 3 parameter student t distribution were tested for goodness of fit considering the negative samples to test the goodness of fit for the theoretical distributions the optimal parameters were obtained by the maximum likelihood method and the kolmogorov smirnov ks test was performed null hypothesis in a ks test is that samples are extracted from the theoretical probability distribution and if the null hypothesis is rejected h 1 it is considered that the samples are not from the theoretical probability distribution table 7 shows the test results with a significance level of 5 the distribution with the largest test statistic was selected as an optimal distribution the result of parameter fit is shown in table 8 and the comparison figure between histogram of the relative frequency of error and selected probability distribution for sokcho is shown in fig 5 using this distribution random errors were added when estimating the sr 3 4 3 calibration of the snowmelt formula for the calibration of the snowmelt formula equation 3 general range of the degree day coefficient cm presented in nrcs 2004 was used as upper and lower limits of the parameter optimization 1 6 to 6 0 mm degree day c to consider the uncertainty of the algorithm the lower limit was set to 1 10 times and the upper limit was set to 10 times from the limit of general range and limits were divided by 24 to apply to the hourly data limits of the base temperature tb was set to 5 and 5 c to consider the factors affecting the snowmelt in addition to temperature e g net radiation kustas et al 1994 as a result of this calibration for sokcho the nse of the simulated snow depth for the calibration period was 0 4351 indicating relatively low performance this can be attributed to the assumptions of the snow depth estimation algorithm in the snow depth estimation algorithm it is assumed that there is no change in the sr i e change in snow density over time however in reality the density of snow is changed by snow processes such as compaction water percolation and refreezing in the process of becoming old snow from fresh snow vionnet et al 2012 the density of accumulated snow mostly increases over time lee and chung 2018 jo et al 2020 eurocode en 1991 1 3 sanpaolesi et al 1998 classified fresh settled and old snow according to the passed time from occurrence of snow assigning larger density of snow to the older accumulated snow the observed and simulated snow depth time series in 1996 are shown in fig 6 a as shown in the figure the observed snow depth showed a large rate of decrease in the early stage after the occurrence of snow but the magnitude of decreasing rate gradually became small over time however in case of the simulated snow depth contrary to observation the magnitude of the rate of decrease was small at the beginning of the snow occurrence and then increased over time to increase the accuracy of the simulation the effect of snow depth from the previous time step on the snowmelt was analyzed although the snow depth is not an absolute indicator of the aging of the accumulated snow we assumed that snowpack with small snow depth is older than that with large snow depth the basis for this assumption is that small snow depth is always placed in time later than large snow depth in the melting process and snowmelt is not generally dominant in the accumulation process for three classifications of snow depth i e greater than 0 and less than 25 greater than 25 and less than 50 greater than 50 and less than 90 cm the relationships between temperature and the amount of decrease in snow depth were found for the events when the snow depth decreased during the calibration period as shown in fig 7 in fig 7 the regression line slope means the trend of the decrease in snow depth according to temperature while large uncertainties reside in the relationship the regression lines of the plots reveal that more snow tends to melt for thicker snowpack this snowmelt was expressed as an exponential function resulting in modified formula presented in equation 10 10 δ t h s m s r x e a h s c m t t b s r x e a h s where a cm 1 is a correction parameter according to the hs there are three parameters cm tb and a and the nse of the snow depth prediction for sokcho was 0 8671 as a result of optimization of the parameters results of the parameter calibration for the test stations are presented in table 9 and the improved simulation results for sokcho are shown in fig 6b 4 result 4 1 validation of the snow depth estimation algorithm the snow depth estimation algorithm was validated using the data from the validation period the snow depth was simulated using only temperature precipitation and relative humidity data during the validation period and the result showed nse of the simulated snow depth ranging from 0 4322 to 0 7528 table 9 when the sr perturbation term is considered since the nse value changes at every simulation the median values of nse from 100 simulations were used to evaluate the model resulting in similar result with the model which does not consider the sr perturbation term fig 8 a and 8b show the simulated results of the snow depth for sokcho in the winter of 2010 and 2014 in fig 8a and b it can be confirmed that the simulated results accounting for occurrence accumulation and decrease of snow depth explaining the process of changing the snow depth proceeds similarly to the observed data in addition the snow depth estimation algorithm has to reproduce the extreme value of the snow depth fig 8c shows comparison of yearly maximum snow depth between the observed and the simulated snow depth here the yearly maximum snow depth is the maximum snow depth that occurred during the winter of a given year i e the yearly maximum snow depth in year 2000 means the maximum snow depth during a study period from november 2000 to march 2001 the regression results of fig 8c for the other test stations were summarized in table 10 the time series simulated by the snow depth estimation algorithm was found to reproduce the observed extreme values well 4 2 the weather generation model figs 9 and 10 show the results of generating a 200 year synthetic weather variable time series using the data observed from sokcho station in the case of precipitation the first to the third moment of precipitation are accurately reproduced for the hourly units as shown in fig 9 as the figure shows variability of precipitation on a large time scale up to 5 months is also well reproduced fig 10 shows the monthly average statistics of the synthetic and observed temperature and relative humidity it is shown that the hourly to daily statistics of the weather variables are well reproduced particularly for the winter season january february march november and december results of weather generation for other test stations also showed good agreement with observed statistics and were not presented in this paper 4 3 simulation of the synthetic snow depth time series fig 11 shows simulated results of the synthetic snow depth time series using the snow depth estimation algorithm and the time series of the 200 year synthetic weather variables at the sokcho station the synthetic snow depth time series simulated well not only for the year with very shallow snow but also for the year with snow depth of larger than 123 8 cm which was the maximum snow depth observed the mean and standard deviation of the snow depth time series and yearly average number of snow days are listed in table 11 to compare the statistics of the observed and simulated snow depth time series to consider uncertainty residing in the snow ratio this study simulated 100 sets of 200 year synthetic snow depth while perturbing the snow ratio using the distribution shown in fig 5 in case of the model with sr perturbation term since it is difficult to obtain meaningful comparison when periods with no snow i e period of zero snow depth are included in the statistical calculation due to a large number of zero values the mean and standard deviation were calculated for the observed and simulated time series with a snow depth of 1 cm or more the mean and standard deviation of the simulated snow depth time series had relative errors ranging from 3 0 to 63 4 percentage and from 2 2 to 32 7 percentage respectively the errors were particularly greater in gangneung and donghae station the errors for mean and standard deviation were 63 4 and 32 7 in gangneung and 5 9 and 26 7 in donghae these two stations have shorter calibration period table 3 compared to the other stations because of the short available observation period not long enough period of the calibration data can lead to poor model calibration and these two stations showed low model efficiency in validation period table 9 the model with the low model efficiency led to the great error in these two stations on the other hand average relative errors for the other 2 stations were 5 7 for mean and 6 0 for standard deviation indicating that the observed statistics were well reproduced the yearly average number of snowy days days with freshly fallen snow depth of 1 cm or more were calculated the mean error between observed and simulated time series was 2 7 days the error was great at the station with more snowy days a year daegwallyeong station has more than 20 snowy days a year and it includes many types of snow with different characteristics this led to great uncertainty in estimating sr for the station table 6 the uncertainty in sr estimation causes error in estimating snowy days only days with fhs 1 cm are counted reducing the uncertainty in estimating sr is a challenge to be addressed to improve the model fig 12 shows the comparison of yearly maximum snow depth from the simulated and observed snow depth time series with x axis scaled with a gumbel reduced variate the yearly maximum snow depths for the return period from 2 years to 40 years were well reproduced in the simulated snow depth time series the green shades shown in the fig 12 are the 90 prediction interval note that the uncertainty of the snow depth shown here is not from procedure of curve fitting of annual maximum snow values e g debock et al 2017 liel et al 2017 but from the modeling of physical process of snow accumulation which may provide a fresh insight on design snow load estimation procedures finally the simulated data were compared with the design snow load map of korea shin et al 2016 that is currently applied in the korean building code kbc2016 aik 2016 in this code the design snow load is determined by multiplying the predetermined specific weight of snow table 12 to the 100 year snow depth that is estimated from the frequency analysis based on the annual maximum snow depth the yearly maximum snow depths with 100 years of return period at the test stations were shown in fig 12 the yearly maximum snow depths estimated from the model in this study were greater than kbc2016 at all test stations even considering uncertainty of sr estimation green shade design snow loads table 13 also showed even more larger difference due to the increasing unit weight of snow depending on snow depth it is believed that this result can be used for referring and renewing the criterion and be provided for the information to areas that may be vulnerable for snow disasters 5 discussion 5 1 expansion of the estimation equation for the decreased snow depth snowpack ablation occurs in the form of not only melting but also sublimation the contribution of sublimation to total ablation is affected by the meteorological and geographical characteristics of the site among which altitude is a major factor at an area with 2000 m of altitude or higher sublimation can contribute more than 20 of the total ablation fayad et al 2017 therefore it is very important to consider sublimation in snow ablation process especially if the area of interest has high altitude in this view the primary reason why this study accurately estimated snow depth while not considered sublimation is because the area has low altitude maximum and mean altitude of 842 m and 229 m respectively to fix this issue introduction of a term in the snow melt equation equation 4 that explains the contribution of sublimation macdonell et al 2013 found that among many meteorological variables net shortwave radiation is highly correlated with sublimation with a correlation coefficient of 0 75 a sublimation term can be added based on this finding as equation 11 11 δ m s r x c s r n where c s is a sublimation parameter mm w m2 r n is net shortwave radiation w m2 6 conclusion observation and analysis of weather variables related to the snowfall are essential to mitigate heavy snow disasters that are becoming more and more intense with the climate change snow depth is the most fundamental variable among the various snow related variables and the snow depth data are used to estimate other snow related variables in many studies as such observation of the snow depth is very important and previous studies were primarily based on the observed snow depth data however a typical research based on the observational data may have problems due to the limitations with the observation itself such as ungauged areas or quality problems of observed data also using the observed data has limitations in that it may not accurately reflect the trend of snow depth for various climate scenarios for this reason it is necessary to design a method to simulate the snow depth for the various climate scenarios and through this long term trends in snow depth can be analyzed for this purpose a method for generating continuous snow depth time series was proposed in this study the procedure consists of 1 a snow depth estimation algorithm that simulates the increase and decrease of snow depth using precipitation temperature and relative humidity and 2 a stochastic weather generation model to simulate a synthetic time series that reproduces the statistical characteristics of the observed data the proposed procedure has been shown to accurately reproduce the standard statistical and extreme characteristics of the observed snow depth by simulating the snow depth with a combination of a few weather variables the essential achievement in this study is that it is the first trial to simulate a continuous snow depth time series with a stochastic approach and also first to simulate synthetic snow depth using a weather generation model note that the model of this study was constructed for several observation points in korea in order to be more widely applied it is necessary to verify the model in other regions with various snowfall and melting characteristics this will enable regionalization of model parameters kim et al 2013a kim et al 2016 liel et al 2017 which will improve usability in ungauged regions we intend to address these topics through future research credit authorship contribution statement jeongha park

2500,we propose a stochastic approach for simulation of realistic continuous snow depth time series using a snow depth estimation model and a stochastic weather generation model the snow depth estimation model consists of three steps defining the precipitation type estimating the snow ratio and estimating the decreased snow depth first air temperature and relative humidity are used as indices to determine the type of precipitation when precipitation occurs when the type is identified as snow the snow ratio is estimated converting the precipitation depth into depth of fresh snow here the snow ratio is estimated through sigmoidal relationship with the air temperature lastly the amount of decreased snow depth was estimated using a novel temperature index snowmelt equation that can consider depth dependent melting of snowpack the model was applied to four meteorological stations of korea and yielded high nash sutcliffe efficiency values which ranged between 0 745 and 0 875 for calibration and ranged between 0 432 and 0 753 for validation this calibrated snow depth estimation model was then applied to synthetic weather data precipitation temperature and relative humidity that was generated by stochastic weather generation model to simulate continuous snow depth time series the simulated snow depth data accurately reproduced standard and extreme value statistics of the observed data the latter of which were consistent with the current korean building code this model can be widely used not only in the field of snow related risk analysis but also in data simulation for ungauged areas and future trend study using the climate projection keywords snow depth maximum snow depth weather generation stochastic snow model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction extreme snow events are detrimental to human society excessively accumulated snow causes structural geis et al 2012 and functional world meteorological organization wmo 2021 failure of important infrastructures of which impact proliferates towards the various economic sectors of a country and the globe for example unprecedented severe winter storm of 2021 texas exacerbated the global chip shortage bbc news 2021 and the subsequent slowdown of manufacturing industry that was initiated by the covid19 the great 2008 chinese storm zhou et al 2011 caused the full or partial collapse of 2 2 million houses which costed 129 casualties and 1 7 displaced populations the direct and indirect economic damages of both events were assessed to be 300 asce 2022 and 20 billion usd zhou et al 2011 respectively accumulation and melting of snow also pose significant impact on daily lives of millions of people by adding great variability water resources barnett et al 2005 and causing floods yan et al 2018 li et al 2019 yan et al 2020 cho and jacobs 2020 some studies argue that the extreme snow events are associated with the global warming liu et al 2012 cohen et al 2014 so their adverse impact is likely to increase in the future therefore measures should be taken to prepare for the extreme snow events and the subsequent disasters of which fundamental step should be accurate prediction of temporal behavior of snowpacks for this observation and analysis of weather variables related to snowfall are essential representative weather variables for the analysis include snow depth snow water equivalent and snow load data of these data for snow water equivalent and snow load have traditionally been observed less than snow depth data because it requires much more time and cost ntokas et al 2021 for this reason the snow water equivalent and snow load have often been estimated by multiplying the relatively well observed snow depth and the estimated snow density jonas et al 2009 sturm et al 2010 however compared to other meteorological data such as precipitation temperature and wind speed the snow depth is observed less frequently https web kma go kr eng biz observation 02 jsp if there is no observed snow depth data simulation methods can be considered for estimation of snow depth the snow depth can be estimated from the existing snow depth fresh snow depth and decreased depth accounting for the melted snow the simulation method is divided into two different categories physics based and statistical method a physics based model simulates snow depth by expressing snow processes such as thermal diffusion phase change and metamorphism in the snowpack in terms of the physics based equations le roux et al 2020 while physics models have a firm scientific basis they are based on many assumptions conceptualizing complex physical processes of snow accumulation and melting e g tuzet et al 2017 which entails accumulation of uncertainties as simulation progresses over time perona et al 2007 in addition they require various types of meteorological input data such as precipitation long shortwave radiation air temperature wind speed and humidity which is often difficult to obtain a stochastic method is based on a statistical relationship between snow depth and various weather variables lee et al 2019 and has advantage of simulating the snow depth with relatively few input data and low computational cost lee et al 2020 developed a markov chain model that defined a transition probability from current snow depth cluster to another to establish a heavy snowfall alarm model this model can only predict increasing snow depth over time and it accurately predicted the time series in seoul r2 0 957 adib et al 2021 using the wavelet transformation resolved snow depth time series into linear and nonlinear components and simulated those components with an arima model and a neuro fuzzy model respectively to predict the snow depth woody et al 2009 predicted the one day ahead snow depth using a storage model assuming the seasonal mean component as a periodic function lee et al 2019 predicted the daily maximum fresh snow depth by an artificial neural network model using the observed daily precipitation average temperature and minimum temperature as input parameters for the model as mentioned above most studies related to the snow depth simulation focus on either short term forecasting woody et al 2020 or simulation of the fresh snow depth kim et al 2014 park et al 2014 research regarding the simulation of a continuous snow depth time series is rare because it is difficult to simulate not only the fresh snow depth but also the existing snow depth and the decreased snow depth simultaneously perona et al 2007 assumed a poisson based stochastic accumulation process and a deterministic linear decay process by dividing the snow period into the accumulation and decay periods to simulate the snow depth change yin et al 2011 simulated the snow load for three observation sites in the united states using the filtered poisson process model assuming the frequency amplitude duration and total event period of the snow load as poisson and lognormal probability distributions as a result of this study empirical cumulative probability function of the daily snow load and the annual maximum snow load was simulated similarly to the observed values however it inherently includes uncertainty from not actually measuring the snow load value but rather using the estimation from snow water equivalent croce et al 2018a b classified seven categories of weather conditions that induce snow load change fitted the relationship between daily maximum minimum temperature and precipitation with a conditional probability function for each classification and simulated snow load time series by generating random numbers at each time step however there are limitations in this approach because it does not validate the results with observations and cannot consider various combinations of weather variables as input parameters in this study we propose new stochastic approach to simulate the continuous snow depth time series the process can be summarized in three major steps as follows 1 snow depth estimation algorithm that simulates the occurrence accumulation and decreased snow depth 2 validation with the observed snow depth from the validation period and 3 synthetic weather variable simulation using a stochastic weather generation model for the final simulation of the synthetic snow depth time series this study is distinct from previous studies in that it was designed to use minimum number of weather variables temperature precipitation relative humidity to increase the applicability of the model the performance of the model can be evaluated intuitively by directly comparing it with the observed snow depth data and a stochastic weather generation model is introduced to accurately reproduce statistical characteristics of the observed weather variables allowing combination of various weather variables to be considered and enabling monte carlo based risk analysis this approach also can be applied to the climate change studies and be used to simulate synthetic data for ungauged areas rest of this paper is organized as follows the study sites and weather data are described in section 2 the methodology about the snow depth estimation algorithm validation and stochastic weather generation model is described in section 3 the results from the model validation as well as the simulated snow depth data corresponding to the synthetic input weather data are presented in section 4 section 5 discusses the expansion of the equation for the decreased snow depth and ending with conclusions of the research in section 6 2 study site and meteorological data there are seven synoptic weather stations with maximum snow depth records greater than 100 cm in republic of korea fig 1 all stations except ulleungdo 115 station are in the far east mountainous region or yeongdong region in this region as the cold and dry air from the asian continent passes through the east sea heat and moisture are supplied from the relatively warm seawater resulting in unstable lower boundary layer heavy snowfall events occur when this unstable air is blown by the northeast air current into the yeongdong region with highly complex mountainous topography lee and lee 1994 station information is described in table 1 the maximum of the daily maximum snow depth observed at each station ranged from 293 6 to 102 9 cm while the starting time of observation differs by the stations the time resolution for the observation was uniformly improved to 3 h since 1982 among seven stations bukgangneung 104 and samcheok 214 were excluded for application because of the short observation periods for bukgangeung 12 years and the absence of hourly snow depth observation for samcheok because there was no solar radiation observation in sokcho 90 and donghae 106 solar radiation data from gangneung 105 was used lastly ulleungdo 115 was excluded because of the lack of solar radiation observation data which could not be inferred either because there is no nearby station the weather data hourly temperature precipitation relative humidity snow depth and 3 hour fresh snow depth in the winter period were used to calibrate and validate the model in section 3 4 and section 4 1 3 methodology a flowchart showing the overall picture of the proposed methodology is shown in fig 2 the process of simulating synthetic snow depth time series consists of three general steps as follows 1 calibration of the snow depth estimation algorithm i e 1st 3rd steps in fig 2 2 validation of this algorithm i e 4th step and 3 simulation of a synthetic weather variable time series through the weather generation model i e 5th step afterward a synthetic snow depth time series is simulated by applying a snow depth estimation algorithm to the simulated synthetic weather time series from the previous steps i e 6th step the snow depth estimation algorithm calibration and validation of the model and weather generation model were explained in sections 3 1 3 2 and 3 3 respectively 3 1 snow depth estimation algorithm to estimate the total change of a snow depth gain and loss of snow need to be simulated first to estimate the increase in snow depth i e gain it is necessary to identify the precipitation type such as rain snow and sleet when winter precipitation occurs if the type of precipitation is identified as snow the snow ratio sr which is the ratio of the depth of snowfall to the depth of precipitation as shown in equation 1 is estimated the increase in snow depth is estimated by multiplying the estimated sr by the depth of precipitation korea meteorological adaministration kma 2011 the amount of decreased snow depth i e loss can be estimated by simulating the melting of the accumulated snow and the changes in its shape 1 s r s n o w f a l l d e p t h m m p r e c i p i t a t i o n d e p t h m m 3 1 1 discrimination of precipitation type to determine the type of precipitation on the ground matsuo et al 1981 derived a relationship between type of precipitation and surface meteorological data from the observation data of wajima matsumoto and nikko stations in japan temperature and relative humidity were suggested as the meteorological variables for determining the precipitation type and the critical relative humidity at which snow occurs was proposed as a linear function of temperature the kma adopted this concept and proposed a shifted matsuo scheme lee et al 2014 korea meteorological adaministration kma 2011 to fit the korean meteorological data the kma then presented five conditions for the additional discrimination of precipitation types listed in table 2 used for the snow forecasts in this study the type of precipitation was determined based on this criterion to evaluate its performance using the test weather stations data subsection 3 4 1 3 1 2 estimation of the snow ratio in general in order to estimate snow depth a process of converting the predicted or observed precipitation depth into the snow depth is required for this the sr from equation 1 is applied which can vary from 3 to 100 depending on the weather conditions roebber et al 2003 in korea meteorological adaministration kma 2011 four conditions according to the temperature reference on the ground below or above 0 c and the temperature reference at 850 hpa below or above 8 c were considered to estimate the sr then the relationship between precipitation and sr at each condition was analyzed using the observation data this classification method is based on observation that 1 precipitation occurs and evolves at an altitude of 850 hpa or higher 2 a large amount of supercooled water exist in the humid air below 10 c and 3 the size of the snow may increase due to this supercooled water hindman and johnson 1972 pruppacher 1995 the above method provided a satisfactory prediction performance with a correlation coefficient of 0 86 for all cases however meteorological variables such as temperature at an altitude of 850 hpa are not suitable for use in this study because upper air observations are required which are difficult to acquire and those data cannot be simulated with stochastic weather generation models in addition studies using artificial neural networks to estimate the sr roebber et al 2003 also required upper air observation data meanwhile lee et al 2005 proposed a model to estimate the sr by expressing sr as a function of surface air temperature by adopting a sigmoidal nonlinear regression equation ratkowsky 1990 as shown in equation 2 2 s r a 1 e x p t b c where a b c are parameters of the sigmoid function as a result of prediction using this model a correlation coefficient of 0 55 was recorded in 17 cases of snow events although this result is less accurate than the method using upper air observation data the alternative use of the regression model is reasonable because the purpose of this study is to analyze the trend of long term snow depth using available weather data not to develop an accurate short term forecast model accordingly the regression model equation 2 was chosen to estimate the snow ratio 3 1 3 estimation of the decreased snow depth the amount of decreased snow depth can be simulated with a physics based model that considers the temperature distribution inside the snowpack interaction between snow layers and other various external weather conditions such as temperature radiation and humidity however the amount of decreased snow depth is rarely simulated by statistical or empirical method alone and for this reason previous studies on the simulation of snow depth other than the physics based model focused on estimating the fresh snow depth or probable maximum snow depth croce et al 2018a b simulated the amount of snow load reduction by assuming it is proportional to the daily maximum temperature on the other hand many studies have been conducted to estimate the snowmelt which is the depth of the water resulting from melting of snow rather than the decrease in snow depth because snowmelt accounts for significant portion of the water resources in snowmelt dominated region barnett et al 2005 and contributes to flood yan et al 2018 li et al 2019 yan et al 2020 cho and jacobs 2020 snowmelt estimation methods are in general divided into an energy balance method and a temperature index method the energy balance method is a method of calculating the energy flux in the snowpack by considering all terms of the energy balance equation resulting the method to be very accurate but data intensive and may not be applicable depending on the station nrcs 2004 on the other hand the temperature index method uses only temperature data to estimate the snowmelt as shown in equation 3 3 m c m t t b where m is snowmelt mm day cm is degree day coefficient mm degree day c t is mean daily air temperature c and tb is base temperature c despite this simplification the temperature index method shows good performance because the temperature variable itself shows high correlation with various energy balance factors often showing even better performance than the energy balance method at a watershed scale hock 2003 in this study the amount of decreased snow depth is simulated by the temperature index method with couple of assumptions first assumption is that the sr of the snowpack does not change over time and keeps its value when snow occurs second is that snow melting occurs sequentially from the upper layer of snow using these assumptions the parameters of the snowmelt formula can be calibrated and the snowmelt depth simulated by the formula can be converted into the decreased snow depth the details are described in the next section section 3 2 3 2 model calibration and validation the observed snowmelt data are needed to calibrate the parameters of the snowmelt formula because only few stations measure snowmelt and this study site is no exception however we used decreased snow depth due to snowmelt for calibration of the parameters this was done by applying the decreased snow depth to the observed increasing snow depth time series here the observed increasing snow depth time series means a time series in which the amount of snow depth decrease is removed from the observed snow depth time series i e the time series only accumulating the fresh snow depth over time without accounting for the loss for example when n fresh snowfalls occur without considering the melting of the snow a snowpack profile will be formed as shown in fig 3 weather variables available include 3 hour fresh snow depth precipitation snow depth and temperature the observed sr can be obtained by dividing 3 hour fresh snow depth by the precipitation depth then the decreased snow depth δ can be expressed as a function of snowmelt and sr equation 4 4 δ m s r x where δ is decreased snow depth mm and s r x is snow ratio of xth snow layer top layer by subtracting this term from the observed increasing snow depth time series a simulated snow depth time series can be made however since changes in snow density during snow processes such as compaction and refreezing cannot be considered it was assumed that the sr value does not change over time in addition since sr values of the snow layers are different and temperature distribution in snowpack is not provided it was assumed that the snowmelt occurs sequentially from the upper layer of snow in equation 3 the degree day coefficient cm and the base temperature tb are parameters and optimal parameters that best simulates the observed snow depth time series can be obtained through parameter optimization the parameters were optimized to maximize the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse equation 5 of the simulated snow depth using the particle swarm optimization method cho et al 2011 5 n s e 1 t 1 t h s t m h s t o 2 t 1 t h s t o h s 2 where h s t m and h s t o are respectively simulated and observed snow depth at t time step and h s is mean observed snow depth because the 4 test stations have different length of observation half of available data at each station were used for the calibration and the remaining data were used for the validation table 3 during the validation period discrimination of the precipitation type estimation of the sr and estimation of the decreased snow depth algorithms were all applied and the algorithm performance was evaluated by simulating the time series of snow depth only with the observed precipitation temperature and relative humidity equations 7 and 8 show expressions used to simulate the snow depth 7 h s i h s i 1 h f s i δ i h s i 1 h f s i δ i 0 h s i 1 h f

depth mm and subscript i means time step 3 3 weather generation model after calibration of the snow estimation algorithm synthetic weather time series data was required for simulation of the synthetic snow depth time series a weather generation model which simulates synthetic weather data that reproduces the statistical characteristics of observed weather data is extensively used in many fields such as crop productivity priya and shibasaki 2001 supit et al 2012 flood risk analysis kim et al 2013b park et al 2015 kim et al 2017 park et al 2021 dao et al 2021 climate change de luca et al 2020 thorndahl and andersen 2021 rainfall disaggregation koutsoyiannis and onof 2001 and water resource management fowler et al 2000 faramarzi et al 2009 weather generation models have been developed for the past few decades and are classified into three types fatichi et al 2011 first type is a model that simulates a daily or annual time series using an empirical statistical method statistical characteristics and autocorrelation of the observed weather variables are directly inferred e g markov chain model second is a physics based weather forecast model which simulates weather data by solving nonlinear partial differential equations that express weather dynamics third is a mechanistic model designed to explain various meteorological physics processes such as cells and clusters of rainfall and temperature dependence on long wave radiation in this study last stochastic model was selected as the weather generation model to simulate the synthetic snow depth data through long term meteorological variable simulation using the hourly observation data the model by kim and onof 2020 was chosen for precipitation simulation and the awe gen model fatichi et al 2011 were selected for the weather variables simulation because they reproduce not only standard statistical characteristics but also extreme characteristics of the observed data 3 3 1 simulation of the precipitation the kim and onof 2020 model was used to simulate the precipitation the basic structure of the model is the poisson cluster rainfall generation model onof and wang 2020 chen et al 2021 which assumes the storms including rain cells arrive following the poisson process in addition to the arrival of the storms the duration of the storm as well as the arrival duration and intensity of the rain cell are defined using different probability distribution functions with 5 to 8 parameters depending on the type of probability distribution unlike the traditional poisson cluster rainfall model this rainfall model can accurately reproduce the extreme characteristics this is because 1 the chosen model is based on a mathematical structure that can reproduce the first to third order statistical characteristics of the observation data 2 it considers the inverse relationship between rain cell duration and intensity enabling the reproduction of short term concentrated rainfall events 3 it adopted gamma distribution to simulate the intensity of the rain cell and 4 it has two additional modules to consider autocorrelation structure of rainstorms and monthly rainfall for this reason the kim and onof 2020 model shows improved performance in reproducing the extreme values as well as various statistical characteristics of the observed rainfall over a wide range of time scales compared to traditional models the model parameters were calibrated using precipitation data for each test station 3 3 2 simulation of the weather variables the snow depth estimation algorithm requires temperature and relative humidity as weather variables in addition to the precipitation advanced weather genarator awe gen fatichi et al 2011 was used to simulate these variables the awe gen model which is an improved version of the model by ivanov et al 2007 simulates weather variables through a physics stochastic approach some of the improvements by the awe gen include capabilities in 1 simulating vapor pressure instead of dew point temperature 2 simulating diurnal cycle of wind speed 3 simulating shortwave radiation including the concept of photosynthetic active radiation and 4 reproducing the temporal variability of atmospheric pressure the awe gen model was validated for 10 stations in the united states and italy with various climates and was found to well reproduce the extreme values and interannual variability in addition to the standard statistics of the observed weather data in this study a 200 year synthetic weather time series was simulated using the kim and onof 2020 model and the awe gen model note that the rainfall generation module of the awe gen was first replaced with that of kim and onof 2020 and then the awe gen was run to acquire all weather variables through this approach the unidirectional dependence structure between the weather variables that was explicitly considered by the awe gen can be secured in the synthetically generated weather variables while also keeping the auto correlative structure of the synthetic rainfall that kim and onof 2020 secures three variables precipitation temperature and relative humidity were utilized for the synthetic snow depth simulation 3 4 calibration and validation of the snow depth estimation algorithm 3 4 1 validation of the precipitation type discrimination method to validate the criteria for discriminating the precipitation type presented in section 3 1 1 a confusion matrix was generated using the winter observation data january february march november and december for the entire periods including both the calibration and validation period the matrix for sokcho 90 was presented in table 4 in the actual class when a 3 hour fresh snow depth is greater than 0 cm it was counted an occurrence of snow in the predictive class 3 types snow accumulation snow sleet snow dominant were considered as the occurrences of snow among the 5 types listed in table 2 as a result of this analysis the specificity of the predictive model was 0 805 959 959 232 and the sensitivity was 0 998 132 815 298 132 815 to analyze the events that actually affect the increase in snow depth same analysis approach was applied to the events except for the snow events with fresh snow depth greater than 0 cm and lower than 1 cm as a result of the second analysis the specificity increased to 0 868 574 574 87 as shown in table 4 sensitivity and specificity at the test stations were summarized in table 5 these results show that it is possible to apply the discrimination method of precipitation type to the test stations some of which were not validated in the previous study lee et al 2014 3 4 2 fitting the sr estimation function lee et al 2005 expressed the sr as a sigmoid function equation 2 of surface air temperature a decreasing tendency of the sr with increase in precipitation rate was found in that study and they fitted two sigmoid functions according to general and heavy snow events here a general snow event represents an event with 3 hour precipitation of 1 mm or more and less than 5 mm and a heavy snow event represents an event with 3 hour precipitation of 5 mm or more two sigmoid functions for these two events were fitted to the winter data at the test stations the observed sr data were obtained by dividing the 3 hour fresh snow depth by the 3 hour precipitation and the 3 hour average temperature was used as the surface air temperature a graphical result of fitting the sr estimation function for sokcho 90 is presented in fig 4 and all fitting results at the test stations are summarized in table 6 as a result of fitting the functions coefficients of determination ranged from 0 08 to 0 68 according to the precipitation rate although using these results may not be suitable for the short term forecast with accurate numerical prediction effect caused by the sr estimation error on simulating the long term trend of snow depth is relatively small nonetheless it is necessary to simulate the low frequency extreme events in a long term trend so the error term ε of the sr estimation function was introduced to account for the uncertainty of the sr estimation as shown in equation 9 9 s r a 1 e x p t b c ε to generate the error term ε we first found the optimal distribution of the errors which is the difference between the observed and estimated values in the sr estimation equation three theoretical distributions normal logistic and 3 parameter student t distribution were tested for goodness of fit considering the negative samples to test the goodness of fit for the theoretical distributions the optimal parameters were obtained by the maximum likelihood method and the kolmogorov smirnov ks test was performed null hypothesis in a ks test is that samples are extracted from the theoretical probability distribution and if the null hypothesis is rejected h 1 it is considered that the samples are not from the theoretical probability distribution table 7 shows the test results with a significance level of 5 the distribution with the largest test statistic was selected as an optimal distribution the result of parameter fit is shown in table 8 and the comparison figure between histogram of the relative frequency of error and selected probability distribution for sokcho is shown in fig 5 using this distribution random errors were added when estimating the sr 3 4 3 calibration of the snowmelt formula for the calibration of the snowmelt formula equation 3 general range of the degree day coefficient cm presented in nrcs 2004 was used as upper and lower limits of the parameter optimization 1 6 to 6 0 mm degree day c to consider the uncertainty of the algorithm the lower limit was set to 1 10 times and the upper limit was set to 10 times from the limit of general range and limits were divided by 24 to apply to the hourly data limits of the base temperature tb was set to 5 and 5 c to consider the factors affecting the snowmelt in addition to temperature e g net radiation kustas et al 1994 as a result of this calibration for sokcho the nse of the simulated snow depth for the calibration period was 0 4351 indicating relatively low performance this can be attributed to the assumptions of the snow depth estimation algorithm in the snow depth estimation algorithm it is assumed that there is no change in the sr i e change in snow density over time however in reality the density of snow is changed by snow processes such as compaction water percolation and refreezing in the process of becoming old snow from fresh snow vionnet et al 2012 the density of accumulated snow mostly increases over time lee and chung 2018 jo et al 2020 eurocode en 1991 1 3 sanpaolesi et al 1998 classified fresh settled and old snow according to the passed time from occurrence of snow assigning larger density of snow to the older accumulated snow the observed and simulated snow depth time series in 1996 are shown in fig 6 a as shown in the figure the observed snow depth showed a large rate of decrease in the early stage after the occurrence of snow but the magnitude of decreasing rate gradually became small over time however in case of the simulated snow depth contrary to observation the magnitude of the rate of decrease was small at the beginning of the snow occurrence and then increased over time to increase the accuracy of the simulation the effect of snow depth from the previous time step on the snowmelt was analyzed although the snow depth is not an absolute indicator of the aging of the accumulated snow we assumed that snowpack with small snow depth is older than that with large snow depth the basis for this assumption is that small snow depth is always placed in time later than large snow depth in the melting process and snowmelt is not generally dominant in the accumulation process for three classifications of snow depth i e greater than 0 and less than 25 greater than 25 and less than 50 greater than 50 and less than 90 cm the relationships between temperature and the amount of decrease in snow depth were found for the events when the snow depth decreased during the calibration period as shown in fig 7 in fig 7 the regression line slope means the trend of the decrease in snow depth according to temperature while large uncertainties reside in the relationship the regression lines of the plots reveal that more snow tends to melt for thicker snowpack this snowmelt was expressed as an exponential function resulting in modified formula presented in equation 10 10 δ t h s m s r x e a h s c m t t b s r x e a h s where a cm 1 is a correction parameter according to the hs there are three parameters cm tb and a and the nse of the snow depth prediction for sokcho was 0 8671 as a result of optimization of the parameters results of the parameter calibration for the test stations are presented in table 9 and the improved simulation results for sokcho are shown in fig 6b 4 result 4 1 validation of the snow depth estimation algorithm the snow depth estimation algorithm was validated using the data from the validation period the snow depth was simulated using only temperature precipitation and relative humidity data during the validation period and the result showed nse of the simulated snow depth ranging from 0 4322 to 0 7528 table 9 when the sr perturbation term is considered since the nse value changes at every simulation the median values of nse from 100 simulations were used to evaluate the model resulting in similar result with the model which does not consider the sr perturbation term fig 8 a and 8b show the simulated results of the snow depth for sokcho in the winter of 2010 and 2014 in fig 8a and b it can be confirmed that the simulated results accounting for occurrence accumulation and decrease of snow depth explaining the process of changing the snow depth proceeds similarly to the observed data in addition the snow depth estimation algorithm has to reproduce the extreme value of the snow depth fig 8c shows comparison of yearly maximum snow depth between the observed and the simulated snow depth here the yearly maximum snow depth is the maximum snow depth that occurred during the winter of a given year i e the yearly maximum snow depth in year 2000 means the maximum snow depth during a study period from november 2000 to march 2001 the regression results of fig 8c for the other test stations were summarized in table 10 the time series simulated by the snow depth estimation algorithm was found to reproduce the observed extreme values well 4 2 the weather generation model figs 9 and 10 show the results of generating a 200 year synthetic weather variable time series using the data observed from sokcho station in the case of precipitation the first to the third moment of precipitation are accurately reproduced for the hourly units as shown in fig 9 as the figure shows variability of precipitation on a large time scale up to 5 months is also well reproduced fig 10 shows the monthly average statistics of the synthetic and observed temperature and relative humidity it is shown that the hourly to daily statistics of the weather variables are well reproduced particularly for the winter season january february march november and december results of weather generation for other test stations also showed good agreement with observed statistics and were not presented in this paper 4 3 simulation of the synthetic snow depth time series fig 11 shows simulated results of the synthetic snow depth time series using the snow depth estimation algorithm and the time series of the 200 year synthetic weather variables at the sokcho station the synthetic snow depth time series simulated well not only for the year with very shallow snow but also for the year with snow depth of larger than 123 8 cm which was the maximum snow depth observed the mean and standard deviation of the snow depth time series and yearly average number of snow days are listed in table 11 to compare the statistics of the observed and simulated snow depth time series to consider uncertainty residing in the snow ratio this study simulated 100 sets of 200 year synthetic snow depth while perturbing the snow ratio using the distribution shown in fig 5 in case of the model with sr perturbation term since it is difficult to obtain meaningful comparison when periods with no snow i e period of zero snow depth are included in the statistical calculation due to a large number of zero values the mean and standard deviation were calculated for the observed and simulated time series with a snow depth of 1 cm or more the mean and standard deviation of the simulated snow depth time series had relative errors ranging from 3 0 to 63 4 percentage and from 2 2 to 32 7 percentage respectively the errors were particularly greater in gangneung and donghae station the errors for mean and standard deviation were 63 4 and 32 7 in gangneung and 5 9 and 26 7 in donghae these two stations have shorter calibration period table 3 compared to the other stations because of the short available observation period not long enough period of the calibration data can lead to poor model calibration and these two stations showed low model efficiency in validation period table 9 the model with the low model efficiency led to the great error in these two stations on the other hand average relative errors for the other 2 stations were 5 7 for mean and 6 0 for standard deviation indicating that the observed statistics were well reproduced the yearly average number of snowy days days with freshly fallen snow depth of 1 cm or more were calculated the mean error between observed and simulated time series was 2 7 days the error was great at the station with more snowy days a year daegwallyeong station has more than 20 snowy days a year and it includes many types of snow with different characteristics this led to great uncertainty in estimating sr for the station table 6 the uncertainty in sr estimation causes error in estimating snowy days only days with fhs 1 cm are counted reducing the uncertainty in estimating sr is a challenge to be addressed to improve the model fig 12 shows the comparison of yearly maximum snow depth from the simulated and observed snow depth time series with x axis scaled with a gumbel reduced variate the yearly maximum snow depths for the return period from 2 years to 40 years were well reproduced in the simulated snow depth time series the green shades shown in the fig 12 are the 90 prediction interval note that the uncertainty of the snow depth shown here is not from procedure of curve fitting of annual maximum snow values e g debock et al 2017 liel et al 2017 but from the modeling of physical process of snow accumulation which may provide a fresh insight on design snow load estimation procedures finally the simulated data were compared with the design snow load map of korea shin et al 2016 that is currently applied in the korean building code kbc2016 aik 2016 in this code the design snow load is determined by multiplying the predetermined specific weight of snow table 12 to the 100 year snow depth that is estimated from the frequency analysis based on the annual maximum snow depth the yearly maximum snow depths with 100 years of return period at the test stations were shown in fig 12 the yearly maximum snow depths estimated from the model in this study were greater than kbc2016 at all test stations even considering uncertainty of sr estimation green shade design snow loads table 13 also showed even more larger difference due to the increasing unit weight of snow depending on snow depth it is believed that this result can be used for referring and renewing the criterion and be provided for the information to areas that may be vulnerable for snow disasters 5 discussion 5 1 expansion of the estimation equation for the decreased snow depth snowpack ablation occurs in the form of not only melting but also sublimation the contribution of sublimation to total ablation is affected by the meteorological and geographical characteristics of the site among which altitude is a major factor at an area with 2000 m of altitude or higher sublimation can contribute more than 20 of the total ablation fayad et al 2017 therefore it is very important to consider sublimation in snow ablation process especially if the area of interest has high altitude in this view the primary reason why this study accurately estimated snow depth while not considered sublimation is because the area has low altitude maximum and mean altitude of 842 m and 229 m respectively to fix this issue introduction of a term in the snow melt equation equation 4 that explains the contribution of sublimation macdonell et al 2013 found that among many meteorological variables net shortwave radiation is highly correlated with sublimation with a correlation coefficient of 0 75 a sublimation term can be added based on this finding as equation 11 11 δ m s r x c s r n where c s is a sublimation parameter mm w m2 r n is net shortwave radiation w m2 6 conclusion observation and analysis of weather variables related to the snowfall are essential to mitigate heavy snow disasters that are becoming more and more intense with the climate change snow depth is the most fundamental variable among the various snow related variables and the snow depth data are used to estimate other snow related variables in many studies as such observation of the snow depth is very important and previous studies were primarily based on the observed snow depth data however a typical research based on the observational data may have problems due to the limitations with the observation itself such as ungauged areas or quality problems of observed data also using the observed data has limitations in that it may not accurately reflect the trend of snow depth for various climate scenarios for this reason it is necessary to design a method to simulate the snow depth for the various climate scenarios and through this long term trends in snow depth can be analyzed for this purpose a method for generating continuous snow depth time series was proposed in this study the procedure consists of 1 a snow depth estimation algorithm that simulates the increase and decrease of snow depth using precipitation temperature and relative humidity and 2 a stochastic weather generation model to simulate a synthetic time series that reproduces the statistical characteristics of the observed data the proposed procedure has been shown to accurately reproduce the standard statistical and extreme characteristics of the observed snow depth by simulating the snow depth with a combination of a few weather variables the essential achievement in this study is that it is the first trial to simulate a continuous snow depth time series with a stochastic approach and also first to simulate synthetic snow depth using a weather generation model note that the model of this study was constructed for several observation points in korea in order to be more widely applied it is necessary to verify the model in other regions with various snowfall and melting characteristics this will enable regionalization of model parameters kim et al 2013a kim et al 2016 liel et al 2017 which will improve usability in ungauged regions we intend to address these topics through future research credit authorship contribution statement jeongha park

2501,rainfall partitioning into stemflow throughfall and interception loss by vegetation alters hydrological and biogeochemical fluxes between vegetation and soil here we compiled a comprehensive dataset of rainfall partitioning by forests shrublands croplands and grasslands in china from 287 peer reviewed papers 71 in english and 216 in chinese based on this dataset we summarized the best fit functions reported for rainfall partitioning in both mm and as a function of rainfall amount as well as the rainfall thresholds for throughfall and stemflow initiation we explored the pattern of the proportions of stemflow throughfall and interception loss of vegetation in china and performed boosted regression trees brt analysis to model the relative effects of cross site biotic and abiotic predictors on each of the rainfall partitioning fluxes our results identified the scarcity of rainfall partitioning data particularly for grasslands a substantial variability of each rainfall partitioning flux mm could be explained solely by rainfall amount with median r2 values of 0 91 0 99 and 0 82 for stemflow throughfall and interception loss respectively and with linear functions most often reported as the best fit functions significant differences p 0 0001 were detected in rainfall thresholds for initiating stemflow median 3 3 mm interquartile range iqr 1 8 5 4 mm and throughfall median 1 2 mm iqr 0 8 2 2 mm stemflow had a median iqr of 2 7 1 2 6 0 and that value was 74 3 66 7 80 3 for throughfall and 21 6 16 3 28 5 for interception loss respectively significant differences were detected in the proportion of stemflow p 0 001 and throughfall p 0 01 between forests and shrublands respectively whereas no significant differences in the proportion of interception loss were found among vegetation types brt analysis indicated that of the eleven biotic and abiotic predictors examined six were classified as significant predictors in determining stemflow and interception loss respectively whereas throughfall had four significant predictors non linear partial effects of predictors on rainfall partitioning fluxes were prevalent this study avails a global readership to the findings of a large cache of chinese studies that have been inaccessible hitherto providing a mechanistic understanding of the effects of cross site biotic and abiotic predictors on rainfall partitioning fluxes keywords interception loss throughfall stemflow biotic and abiotic predictors boosted regression trees 1 introduction in vegetated ecosystems the incident rainfall is partitioned

at the field plot scale and focused on individual plant species or mixed species at specific sites these studies have greatly improved our understanding of the fine or local scale of rainfall partitioning processes and the associated influencing factors and of their role in ecohydrological and biogeochemical cycles in various ecosystems several narrative reviews have critically evaluated the advancement in the realm of rainfall partitioning by vegetation with detailed information and comprehensive insights see e g crockford and richardson 2000 levia and frost 2003 levia and germer

or global scales e g llorens and domingo 2007 magliano et al 2019 2022 yue et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 nevertheless reviews and syntheses are mostly concentrated on publications in english leaving a large cache of data published in other languages untapped in addition the relative importance of biotic and abiotic factors and their effects on fluxes of rainfall partitioning are less explored limiting our understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving rainfall partitioning in regional or global contexts china 9 6 million km2 has a vast territory with variable climatic and topographic conditions forming an array of diverse ecosystems there has been a drastic increase in rainfall partitioning studies conducted in china especially over the past two decades supplementary fig s1 and the majority of those have been published in chinese and are therefore largely inaccessible to international readers a quantitative synthesis of the existing rainfall partitioning studies in china is critical for holistically assessing the water balance of vegetated ecosystems within china and identifying any under studied ecosystems in need of future research here employing the most relevant and available physically based predictors we provide a comprehensive dataset of rainfall partitioning by differing vegetation types forest shrubland cropland and grassland of china by synthesizing 287 peer reviewed papers 71 papers in english and 216 in chinese published between 1984 and 2021 based on this dataset we quantitatively describe 1 the general characteristics of rainfall partitioning in terms of the field measurements 2 the best fit functions reported for rainfall partitioning as a function of rainfall amount and the rainfall thresholds for initiating stemflow and throughfall 3 the patterns of relative proportions of stemflow throughfall and interception loss to the gross rainfall across vegetation types and further 4 the relative influence of cross site biotic and abiotic

effects of physically based predictors on rainfall partitioning fluxes 2 methods 2 1 data compilation to provide a quantitative synthesis of rainfall partitioning by vegetation throughout china and of how the relevant biotic and abiotic factors affect the proportions of stemflow throughfall and interception loss we searched for all peer reviewed papers published before 2021 inclusive using web of science and china national knowledge infrastructure https oversea cnki net the terms used here were as follows stemflow or stem flow or throughfall or rainfall interception or rainfall partitioning or precipitation interception or precipitation partitioning or rainfall redistribution or precipitation redistribution this yielded a total of 5941 peer reviewed papers we then reviewed each paper to determine whether the studies met the following criteria a studies were exclusively conducted in china b data were exclusively obtained from field experiments data from models or simulations were not considered c the proportion s of stemflow throughfall and or interception loss was reported or could be calculated relative to the gross rainfall d when multiple papers were published on the same plant species community at the same study site the most long term study was chosen in total we identified 287 papers 71 in english and 216 in chinese that met our aforementioned requirements for data extraction a list of the papers could be found in the appendix s1 which were published between 1984 and 2021 supplementary fig s1 overall a total of 237 sites and 1310 observations 464 for stemflow 444 for throughfall and 402 for interception loss were selected in our synthesis fig 1 we extracted the data of rainfall partitioning the proportions of stemflow throughfall and interception loss and their influencing predictors see details in table 1 to assess how cross site biotic and abiotic predictors affect each of the rainfall partitioning fluxes those predictors were chosen based on their physical and ecohydrological relevance on rainfall partitioning including 1 mean annual precipitation map mm affects rainfall partitioning because the incident rainfall amount directly affects the amounts of each rainfall partitioning flux llorens and domingo 2007 magliano et al 2019 2 mean annual temperature mat partly influences rainfall partitioning fluxes by regulating rainfall temperature which governs the leaf wettability and water droplet retention for subsequent evaporation and drainage by influencing the contact angle of intercepted raindrops on leaf surfaces klamerus iwan and

keim et al 2006 nanko et al 2013 wang et al 2012 in addition we extracted the location longitude latitude the rainfall threshold for stemflow and throughfall initiation and the best fit functions for rainfall partitioning in both mm and as a function of rainfall amount for a comprehensive analysis of rainfall partitioning in china for map and mat that were not reported in original studies they were derived from the worldclim database http worldclim org using the location information latitude and longitude with a spatial resolution of 30 s 1 km2 when bark texture pfts and leaf type were not explicitly indicated in the original source article and also could not be found in other papers from the same study site and or authors the data were extracted from the chinese virtual herbarium https www cvh ac cn and national specimen information infrastructure http www nsii org cn 2 2 data analysis all statistical analyses were conducted using r version 4 2 0 r core team 2022 we compared the differences in rainfall partitioning fluxes and the differences in rainfall threshold for stemflow and throughfall initiation between vegetation types using a kruskal wallis rank sum test because those data were not normally distributed according to the shapiro wilk test p 0 05 the subsequent multiple comparisons were performed using dunn s test in the rstatix package kassambara 2021 differences were considered statistically significant at p 0 05 we used boosted regression trees brt to determine the effects of up to eleven predictor variables table 1 on the proportions of stemflow throughfall and interception loss respectively brt is an advanced regression technique which combines a large numbers of simple regression trees together whereby the model performance is improved by sequentially fitting each new tree to the residuals from the previous ones elith et al 2008 the brt approach offers some important advantages including dealing with many types of response variables loss functions and predictors capturing non linear relationships accommodating missing data by using surrogates and automatically identifying interaction effects between predictors de ath 2007 elith et al 2008 lange and sippel 2020 brt is also robust to collinearity and variable selection is achieved because the model largely ignores non informative predictors when fitting trees elith et al 2008 brt models were fitted with gaussian distribution using gbm step function of the r package dismo hijmans et al 2017 we used tenfold cross validation cv to tune model parameters and to assess model performance brt model building requires tuning of three parameters tree complexity tc which specifies the number of interactions that should be modelled learning rate lr which regulates the contribution of each new tree to the growing model and bag fraction bf which controls stochasticity by randomly selecting a specified subset of the data at each iteration elith et al 2008 we tested the following parameter settings tc 1 5 lr 0 05 0 01 0 005 0 001 and 0 0005 bf 0 5 0 55 0 6 0 65 0 7 and 0 75 resulting in 150 models for each response variable supplementary table s1 the optimal settings stemflow tc 5 lr 0 005 bf 0 70 throughfall tc 5 lr 0 01 bf 0 75 relative interception loss tc 5 lr 0 005 bf 0 75 with the lowest cv deviance squared error for the gaussian type while containing a minimum of 1000 trees were then selected to generate the final brt models supplementary table s1 the performance of all models was mainly assessed on the training data deviance explained and on predictions to test data cv deviance explained supplementary table s2 enabling us to evaluate our ability to explain observed data and predict hold out data respectively buston and elith 2011 model results reflect the relative influence ri of individual predictors which is estimated based on how often the predictor is selected for splitting weighted by the squared improvement to the model and averaged across all trees elith et al 2008 ri scores are scaled so that all considered predictors sum to 100 with higher values indicating stronger influence elith et al 2008 we considered only the predictors with a ri score above that expected by chance 100 number of predictors as significant jouffray et al 2019 muller et al 2013 for significant predictors we provide partial dependence plots pdps showing the partial effect on the predicted outcome for a given value of the predictor when the other predictors are kept constant the x axis shows the distribution of the data points and the pdps flatten in regions where there is no change or where there is no data available fitted lines represent the mean estimate and 95 confidence intervals based on 500 bootstrap replicates for improved interpretation the actual response plots were also smoothed using a smoothing spline we also used bootstrap resampling to test the null hypothesis of no interaction among explanatory predictors for each of 100 bootstraps we resampled the values of the proportions of stemflow throughfall and interception loss before re fitting a brt model and then recorded the size of the interactions to generate a distribution under the null hypothesis jouffray et al 2019 pinsky and byler 2015 statistical analyses and graphing except for fig 1a which was generated by qgis v3 22 were done within the r statistical framework mainly using the following packages cowplot wilke 2020 dismo hijmans et al 2017 ggbeeswarm clarke and sherrill mix 2017 ggbrt jouffray 2022 gghalves tiedemann

intervals being negligible fig 2b as to how the measurements were recorded manually versus automatically 90 and 88 of the observations were done manually for stemflow and throughfall respectively the remaining were measured automatically using equipment such as tipping bucket rain gauges fig 2c 3 2 fitted empirical functions and the rainfall thresholds for stemflow and throughfall initiation linear power polynominal poly logarithmic log and exponential exp functions were selected to fit rainfall partitioning fluxes in both mm and against rainfall depth fig 3 approximately one third of the observations did not report the fitted functions for stemflow depth mm and throughfall depth mm against rainfall depth mm and that value was more than one half for interception loss mm linear

interquartile range i e iqr of 0 85 0 93 for stemflow depth and median r2 of 0 99 and an iqr of 0 91 0 97 for throughfall depth respectively for interception loss mm against rainfall depth fig 3e

stemflow and interception loss had six significant predictors while throughfall had four significant predictors ri above what could be expected by chance alone dbh was the dominant predictor for stemflow with a ri of 24 4 followed by lai 14 1 map 11 4 stand height 11 4 bark texture 9 9 and mat 9 7 throughfall was best explained by mat 22 4 followed by dbh 17 7 map 15 7 and stand height 11 5 interception loss was best explained by mat 20 5 followed by map 17 2 dbh 16 8 stand density 13 3 stand height 11 9 and plant age 11 8 for each of the rainfall partitioning fluxes its response to the most influential predictors fig 6b 6c 6d and the three most strongest pairwise interactions supplementary fig s2 table 2 are described below for stemflow the brt model explained 53 7 of the deviance using training data which reflects how good the model is at explaining the observed data the model explained 13 7 of the deviance using cv which reflects how good the model is at predicting hold out data the partial dependence plots pdps fig 6b indicate that in general stemflow slightly increased with a larger dbh it decreased and then began to increase with lai after 2 m2 m 2 with increasing map stemflow first increased and attained its highest value around 1000 mm and then began to decrease shorter tree plant heights and smoother bark were associated with increased stemflow mat in general had a positive stepwise effect on stemflow the three most strongest interactions supplementary fig s2 table 2 revealed that stemflow tended to be higher under the interactions of lower lai around 1 5 m2 m 2 with relatively higher mat p 0 01 or with larger dbh p 0 01 or with intermediate map p 0 01 for throughfall the brt model explained 71 6 of the deviance using training data and 20 8 of the deviance using cv at predicting hold out data the pdps fig 6c indicate that the proportion of throughfall in general remained at a lower stage when mat 4 perhaps due to greater viscosity and higher surface tension of intercepted rain at lower temperatures but sharply increased from 4 8 and then mostly stabilized thereafter throughfall first increased and then began to decrease with increasing dbh peaking at around 20 cm throughfall first decreased and then began to increase with increasing map attaining its minimum around 800 mm throughfall had a generally slight increasing tendency with increasing stand height and began to be flatten after 20 m driven by only a few data points all three most strongest interactions were statistically significant p 0 01 table 2 revealing that throughfall tended to be higher under the interactions of higher mat with larger dbh or with higher map or under the interaction of higher vegetation with larger dbh supplementary fig s2 table 2 for interception loss the brt model explained 67 6 of the deviance using training data and 16 1 of the deviance using cv at predicting hold out data the pdps fig 6d indicate that the proportion of interception loss in general remained at a higher stage when mat 4 but decreased dramatically from 4 8 perhaps as detained water became less viscous and may have been more readily partitioned into throughfall interception loss generally increased with map and then began to decrease after a threshold of 800 mm dbh and plant age had positive effects while stand density and stand height had negative effects on interception loss respectively all three most strongest interactions were significant p 0 01 table 2 revealing that interception loss tended to be higher at lower mat with intermediate map 500 800 mm or with higher plant age or with larger dbh supplementary fig s2 table 2 4 discussion we compiled a comprehensive dataset of rainfall partitioning for forests shrublands croplands and grasslands of china from 287 peer reviewed papers 71 in english and 216 in chinese with english abstract this is particularly noteworthy as around three fourths of studies we synthesized that have been published in chinese are largely inaccessible to international readers our dataset is a valuable supplement to the global rainfall partitioning database helping to enhance our understanding of vegetation related water cycles globally it is interesting to note that geographically rainfall partitioning studies were scarce in western china according to the well known hu line fig 1a which is a natural geographical dividing line that bisects china into regional east and west of the hu line with the east accounting for 36 of the territory but being occupied by 96 of the population hu 1935 zhang et al 2022a in terms of vegetation types most observations were conducted in forests 83 1 followed by in shrublands 13 6 croplands 2 9 with just three observations in grasslands fig 1a clearly more research is needed for the latter three vegetation types especially for grasslands which cover 40 of china s land area kang et al 2007 actually there is a paucity of rainfall partitioning observations for grassland worldwide creating a knowledge gap in our understanding of net precipitation reaching the surface rivera and van stan 2020 for a specific plant species community at a given study site stand scale a substantial variability of each rainfall partitioning flux mm could be explained solely by rainfall amount and the linear functions are overwhelmingly dominated for stemflow and throughfall fig 3a 3c 3e similarly magliano et al 2022 synthesized throughfall and stemflow observations across 40 dryland sites and found that the amount of stemflow throughfall and interception loss could be best predicted by rainfall amount using linear functions for explaining the variances of the relative proportion of each of the rainfall partitioning fluxes to gross rainfall although rainfall amount alone seems to do a relatively good job with various non linear functions fig 3b 3d 3f other meteorological variables e g rainfall intensity wind regimes vapor pressure deficit are recommended to be added to obtain a higher explanatory power as suggested by staelens et al 2008 and zhang et al 2015 for example the rainfall threshold for stemflow or throughfall initiation in general is derived from regression functions between rainfall depth and stemflow or throughfall depth of individual events the rainfall threshold for stemflow initiation a median of 3 3 mm was significantly higher p 0 0001 than for throughfall initiation a median of 1 2 mm fig 4a this is easy to understand that theoretically stemflow is expected to occur only after the saturation of parts of the canopy along preferential flowpaths e g imamura et al 2017 tischer et al 2020 while less rainfall is usually required for throughfall initiation not surprisingly forests had a significantly higher rainfall threshold value for stemflow initiation than shrublands p 0 001 and croplands p 0 05 fig 4b likely due to a higher canopy saturation demand for forests especially for those with rougher barked tree species moreover we found that the stemflow percentage of forests was significantly lower p 0 001 than that of shrublands fig 5b as shrubs are the dominant life form in the vast drylands where water is typically the most important limiting factor for vegetation those results may also imply that shrublands gain more benefits than forests from stemflow considering its well known localized inputs of water and nutrients li et al 2009 whitford et al 1997 zhang et al 2013 in this sense our findings support the argument of planting shrubs rather than trees in the water limited drylands in terms of forestation afforestation and reforestation practices cao et al 2010 identifying the underlying drivers of each of the rainfall partitioning fluxes has great value for estimating water and nutrients budget in vegetated ecosystems in this study we identified the most influential predictors and visualized their partial effects on the proportion of each of the rainfall partitioning fluxes using brt fig 6 our brt models had a rather good explanatory power deviance explained for the observed data while as expected lower for the hold out data cv deviance explained nevertheless they were satisfactory because our main aim was to describe the relative effects of biotic and abiotic predictors on rainfall partitioning fluxes fig 6 rather than to produce predictive models results demonstrated that non linear relationships are prevalent between rainfall partitioning fluxes and their biotic and abiotic predictors dbh stand height map and mat appeared systematically among the most influential predictors regardless of rainfall partitioning fluxes more interestingly we found that throughfall shared all four of its significant predictors with interception loss with only slight differences in ri values and the rankings and with the pdps for these predictors showing the exact opposite tendency fig 6c and 6d this somewhat reflects the reciprocal nature in hydrological process of the two fluxes in terms of water fluxes a higher production of throughfall may correspond to a lower interception loss and vice versa our findings also highlight that the non linear synergistic interactions were prevalent among the most influential predictors in determining each of the rainfall partitioning fluxes supplementary fig s2 table 2 this has rarely been explored and would aid in a clearer understanding of the underlying mechanisms regulating rainfall partitioning fluxes it is worth noting that the macro level predictors we used in this study act as proxies for event and intra event processes that affect the proportions of throughfall stemflow and interception loss thus the value of aggregate analyses lies in the utility of proxy macro level predictors to capture the signals and patterns within the macro level data as such this wide brush approach is complementary to the more detailed single study approach this is partly due to the fact that some predictors in the aggregate may behave differently than that in a single study in disaggregated form see yuan et al 2019 this recognition is important so one does not conflate the behavior of physically based processes at the intra or event scales with the aggregate both approaches have their uses with this study focusing on aggregate patterns our findings provide insights into the roles of some climate variables and stand traits in regulating rainfall partitioning fluxes and thus furnish land management officials with requisite knowledge for seeking viable strategies to enhance water resources use for example china has launched a series of mega afforestation projects to enhance vegetation cover with the main goals of desertification control and soil and water conservation e g cao et al 2010 song et al 2022 while some progresses have been made with these projects some improper activities such as inappropriate use of plant species have also led to some unintended negative effects on ecosystems such as reducing soil moisture e g feng et al 2016 zhang et al 2022b shrubs are largely recommended in recent years in the drylands of china where water resources are scarce due to their lower exploitation of soil water e g wang et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 our study from the point view of rainfall partitioning supplies a more nuanced understanding of these vegetation water interactions that may further strengthen the judicious use of shrubs partly due to shrubs lower rainfall thresholds for stemflow and throughfall initiation fig 4 and their higher harvest of stemflow fig 5 short shrubs in particular with thick and smooth stems and relatively open canopy fig 6 such as caragana korshinskii and salix psammophila would be preferable in drier environments whereas in the humid areas or cities of china with ample precipitation runoff reduction is of greater importance and trees with higher rainfall thresholds for stemflow and throughfall initiation fig 4 and lower stemflow production but higher interception loss fig 5 are recommended such trees e g castanopsis hystrix cryptomeria fortunei larix olgensis and toona sinensis would offer a thick trunk with rough bark and relatively dense canopy fig 6 5 conclusions this study provides a comprehensive dataset on the rainfall partitioning by forests shrublands croplands and grasslands in china by compiling data from 287 peer reviewed papers three fourths of which are in chinese in general rainfall partitioning studies conducted in forests are abundant while that in other vegetation types in particular grasslands are clearly limited and needed a substantial variability of each rainfall partitioning flux mm could be explained solely by rainfall amount mm the rainfall threshold for the initiation of stemflow was significantly higher p 0 0001 than that of throughfall the proportions of stemflow throughfall and interception loss had a median of 2 7 74 3 and 21 6 respectively with significant variations among vegetation types based on brt modelling we identified the most influential predictors fig 6 and delineated their individual and interactive non linear effects on each of the rainfall partitioning fluxes fig 6 table 2 our findings provide a mechanistic understanding of the relative effects of cross site biotic and abiotic predictors on rainfall partitioning would aid in an accurate estimation of water and nutrients budget in vegetated ecosystems worldwide and are helpful for making viable strategies to enhance forestry water resources management data availability

2501,rainfall partitioning into stemflow throughfall and interception loss by vegetation alters hydrological and biogeochemical fluxes between vegetation and soil here we compiled a comprehensive dataset of rainfall partitioning by forests shrublands croplands and grasslands in china from 287 peer reviewed papers 71 in english and 216 in chinese based on this dataset we summarized the best fit functions reported for rainfall partitioning in both mm and as a function of rainfall amount as well as the rainfall thresholds for throughfall and stemflow initiation we explored the pattern of the proportions of stemflow throughfall and interception loss of vegetation in china and performed boosted regression trees brt analysis to model the relative effects of cross site biotic and abiotic predictors on each of the rainfall partitioning fluxes our results identified the scarcity of rainfall partitioning data particularly for grasslands a substantial variability of each rainfall partitioning flux mm could be explained solely by rainfall amount with median r2 values of 0 91 0 99 and 0 82 for stemflow throughfall and interception loss respectively and with linear functions most often reported as the best fit functions significant differences p 0 0001 were detected in rainfall thresholds for initiating stemflow median 3 3 mm interquartile range iqr 1 8 5 4 mm and throughfall median 1 2 mm iqr 0 8 2 2 mm stemflow had a median iqr of 2 7 1 2 6 0 and that value was 74 3 66 7 80 3 for throughfall and 21 6 16 3 28 5 for interception loss respectively significant differences were detected in the proportion of stemflow p 0 001 and throughfall p 0 01 between forests and shrublands respectively whereas no significant differences in the proportion of interception loss were found among vegetation types brt analysis indicated that of the eleven biotic and abiotic predictors examined six were classified as significant predictors in determining stemflow and interception loss respectively whereas throughfall had four significant predictors non linear partial effects of predictors on rainfall partitioning fluxes were prevalent this study avails a global readership to the findings of a large cache of chinese studies that have been inaccessible hitherto providing a mechanistic understanding of the effects of cross site biotic and abiotic predictors on rainfall partitioning fluxes keywords interception loss throughfall stemflow biotic and abiotic predictors boosted regression trees 1 introduction in vegetated ecosystems the incident rainfall is partitioned into interception loss the rainfall that is caught and stored by vegetation and evaporates back into the atmosphere during and after rainfall throughfall rainwater that reaches the under canopy soil

variables and canopy structure del campo et al 2018 van stan et al 2014 yuan et al 2016 yue et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 the overwhelming majority of rainfall partitioning studies have been conducted at the field plot scale and focused on individual plant species or mixed species at specific sites these studies have greatly improved our understanding of the fine or local scale of rainfall partitioning processes and the associated influencing factors and of their role in ecohydrological and biogeochemical cycles in various ecosystems several narrative reviews have critically evaluated the advancement in the realm of rainfall partitioning by vegetation with detailed information and comprehensive insights see e g crockford and richardson 2000 levia and frost 2003 levia and germer 2015 parker 1983 meanwhile some synthesis studies and or quantitative reviews in particular in recent years have emerged on quantifying the patterns of rainfall partitioning by vegetation at regional or global scales e g llorens and domingo 2007 magliano et al 2019 2022 yue et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 nevertheless reviews and syntheses are mostly concentrated on publications in english leaving a large cache of data published in other languages untapped in addition the relative importance of biotic and abiotic factors and their effects on fluxes of rainfall partitioning are less explored limiting our understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving rainfall partitioning in regional or global contexts china 9 6 million km2 has a vast territory with variable climatic and topographic conditions forming an array of diverse ecosystems there has been a drastic increase in rainfall partitioning studies conducted in china especially over the past two decades supplementary fig s1 and the majority of those have been published in chinese and are therefore largely inaccessible to international readers a quantitative synthesis of the existing rainfall partitioning studies in china is critical for holistically assessing the water balance of vegetated ecosystems within china and identifying any under studied ecosystems in need of future research here employing the most relevant and available physically based predictors we provide a comprehensive dataset of rainfall partitioning by differing vegetation types forest shrubland cropland and grassland of china by synthesizing 287 peer reviewed papers 71 papers in english and 216 in chinese published between 1984 and 2021 based on this dataset we quantitatively describe 1 the general characteristics of rainfall partitioning in terms of the field measurements 2 the best fit functions reported for rainfall partitioning as a function of rainfall amount and the rainfall thresholds for initiating stemflow and throughfall 3 the patterns of relative proportions of stemflow throughfall and interception loss to the gross rainfall across vegetation types and further 4 the relative influence of cross site biotic and abiotic factors on each of the rainfall partitioning fluxes the study adds a valuable dataset to global rainfall partitioning database and provides a comprehensive quantitative review of studies and the effects of physically based predictors on rainfall partitioning fluxes 2 methods 2 1 data compilation to provide a quantitative synthesis of rainfall partitioning by vegetation throughout china and of how the relevant biotic and abiotic factors affect the proportions of stemflow throughfall and interception loss we searched for all peer reviewed papers published before 2021 inclusive using web of science and china national knowledge infrastructure https oversea cnki net the terms used here were as follows stemflow or stem flow or throughfall or rainfall interception or rainfall partitioning or precipitation interception or precipitation partitioning or rainfall redistribution or precipitation redistribution this yielded a total of 5941 peer reviewed papers we then reviewed each paper to determine whether the studies met the following criteria a studies were exclusively conducted in china b data were exclusively obtained from field experiments data from models or simulations were not considered c the proportion s of stemflow throughfall and or interception loss was reported or could be calculated relative to the gross rainfall d when multiple papers were published on the same plant species community at the same study site the most long term study was chosen in total we identified 287 papers 71 in english and 216 in chinese that met our aforementioned requirements for data extraction a list of the papers could be found in the appendix s1 which were published between 1984 and 2021 supplementary fig s1 overall a total of 237 sites and 1310 observations 464 for stemflow 444 for throughfall and 402 for interception loss were selected in our synthesis fig 1 we extracted the data of rainfall partitioning the proportions of stemflow throughfall and interception loss and their influencing predictors see details in table 1 to assess how cross site biotic and abiotic predictors affect each of the rainfall partitioning fluxes those predictors were chosen based on their physical and ecohydrological relevance on rainfall partitioning including 1 mean annual precipitation map mm affects rainfall partitioning because the incident rainfall amount directly affects the amounts of each rainfall partitioning flux llorens and domingo 2007 magliano et al 2019 2 mean annual temperature mat partly influences rainfall partitioning fluxes by regulating rainfall temperature which governs the leaf wettability and water droplet retention for subsequent evaporation and drainage by influencing the contact angle of intercepted raindrops on leaf surfaces klamerus iwan and blonska 2018 moreover air temperature affects the kinematic viscosity and shape of detained water films on bark surfaces herwitz and levia 1997 levia and herwitz 2000 3 stand height m affects rainfall partitioning fluxes as it is normally related to the vertical distribution of foliage parker 1995 and other canopy components contributing to the canopy water storage and by impacting canopy roughness and energy exchange with the atmosphere dietz et al 2006 4 stand density individuals ha 1 influences rainfall partitioning fluxes by determining the number of individuals that the incident rainfall will encounter and the corresponding proportions of interception loss throughfall and stemflow as well as the basal area over which stemflow funneled from outlying branches is channeled to the soil matrix honda and durigan 2016 molina and del campo 2012 5 diameter at breast height dbh cm affects rainfall partitioning fluxes due to its close relation with plant morphological metrics such as size height or bark biomass germer et al 2010 siegert and levia 2014 6 plant age year can affect rainfall partitioning fluxes as it alters plant morphological metrics such as size bark texture and thickness and complexity of canopy structure brantley et al 2019 levia et al 2010 7 leaf area index lai m2 m 2 influences rainfall partitioning fluxes by regulating the amount of rainwater retained in

rainfall partitioning due to changes in canopy architecture for example between leafed and leafless phenophases for some pfts due to changes in aboveground vegetative surface area to retain rainwater

keim et al 2006 nanko et al 2013 wang et al 2012 in addition we extracted the location longitude latitude the rainfall threshold for stemflow and throughfall initiation and the best fit functions for rainfall partitioning in both mm and as a function of rainfall amount for a comprehensive analysis of rainfall partitioning in china for map and mat that were not reported in original studies they were derived from the worldclim database http worldclim org using the location information latitude and longitude with a spatial resolution of 30 s 1 km2 when bark texture pfts and leaf type were not explicitly indicated in the original source article and also could not be found in other papers from the same study site and or authors the data were extracted from the chinese virtual herbarium https www cvh ac cn and national specimen information infrastructure http www nsii org cn 2 2 data analysis all statistical analyses were conducted using r version 4 2 0 r core team 2022 we compared the differences in rainfall partitioning fluxes and the differences in rainfall threshold for stemflow and throughfall initiation between vegetation types using a kruskal wallis rank sum test because those data were not normally distributed according to the shapiro wilk test p 0 05 the subsequent multiple comparisons were performed using dunn s test in the rstatix package kassambara 2021 differences were considered statistically significant at p 0 05 we used boosted regression trees brt to determine the effects of up to eleven predictor variables table 1 on the proportions of stemflow throughfall and interception loss respectively brt is an advanced regression technique which combines a large numbers of simple regression trees together whereby the model performance is improved by sequentially fitting each new tree to the residuals from the previous ones elith et al 2008 the brt approach offers some important advantages including dealing with many types of response variables loss functions and predictors capturing non linear relationships accommodating missing data by using surrogates and automatically identifying interaction effects between predictors de ath 2007 elith et al 2008 lange and sippel 2020 brt is also robust to collinearity and variable selection is achieved because the model largely ignores non informative predictors when fitting trees elith et al 2008 brt models were fitted with gaussian distribution using gbm step function of the r package dismo hijmans et al 2017 we used tenfold cross validation cv to tune model parameters and to assess model performance brt model building requires tuning of three parameters tree complexity tc which specifies the number of interactions that should be modelled learning rate lr which regulates the contribution of each new tree to the growing model and bag fraction bf which controls stochasticity by randomly selecting a specified subset of the data at each iteration elith et al 2008 we tested the following parameter settings tc 1 5 lr 0 05 0 01 0 005 0 001 and 0 0005 bf 0 5 0 55 0 6 0 65 0 7 and 0 75 resulting in 150 models for each response variable supplementary table s1 the optimal settings stemflow tc 5 lr 0 005 bf 0 70 throughfall tc 5 lr 0 01 bf 0 75 relative interception loss tc 5 lr 0 005 bf 0 75 with the lowest cv deviance squared error for the gaussian type while containing a minimum of 1000 trees were then selected to generate the final brt models supplementary table s1 the performance of all models was mainly assessed on the training data deviance explained and on predictions to test data cv deviance explained supplementary table s2 enabling us to evaluate our ability to explain observed data and predict hold out data respectively buston and elith 2011 model results reflect the relative influence ri of individual predictors which is estimated based on how often the predictor is selected for splitting weighted by the squared improvement to the model and averaged across all trees elith et al 2008 ri scores are scaled so that all considered predictors sum to 100 with higher values indicating stronger influence elith et al 2008 we considered only the predictors with a ri score above that expected by chance 100 number of predictors as significant jouffray et al 2019 muller et al 2013 for significant predictors we provide partial dependence plots pdps showing the partial effect on the predicted outcome for a given value of the predictor when the other predictors are kept constant the x axis shows the distribution of the data points and the pdps flatten in regions where there is no change or where there is no data available fitted lines represent the mean estimate and 95 confidence intervals based on 500 bootstrap replicates for improved interpretation the actual response plots were also smoothed using a smoothing spline we also used bootstrap resampling to test the null hypothesis of no interaction among explanatory predictors for each of 100 bootstraps we resampled the values of the proportions of stemflow throughfall and interception loss before re fitting a brt model and then recorded the size of the interactions to generate a distribution under the null hypothesis jouffray et al 2019 pinsky and byler 2015 statistical analyses and graphing except for fig 1a which was generated by qgis v3 22 were done within the r statistical framework mainly using the following packages cowplot wilke 2020 dismo hijmans et al 2017 ggbeeswarm clarke and sherrill mix 2017 ggbrt jouffray 2022 gghalves tiedemann

partitioning observations spanning 18 7 53 5 n in latitude and 83 3 130 2 e in longitude we identified that data were scarce for the western part of china illustrated by the hu line especially in qinghai tibet plateau and xinjiang uygur autonomous region fig 1a the collected observations exhibited wide ranges of map 120 4240 mm and mat 5 5 28 5 fig 1b a majority of observations were conducted in forests 83 1 followed by in shrublands 13 6 croplands 2 9 and grasslands only three observations fig 1a according to whittaker biome classification studies were concentrated in boreal forests temperate seasonal forests temperate grassland deserts woodlands shrublands and tropical seasonal forests savannas fig 1b ten of the most studied genera included pinus larix quercus cunninghamia caragana betula phyllostachys picea platycladus and salix study periods had a range of 1 96 months however a majority of studies 92 4 were conducted 24 months fig 2 a observations were recorded at event intra event daily weekly biweekly and irregular scales an overwhelming majority of observations conducted at the event scale 87 2 followed by the intra event scale 9 9 with other temporal intervals being negligible fig 2b as to how the measurements were recorded manually versus automatically 90 and 88 of the observations were done manually for stemflow and throughfall respectively the remaining were measured automatically using equipment such as tipping bucket rain gauges fig 2c 3 2 fitted empirical functions and the rainfall thresholds for stemflow and throughfall initiation linear power polynominal poly logarithmic log and exponential exp functions were selected to fit rainfall partitioning fluxes in both mm and against rainfall depth fig 3 approximately one third of the observations did not report the fitted functions for stemflow depth mm and throughfall depth mm against rainfall depth mm and that value was more than one half for interception loss mm linear functions were overwhelmingly reported for stemflow depth mm and throughfall depth mm against rainfall depth fig 3a 3c with a very high coefficient of determination median r2 of 0 91 and an interquartile range i e iqr of 0 85 0 93 for stemflow depth and median r2 of 0 99 and an iqr of 0 91 0 97 for throughfall depth respectively for interception loss mm against rainfall depth fig 3e

based on a small number of observations only 11 for stemflow and interception loss and 15 for throughfall with a relatively wide range 3 4 effects of cross site biotic and abiotic predictors on rainfall partitioning fig 6 a shows the relative influence ri of individual predictors on the proportions of stemflow throughfall and interception loss respectively of the eleven predictors both stemflow and interception loss had six significant predictors while throughfall had four significant predictors ri above what could be expected by chance alone dbh was the dominant predictor for stemflow with a ri of 24 4 followed by lai 14 1 map 11 4 stand height 11 4 bark texture 9 9 and mat 9 7 throughfall was best explained by mat 22 4 followed by dbh 17 7 map 15 7 and stand height 11 5 interception loss was best explained by mat 20 5 followed by map 17 2 dbh 16 8 stand density 13 3 stand height 11 9 and plant age 11 8 for each of the rainfall partitioning fluxes its response to the most influential predictors fig 6b 6c 6d and the three most strongest pairwise interactions supplementary fig s2 table 2 are described below for stemflow the brt model explained 53 7 of the deviance using training data which reflects how good the model is at explaining the observed data the model explained 13 7 of the deviance using cv which reflects how good the model is at predicting hold out data the partial dependence plots pdps fig 6b indicate that in general stemflow slightly increased with a larger dbh it decreased and then began to increase with lai after 2 m2 m 2 with increasing map stemflow first increased and attained its highest value around 1000 mm and then began to decrease shorter tree plant heights and smoother bark were associated with increased stemflow mat in general had a positive stepwise effect on stemflow the three most strongest interactions supplementary fig s2 table 2 revealed that stemflow tended to be higher under the interactions of lower lai around 1 5 m2 m 2 with relatively higher mat p 0 01 or with larger dbh p 0 01 or with intermediate map p 0 01 for throughfall the brt model explained 71 6 of the deviance using training data and 20 8 of the deviance using cv at predicting hold out data the pdps fig 6c indicate that the proportion of throughfall in general remained at a lower stage when mat 4 perhaps due to greater viscosity and higher surface tension of intercepted rain at lower temperatures but sharply increased from 4 8 and then mostly stabilized thereafter throughfall first increased and then began to decrease with increasing dbh peaking at around 20 cm throughfall first decreased and then began to increase with increasing map attaining its minimum around 800 mm throughfall had a generally slight increasing tendency with increasing stand height and began to be flatten after 20 m driven by only a few data points all three most strongest interactions were statistically significant p 0 01 table 2 revealing that throughfall tended to be higher under the interactions of higher mat with larger dbh or with higher map or under the interaction of higher vegetation with larger dbh supplementary fig s2 table 2 for interception loss the brt model explained 67 6 of the deviance using training data and 16 1 of the deviance using cv at predicting hold out data the pdps fig 6d indicate that the proportion of interception loss in general remained at a higher stage when mat 4 but decreased dramatically from 4 8 perhaps as detained water became less viscous and may have been more readily partitioned into throughfall interception loss generally increased with map and then began to decrease after a threshold of 800 mm dbh and plant age had positive effects while stand density and stand height had negative effects on interception loss respectively all three most strongest interactions were significant p 0 01 table 2 revealing that interception loss tended to be higher at lower mat with intermediate map 500 800 mm or with higher plant age or with larger dbh supplementary fig s2 table 2 4 discussion we compiled a comprehensive dataset of rainfall partitioning for forests shrublands croplands and grasslands of china from 287 peer reviewed papers 71 in english and 216 in chinese with english abstract this is particularly noteworthy as around three fourths of studies we synthesized that have been published in chinese are largely inaccessible to international readers our dataset is a valuable supplement to the global rainfall partitioning database helping to enhance our understanding of vegetation related water cycles globally it is interesting to note that geographically rainfall partitioning studies were scarce in western china according to the well known hu line fig 1a which is a natural geographical dividing line that bisects china into regional east and west of the hu line with the east accounting for 36 of the territory but being occupied by 96 of the population hu 1935 zhang et al 2022a in terms of vegetation types most observations were conducted in forests 83 1 followed by in shrublands 13 6 croplands 2 9 with just three observations in grasslands fig 1a clearly more research is needed for the latter three vegetation types especially for grasslands which cover 40 of china s land area kang et al 2007 actually there is a paucity of rainfall partitioning observations for grassland worldwide creating a knowledge gap in our understanding of net precipitation reaching the surface rivera and van stan 2020 for a specific plant species community at a given study site stand scale a substantial variability of each rainfall partitioning flux mm could be explained solely by rainfall amount and the linear functions are overwhelmingly dominated for stemflow and throughfall fig 3a 3c 3e similarly magliano et al 2022 synthesized throughfall and stemflow observations across 40 dryland sites and found that the amount of stemflow throughfall and interception loss could be best predicted by rainfall amount using linear functions for explaining the variances of the relative proportion of each of the rainfall partitioning fluxes to gross rainfall although rainfall amount alone seems to do a relatively good job with various non linear functions fig 3b 3d 3f other meteorological variables e g rainfall intensity wind regimes vapor pressure deficit are recommended to be added to obtain a higher explanatory power as suggested by staelens et al 2008 and zhang et al 2015 for example the rainfall threshold for stemflow or throughfall initiation in general is derived from regression functions between rainfall depth and stemflow or throughfall depth of individual events the rainfall threshold for stemflow initiation a median of 3 3 mm was significantly higher p 0 0001 than for throughfall initiation a median of 1 2 mm fig 4a this is easy to understand that theoretically stemflow is expected to occur only after the saturation of parts of the canopy along preferential flowpaths e g imamura et al 2017 tischer et al 2020 while less rainfall is usually required for throughfall initiation not surprisingly forests had a significantly higher rainfall threshold value for stemflow initiation than shrublands p 0 001 and croplands p 0 05 fig 4b likely due to a higher canopy saturation demand for forests especially for those with rougher barked tree species moreover we found that the stemflow percentage of forests was significantly lower p 0 001 than that of shrublands fig 5b as shrubs are the dominant life form in the vast drylands where water is typically the most important limiting factor for vegetation those results may also imply that shrublands gain more benefits than forests from stemflow considering its well known localized inputs of water and nutrients li et al 2009 whitford et al 1997 zhang et al 2013 in this sense our findings support the argument of planting shrubs rather than trees in the water limited drylands in terms of forestation afforestation and reforestation practices cao et al 2010 identifying the underlying drivers of each of the rainfall partitioning fluxes has great value for estimating water and nutrients budget in vegetated ecosystems in this study we identified the most influential predictors and visualized their partial effects on the proportion of each of the rainfall partitioning fluxes using brt fig 6 our brt models had a rather good explanatory power deviance explained for the observed data while as expected lower for the hold out data cv deviance explained nevertheless they were satisfactory because our main aim was to describe the relative effects of biotic and abiotic predictors on rainfall partitioning fluxes fig 6 rather than to produce predictive models results demonstrated that non linear relationships are prevalent between rainfall partitioning fluxes and their biotic and abiotic predictors dbh stand height map and mat appeared systematically among the most influential predictors regardless of rainfall partitioning fluxes more interestingly we found that throughfall shared all four of its significant predictors with interception loss with only slight differences in ri values and the rankings and with the pdps for these predictors showing the exact opposite tendency fig 6c and 6d this somewhat reflects the reciprocal nature in hydrological process of the two fluxes in terms of water fluxes a higher production of throughfall may correspond to a lower interception loss and vice versa our findings also highlight that the non linear synergistic interactions were prevalent among the most influential predictors in determining each of the rainfall partitioning fluxes supplementary fig s2 table 2 this has rarely been explored and would aid in a clearer understanding of the underlying mechanisms regulating rainfall partitioning fluxes it is worth noting that the macro level predictors we used in this study act as proxies for event and intra event processes that affect the proportions of throughfall stemflow and interception loss thus the value of aggregate analyses lies in the utility of proxy macro level predictors to capture the signals and patterns within the macro level data as such this wide brush approach is complementary to the more detailed single study approach this is partly due to the fact that some predictors in the aggregate may behave differently than that in a single study in disaggregated form see yuan et al 2019 this recognition is important so one does not conflate the behavior of physically based processes at the intra or event scales with the aggregate both approaches have their uses with this study focusing on aggregate patterns our findings provide insights into the roles of some climate variables and stand traits in regulating rainfall partitioning fluxes and thus furnish land management officials with requisite knowledge for seeking viable strategies to enhance water resources use for example china has launched a series of mega afforestation projects to enhance vegetation cover with the main goals of desertification control and soil and water conservation e g cao et al 2010 song et al 2022 while some progresses have been made with these projects some improper activities such as inappropriate use of plant species have also led to some unintended negative effects on ecosystems such as reducing soil moisture e g feng et al 2016 zhang et al 2022b shrubs are largely recommended in recent years in the drylands of china where water resources are scarce due to their lower exploitation of soil water e g wang et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 our study from the point view of rainfall partitioning supplies a more nuanced understanding of these vegetation water interactions that may further strengthen the judicious use of shrubs partly due to shrubs lower rainfall thresholds for stemflow and throughfall initiation fig 4 and their higher harvest of stemflow fig 5 short shrubs in particular with thick and smooth stems and relatively open canopy fig 6 such as caragana korshinskii and salix psammophila would be preferable in drier environments whereas in the humid areas or cities of china with ample precipitation runoff reduction is of greater importance and trees with higher rainfall thresholds for stemflow and throughfall initiation fig 4 and lower stemflow production but higher interception loss fig 5 are recommended such trees e g castanopsis hystrix cryptomeria fortunei larix olgensis and toona sinensis would offer a thick trunk with rough bark and relatively dense canopy fig 6 5 conclusions this study provides a comprehensive dataset on the rainfall partitioning by forests shrublands croplands and grasslands in china by compiling data from 287 peer reviewed papers three fourths of which are in chinese in general rainfall partitioning studies conducted in forests are abundant while that in other vegetation types in particular grasslands are clearly limited and needed a substantial variability of each rainfall partitioning flux mm could be explained solely by rainfall amount mm the rainfall threshold for the initiation of stemflow was significantly higher p 0 0001 than that of throughfall the proportions of stemflow throughfall and interception loss had a median of 2 7 74 3 and 21 6 respectively with significant variations among vegetation types based on brt modelling we identified the most influential predictors fig 6 and delineated their individual and interactive non linear effects on each of the rainfall partitioning fluxes fig 6 table 2 our findings provide a mechanistic understanding of the relative effects of cross site biotic and abiotic predictors on rainfall partitioning would aid in an accurate estimation of water and nutrients budget in vegetated ecosystems worldwide and are helpful for making viable strategies to enhance forestry water resources management data availability

2502,nuclear energy represents a relatively novel clean energy source and potential nuclear contamination must be considered while developing the nuclear industry in the context of a hypothetical nuclear accident a nuclide migration model was established based on regional geological and hydrological data to investigate the migration characteristics of the radionuclides 3h 99tc vii 137cs and 79se iv in a proposed spent fuel reprocessing site sfrs in gansu china the temporal and spatial evolution of these four nuclides as well as their effects on the environment and local population were discussed in detail the model of nuclide migration in the vadose zone was coupled to a large scale regional nuclide migration model of groundwater in the form of boundary conditions the results under the least favorable conditions showed that nuclides with high adsorption rates 137cs and 79se iv remained in the vadose zone and decayed out completely in contrast nuclides with low adsorption rates 3h and 99tc vii penetrated the vadose zone and polluted the groundwater the vadose zone delayed the arrival of 3h and 99tc vii to the phreatic surface and reduced their concentrations it was predicted that the concentration of 3h in the groundwater would fall below the threshold after 40 years and the distance from the leakage area to the leading edge of the contamination plume would be 374 m 99tc vii which has a slightly higher adsorption rate and a lower decay rate than 3h spread 833 m after 3000 years when its concentration was below the threshold 3h and 99tc vii did not migrate to downstream farms to threaten the safety of residential drinking water this research presents a safety assessment of a nuclear area in gansu china and provides a significant reference for the future

al 2020 nuclear energy has been used for efficient power generation kim 2021 hydrogen production aydin dincer 2022 seawater desalination al othman et al 2019 and heat supply j chen et al 2021 however the rapid development of the nuclear industry is accompanied by the generation of large amounts of radioactive waste adversely affecting the ecological environment and human health severnini 2017 reprocessing technology is the most widespread method used for the treatment of nuclear waste and a critical aspect of spent fuel recycling rodríguez penalonga and moratilla soria 2017 the environmental friendliness of spent fuel reprocessing facilities must be guaranteed it is essential to assess the environmental and health risks of a hypothetical nuclear accident prior to the construction of reprocessing plants these assessments offer vital guidance for subsequent nuclear engineering construction plans and nuclear accident emergency response protocols conducting safety assessments of nuclear facilities involves investigating the risk dynamics of radionuclide migration into the surrounding environment testoni et al 2020 typical research methods include four main types laboratory tests field tests tracer tests and numerical simulations laboratory and field tests are primarily used to obtain soil hydraulic and nuclide transport parameters such as permeability dispersion and distribution coefficients tran et al 2019 neil et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 tracer tests are highly effective razafindratsima et al 2015 tran et al 2020 but time consuming and costly and the scale problem complicates their use sudicky frind 1982 hunt et al 2011 these three types of research methods are crucial for obtaining parameters reflecting the actual stratigraphic conditions of the study area some safety assessments use only the empirical values of previous studies these are not representative and have very low credibility numerical simulation is currently the most widely used method for predicting nuclide transport in geological environments it simulates and calculates the migration characteristics of the nuclides by establishing theoretical models and selecting geological information and experimental data yim and simonson 2000 proposed three types of performance assessment models for low level radioactive waste llrw disposal facilities the first category is referred to as near field models and they track the degradation of the facility the waste and the seepage of radionuclides into the surrounding subsoil guo 2017 x li et al 2008 the second category transport models tracks the movement of radionuclides from the subsoil to potential human exposure sites schwartz 2012b the third category is dose exposure models that track the uptake exposure and dose equivalent that may result from any transported radionuclides goronovski et al 2018 dai et al 2019 numerical models must reflect site conditions accurately which requires high reliability of the modeling parameters and calibration by incorporating observations to improve model accuracy jakimavičiūtė maselienė and cidzikienė 2015 developed a model for groundwater flow and tritium migration at the site of a new nuclear power plant in lithuania tritium migration from nuclear power plant reactors was predicted using water level monitoring data for calibration testoni et al 2020 combined field measurements with modeling to analyze strontium dynamics in the hydrological and hydrogeological context of a nuclear power plant in italy modeling nuclide transport in the coupled vadose zone groundwater system is a challenge in numerical simulation studies of regional nuclear contamination after being released from a nuclear facility radionuclides first enter the vadose zone where the unsaturated soil has a much smaller permeability coefficient than the saturated soil van genuchten 1980 nuclides are retained dispersed adsorbed and attenuated in the vadose zone nützmann et al 2002 nair et al 2010 j s chen et al 2019 morsali et al 2019 which can be considered as a natural barrier protecting the groundwater from contamination z li et al 2017 therefore investigating the nuclide migration in the vadose zone must be considered in safety evaluations of nuclear areas some studies conducted three dimensional 3 d simulations of the vadose zone and the groundwater schwartz 2020 although these models are physically based and mathematically rigorous they may suffer from the incompatibility of various hydrological processes in the vadose zone and the groundwater at different spatial and temporal scales beegum et al 2019 regional scale 3d models may be difficult to converge and are computationally intensive shen phanikumar 2010 currently the ideal solution is to couple a vadose zone model qian et al 2009 pontedeiro et al 2018 with a groundwater model zuo et al 2009 testoni et al 2015 schwartz 2012a after simplifying them to different degrees the quasi 3 d approach is the most commonly used method kuznetsov et al 2012 it has been shown that the lateral flow in the vadose zone is relatively weak and can generally be reduced to a one dimensional vertical motion zhu et al 2016 the water movement and solute transport in groundwater are considered 3d movements the quasi 3 d approach is widely used to couple vadose zone and groundwater models at the regional scale testoni et al 2017 mao et al 2021 in this study we propose a coupled vadose zone groundwater model based on experimental parameters and hydrogeological data to evaluate the effects of a hypothetical nuclear accident at a proposed sfrs in gansu china the migration and dispersion patterns of 3h 99tc vii 137cs and 79se iv in the geological environment were investigated using the hydrus 1d and feflow software the results of the 1d vertical model in the vadose zone were imported into the 3d groundwater nuclide migration model as the upper boundary conditions fig 1 shows the flowchart of the method based on the results we evaluated the retention effect of the vadose zone and the impacts of a nuclear leakage accident on the groundwater and downstream farms under the least favorable condition this study provides technical support for the siting of nuclear facilities in the study area and a reference for emergency responses to potential future nuclear accidents 2 research background 2 1 study area an sfrs is currently proposed to be built in an uninhabited area of the gobi desert in gansu province northwestern china its geographical location landform types and stratigraphic overview are shown in fig 2 the topography of the study area has high elevations in the north and west and low elevations in the south and east the landform types in the area include i denuded hilly areas in the northwest ii a gently sloping gobi plain in the southwest and northeast and iii artificial landform in the southeast additionally some micro landforms exist such as the central gully the lithology of the strata in the study area consists of two major parts the upper is the quaternary strata qal pl comprised of alluvial diluvial gravelly sand mixed with breccia and the lower part is comprised of mid haixi intrusive rocks γ δ 4 2 with mainly black mica granitic amphibolite the latter can be further classified into strongly weathered moderately weathered and slightly weathered parts the direction of groundwater flow is controlled by topography and geomorphology as shown in fig 2 and fig 3 the sfrs is located in the gently sloping gobi plain landform between the denuded hilly landform and the gully the groundwater in the northern denuded hilly landform primarily seeps southward along the slope to the low lying area gully and then flows from the west to a farm in the southeast which has dozens of residents therefore nuclear wastewater may contaminate the drinking water of the farm posing health risks to the farm residents the study area is located in the mid latitude westerly circulation zone of the northern hemisphere and has an arid continental climate it is characterized by high wind speeds strong sunshine low humidity low rainfall high temperatures low air pressure and high evaporation rates the sparse vegetation dry climate stable stratigraphy and lack of a dense population provide outstanding geographical advantages for the construction of nuclear facilities 2 2 hypothetical nuclear leakage accident it is assumed that a nuclear explosion accident has occurred in a large temporary storage tank containing waste liquid and the leakage is stopped after 24 h under emergency protocols during this time a large amount of radioactive liquid is released to overflow into the plant s staging area which is approximately 0 52 km long by 0 45 km wide and covers 0 234 km2 fig 2 it is assumed that the radioactive liquid enters the vadose zone and bypasses the engineered barriers the nuclides in the radioactive waste liquid include 3h 99tc vii 137cs and 79se iv table 1 lists their basic parameter values which were provided by a nuclear power company 2 3 contamination threshold the guidelines for drinking water quality issued by the world health organization who stipulate that the groundwater meets the drinking water standard when the total alpha radioactivity is 0 5 bq l and the total beta radioactivity is 1 bq l when the total radioactivity of the groundwater exceeds these values an annual committed effective dose of 0 1 msv is used as the groundwater quality standard world health organization 2011 in this study a nuclide concentration of 0 1msv was used as the contamination threshold the calculation of the annual committed effective dose j s chen et al 2019 is shown in equation 1 the values were obtained from the international commission on radiological protection icrp eckerman et al 2013 this equation can be used to calculate the contamination concentration thresholds for the different nuclides table 2 1 a n n u a l c o m

the pathway for nuclides to migrate to the groundwater due to the hindering effect on nuclides migration the vadose zone is considered a natural barrier to protect the groundwater in case of a nuclear accident in this study hydrus 1d was used to simulate the vertical migration of 3h 99tc vii 137cs and 79se iv in the vadose zone under three different precipitation conditions 3 1 1 hydrus 1d calculation principle in the water flow module hydrus 1d uses richard s equation to describe the one dimensional equilibrium flow through unsaturated porous media šimůnek et al 2006 2 θ t x k h x h x cos β s where θ is the volumetric water content t is the time a k h x is the hydraulic conductivity of the unsaturated soil m a k h x k s x k r h x k s x is the hydraulic conductivity of the saturated soil m a and k r h x is the relative hydraulic conductivity of the soil h is the pressure head m β is the angle between the water flow direction and the longitudinal axis and water flow within the vadose zone involves one dimensional continuous vertical infiltration so β 0 s is the source sink term 1 a in the solute transport module the migration of nuclides in the vadose zone includes convection dispersion linear equilibrium adsorption and the first order decay reaction the analytical equation is as follows šimůnek et al 2006 3 θ c t ρ s s t x θ d c x qc x λ θ c λ ρ s s φ where c

density m a λ is decay rate 1 a φ is the source sink term g m3 a 3 1 2 soil characteristic parameters and model validation the basic properties and hydraulic parameters of the 9 m deep vadose zone were analyzed by field tests and laboratory tests for several months fig 4 the upper pleistocene alluvial diluvial layer consisted of clay silt gravel sand and breccia and the clay silt and sand particles formed tight inclusions around the breccia we used soil sieves and a laser diffraction particle analyzer ldpa to determine the layer s particle size distribution the results showed that the shapes of the particle size distribution curves of the tested soils at different depths were similar indicating high homogeneity of the stratigraphic lithology therefore the stratum of the vadose zone was considered a homogeneous porous medium in the model the saturated permeability coefficients of the soils required for the model were measured by three tests the single ring method the double ring method and the inverse auger method iam the in situ soil water characteristics test was performed by installing soil moisture probes and matrix suction probes in deep pits to measure the water content and matrix suction at different depths of the vadose zone these measured values were combined with the results of a laboratory filter paper test to obtain the unsaturated soil water characteristics curve parameters additionally the dry density of the soil was obtained from field irrigation tests and the dispersion was calculated from the results of field single hole dispersion experiments based on the field unsaturated zone water transport test model validation was performed by comparing the measured and simulated values of the volumetric water content at a depth of 4 m after 24 h of water injection the test methods and model validation have been described in detail zhang et al 2021 the final model parameters are listed in table 3 3 1 3 simulation of the leakage conditions the hypothetical nuclear leakage accident lasted for 24 h thus we firstly simulated the infiltration of the nuclear waste liquid into the vadose zone during this period a 9 m deep 1d vertical model with 90 meshes was created the upper boundary was the ground surface and the lower boundary was the phreatic surface the initial pressure head value was 0 m at the phreatic surface and it decreased upward it was 8 9 m at 0 1 m below the surface and 0 m at the surface the upper boundary and the lower boundary had a constant pressure head in the solute transport module the initial concentration was 0 the upper boundary was a concentration flux boundary and the lower boundary was zero concentration gradient boundary 3 1 4 one dimensional nuclide transport model for the vadose zone the assessment of radiological risk requires a prediction of the distribution of the radioactive concentrations in the environment over a long period i e 10 000 years in this study the initial moment of the model was when the leakage stopped in the water migration module the initial pressure head was the simulation result of the leakage conditions fig 5 a the lower boundary was the constant pressure head boundary and the upper boundary was the atmospheric boundary condition based on precipitation data from 1958 to 2015 in the study area fig 5 b three different rainfall conditions were simulated maximum 0 127 m a average 0 0629 m a and minimum 0 0183 m a in the solute transport module the initial concentration was the simulation result of the leakage conditions fig 5 c the upper boundary condition was the concentration flux boundary and the lower boundary condition was the zero concentration gradient boundary 3 2 nuclide migration in the groundwater high groundwater quality is required to ensure drinking safety and human health it is difficult and costly to deal with contaminated groundwater therefore the most important aspect of the safety assessment in nuclear areas is the prediction of potential groundwater contamination caused by nuclear accidents in this study a 3d model of nuclide migration in groundwater was developed by feflow to investigate the spatial and temporal distribution as well as the migration patterns of nuclides 3 2 1 feflow calculation principle feflow uses the following equations to simulate 3d processes i j 1 2 3 diersch 2014 s 0 h t q i f x j q ρ

dimensional steady state flow groundwater model according to regional geological information and data obtained from 62 boreholes the aquifers in the study area were classified into 3 categories pore water in the loose rock mass of the quaternary layer fracture water in the strongly and moderately weathered bedrock and fracture water in the slightly weathered bedrock the model was divided into 6 layers fig 6 shows the 3d scheme of the simulation area after stratigraphic generalization the permeability coefficient and effective porosity were obtained from preliminary hydrogeological investigation table 4 the permeability coefficients were the same in the and y directions and the permeability coefficient in the z direction was one tenth of that in the direction as shown in fig 3 there was no obvious hydrogeological boundary in the modeling area and the long term field monitoring results indicated an insignificant variability in the groundwater level therefore the boundary conditions of this model were derived from the hydraulic head values of specific nodes and the model s boundary line had a constant head boundary condition with a gradient groundwater is recharged by atmospheric precipitation and irrigation water and discharge occurs by evaporation and extraction the study area is a highly arid zone where the evaporation rate is tens of times the rainfall rate and the groundwater level is deeper than the ultimate evaporation depth of 4 m thus the effects of rainfall and evaporation on the aquifer were not considered the farm to the southeast of the sfrs has an area of 59 4 km2 and about 180 agricultural irrigation wells that pump groundwater to irrigate the farmland at a rate of 4 36 107 m3 year in the model groundwater extraction consisted of well drainage and surface drainage the extraction rate of well drainage was 664 m3 d and the surface drainage rate is 20 10 4 m d an empirical value of 0 2 was used for the irrigation infiltration coefficient china geology survey 2012 and the irrigation recharge rate was 4 10 4 m d 3 2 3 model validation the quaternary stratum in the study area was thicker in the southwest direction and thinner in the northeast direction the dotted red line in fig 7 is the boundary that divided the model area into two relatively independent hydrogeological units the northwestern area is zone a with a shallow bedrock depth and it is dominated by bedrock fracture water and 6 water level observation wells are deployed in this zone the southwestern and southeastern farm areas comprise zone b with a thick quaternary stratum it is dominated by loose rock pore water and there are 14 water level observation wells the steady state flow groundwater model was calibrated by a trial and error procedure to optimize the permeability coefficients of the quaternary strata and strongly and moderately weathered bedrock layer the fitted curve of the simulated and observed groundwater tables in the observation wells was shown in fig 8 a and the correlation coefficient was 0 9915 the non homogeneous permeability coefficients of the aquifer fig 8 b obtained by model calibration were input into the feflow software to correct the groundwater flow field fig 8 c showed that the simulated groundwater flow field was fairly consistent with the observed flow field in most of the model area except for the southeastern part there are numerous agricultural irrigation wells irregularly distributed in the southeastern region and their complex recharge and discharge conditions were simplified in the model resulting in deviations from actual conditions however this model was used primarily to study the spatial and temporal distribution of nuclides from the nuclear leakage area to the drinking water well where the simulated and actual flow fields were the same therefore it can be reasonably assumed that the calibrated model meets the requirements and adequately reflects the actual flow field characteristics 3 2 4 coupled transient state flow model of vadose zone groundwater nuclide migration after calibrating the steady state groundwater model solute transport calculations were added to perform transient state nuclide migration simulations the nuclide transport parameters in table 5 were obtained from previous studies in this region spitz moreno 1996 schroeder et al 1993 c l liu et al 2001 d j liu et al 2006 li et al 2012a li et al 2012b shih et al 2017 including the henry constant and regional scale dispersion the water recharge flux and nuclide radionuclide concentration flux curves fig 9 obtained from the vadose zone model were set as the upper boundary conditions in this way the coupled calculation of the migration of nuclides in the vadose zone and groundwater was realized 4 results and discussion 4 1 the effect of annual precipitation on nuclide migration according to the meteorological statistics of the study area from 1958 to 2015 three different rainfall conditions were simulated maximum average and minimum the results showed that 137cs and 79se iv with high adsorption rates were retained in the vadose zone and the migration of 79se iv was taken as an example to analyze the effects of precipitation fig 10 showed that the higher the annual precipitation the deeper 79se iv polluted as for 3h and 99tc vii they were less adsorptive and quickly migrated through the vadose zone to the groundwater for instance under minimum average and maximum precipitation conditions 99tc vii began to contaminate the groundwater after 51 5 14 3 and 9 31 years and the contamination area reached a distance of 664 792 and 833 m from the leakage point when the concentration fell below the threshold at 590 1210 and 3000 years respectively fig 11 the reason was that seepage one of the main driving forces for nuclide migration in the vadose zone harman et al 2011 ojha et al 2015 persson saifadeen 2016 enhanced with the increase of precipitation thus the nuclide migration was accelerated and the nuclides with strong adsorption 137cs and 79se iv had a larger pollution distance in the same time and the nuclides with weaker adsorption 3h and 99tc vii took less time to penetrate the vadose zone higher annual precipitation reduced the inhibitory effect of the vadose zone on the migration of 3h and 99tc vii therefore more nuclides could seep into the aquifer resulting in more extensive and longer term groundwater contamination it is commonly accepted that in semi arid regions with relatively low annual precipitation below 250 500 mm the evaporation rate is much greater than rainfall rate thus contaminants from surface or near surface spills cannot reach the phreatic surface and pose a threat to groundwater quality wang et al 2009 zheng et al 2020 however the hypothetical nuclear spill site in this study was located inside the plant and the asphalt concrete floor still prevented evaporation even after the explosion therefore even if the annual precipitation is very low 18 3 127 mm long term continuous accumulation 10000 years can generate a certain amount of water flow accelerating the leaching of nuclides in the vadose zone and increasing the migration depth even leading to potential nuclear contamination of the groundwater therefore preventing the infiltration of atmospheric rainfall in the vadose zone after a nuclear accident is an effective measure to protect the groundwater from nuclear contamination huang et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 in addition our analysis indicates that the migration of nuclides in the vadose zone is influenced by changes of rainfall intensity the greater the annual precipitation the faster the nuclides migrate and the higher the radioactive risks are therefore the safety evaluation of a hypothetical nuclear accident should be conducted under maximum precipitation 4 2 nuclide migration in the vadose zone field tests and laboratory tests were carried out including the in situ soil water characteristics test unsaturated zone water transport test etc based on the obtained parameters the temporal and spatial evolution of 3h 99tc vii 137cs and 79se iv in the vadose zone under maximum precipitation was simulated by hydrus 1d the detailed characteristics and laws of nuclide migration were shown below 4 2 1 retention of highly adsorptive nuclides by the vadose zone the rock and soil in the vadose zone exhibited high adsorption to 137cs and 79se iv reducing their migration rate fig 12 showed the radioactive concentrations of the highly adsorbed nuclides at different depths of the vadose zone the radioactive concentration reached the threshold at depths of h1 and h2 with difference of l which represented the magnitude of the contamination zone locations with concentrations below the threshold are the safe zones the lower safe zone remained uncontaminated whereas the upper one was contaminated but the radionuclides gradually separated out due to gravity as shown in fig 13 the peak radioactive concentrations of 137cs and 79se iv decreased over time the range of the contamination zone first increased then decreased and finally disappeared in the early stage the contamination zone expanded because of the strong convection and dispersion caused by the large infiltration flow and high nuclide concentrations then the leakage stopped and the surface infiltration was only equal to the atmospheric rainfall weakening the convective effect adsorption and decay led to a decrease in nuclide concentration and a weakening of dispersion thus the radionuclide concentration in the vadose zone decreased and the contamination zone shrank the location of the peak radioactive concentration of 137cs remained at the ground surface after the nuclear leak was stopped by emergency measures i e at the initial moment of the model the contamination zone of 137cs reached a depth of 0 311 m below the ground surface it reached the maximum depth of 0 34 m after 110 years and then shrank until its disappearance after 733 years the position of the peak radioactive concentration of 79se iv slowly moved downward from the surface the low decay rate and high adsorption rate of 79se iv caused it to remain in the vadose zone for a longer period the contamination zone reached a depth of 0 0791 m at the initial moment and reached the maximum extent of 0 786 m after 1500 years eventually the contamination zone of 79se iv disappeared at 4150 years when 79se iv contaminated as deep as 2 05 m below the surface at the end of the modeling period 137cs and 79se iv had decayed the migration of 137cs and 79se iv fully demonstrated the retention of highly adsorbed nuclides by the vadose zone and the vadose zone can be regarded as a natural barrier to protect the aquifer from contamination 4 2 2 delay and weakening effect of the vadose zone on low adsorptive nuclides 3h and 99tc vii are representative nuclides with low adsorption rates it could be observed in fig 14 that their penetration curves were asymmetric and had clear trailing at the later stage initially the infiltration of a large amount of the source liquid led to a fast nuclide migration rate subsequently the upper boundary changed to low atmospheric rainfall making the migration rate slowed down 3h and 99tc vii migrated to the phreatic surface within several years after the nuclear leakage their radioactive concentrations reached the threshold after 6 63 and 9 3 years respectively starting to pollute the phreatic surface 3h and 99tc vii reached the peak concentration 0 218x and 0 222x of the initial value after 10 9 and 23 3 years respectively subsequently their concentrations decreased below the threshold after 17 3 and 51 1 years representing the end of pollution the pollution caused by 3h and 99tc vii lasted for 10 67 and 41 8 years respectively later the residual leaching stage started which required a long time for the pollutants to flow out of the vadose zone completely there was a significant delay and weakening effect of the vadose zone on the nuclides with low adsorption rates resulting in a sufficient response time for nuclear contamination treatment radionuclides enter the aquifer through the vadose zone under the leaching of precipitation adsorption and decay slow down this process the difference in adsorption rate of the nuclides significantly affects the distribution of the radioactive concentration in the vertical direction and it is difficult for nuclides with high distribution coefficient to reach the phreatic surface the half life of different nuclides varies substantially causing the differences in the radioactive concentration and retention time in the vadose zone some radionuclides decay very rapidly and have a limited extent and duration of contamination in the vadose zone therefore the radiological risks of different nuclides can be ranked based on the distribution coefficient and half life before managing a nuclear accident 4 3 nuclide migration in the groundwater under maximum precipitation 3h and 99tc vii with low absorption rates penetrated the vadose zone and contaminated the aquifer and their dispersion ranges at different time points after the occurrence of nuclear leakage were shown in fig 15 and fig 16 the results showed that 3h and 99tc vii migrated downstream after entering the aquifer forming a pollution plume that spread due to hydrodynamic dispersion and molecular diffusion the maximum concentration area moved downward from the top of the plume over time the concentration of nuclides in the aquifer initially increased and subsequently decreased the reason for this trend is that the dilution by water and the decay of nuclides played a weakening role in the concentration of 3h whereas the recharge of the concentration flux from the vadose zone played an enhancing role in the early stage the enhancing effect was stronger resulting in the increase of the concentration when the weaking effect became greater the concentration of 3h and 99tc vii started to decrease the geological medium does not absorb 3h thereby the migration rate of 3h was similar to the groundwater flow rate due to the high delay rate the overall concentration of 3h in groundwater reduced to below the threshold after 40 years the distance from the leakage area to the leading edge of the contaminated plume was approximately 374 m in contrast the higher adsorption rate and lower delay rate of 99tc vii led to a lower diffusion rate and longer duration of the contamination plume the concentration of 99tc vii was below the pollution threshold after 3000 years and the contaminated plume extended by 833 m a key objective of the nuclide transport prediction model is the assessment of contamination trends in environmentally sensitive areas in this study the drinking water safety of residents near the farm in the southeastern portion of the study area was analyzed under maximum annual rainfall the sfrs is located far from human population centers in an area of favorable geological conditions the proposed plant site has a thin quaternary overburden and the groundwater is bedrock fracture water with a small permeability coefficient according to the simulation results fig 15 and fig 16 the contamination plumes of 3h and 99tc vii were small and they were unable to reach the farms and threaten the drinking water safety of nearby residents therefore the environmental impact of the hypothetical nuclear accident was minimal indicating that the proposed site is suitable for constructing the plant 5 conclusions a regional scale coupled vadose zone groundwater nuclide migration model was established based on field tests parameters and hydrogeological data for a proposed sfrs in northwest china the radiodynamic risks of 3h 99tc vii 137cs and 79se iv in a hypothetical nuclear accident were assessed under the most unfavorable conditions according to the results the following major conclusions were drawn 1 the vadose zone inhibited the movement of the nuclides with a high adsorption rate the maximum contamination depths of 137cs and 79se iv were 0 34 m and 2 05 m respectively 137cs and 79se iv had decayed before the end of the simulation 10 000 years and neither were predicted to contaminate the groundwater 2 the contamination zone of 137cs and 79se iv in the vadose zone was predicted to first increase then decrease and finally disappear the contamination zones of 137cs and 79se reached the maximum ranges of 0 34 m and 0 786 m after 110 and 1500 years and disappeared after 733 and 4150 years respectively 3 the vadose zone significantly delayed the movement of the nuclides with a low adsorption rate compared to when the vadose zone was not considered the contamination at the phreatic surface by 3h and 99tc vii started at 6 63 and 9 3 years and ended at 17 3 and 51 1 years lasting 10 67 and 41 8 years respectively the peak concentrations were 0 218x and 0 222x of the initial concentrations 4 after entering the aquifer the concentration of 3h and 99tc vii in the groundwater decreased to below the threshold after 40 and 3000 years respectively the distance from the leakage area to the leading edge of the contaminated plume was approximately 374 m and 833 m respectively neither 3h nor 99tc vii was predicted to threaten the drinking water safety of residents in downstream farms 5 the groundwater at the proposed plant site is bedrock fracture water with very low velocity resulting in the slow migration of nuclides the environmental impact of the hypothetical nuclear accident is predicted to be minimal thus the proposed site is suitable for the construction of the plant credit authorship contribution statement xin zhang

2502,nuclear energy represents a relatively novel clean energy source and potential nuclear contamination must be considered while developing the nuclear industry in the context of a hypothetical nuclear accident a nuclide migration model was established based on regional geological and hydrological data to investigate the migration characteristics of the radionuclides 3h 99tc vii 137cs and 79se iv in a proposed spent fuel reprocessing site sfrs in gansu china the temporal and spatial evolution of these four nuclides as well as their effects on the environment and local population were discussed in detail the model of nuclide migration in the vadose zone was coupled to a large scale regional nuclide migration model of groundwater in the form of boundary conditions the results under the least favorable conditions showed that nuclides with high adsorption rates 137cs and 79se iv remained in the vadose zone and decayed out completely in contrast nuclides with low adsorption rates 3h and 99tc vii penetrated the vadose zone and polluted the groundwater the vadose zone delayed the arrival of 3h and 99tc vii to the phreatic surface and reduced their concentrations it was predicted that the concentration of 3h in the groundwater would fall below the threshold after 40 years and the distance from the leakage area to the leading edge of the contamination plume would be 374 m 99tc vii which has a slightly higher adsorption rate and a lower decay rate than 3h spread 833 m after 3000 years when its concentration was below the threshold 3h and 99tc vii did not migrate to downstream farms to threaten the safety of residential drinking water this research presents a safety assessment of a nuclear area in gansu china and provides a significant reference for the future

the rapid development of the nuclear industry is accompanied by the generation of large amounts of radioactive waste adversely affecting the ecological environment and human health severnini 2017 reprocessing technology is the most widespread method used for the treatment of nuclear waste and a critical aspect of spent fuel recycling rodríguez penalonga and moratilla soria 2017 the environmental friendliness of spent fuel reprocessing facilities must be guaranteed it is essential to assess the environmental and health risks of a hypothetical nuclear accident prior to the construction of reprocessing plants these assessments offer vital guidance for subsequent nuclear engineering construction plans and nuclear accident emergency response protocols conducting safety assessments of nuclear facilities involves investigating the risk dynamics of radionuclide migration into the surrounding environment testoni et al 2020 typical research methods include four main types laboratory tests field tests tracer tests and numerical simulations laboratory and field tests are primarily used to obtain soil hydraulic and nuclide transport parameters such as permeability dispersion and distribution coefficients tran et al 2019 neil et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 tracer tests are highly effective razafindratsima et al 2015 tran et al 2020 but time consuming and costly and the scale problem complicates their use sudicky frind 1982 hunt et al 2011 these three types of research methods are crucial for obtaining parameters reflecting the actual stratigraphic conditions of the study area some safety assessments use only the empirical values of previous studies these are not representative and have very low credibility numerical simulation is currently the most widely used method for predicting nuclide transport in geological environments it simulates and calculates the migration characteristics of the nuclides by establishing theoretical models and selecting geological information and experimental data yim and simonson 2000 proposed three types of performance assessment models for low level radioactive waste llrw disposal facilities the first category is referred to as near field models and they track the degradation of the facility the waste and the seepage of radionuclides into the surrounding subsoil guo 2017 x li et al 2008 the second category transport models tracks the movement of radionuclides from the subsoil to potential human exposure sites schwartz 2012b the third category is dose exposure models that track the uptake exposure and dose equivalent that may result from any transported radionuclides goronovski et al 2018 dai et al 2019 numerical models must reflect site conditions accurately which requires high reliability of the modeling parameters and calibration by incorporating observations to improve model accuracy jakimavičiūtė maselienė and cidzikienė 2015 developed a model for groundwater flow and tritium migration at the site of a new nuclear power plant in lithuania tritium migration from nuclear power plant reactors was predicted using water level monitoring data for calibration testoni et al 2020 combined field measurements with modeling to analyze strontium dynamics in the hydrological and hydrogeological context of a nuclear power plant in italy modeling nuclide transport in the coupled vadose zone groundwater system is a challenge in numerical simulation studies of regional nuclear contamination after being released from a nuclear facility radionuclides first enter the vadose zone where the unsaturated soil has a much smaller permeability coefficient than the saturated soil van genuchten 1980 nuclides are retained dispersed adsorbed and attenuated in the vadose zone nützmann et al 2002 nair et al 2010 j s chen et al 2019 morsali et al 2019 which can be considered as a natural barrier protecting the groundwater from contamination z li et al 2017 therefore investigating the nuclide migration in the vadose zone must be considered in safety evaluations of nuclear areas some studies conducted three dimensional 3 d simulations of the vadose zone and the groundwater schwartz 2020 although these models are physically based and mathematically rigorous they may suffer from the incompatibility of various hydrological processes in the vadose zone and the groundwater at different spatial and temporal scales beegum et al 2019 regional scale 3d models may be difficult to converge and are computationally intensive shen phanikumar 2010 currently the ideal solution is to couple a vadose zone model qian et al 2009 pontedeiro et al 2018 with a groundwater model zuo et al 2009 testoni et al 2015 schwartz 2012a after simplifying them to different degrees the quasi 3 d approach is the most commonly used method kuznetsov et al 2012 it has been shown that the lateral flow in the vadose zone is relatively weak and can generally be reduced to a one dimensional vertical motion zhu et al 2016 the water movement and solute transport in groundwater are considered 3d movements the quasi 3 d approach is widely used to couple vadose zone and groundwater models at the regional scale testoni et al 2017 mao et al 2021 in this study we propose a coupled vadose zone groundwater model based on experimental parameters and hydrogeological data to evaluate the effects of a hypothetical nuclear accident at a proposed sfrs in gansu china the migration and dispersion patterns of 3h 99tc vii 137cs and 79se iv in the geological environment were investigated using the hydrus 1d and feflow software the results of the 1d vertical model in the vadose zone were imported into the 3d groundwater nuclide migration model as the upper boundary conditions fig 1 shows the flowchart of the method based on the results we evaluated the retention effect of the vadose zone and the impacts of a nuclear leakage accident on the groundwater and downstream farms under the least favorable condition this study provides technical support for the siting of nuclear facilities in the study area and a reference for emergency responses to potential future nuclear accidents 2 research background 2 1 study area an sfrs is currently proposed to be built in an uninhabited area of the gobi desert in gansu province northwestern china its geographical location landform types and stratigraphic overview are shown in fig 2 the topography of the study area has high elevations in the north and west and low elevations in the south and east the landform types in the area include i denuded hilly areas in the northwest ii a gently sloping gobi plain in the southwest and northeast and iii artificial landform in the southeast additionally some micro landforms exist such as the central gully the lithology of the strata in the study area consists of two major parts the upper is the quaternary strata qal pl comprised of alluvial diluvial gravelly sand mixed with breccia and the lower part is comprised of mid haixi intrusive rocks γ δ 4 2 with mainly black mica granitic amphibolite the latter can be further classified into strongly weathered moderately weathered and slightly weathered parts the direction of groundwater flow is controlled by topography and geomorphology as shown in fig 2 and fig 3 the sfrs is located in the gently sloping gobi plain landform between the denuded hilly landform and the gully the groundwater in the northern denuded hilly landform primarily seeps southward along the slope to the low lying area gully and then flows from the west to a farm in the southeast which has dozens of residents therefore nuclear wastewater may contaminate the drinking water of the farm posing health risks to the farm residents the study area is located in the mid latitude westerly circulation zone of the northern hemisphere and has an arid continental climate it is characterized by high wind speeds strong sunshine low humidity low rainfall high temperatures low air pressure and high evaporation rates the sparse vegetation dry climate stable stratigraphy and lack of a dense population provide outstanding geographical advantages for the construction of nuclear facilities 2 2 hypothetical nuclear leakage accident it is assumed that a nuclear explosion accident has occurred in a large temporary storage tank containing waste liquid and the leakage is stopped after 24 h under emergency protocols during this time a large amount of radioactive liquid is released to overflow into the plant s staging area which is approximately 0 52 km long by 0 45 km wide and covers 0 234 km2 fig 2 it is assumed that the radioactive liquid enters the vadose zone and bypasses the engineered barriers the nuclides in the radioactive waste liquid include 3h 99tc vii 137cs and 79se iv table 1 lists their basic parameter values which were provided by a nuclear power company 2 3 contamination threshold the guidelines for drinking water quality issued by the world health organization who stipulate that the groundwater meets the drinking water standard when the total alpha radioactivity is 0 5 bq l and the total beta radioactivity is 1 bq l when the total radioactivity of the groundwater exceeds these values an annual committed effective dose of 0 1 msv is used as the groundwater quality standard world health organization 2011 in this study a nuclide concentration of 0 1msv was used as the contamination threshold the calculation of the annual committed effective dose j s chen et al 2019 is shown in equation 1 the values were obtained from the international commission on radiological protection icrp eckerman et al 2013 this equation can be used to calculate the contamination concentration thresholds for the different nuclides table 2 1 a n n u a l c o m

the pathway for nuclides to migrate to the groundwater due to the hindering effect on nuclides migration the vadose zone is considered a natural barrier to protect the groundwater in case of a nuclear accident in this study hydrus 1d was used to simulate the vertical migration of 3h 99tc vii 137cs and 79se iv in the vadose zone under three different precipitation conditions 3 1 1 hydrus 1d calculation principle in the water flow module hydrus 1d uses richard s equation to describe the one dimensional equilibrium flow through unsaturated porous media šimůnek et al 2006 2 θ t x k h x h x

density m a λ is decay rate 1 a φ is the source sink term g m3 a 3 1 2 soil characteristic parameters and model validation the basic properties and hydraulic parameters of the 9 m deep vadose zone were analyzed by field tests and laboratory tests for several months fig 4 the upper pleistocene alluvial diluvial layer consisted of clay silt gravel sand and breccia and the clay silt and sand particles formed tight inclusions around the breccia we used soil sieves and a laser diffraction particle analyzer ldpa to determine the layer s particle size distribution the results showed that the shapes of the particle size distribution curves of the tested soils at different depths were similar indicating high homogeneity of the stratigraphic lithology therefore the stratum of the vadose zone was considered a homogeneous porous medium in the model the saturated permeability coefficients of the soils required for the model were measured by three tests the single ring method the double ring method and the inverse auger method iam the in situ soil water characteristics test was performed by installing soil moisture probes and matrix suction probes in deep pits to measure the water content and matrix suction at different depths of the vadose zone these measured values were combined with the results of a laboratory filter paper test to obtain the unsaturated soil water characteristics curve parameters additionally the dry density of the soil was obtained from field irrigation tests and the dispersion was calculated from the results of field single hole dispersion experiments based on the field unsaturated zone water transport test model validation was performed by comparing the measured and simulated values of the volumetric water content at a depth of 4 m after 24 h of water injection the test methods and model validation have been described in detail zhang et al 2021 the final model parameters are listed in table 3 3 1 3 simulation of the leakage conditions the hypothetical nuclear leakage accident lasted for 24 h thus we firstly simulated the infiltration of the nuclear waste liquid into the vadose zone during this period a 9 m deep 1d vertical model with 90 meshes was created the upper boundary was the ground surface and the lower boundary was the phreatic surface the initial pressure head value was 0 m at the phreatic surface and it decreased upward it was 8 9 m at 0 1 m below the surface and 0 m at the surface the upper boundary and the lower boundary had a constant pressure head in the solute transport module the initial concentration was 0 the upper boundary was a concentration flux boundary and the lower boundary was zero concentration gradient boundary 3 1 4 one dimensional nuclide transport model for the vadose zone the assessment of radiological risk requires a prediction of the distribution of the radioactive concentrations in the environment over a long period i e 10 000 years in this study the initial moment of the model was when the leakage stopped in the water migration module the initial pressure head was the simulation result of the leakage conditions fig 5 a the lower boundary was the constant pressure head boundary and the upper boundary was the atmospheric boundary condition based on precipitation data from 1958 to 2015 in the study area fig 5 b three different rainfall conditions were simulated maximum 0 127 m a average 0 0629 m a and minimum 0 0183 m a in the solute transport module the initial concentration was the simulation result of the leakage conditions fig 5 c the upper boundary condition was the concentration flux boundary and the lower boundary condition was the zero concentration gradient boundary 3 2 nuclide migration in the groundwater high groundwater quality is required to ensure drinking safety and human health it is difficult and costly to deal with contaminated groundwater therefore the most important aspect of the safety assessment in nuclear areas is the prediction of potential groundwater contamination caused by nuclear accidents in this study a 3d model of nuclide migration in groundwater was developed by feflow to investigate the spatial and temporal distribution as well as the migration patterns of nuclides 3 2 1 feflow calculation principle feflow uses the following equations to simulate 3d processes i j 1 2 3 diersch 2014 s 0 h t q i f x j q ρ

dimensional steady state flow groundwater model according to regional geological information and data obtained from 62 boreholes the aquifers in the study area were classified into 3 categories pore water in the loose rock mass of the quaternary layer fracture water in the strongly and moderately weathered bedrock and fracture water in the slightly weathered bedrock the model was divided into 6 layers fig 6 shows the 3d scheme of the simulation area after stratigraphic generalization the permeability coefficient and effective porosity were obtained from preliminary hydrogeological investigation table 4 the permeability coefficients were the same in the and y directions and the permeability coefficient in the z direction was one tenth of that in the direction as shown in fig 3 there was no obvious hydrogeological boundary in the modeling area and the long term field monitoring results indicated an insignificant variability in the groundwater level therefore the boundary conditions of this model were derived from the hydraulic head values of specific nodes and the model s boundary line had a constant head boundary condition with a gradient groundwater is recharged by atmospheric precipitation and irrigation water and discharge occurs by evaporation and extraction the study area is a highly arid zone where the evaporation rate is tens of times the rainfall rate and the groundwater level is deeper than the ultimate evaporation depth of 4 m thus the effects of rainfall and evaporation on the aquifer were not considered the farm to the southeast of the sfrs has an area of 59 4 km2 and about 180 agricultural irrigation wells that pump groundwater to irrigate the farmland at a rate of 4 36 107 m3 year in the model groundwater extraction consisted of well drainage and surface drainage the extraction rate of well drainage was 664 m3 d and the surface drainage rate is 20 10 4 m d an empirical value of 0 2 was used for the irrigation infiltration coefficient china geology survey 2012 and the irrigation recharge rate was 4 10 4 m d 3 2 3 model validation the quaternary stratum in the study area was thicker in the southwest direction and thinner in the northeast direction the dotted red line in fig 7 is the boundary that divided the model area into two relatively independent hydrogeological units the northwestern area is zone a with a shallow bedrock depth and it is dominated by bedrock fracture water and 6 water level observation wells are deployed in this zone the southwestern and southeastern farm areas comprise zone b with a thick quaternary stratum it is dominated by loose rock pore water and there are 14 water level observation wells the steady state flow groundwater model was calibrated by a trial and error procedure to optimize the permeability coefficients of the quaternary strata and strongly and moderately weathered bedrock layer the fitted curve of the simulated and observed groundwater tables in the observation wells was shown in fig 8 a and the correlation coefficient was 0 9915 the non homogeneous permeability coefficients of the aquifer fig 8 b obtained by model calibration were input into the feflow software to correct the groundwater flow field fig 8 c showed that the simulated groundwater flow field was fairly consistent with the observed flow field in most of the model area except for the southeastern part there are numerous agricultural irrigation wells irregularly distributed in the southeastern region and their complex recharge and discharge conditions were simplified in the model resulting in deviations from actual conditions however this model was used primarily to study the spatial and temporal distribution of nuclides from the nuclear leakage area to the drinking water well where the simulated and actual flow fields were the same therefore it can be reasonably assumed that the calibrated model meets the requirements and adequately reflects the actual flow field characteristics 3 2 4 coupled transient state flow model of vadose zone groundwater nuclide migration after calibrating the steady state groundwater model solute transport calculations were added to perform transient state nuclide migration simulations the nuclide transport parameters in table 5 were obtained from previous studies in this region spitz moreno 1996 schroeder et al 1993 c l liu et al 2001 d j liu et al 2006 li et al 2012a li et al 2012b shih et al 2017 including the henry constant and regional scale dispersion the water recharge flux and nuclide radionuclide concentration flux curves fig 9 obtained from the vadose zone model were set as the upper boundary conditions in this way the coupled calculation of the migration of nuclides in the vadose zone and groundwater was realized 4 results and discussion 4 1 the effect of annual precipitation on nuclide migration according to the meteorological statistics of the study area from 1958 to 2015 three different rainfall conditions were simulated maximum average and minimum the results showed that 137cs and 79se iv with high adsorption rates were retained in the vadose zone and the migration of 79se iv was taken as an example to analyze the effects of precipitation fig 10 showed that the higher the annual precipitation the deeper 79se iv polluted as for 3h and 99tc vii they were less adsorptive and quickly migrated through the vadose zone to the groundwater for instance under minimum average and maximum precipitation conditions 99tc vii began to contaminate the groundwater after 51 5 14 3 and 9 31 years and the contamination area reached a distance of 664 792 and 833 m from the leakage point when the concentration fell below the threshold at 590 1210 and 3000 years respectively fig 11 the reason was that seepage one of the main driving forces for nuclide migration in the vadose zone harman et al 2011 ojha et al 2015 persson saifadeen 2016 enhanced with the increase of precipitation thus the nuclide migration was accelerated and the nuclides with strong adsorption 137cs and 79se iv had a larger pollution distance in the same time and the nuclides with weaker adsorption 3h and 99tc vii took less time to penetrate the vadose zone higher annual precipitation reduced the inhibitory effect of the vadose zone on the migration of 3h and 99tc vii therefore more nuclides could seep into the aquifer resulting in more extensive and longer term groundwater contamination it is commonly accepted that in semi arid regions with relatively low annual precipitation below 250 500 mm the evaporation rate is much greater than rainfall rate thus contaminants from surface or near surface spills cannot reach the phreatic surface and pose a threat to groundwater quality wang et al 2009 zheng et al 2020 however the hypothetical nuclear spill site in this study was located inside the plant and the asphalt concrete floor still prevented evaporation even after the explosion therefore even if the annual precipitation is very low 18 3 127 mm long term continuous accumulation 10000 years can generate a certain amount of water flow accelerating the leaching of nuclides in the vadose zone and increasing the migration depth even leading to potential nuclear contamination of the groundwater therefore preventing the infiltration of atmospheric rainfall in the vadose zone after a nuclear accident is an effective measure to protect the groundwater from nuclear contamination huang et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 in addition our analysis indicates that the migration of nuclides in the vadose zone is influenced by changes of rainfall intensity the greater the annual precipitation the faster the nuclides migrate and the higher the radioactive risks are therefore the safety evaluation of a hypothetical nuclear accident should be conducted under maximum precipitation 4 2 nuclide migration in the vadose zone field tests and laboratory tests were carried out including the in situ soil water characteristics test unsaturated zone water transport test etc based on the obtained parameters the temporal and spatial evolution of 3h 99tc vii 137cs and 79se iv in the vadose zone under maximum precipitation was simulated by hydrus 1d the detailed characteristics and laws of nuclide migration were shown below 4 2 1 retention of highly adsorptive nuclides by the vadose zone the rock and soil in the vadose zone exhibited high adsorption to 137cs and 79se iv reducing their migration rate fig 12 showed the radioactive concentrations of the highly adsorbed nuclides at different depths of the vadose zone the radioactive concentration reached the threshold at depths of h1 and h2 with difference of l which represented the magnitude of the contamination zone locations with concentrations below the threshold are the safe zones the lower safe zone remained uncontaminated whereas the upper one was contaminated but the radionuclides gradually separated out due to gravity as shown in fig 13 the peak radioactive concentrations of 137cs and 79se iv decreased over time the range of the contamination zone first increased then decreased and finally disappeared in the early stage the contamination zone expanded because of the strong convection and dispersion caused by the large infiltration flow and high nuclide concentrations then the leakage stopped and the surface infiltration was only equal to the atmospheric rainfall weakening the convective effect adsorption and decay led to a decrease in nuclide concentration and a weakening of dispersion thus the radionuclide concentration in the vadose zone decreased and the contamination zone shrank the location of the peak radioactive concentration of 137cs remained at the ground surface after the nuclear leak was stopped by emergency measures i e at the initial moment of the model the contamination zone of 137cs reached a depth of 0 311 m below the ground surface it reached the maximum depth of 0 34 m after 110 years and then shrank until its disappearance after 733 years the position of the peak radioactive concentration of 79se iv slowly moved downward from the surface the low decay rate and high adsorption rate of 79se iv caused it to remain in the vadose zone for a longer period the contamination zone reached a depth of 0 0791 m at the initial moment and reached the maximum extent of 0 786 m after 1500 years eventually the contamination zone of 79se iv disappeared at 4150 years when 79se iv contaminated as deep as 2 05 m below the surface at the end of the modeling period 137cs and 79se iv had decayed the migration of 137cs and 79se iv fully demonstrated the retention of highly adsorbed nuclides by the vadose zone and the vadose zone can be regarded as a natural barrier to protect the aquifer from contamination 4 2 2 delay and weakening effect of the vadose zone on low adsorptive nuclides 3h and 99tc vii are representative nuclides with low adsorption rates it could be observed in fig 14 that their penetration curves were asymmetric and had clear trailing at the later stage initially the infiltration of a large amount of the source liquid led to a fast nuclide migration rate subsequently the upper boundary changed to low atmospheric rainfall making the migration rate slowed down 3h and 99tc vii migrated to the phreatic surface within several years after the nuclear leakage their radioactive concentrations reached the threshold after 6 63 and 9 3 years respectively starting to pollute the phreatic surface 3h and 99tc vii reached the peak concentration 0 218x and 0 222x of the initial value after 10 9 and 23 3 years respectively subsequently their concentrations decreased below the threshold after 17 3 and 51 1 years representing the end of pollution the pollution caused by 3h and 99tc vii lasted for 10 67 and 41 8 years respectively later the residual leaching stage started which required a long time for the pollutants to flow out of the vadose zone completely there was a significant delay and weakening effect of the vadose zone on the nuclides with low adsorption rates resulting in a sufficient response time for nuclear contamination treatment radionuclides enter the aquifer through the vadose zone under the leaching of precipitation adsorption and decay slow down this process the difference in adsorption rate of the nuclides significantly affects the distribution of the radioactive concentration in the vertical direction and it is difficult for nuclides with high distribution coefficient to reach the phreatic surface the half life of different nuclides varies substantially causing the differences in the radioactive concentration and retention time in the vadose zone some radionuclides decay very rapidly and have a limited extent and duration of contamination in the vadose zone therefore the radiological risks of different nuclides can be ranked based on the distribution coefficient and half life before managing a nuclear accident 4 3 nuclide migration in the groundwater under maximum precipitation 3h and 99tc vii with low absorption rates penetrated the vadose zone and contaminated the aquifer and their dispersion ranges at different time points after the occurrence of nuclear leakage were shown in fig 15 and fig 16 the results showed that 3h and 99tc vii migrated downstream after entering the aquifer forming a pollution plume that spread due to hydrodynamic dispersion and molecular diffusion the maximum concentration area moved downward from the top of the plume over time the concentration of nuclides in the aquifer initially increased and subsequently decreased the reason for this trend is that the dilution by water and the decay of nuclides played a weakening role in the concentration of 3h whereas the recharge of the concentration flux from the vadose zone played an enhancing role in the early stage the enhancing effect was stronger resulting in the increase of the concentration when the weaking effect became greater the concentration of 3h and 99tc vii started to decrease the geological medium does not absorb 3h thereby the migration rate of 3h was similar to the groundwater flow rate due to the high delay rate the overall concentration of 3h in groundwater reduced to below the threshold after 40 years the distance from the leakage area to the leading edge of the contaminated plume was approximately 374 m in contrast the higher adsorption rate and lower delay rate of 99tc vii led to a lower diffusion rate and longer duration of the contamination plume the concentration of 99tc vii was below the pollution threshold after 3000 years and the contaminated plume extended by 833 m a key objective of the nuclide transport prediction model is the assessment of contamination trends in environmentally sensitive areas in this study the drinking water safety of residents near the farm in the southeastern portion of the study area was analyzed under maximum annual rainfall the sfrs is located far from human population centers in an area of favorable geological conditions the proposed plant site has a thin quaternary overburden and the groundwater is bedrock fracture water with a small permeability coefficient according to the simulation results fig 15 and fig 16 the contamination plumes of 3h and 99tc vii were small and they were unable to reach the farms and threaten the drinking water safety of nearby residents therefore the environmental impact of the hypothetical nuclear accident was minimal indicating that the proposed site is suitable for constructing the plant 5 conclusions a regional scale coupled vadose zone groundwater nuclide migration model was established based on field tests parameters and hydrogeological data for a proposed sfrs in northwest china the radiodynamic risks of 3h 99tc vii 137cs and 79se iv in a hypothetical nuclear accident were assessed under the most unfavorable conditions according to the results the following major conclusions were drawn 1 the vadose zone inhibited the movement of the nuclides with a high adsorption rate the maximum contamination depths of 137cs and 79se iv were 0 34 m and 2 05 m respectively 137cs and 79se iv had decayed before the end of the simulation 10 000 years and neither were predicted to contaminate the groundwater 2 the contamination zone of 137cs and 79se iv in the vadose zone was predicted to first increase then decrease and finally disappear the contamination zones of 137cs and 79se reached the maximum ranges of 0 34 m and 0 786 m after 110 and 1500 years and disappeared after 733 and 4150 years respectively 3 the vadose zone significantly delayed the movement of the nuclides with a low adsorption rate compared to when the vadose zone was not considered the contamination at the phreatic surface by 3h and 99tc vii started at 6 63 and 9 3 years and ended at 17 3 and 51 1 years lasting 10 67 and 41 8 years respectively the peak concentrations were 0 218x and 0 222x of the initial concentrations 4 after entering the aquifer the concentration of 3h and 99tc vii in the groundwater decreased to below the threshold after 40 and 3000 years respectively the distance from the leakage area to the leading edge of the contaminated plume was approximately 374 m and 833 m respectively neither 3h nor 99tc vii was predicted to threaten the drinking water safety of residents in downstream farms 5 the groundwater at the proposed plant site is bedrock fracture water with very low velocity resulting in the slow migration of nuclides the environmental impact of the hypothetical nuclear accident is predicted to be minimal thus the proposed site is suitable for the construction of the plant credit authorship contribution statement xin zhang

2503,sr isotopes have been widely used to quantify silicate versus carbonate weathering reflected in rivers but there is no such study in groundwater which is restricted by the difficulty of accurately determining the sr contents and isotopic ratios of the two endmembers in silicate dominated aquifers in a sandstone catchment we find rainwater modern groundwater in the recharge area and old groundwater in the discharge area have contrast 87sr 86sr ratios with mean values of 0 710784 0 711448 and 0 710269 respectively if we follow previous studies and use the acetic acid leachate of sandstone to represent the calcite fraction the resulting 87sr 86sr ratio cannot explain most groundwater samples by considering the simultaneous dissolution of calcite and silicates in the acetic acid leachate we find the typical 87sr 86sr ratio of calcite equals 0 709113 which well explains the 87sr 86sr ratios of all groundwater samples the 87sr 86sr ratios of groundwater in the recharge area with abundant dissolved co2 are contributed by three endmembers rainwater silicate and calcite whereas those of old groundwater in the discharge area with low dissolved co2 as well as low cl and so4 2 can be explained by two endmembers calcite and groundwater in the recharge area based on strontium isotopic budget we find the equivalent concentrations of co2 consumption by silicates and calcite in groundwater are both larger than those in river waters studied in previous studies and the majority of dissolved co2 in groundwater can be fixed by carbonate weathering as long as the residence time is long enough this study enhances understanding of the roles of silicate and carbonate weathering during long time groundwater circulation keywords chemical weathering degassing strontium isotopes leaching experiment groundwater age data availability supplementary data to this article can be found online 1 introduction the geological carbon cycle i e weathering of silicates and carbonates that consumes co2 and releases various cations and the subsequent transformation of hco3 into carbonates and co2 is a fundamental process controlling not only hydrochemical components in surface and subsurface water bodies bickle et al 2005 bufe et al 2021 harrington and herczeg 2003 tipper et al 2006a but also the long term global climate change berner 1990 gaillardet et al 1999 gernon et al 2021 because carbonates widely occur as cement or detrital grains in silicate rocks langman et al 2019 nichols 2009 white et al 2005 and are more easily weathered than silicate minerals holland 1978 roy et al 1999 carbonates and silicates are two endmembers controlling water hydrochemistry in silicate dominated watersheds in the last three decades the intensities of silicate versus carbonate weathering reflected in rivers have been intensively studied andrews and jacobson 2018 bickle et al 2005 bickle et al 2018 blum et al 1998 chao et al 2015 krishnaswami et al 1992 liu et al 2011 moon et al 2007 although groundwater is large in volume alley et al 2002 and fresh groundwater is usually abundant in hco3 the contributions of silicate and carbonate weathering reflected in groundwater are seldom explored in the literature moreover groundwater pumped from deep parts of an aquifer would inevitably undergo degassing mishra et al 2018 wood and hyndman 2017 but the concentration of hco3 in the subsurface before degassing is poorly known sr isotope ratios of water which are determined by dissolution of rocks and not fractionated by such processes as clay formation sorption and precipitation degassing removing sr are widely used to infer the rocks or minerals that water has reacted with during water circulation banner et al 1989 clarks 2015 han et al 2010 négrel et al 2001 silicates are usually high in 87sr 86sr and na sr marine carbonates are low in na sr and 87sr 86sr burke et al 1982 edmond 1992 whereas trace calcite in silicate rocks could have the same high 87sr 86sr as silicates when radiogenic sr is incorporated into calcite e g blum et al 1998 english et al 2000 jacobson et al 2003 along the flowpaths from recharge to discharge areas the trend of decreasing 87sr 86sr with flow distance has been widely reported in silicate dominated aquifers e g cartwright et al 2007 harrington and herczeg 2003 liu et al 2020 xie et al 2013 in most studies e g cartwright et al 2007 liu et al 2020 xie et al 2013 this trend was explained by mixing of groundwater with low 87sr 86sr from neighboring aquifers harrington and herczeg 2003 inferred that such a trend should be at least partly contributed by terrestrial carbonate minerals inside the aquifer unfortunately they did not identify carbonate minerals by using x ray diffractometer xrd identifying the occurrence of trace carbonate minerals in silicate dominated aquifers and accurately determining their 87sr 86sr ratio are critical to understanding the evolution of 87sr 86sr ratios of groundwater and quantify carbonate versus silicate weathering the step leaching experiment has been widely used to separate trace carbonates from silicates i e acetic acid leachates are used to represent pure carbonates lehn et al 2017 vivo et al 1989 yang et al 2001 and residues to represent the silicates fraction chen et al 2007 phan et al 2018 stille et al 1989 in fact silicate dissolution would inevitably occur in the step of acetic acid leach andrews et al 2016 bailey et al 2000 jacobson and blum 2000 leading to overestimation of carbonate derived sr and the typical 87sr 86sr of carbonates baublys et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 in the cretaceous sandstone aquifer of the ordos basin china there is a trend of decreasing 87sr 86sr form the recharge to the discharge area ji et al 2022 lyu et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 but groundwater in the discharge area could have 87sr 86sr ratio as low as 0 709742 which is much lower than that of calcite represented by acetic acid leachates of sand or sandstone ranging from 0 710425 to 0 711176 rao et al 2015 because there is no carbonate aquifer with low 87sr 86sr ratios underlying the sandstone aquifer in the basin this phenomenon calls for an improved approach to obtain the 87sr 86sr of trace calcite in sandstone in this study we attempt to quantify the evolution of silicate and carbonate weathering reflected in groundwater by using the trend of decreasing 87sr 86sr ratios from recharge to discharge areas to do this we first use a mass balance model to obtain the typical 87sr 86sr and sr na of the calcite and silicates endmembers in sandstone by considering the simultaneous dissolution of carbonates and silicates in the acetic acid leachate a three endmember rainwater silicates and calcite strontium isotopic budget model is developed to quantify silicate versus calcite weathering in the recharge area whereas a two endmember groundwater in the recharge area and calcite model is proposed to quantify silicate versus calcite weathering in the discharge area note that the neglect of the silicate endmember in the discharge area is supported by the behavior of li isotopes from recharge to discharge areas reported in a recent study fig s1 ji et al 2022 this study leads to a clear understanding of co2 consumption and the source of hco3 in groundwater 2 methods 2 1 study area and sampling the ordos plateau in northwestern china is one of the most intensively studied groundwater basins of china hou et al 2017 jiang et al 2017 due to the semi arid climate groundwater is the only water supply in the basin the northeast southwest trending sishi ridge which has an elevation of 1 400 1 500 m above sea level constitutes the first order divide inside the ordos plateau fig 1 as a result of the undulating topography the ordos plateau can be divided into numerous sub basins where groundwater flows from topographic highs to topographic lows the thick cretaceous sandstone with a maximum thickness of around 950 m constitutes the main aquifer system of ordos plateau jiang et al 2012 as shown in the geological cross section a a fig 2 the aquifer system consists mainly of k1 h and k1 l sandstones the former was deposited in a fluvial environment whereas the latter was deposited in an eolian environment in the east and in a fluvial environment in the west in the fluvial sandstone there are numerous sporadic clay lenses but no continuous aquitards the study area of the current study is mainly located in the wudu lake catchment fig 1 which covers an area of about 200 km2 note that there is no river in the catchment and precipitation is the only source of groundwater recharge more detailed description of the wudu lake catchment can be found in wang et al 2015 and ji et al 2022 the numerous wells with different depths drilled into the cretaceous sandstone for irrigation and domestic uses in the wudu lake catchment provide an excellent opportunity to obtain groundwater samples with different ages in the summers of 2017 and 2018 19 groundwater samples were collected in the study area before sampling ph temperature and electrical conductivity ec were measured in the field and water sampling began when all parameters mentioned above reaching a steady state samples for 3h and 14c dating were directly stored in ldpe bottles while other samples for elemental and isotopic analysis were stored in ldpe bottles after passing through 0 2 μm filters samples for measurements of cations and isotopes were acidified to ph 2 with double distilled hno3 among the 19 groundwater samples 6 were collected from wells near the divide of the watershed to represent groundwater in the recharge area rg and 13 were collected from wells near lakes to represent groundwater in the discharge area dg the 6 samples in the recharge area are further divided into subgroup rg1 rg1 1 through rg1 3 and subgroup rg2 rg2 1 through rg2 3 when necessary note that the 13 wells in the discharge area are all flowing wells with water overflowing at the well outlet which are ideal for collecting water mainly from the lower half part of the well zhang et al 2019 the 13 samples in discharge areas are divided into three subgroups dg1 dg2 and dg3 dg1 includes 6 samples from shallow flowing wells dg1 1 through dg1 6 with depths ranging from 70 to 120 m dg2 includes 5 samples from deeper flowing wells dg2 1 through dg2 5 with depths of around 300 m and dg3 includes 2 samples from flowing wells drilled to the bottom of cretaceous sandstone aquifer dg3 1 and dg3 2 to identify the mineralogy of sandstone we collected two rock samples in the wudu lake catchment and one rock sample in a neighboring catchment we also collect measurements of major ions as well as 87sr 86sr ratios of four rainwater samples corresponding to four precipitation events in the city near our study area to consider its contribution as an endmember 2 2 geochemical analyses the hco3 and co3 2 of groundwater were analyzed by titration in the field the partial pressure of co2 p co2 in groundwater was calculated by the watspec program wigley 1977 the cl so4 2 and no3 were analyzed by ion chromatography ics 900 dionex and na k mg2 and ca2 were measured by inductively coupled plasma icp oes 900 thermo at the ministry of education key laboratory of groundwater circulation and environmental evolution china university of geosciences trace elements like li and sr2 were measured using a perkinelmer nexion 300d icp ms sio2 was analyzed by using the molybdenum blue spectrophotometer method with a t6 uv spectrophotometer three sandstone samples were crushed and the mineralogical and elemental compositions of these samples were determined by d max2500 x ray diffractometer at the xi an center of geological survey and pw4400 x ray fluorescence spectrometer at national research center of geoanalysis respectively the measurements of 87sr 86sr ratios of groundwater and rock samples were completed by a neptune plus mc icp ms at the ministry of education key laboratory of surficial geochemistry of nanjing university the 3h measurements were completed at the institute of hydrogeology and environmental geology chinese academy of geological sciences and and the 14c measurements at the beta analytic inc miami florida usa the details of sr isotopic purification and analysis and of 3h and 14c measurement have been reported in ji et al 2022 thus are not repeated here 2 3 interpretation of the leaching experiment the leaching experiment is conducted by following the protocol in previous studies banner et al 1994 jacobson and blum 2000 zhou et al 2009 with moderate modifications to the concentrations of the acetic acid and time of dissolution in detail 2 g of each sandstone powder was first dissolved with 50 ml deionized water at room temperature for 24 h the solutions were centrifuged and passed through 0 45 μm filters to obtain deionized water leachates the residues were then dissolved with 50 ml 0 05 m acetic acid solutions at room temperature for 24 h which were centrifuged and passed through 0 45 μm filters to obtain acetic acid leachates 2 3 1 determination of sr isotopes and typical sr content of silicates and calcite the residue of each sample which represents the silicates fraction is used to measure the 87sr 86sr of silicates in sandstone 87sr 86sr sil and the acetic acid leachate of each sample is used to measure the concentrations of cations as well as 87sr 86sr ratios taking average value of 87sr 86sr sil of different samples leads to 87 sr 86 sr sil while extrapolating the linear relationship between 87sr 86sr and na sr of leachates at na sr 0 leads to 87 sr 86 sr cal in the acetic acid leachate the relationship between concentration of sr2 derived from silicates sr2 sil l μg l and concentration of sr2 derived from calcite sr2 cal l μg l can be expressed as 1a sr 2 l sr 2 sil l sr 2 cal l 1b sr 2 l 87 sr 86 sr l sr 2 sil l 87 sr 86 sr sil sr 2 cal l 87 sr 86 sr cal where sr2 l μg l and 87sr 86sr l are sr content and isotopic ratios in the leachate respectively equations 1a and 1b lead to sr2 sil l and sr2 cal l of each sample for each sandstone sample sr content in per gram calcite sr cal can be obtained as follows multiplying sr2 cal l and the volume of acetic acid solution 50 ml and then divided by the mass of sandstone 2 g leads to sr content of calcite in per gram sandstone which is denoted as sr cal sandstone sr cal equals sr cal sandstone divided by the proportion of calcite in sandstone measured by xrd sr content in per gram silicates sr sil can be obtained as follows sr content of silicates in per gram sandstone denoted as sr sil sandstone equals the total sr content determined by xrf analysis subtracted by sr cal sandstone because the geochemical behavior of sr is very similar to that of ca we assume that plagioclase and hornblende that contain ca are two main sr bearing silicates therefore sr content in per gram silicates sr sil equals sr sil sandstone divided by the proportion of sr bearing silicates plagioclase and hornblende measured by xrd 2 3 2 determination of ca content of silicates ca in the acetic acid leachate is also contributed by dissolution of both calcite and silicates the relationship between calcite derived ca silicate derived ca and total ca in per liter leachate can be written as 2 ca 2 l m cal l ca cal m sil l ca sil where ca2 l μg l refers to the total dissolved ca in each leachate sample ca cal μg g represents the typical ca content of pure calcite equaling 400 000 μg g ca sil μg g refers to the typical ca content of silicates for each leachate sample m cal l g l and m sil l g l are the masses of dissolved calcite and silicates in per liter leachate because the geochemical behavior of sr is very similar to that of ca we use the following two equations to obtain m cal l and m sil l 3a m cal l sr 2 cal l sr cal 3b m sil l sr 2 sil l sr sil substitute equations 3a and 3b into equation 2 we can obtain the following equation for determining ca sil of each sample 4 ca sil ca 2 l m cal l ca cal m sil l the mean value of ca sil obtained by different samples represents the typical ca content in the silicates endmember ca sil μg g 3 results and discussion 3 1 chemical compositions and sr isotopic ratios of endmembers 3 1 1 rainwater and sandstone rainwater which is the only source of groundwater recharge in our study area should be an endmember of groundwater chemistry for the four rainwater samples the 87sr 86sr ratios range from 0 710637 to 0 710913 table s1 with a mean value of 0 710784 table 1 the rainwater samples have concentrations of so4 2 ranging from 28 43 to 88 40 mg l the so4 2 brought by rainwater is a direct source of so4 2 in shallow groundwater in our study area groundwater chemistry is determined by the interaction of water with different minerals in the cretaceous sandstone according to xrd measurements the sandstone samples are mainly composed of quartz silicates calcite and clay minerals table s2 the percentage of silicates including plagioclase and hornblende ranges between 31 3 and 56 4 whereas the percentage of calcite varies between 2 1 and 2 9 the occurrence of silicates and calcite in sandstone in this study area are similar to the simultaneous occurrence of carbonates and silicates in granitoid rocks boettinger and southard 1991 white et al 2005 we also find montmorillonite is the main weathering product during silicate weathering which is widespread in regions with a semi arid climate chamley 1989 sun et al 2011 3 1 2 calcite and silicates endmembers determined by acetic acid leachates and residues of sandstone the acetic acid leachates of three sandstone samples have narrow variations in concentrations of cations table s3 the mean concentrations of li k and na in the sandstone leachates which are derived from silicates are 27 31 μg l 21 51 mg l and 26 17 mg l respectively the high concentrations of k and na indicate that silicate dissolution has contributions to the leachate therefore the high mean concentrations of sr2 mg2 and ca2 in the sandstone leachates equaling 2 59 mg l 69 23 mg l and 857 21 mg l respectively should be contributed by dissolution of both silicates and calcite the linear relationship between 87sr 86sr ratios and na sr of the three sandstone leachates yields a 87sr 86sr ratio of 0 709113 at na sr 0 which can be interpreted as the 87sr 86sr ratio of the calcite endmember 87 sr 86 sr cal in our study area fig 3 a table 1 for the two sandstone samples in the wudu lake catchment the residues of the two rock samples which represent the silicate fractions have 87sr 86sr ratios equaling 0 714543 and 0 713433 respectively we use the mean of the two equaling 0 713988 to represent the 87sr 86sr ratio of the silicate endmember 87 sr 86 sr sil table 1 the linear relationship between 87sr 86sr ratios and na sr also yields a typical na sr of 72 0 for silicates at 87sr 86sr 0 713988 fig 3a the typical na sr for silicates is within the range of na sr molar ratios from 29 1 to 1179 5 in the leachates of low calcite 0 02 wt granitoid rock samples reported in white et al 2005 by using equations 1a and 1b we obtain sr2 sil l and sr2 cal l in each leachate sample which can be transformed into sr sil and sr cal of each sandstone sample the sr sil of rk1 and rk2 are calculated to be 645 5 ppm and 764 3 ppm respectively the sr cal of rk1 and rk2 are calculated to be 1158 1 ppm and 1095 9 ppm respectively by taking mean values of the two rock samples sr sil equals 704 9 ppm whereas sr cal equals 1127 0 ppm table 1 based on the typical na sr of silicates equaling 72 0 the typical na content in silicates is determined to be 13266 6 ppm as shown in fig 3a on the plot of 87sr 86sr versus na sr the three endmembers well explain all groundwater samples in the recharge area rg1 and rg2 and the samples with limited influence by evaporites in the discharge area however if we follow previous studies e g lehn et al 2017 moore et al 2013 rao et al 2015 i e use the acetic acid leachate to represent the calcite fraction and the residue to represent the pure silicates endmember most groundwater samples cannot be explained by the three endmembers fig 3b 3 2 evolution of sr contents and 87sr 86sr of groundwater with increasing age in our previous study ji et al 2022 li isotopes have shown that silicate weathering occurs in the recharge area but does not occur along the flowpaths from deep part of recharge area to discharge area and adsorption is responsible for li removal in the discharge area where co2 is limited fig s1 the decreased sr contents in the deep part of discharge area dg2 and dg3 indicate that sr has been partly removed by adsorption for convenience of understanding the evolution of groundwater chemistry and sr isotopes with flow distance in fig 4 we schematically show the locations mean contents of dissolved co2 mean sr contents and mean 87sr 86sr of groundwater in sub groups rg dg1and dg2 some of the proceses contributing to the evolution of sr contents and 87sr 86sr are identified in this subsection whereas others are identified in subsections 3 4 and 3 5 3 2 1 modern groundwater in the recharge area the 3h concentrations of two samples in the recharge area are 31 7 tu and 9 2 tu table s1 respectively the high 3h indicates that groundwater in the recharge area belongs to modern groundwater recharged from recent precipitation the six groundwater samples in the recharge area have hco3 contents ranging from 203 92 to 223 51 mg l which are much higher than that of rainwater equaling 27 56 mg l the increased hco3 from rainwater to groundwater indicates the occurrence of weathering releasing hco3 into groundwater although the sample rg2 2 has higher concentrations of no3 and sr2 than the sample rg2 3 the two samples have almost the same 87sr 86sr therefore we assume that the possible influence of anthropogenic pollution on sr contents and sr isotopic ratios is negligible as shown in fig 3 groundwater in the recharge area has higher 87sr 86sr ratios than rainwater bullen et al 1996 and katz and bullen 1996 observed a similar phenomenon in their study areas and proposed that it was caused by weathering of k feldspar based on fig 3a the silicates endmember is responsible for the higher 87sr 86sr ratios of groundwater but silicate weathering and calcite weathering are both responsible for the high sr contents of groundwater 3 2 2 old groundwater in the discharge area the 3h concentrations of samples in the discharge area are close to 1 tu and the 14c dating shows ages ranging from 6110 to 29510 years table s1 two samples in subgroup dg1 have ages of 6110 and 7800 years two samples in subgroup dg2 have ages of 13 810 and 15860 years while the two samples in subgroup dg3 have ages of 26 980 and 29510 years showing a trend of increasing age from shallow to deep flowing wells from the recharge to the discharge area there are also trends of decreasing concentrations of dissolved co2 and increasing ph which indicate co2 consumption as well as a trend of decreasing 87sr 86sr ratio fig 5 a b showing occurrence of weathering of endmembers calcite and or evaporites with low 87sr 86sr ratio along the flowpath however due to hydrochemical processes removing cations ca na and mg na decrease with the decreasing 87sr 86sr ratios fig 5c d due to processes removing ca a similar relationship between 87sr 86sr ratio and ca along flowpaths was also reported in xie et al 2013 among the 13 old groundwater samples in the discharge area some have low whereas others have high contents of so4 2 and cl fig 6 the high contents of so4 2 and cl in subgroups dg2 and dg3 are evidence of dissolution of residual evaporites along the flowpath whereas the low contents of so4 2 and cl in subgroup dg1 are evidence of limited residual evaporites along the flowpath the residual evaporites in the aquifer are a possible endmember with low 87sr 86sr ratios clark 2015 gaillardet et al 1997 however as shown in fig 6 a large increase in cl or so4 2 in subgroup dg2 only leads to a small decrease in 87sr 86sr ratios implying that the effect of evaporites on 87sr 86sr ratios is limited moreover in subgroup dg1 there is a large variation in 87sr 86sr even if cl hardly changes and contents of so4 2 are low indicating that evaporite dissolution is not the cause of the low 87sr 86sr in the discharge area from the sampling points in subgroup rg2 in the deep part of the recharge area to groundwater in the discharge area silicate weathering seldom occurs because of the increasingly lower dissolved co2 along the flowpath which is supported by li isotopes fig s1 the plot of 87sr 86sr versus mg sr fig 7 shows that groundwater in subgroup rg2 and calcite are two endmembers of groundwater in discharge area even though mg and sr are both partly removed during the flowpaths from recharge to discharge areas 3 3 silicate and calcite weathering reflected in recharge area groundwater 3 3 1 determination of dissolved silicates and calcite using a three endmember model négrel et al 1993 proposed a method to calculate the contributions of different endmembers to river water by using budgets of cl na mg ca sr and 87sr 86sr which has been widely used in river water studies bickle et al 2005 gaillardet et al 1999 yu et al 2021 in in the recharge area we only need to consider three endmembers rainwater silicates and calcite by assuming that per liter groundwater in the recharge area is evolved from per liter infiltrated rainwater and there is no loss of dissolved sr2 in the recharge area we use the following two equations to quantify the contributions by silicate and carbonate weathering 5a sr 2 rg sr 2 rw m sil sr sil m cal sr cal 5b sr 2 rg 87 sr 86 sr rg sr 2 rw 87 sr 86 sr rw m sil sr sil 87 sr 86 sr sil m cal sr cal 87 sr 86 sr cal where sr2 rg μg l and 87sr 86sr rg are sr contents and 87sr 86sr ratios of groundwater samples in the recharge area respectively sr 2 rw μg l and 87 sr 86 sr ra are sr content and 87sr 86sr ratios of the rainwater endmember respectively sr sil μg g and sr cal μg g are typical sr contents in silicates and calcite respectively 87 sr 86 sr sil and 87 sr 86 sr cal are typical 87sr 86sr ratios of silicates and calcite respectively m sil g l and m cal g l are the masses of dissolved silicates and calcite in per liter water respectively by substituting the sr contents and 87sr 86sr ratios of the three endmembers listed in table 1 into equations 5a and 5b m sil and m cal in the recharge area can be obtained table 2 based on the typical sr contents of calcite and silicates for each groundwater sample we can also obtain the concentration of silicate derived sr2 in water sr2 sil w and the concentration of calcite derived sr2 in water sr2 cal w table 2 subgroup rg1 has a mean sr2 sil w sr2 cal w equaling 1 51 whereas subgroup rg2 has a mean sr2 sil w sr2 cal w equaling 1 05 the ratio sr2 sil w sr2 cal w being larger than 1 0 well explains why the sr isotopic ratios of groundwater in the recharge area are higher than those of rainwater 3 3 2 determination of co2 consumption by silicates and calcite because plagioclase is the dominant silicate in our study area we assume that the ca na ratio of silicates equaling 7 18 mol mol as listed in table 1 represents the ca na ratio of plagioclase in our study area therefore the chemical formula of silicates in our study area can be approximated as na0 12ca0 88al1 88si2 12o8 because montmorillonite is the major product of silicate weathering in our study area following drever 1997 the reaction of plagioclase with co2 can be expressed as 6 7 45 na 0 12 ca 0 88 al 1 88 si 2 12 o 8 12 co 2 6 2 si oh 4 0 89 na 5 56ca 2 3ca 0 33 al 4 67 si 7 33 o 20 oh 4 ca montmorillonite 12hco 3 0 4h 2 o the reaction of calcite with co2 can be written as 7 caco 3 co 2 h 2 o ca 2 2hco 3 based on m sil and m cal of each sample and the formula of plagioclase weathering and calcite weathering given in equations 6 and 7 the equivalent concentration of co2 consumed by silicates co2 sil and the equivalent concentration of co2 consumed by calcite co2 cal of each sample can be calculated directly table 2 co2 sil ranges from 1 29 to 1 94 mmol l whereas co2 cal varies from 0 95 to 1 87 mmol l we find co2 sil and co2 cal of groundwater in our study area are within the ranges of co2 sil and co2 cal in the 51 global rivers studied in gaillardet et al 1999 fig 8 indicating that the results of our calculation are reliable 3 4 silicate and calcite weathering reflected in discharge area groundwater with low concentrations of dissolved co2 3 4 1 determination of additional calcite weathering using a two endmember model as shown in fig 7 the sr isotope ratios of groundwater in discharge areas can be explained by mixing of two endmembers i e groundwater in subgroup rg2 and the trace calcite considering that sr2 have been partly removed along the long distance flowpaths by assuming that per liter groundwater in the discharge area is evolved from per liter groundwater in subgroup rg2 with an additional weathering of δm cal g l calcite the strontium isotopic budget can be written as 8 sr 2 rg2 δ m cal sr cal 87 sr 86 sr dg sr 2 rg2 87 sr 86 sr rg2 δ m cal sr cal 87 sr 86 sr cal where sr 2 rg2 μg l and 87 sr 86 sr rg2 are typical sr content and 87sr 86sr ratio in subgroup rg2 respectively 87 sr 86 sr dg is the 87sr 86sr ratio of a groundwater sample in the discharge area by rearranging equation 8 δm cal g can be obtained as 9 δ m cal sr 2 rg2 87 sr 86 sr rg2 87 sr 87 sr dg sr cal 87 sr 86 sr dg 87 sr 86 sr cal according to equation 9 δm cal ranges from 0 93 to 12 28 mmol l based on the binary mixing model we find f cal ranges from 19 0 to 75 7 fig 9 3 4 2 weathering in the discharge area based on equation 7 the required equivalent concentration of co2 consumption by additional calcite weathering δ co2 cal ranges from 0 93 mmol l to 12 28 mmol l however we find δ co2 cal of several samples sample dg1 2 and all samples in dg2 and dg3 are larger than the highest concentration of dissolved co2 in the recharge area equaling 4 37 mmol l sample rg2 3 table 2 if the upper limit of available co2 for additional weathering of calcite equals 4 37 mmol l we infer that the low 87sr 86sr ratios of these samples sample dg1 2 and all samples in dg2 and dg3 are caused not only by calcite weathering but also by calcite fluid equilibrium fantle and depaolo 2006 zhang and depaolo 2020 that does not consume co2 fig 4 hereafter we only use the five samples in dg1 dg1 2 excluded to discuss calcite weathering in the discharge area fig 9 table 3 we assume that the equivalent concentration of co2 consumed by silicates co2 sil of each sample in the discharge area equals 1 54 mmol l which is the mean co2 sil in subgroup rg2 the equivalent concentration of co2 consumed by calcite co2 cal can be obtained by the sum of average co2 cal in rg2 equaling 1 58 mmol l and δ co2 cal of each sample we find co2 cal of groundwater in the discharge area ranges from 2 51 to 4 97 mmol l which is larger than the maximum of co2 carb equaling 1 56 mmol l in the 51 large rivers studied in gaillerdet et al 1999 3 5 calculated hco3 versus measured hco3 implications to the degree of degassing based on equations 6 and 7 we can obtain the concentration of hco3 generated by silicate weathering hco3 sil and the concentration of hco3 generated by calcite weathering hco3 cal in the recharge area by adding hco3 from three sources i e silicate weathering calcite weathering and rainwater the calculated contents of hco3 range from 3 74 to 5 97 mmol l table 2 which are in the same order of magnitude as measured hco3 ranging between 3 34 and 3 66 mmol l fig 10 shows the relationship between calculated hco3 and measured hco3 of the 6 samples in the recharge area the measured hco3 being lower than the calculated hco3 can be explained by neoformation of clay minerals which would generate h and lead to co2 emission by reacting with hco3 for groundwater in the 5 samples in subgroup dg1 the measured hco3 co3 2 varying between 3 03 and 3 29 mmol l with a mean of 3 17 mmol l which is slightly lower than the measured hco3 co3 2 varying between 3 34 and 3 66 mmol l in the recharge area fig 11 this leads to the impression that only a small proportion of hco3 has been removed by degassing in fact the calculated hco3 ranges from 7 00 to 11 93 mmol l with a mean of 10 18 mmol l in subgroup dg1 table 3 fig 11 indicating that around 2 3 of total hco3 has been removed by degassing when groundwater flows from the deep to the well outlet fig 4 due to the difficulty of determining hco3 before degassing some previous studies mishra et al 2018 wood and hyndman 2017 simply assumed that the concentration of hco3 in groundwater before degassing equals twice of measured hco3 after degassing this indicates that the degree of degassing was underestimated in previous studies due to the removal of selected cations during the degassing process the residual ca2 mg2 and sr2 in groundwater samples could not represent the actual cations derived from calcite and silicates causing difficulty of using the plot of ca na versus mg na to quantify silicate and calcite weathering in this process precipitation of carbonates would cause ca and mg isotope fractionation lee et al 2014 tipper et al 2006b but does not change 87sr 86sr frost and toner 2004 négrel et al 2001 we believe that our method which quantitatively determined the weathered silicates and calcite in groundwater with improved mass balance equations of sr isotopes would be valuable to estimate the potential of deep aquifers as carbon sinks 3 6 the control of residence time and co2 availability on the ratio of silicate to calcite weathering because co2 consumed by carbonates and co2 consumed by silicates have different fates when hco3 got precipitated the ratio of co2 sil to co2 cal co2 sil co2 cal is critical to understanding the role of geological carbon cycle in global climate change among the 51 rivers studied in gaillardet et al 1999 31 rivers have co2 sil co2 cal 1 whereas 20 rivers have co2 sil co2 cal 1 therefore calcite weathering plays a larger role than silicate weathering in 61 of the rivers in our study area we find co2 sil co2 cal ranges from 1 33 to 1 47 in subgroup rg1 table 2 this could be a result of the high availability of co2 in the initial stage of groundwater circulation as well as the longer reaction times of groundwater than river water this is consistent with tipper et al s 2006a inference that a longer residence time of shallow groundwater would allow further dissolution of silicates and is also consistent with calmels et al s 2011 observation that 87sr 86sr ratios of shallow groundwater are higher than those of river water from rapid surface runoff based on the difference in 3h between subgroups rg1 and rg2 we infer that samples in subgroup rg2 have longer reaction times than samples in subgroup rg1 as shown in table 2 subgroup rg2 has almost the same mean co2 sil as subgroup rg1 but has larger mean co2 cal than subgroup rg1 therefore co2 sil co2 cal of subgroup rg2 ranges from 0 95 to 0 99 this is consistent with the slightly lower 87sr 86sr in subgroup rg2 than in subgroup rg1 in the discharge area we find co2 sil co2 cal ranges from 0 31 to 0 61 therefore when the concentration of dissolved co2 in groundwater is not high enough the remaining co2 cannot be consumed by silicates but can be consumed by calcite causing lower 87sr 86sr as reported in jasechko et al 2017 fossil groundwater comprises around 42 85 of total groundwater in the crust s uppermost 1 km therefore we believe that deep aquifers with fossil groundwater can be important carbon sinks which is consistent with the speculations in previous studies schopka and derry 2012 zhang and planavsky 2019 3 7 implications for interpreting sr isotopes in acetic acid leachates and silicate dominated aquifers in our study area old groundwater contributed by calcite weathering in the discharge area has low 87sr 86sr ratios but the calcite endmember represented by acetic acid leachates of sandstone has higher 87sr 86sr ratios than old groundwater based on this paradox we realize the shortcoming of using the acetic acid leachate to represent calcite we find the assumption that acetic acid leachates are contributed solely by calcite dissolution leads to not only erroneous 87sr 86sr and sr na of calcite but also erroneous sr na of silicates the proposed method in this study would be useful for interpreting the acetic acid leachate of rocks in future studies due to the poor understanding of 87sr 86sr of trace calcite in silicate dominated aquifer many existing studies attributed the decreasing 87sr 86sr of groundwater with flow distance to overlying or underlying sources with low 87sr 86sr ratios we believe that our approach can be applied to re interpret the evolution of 87sr 86sr in some silicate dominated aquifers which might lead to increased understanding of the potential of groundwater as a carbon sink 4 summary weathering of silicates and calcite largely determines the hydrochemical components of groundwater in sandstone aquifers but the occurrence of geochemical processes removing ions like ca2 mg2 sr2 k li and hco3 makes it difficult to infer the degrees of silicate and calcite weathering in groundwater by using cations only in this study we propose a three endmember strontium isotopic budget model for quantifying silicate and calcite weathering in the recharge area and a two endmember model for silicate and calcite weathering in the discharge area because of the abundant co2 in the vadose zone and in the shallow part of the aquifer and the longer residence time than river water we find the equivalent concentrations of co2 consumed by silicate and carbonate weathering in modern groundwater with ages 70 years are much larger than the majority of rivers studied by gaillerdet et al 1999 more evidences by using other isotopes are expected to identify the effect of residence times and availability of co2 on silicate and carbonate weathering in various water bodies the sr isotopes of old groundwater in discharge areas with ages in the range of 6000 8000 years reveal that the equivalent concentration of co2 consumption by carbonate weathering is higher than the maximum value in the 51 global rivers and the majority of total dissolved co2 has been transformed into hco3 or co3 2 by weathering further investigations are expected to examine the role of sandstone aquifers as a carbon sink this study increases understanding of the control of sr isotope evolution and processes of chemical weathering during groundwater circulation in silicate dominated aquifers the proposed method in this study would be valuable for investigating the roles of silicate and carbonate weathering in various water bodies in the future more studies are expected to identify whether silicate weathering or carbonate weathering dominates in groundwater with different ages in silicates dominated aquifers declaration

2503,sr isotopes have been widely used to quantify silicate versus carbonate weathering reflected in rivers but there is no such study in groundwater which is restricted by the difficulty of accurately determining the sr contents and isotopic ratios of the two endmembers in silicate dominated aquifers in a sandstone catchment we find rainwater modern groundwater in the recharge area and old groundwater in the discharge area have contrast 87sr 86sr ratios with mean values of 0 710784 0 711448 and 0 710269 respectively if we follow previous studies and use the acetic acid leachate of sandstone to represent the calcite fraction the resulting 87sr 86sr ratio cannot explain most groundwater samples by considering the simultaneous dissolution of calcite and silicates in the acetic acid leachate we find the typical 87sr 86sr ratio of calcite equals 0 709113 which well explains the 87sr 86sr ratios of all groundwater samples the 87sr 86sr ratios of groundwater in the recharge area with abundant dissolved co2 are contributed by three endmembers rainwater silicate and calcite whereas those of old groundwater in the discharge area with low dissolved co2 as well as low cl and so4 2 can be explained by two endmembers calcite and groundwater in the recharge area based on strontium isotopic budget we find the equivalent concentrations of co2 consumption by silicates and calcite in groundwater are both larger than those in river waters studied in previous studies and the majority of dissolved co2 in groundwater can be fixed by carbonate weathering as long as the residence time is long enough this study enhances understanding of the roles of silicate and carbonate weathering during long time groundwater circulation keywords chemical weathering degassing

and carbonates that consumes co2 and releases various cations and the subsequent transformation of hco3 into carbonates and co2 is a fundamental process controlling not only hydrochemical components in surface and subsurface water bodies bickle et al 2005 bufe et al 2021 harrington and herczeg 2003 tipper et al 2006a but also the long term global climate change berner 1990 gaillardet et al 1999 gernon et al 2021 because carbonates widely occur as cement or detrital grains in silicate rocks langman et al 2019 nichols 2009 white et al 2005 and are more easily weathered than silicate minerals holland 1978 roy et al 1999 carbonates and silicates are two endmembers controlling water hydrochemistry in silicate dominated watersheds in the last three decades the intensities of silicate versus carbonate weathering reflected in rivers have been intensively studied andrews and jacobson 2018 bickle et al 2005 bickle et al 2018 blum et al 1998 chao et al 2015 krishnaswami et al 1992 liu et al 2011 moon et al 2007 although groundwater is large in volume alley et al 2002 and fresh groundwater is usually abundant in hco3 the contributions of silicate and carbonate weathering reflected in groundwater are seldom explored in the literature moreover groundwater pumped from deep parts of an aquifer would inevitably undergo degassing mishra et al 2018 wood and hyndman 2017 but the concentration of hco3 in the subsurface before degassing is poorly known sr isotope ratios of water which are determined by dissolution of rocks and not fractionated by such processes as clay formation sorption and precipitation degassing removing sr are widely used to infer the rocks or minerals that water has reacted with during water circulation banner et al 1989 clarks 2015 han et al 2010 négrel et al 2001 silicates are usually high in 87sr 86sr and na sr marine carbonates are low in na sr and 87sr 86sr burke et al 1982 edmond 1992 whereas trace calcite in silicate rocks could have the same high 87sr 86sr as silicates when radiogenic sr is incorporated into calcite e g blum et al 1998 english et al 2000 jacobson et al 2003 along the flowpaths from recharge to discharge areas the trend of decreasing 87sr 86sr with flow distance has been widely reported in silicate dominated aquifers e g cartwright et al 2007 harrington and herczeg 2003 liu et al 2020 xie et al 2013 in most studies e g cartwright et al 2007 liu et al 2020 xie et al 2013 this trend was explained by mixing of groundwater with low 87sr 86sr from neighboring aquifers harrington and herczeg 2003 inferred that such a trend should be at least partly contributed by terrestrial carbonate minerals inside the aquifer unfortunately they did not identify carbonate minerals by using x ray diffractometer xrd identifying the occurrence of trace carbonate minerals in silicate dominated aquifers and accurately determining their 87sr 86sr ratio are critical to understanding the evolution of 87sr 86sr ratios of groundwater and quantify carbonate versus silicate weathering the step leaching experiment has been widely used to separate trace carbonates from silicates i e acetic acid leachates are used to represent pure carbonates lehn et al 2017 vivo et al 1989 yang et al 2001 and residues to represent the silicates fraction chen et al 2007 phan et al 2018 stille et al 1989 in fact silicate dissolution would inevitably occur in the step of acetic acid leach andrews et al 2016 bailey et al 2000 jacobson and blum 2000 leading to overestimation of carbonate derived sr and the typical 87sr 86sr of carbonates baublys et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 in the cretaceous sandstone aquifer of the ordos basin china there is a trend of decreasing 87sr 86sr form the recharge to the discharge area ji et al 2022 lyu et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 but groundwater in the discharge area could have 87sr 86sr ratio as low as 0 709742 which is much lower than that of calcite represented by acetic acid leachates of sand or sandstone ranging from 0 710425 to 0 711176 rao et al 2015 because there is no carbonate aquifer with low 87sr 86sr ratios underlying the sandstone aquifer in the basin this phenomenon calls for an improved approach to obtain the 87sr 86sr of trace calcite in sandstone in this study we attempt to quantify the evolution of silicate and carbonate weathering reflected in groundwater by using the trend of decreasing 87sr 86sr ratios from recharge to discharge areas to do this we first use a mass balance model to obtain the typical 87sr 86sr and sr na of the calcite and silicates endmembers in sandstone by considering the simultaneous dissolution of carbonates and silicates in the acetic acid leachate a three endmember rainwater silicates and calcite strontium isotopic budget model is developed to quantify silicate versus calcite weathering in the recharge area whereas a two endmember groundwater in the recharge area and calcite model is proposed to quantify silicate versus calcite weathering in the discharge area note that the neglect of the silicate endmember in the discharge area is supported by the behavior of li isotopes from recharge to discharge areas reported in a recent study fig s1 ji et al 2022 this study leads to a clear understanding of co2 consumption and the source of hco3 in groundwater 2 methods 2 1 study area and sampling the ordos plateau in northwestern china is one of the most intensively studied groundwater basins of china hou et al 2017 jiang et al 2017 due to the semi arid climate groundwater is the only water supply in the basin the northeast southwest trending sishi ridge which has an elevation of 1 400 1 500 m above sea level constitutes the first order divide inside the ordos plateau fig 1 as a result of the undulating topography the ordos plateau can be divided into numerous sub basins where groundwater flows from topographic highs to topographic lows the thick cretaceous sandstone with a maximum thickness of around 950 m constitutes the main aquifer system of ordos plateau jiang et al 2012 as shown in the geological cross section a a fig 2 the aquifer system consists mainly of k1 h and k1 l sandstones the former was deposited in a fluvial environment whereas the latter was deposited in an eolian environment in the east and in a fluvial environment in the west in the fluvial sandstone there are numerous sporadic clay lenses but no continuous aquitards the study area of the current study is mainly located in the wudu lake catchment fig 1 which covers an area of about 200 km2 note that there is no river in the catchment and precipitation is the only source of groundwater recharge more detailed description of the wudu lake catchment can be found in wang et al 2015 and ji et al 2022 the numerous wells with different depths drilled into the cretaceous sandstone for irrigation and domestic uses in the wudu lake catchment provide an excellent opportunity to obtain groundwater samples with different ages in the summers of 2017 and 2018 19 groundwater samples were collected in the study area before sampling ph temperature and electrical conductivity ec were measured in the field and water sampling began when all parameters mentioned above reaching a steady state samples for 3h and 14c dating were directly stored in ldpe bottles while other samples for elemental and isotopic analysis were stored in ldpe bottles after passing through 0 2 μm filters samples for measurements of cations and isotopes were acidified to ph 2 with double distilled hno3 among the 19 groundwater samples 6 were collected from wells near the divide of the watershed to represent groundwater in the recharge area rg and 13 were collected from wells near lakes to represent groundwater in the discharge area dg the 6 samples in the recharge area are further divided into subgroup rg1 rg1 1 through rg1 3 and subgroup rg2 rg2 1 through rg2 3 when necessary note that the 13 wells in the discharge area are all flowing wells with water overflowing at the well outlet which are ideal for collecting water mainly from the lower half part of the well zhang et al 2019 the 13 samples in discharge areas are divided into three subgroups dg1 dg2 and dg3 dg1 includes 6 samples from shallow flowing wells dg1 1 through dg1 6 with depths ranging from 70 to 120 m dg2 includes 5 samples from deeper flowing wells dg2 1 through dg2 5 with depths of around 300 m and dg3 includes 2 samples from flowing wells drilled to the bottom of cretaceous sandstone aquifer dg3 1 and dg3 2 to identify the mineralogy of sandstone we collected two rock samples in the wudu lake catchment and one rock sample in a neighboring catchment we also collect measurements of major ions as well as 87sr 86sr ratios of four rainwater samples corresponding to four precipitation events in the city near our study area to consider its contribution as an endmember 2 2 geochemical analyses the hco3 and co3 2 of groundwater were analyzed by titration in the field the partial pressure of co2 p co2 in groundwater was calculated by the watspec program wigley 1977 the cl so4 2 and no3 were analyzed by ion chromatography ics 900 dionex and na k mg2 and ca2 were measured by inductively coupled plasma icp oes 900 thermo at the ministry of education key laboratory of groundwater circulation and environmental evolution china university of geosciences trace elements like li and sr2 were measured using a perkinelmer nexion 300d icp ms sio2 was analyzed by using the molybdenum blue spectrophotometer method with a t6 uv spectrophotometer three sandstone samples were crushed and the mineralogical and elemental compositions of these samples were determined by d max2500 x ray diffractometer at the xi an center of geological survey and pw4400 x ray fluorescence spectrometer at national research center of geoanalysis respectively the measurements of 87sr 86sr ratios of groundwater and rock samples were completed by a neptune plus mc icp ms at the ministry of education key laboratory of surficial geochemistry of nanjing university the 3h measurements were completed at the institute of hydrogeology and environmental geology chinese academy of geological sciences and and the 14c measurements at the beta analytic inc miami florida usa the details of sr isotopic purification and analysis and of 3h and 14c measurement have been reported in ji et al 2022 thus are not repeated here 2 3 interpretation of the leaching experiment the leaching experiment is conducted by following the protocol in previous studies banner et al 1994 jacobson and blum 2000 zhou et al 2009 with moderate modifications to the concentrations of the acetic acid and time of dissolution in detail 2 g of each sandstone powder was first dissolved with 50 ml deionized water at room temperature for 24 h the solutions were centrifuged and passed through 0 45 μm filters to obtain deionized water leachates the residues were then dissolved with 50 ml 0 05 m acetic acid solutions at room temperature for 24 h which were centrifuged and passed through 0 45 μm filters to obtain acetic acid leachates 2 3 1 determination of sr isotopes and typical sr content of silicates and calcite the residue of each sample which represents the silicates fraction is used to measure the 87sr 86sr of silicates in sandstone 87sr 86sr sil and the acetic acid leachate of each sample is used to measure the concentrations of cations as well as 87sr 86sr ratios taking average value of 87sr 86sr sil of different samples leads to 87 sr 86 sr sil while extrapolating the linear relationship between 87sr 86sr and na sr of leachates at na sr 0 leads to 87 sr 86 sr cal in the acetic acid leachate the relationship between concentration of sr2 derived from silicates sr2 sil l μg l and concentration of sr2 derived from calcite sr2 cal l μg l can be expressed as 1a sr 2 l sr 2 sil l sr 2 cal l 1b sr 2 l 87 sr 86 sr l sr 2 sil l 87 sr 86 sr sil sr 2 cal l 87 sr 86 sr cal where sr2 l μg l and 87sr 86sr l are sr content and isotopic ratios in the leachate respectively equations 1a and 1b lead to sr2 sil l and sr2 cal l of each sample for each sandstone sample sr content in per gram calcite sr cal can be obtained as follows multiplying sr2 cal l and the volume of acetic acid solution 50 ml and then divided by the mass of sandstone 2 g leads to sr content of calcite in per gram sandstone which is denoted as sr cal sandstone sr cal equals sr cal sandstone divided by the proportion of calcite in sandstone measured by xrd sr content in per gram silicates sr sil can be obtained as follows sr content of silicates in per gram sandstone denoted as sr sil sandstone equals the total sr content determined by xrf analysis subtracted by sr cal sandstone because the geochemical behavior of sr is very similar to that of ca we assume that plagioclase and hornblende that contain ca are two main sr bearing silicates therefore sr content in per gram silicates sr sil equals sr sil sandstone divided by the proportion of sr bearing silicates plagioclase and hornblende measured by xrd 2 3 2 determination of ca content of silicates ca in the acetic acid leachate is also contributed by dissolution of both calcite and silicates the relationship between calcite derived ca silicate derived ca and total ca in per liter leachate can be written as 2 ca 2 l m cal l ca cal m sil l ca sil where ca2 l μg l refers to the total dissolved ca in each leachate sample ca cal μg g represents the typical ca content of pure calcite equaling 400 000 μg g ca sil μg g refers to the typical ca content of silicates for each leachate sample m cal l g l and m sil l g l are the masses of dissolved calcite and silicates in per liter leachate because the geochemical behavior of sr is very similar to that of ca we use the following two equations to obtain m cal l and m sil l 3a m cal l sr 2 cal l sr cal 3b m sil l sr 2 sil l sr sil substitute equations 3a and 3b into equation 2 we can obtain the following equation for determining ca sil of each sample 4 ca sil ca 2 l m cal l ca cal m sil l the mean value of ca sil obtained by different samples represents the typical ca content in the silicates endmember ca sil μg g 3 results and discussion 3 1 chemical compositions and sr isotopic ratios of endmembers 3 1 1 rainwater and sandstone rainwater which is the only source of groundwater recharge in our study area should be an endmember of groundwater chemistry for the four rainwater samples the 87sr 86sr ratios range from 0 710637 to 0 710913 table s1 with a mean value of 0 710784 table 1 the rainwater samples have concentrations of so4 2 ranging from 28 43 to 88 40 mg l the so4 2 brought by rainwater is a direct source of so4 2 in shallow groundwater in our study area groundwater chemistry is determined by the interaction of water with different minerals in the cretaceous sandstone according to xrd measurements the sandstone samples are mainly composed of quartz silicates calcite and clay minerals table s2 the percentage of silicates including plagioclase and hornblende ranges between 31 3 and 56 4 whereas the percentage of calcite varies between 2 1 and 2 9 the occurrence of silicates and calcite in sandstone in this study area are similar to the simultaneous occurrence of carbonates and silicates in granitoid rocks boettinger and southard 1991 white et al 2005 we also find montmorillonite is the main weathering product during silicate weathering which is widespread in regions with a semi arid climate chamley 1989 sun et al 2011 3 1 2 calcite and silicates endmembers determined by acetic acid leachates and residues of sandstone the acetic acid leachates of three sandstone samples have narrow variations in concentrations of cations table s3 the mean concentrations of li k and na in the sandstone leachates which are derived from silicates are 27 31 μg l 21 51 mg l and 26 17 mg l respectively the high concentrations of k and na indicate that silicate dissolution has contributions to the leachate therefore the high mean concentrations of sr2 mg2 and ca2 in the sandstone leachates equaling 2 59 mg l 69 23 mg l and 857 21 mg l respectively should be contributed by dissolution of both silicates and calcite the linear relationship between 87sr 86sr ratios and na sr of the three sandstone leachates yields a 87sr 86sr ratio of 0 709113 at na sr 0 which can be interpreted as the 87sr 86sr ratio of the calcite endmember 87 sr 86 sr cal in our study area fig 3 a table 1 for the two sandstone samples in the wudu lake catchment the residues of the two rock samples which represent the silicate fractions have 87sr 86sr ratios equaling 0 714543 and 0 713433 respectively we use the mean of the two equaling 0 713988 to represent the 87sr 86sr ratio of the silicate endmember 87 sr 86 sr sil table 1 the linear relationship between 87sr 86sr ratios and na sr also yields a typical na sr of 72 0 for silicates at 87sr 86sr 0 713988 fig 3a the typical na sr for silicates is within the range of na sr molar ratios from 29 1 to 1179 5 in the leachates of low calcite 0 02 wt granitoid rock samples reported in white et al 2005 by using equations 1a and 1b we obtain sr2 sil l and sr2 cal l in each leachate sample which can be transformed into sr sil and sr cal of each sandstone sample the sr sil of rk1 and rk2 are calculated to be 645 5 ppm and 764 3 ppm respectively the sr cal of rk1 and rk2 are calculated to be 1158 1 ppm and 1095 9 ppm respectively by taking mean values of the two rock samples sr sil equals 704 9 ppm whereas sr cal equals 1127 0 ppm table 1 based on the typical na sr of silicates equaling 72 0 the typical na content in silicates is determined to be 13266 6 ppm as shown in fig 3a on the plot of 87sr 86sr versus na sr the three endmembers well explain all groundwater samples in the recharge area rg1 and rg2 and the samples with limited influence by evaporites in the discharge area however if we follow previous studies e g lehn et al 2017 moore et al 2013 rao et al 2015 i e use the acetic acid leachate to represent the calcite fraction and the residue to represent the pure silicates endmember most groundwater samples cannot be explained by the three endmembers fig 3b 3 2 evolution of sr contents and 87sr 86sr of groundwater with increasing age in our previous study ji et al 2022 li isotopes have shown that silicate weathering occurs in the recharge area but does not occur along the flowpaths from deep part of recharge area to discharge area and adsorption is responsible for li removal in the discharge area where co2 is limited fig s1 the decreased sr contents in the deep part of discharge area dg2 and dg3 indicate that sr has been partly removed by adsorption for convenience of understanding the evolution of groundwater chemistry and sr isotopes with flow distance in fig 4 we schematically show the locations mean contents of dissolved co2 mean sr contents and mean 87sr 86sr of groundwater in sub groups rg dg1and dg2 some of the proceses contributing to the evolution of sr contents and 87sr 86sr are identified in this subsection whereas others are identified in subsections 3 4 and 3 5 3 2 1 modern groundwater in the recharge area the 3h concentrations of two samples in the recharge area are 31 7 tu and 9 2 tu table s1 respectively the high 3h indicates that groundwater in the recharge area belongs to modern groundwater recharged from recent precipitation the six groundwater samples in the recharge area have hco3 contents ranging from 203 92 to 223 51 mg l which are much higher than that of rainwater equaling 27 56 mg l the increased hco3 from rainwater to groundwater indicates the occurrence of weathering releasing hco3 into groundwater although the sample rg2 2 has higher concentrations of no3 and sr2 than the sample rg2 3 the two samples have almost the same 87sr 86sr therefore we assume that the possible influence of anthropogenic pollution on sr contents and sr isotopic ratios is negligible as shown in fig 3 groundwater in the recharge area has higher 87sr 86sr ratios than rainwater bullen et al 1996 and katz and bullen 1996 observed a similar phenomenon in their study areas and proposed that it was caused by weathering of k feldspar based on fig 3a the silicates endmember is responsible for the higher 87sr 86sr ratios of groundwater but silicate weathering and calcite weathering are both responsible for the high sr contents of groundwater 3 2 2 old groundwater in the discharge area the 3h concentrations of samples in the discharge area are close to 1 tu and the 14c dating shows ages ranging from 6110 to 29510 years table s1 two samples in subgroup dg1 have ages of 6110 and 7800 years two samples in subgroup dg2 have ages of 13 810 and 15860 years while the two samples in subgroup dg3 have ages of 26 980 and 29510 years showing a trend of increasing age from shallow to deep flowing wells from the recharge to the discharge area there are also trends of decreasing concentrations of dissolved co2 and increasing ph which indicate co2 consumption as well as a trend of decreasing 87sr 86sr ratio fig 5 a b showing occurrence of weathering of endmembers calcite and or evaporites with low 87sr 86sr ratio along the flowpath however due to hydrochemical processes removing cations ca na and mg na decrease with the decreasing 87sr 86sr ratios fig 5c d due to processes removing ca a similar relationship between 87sr 86sr ratio and ca along flowpaths was also reported in xie et al 2013 among the 13 old groundwater samples in the discharge area some have low whereas others have high contents of so4 2 and cl fig 6 the high contents of so4 2 and cl in subgroups dg2 and dg3 are evidence of dissolution of residual evaporites along the flowpath whereas the low contents of so4 2 and cl in subgroup dg1 are evidence of limited residual evaporites along the flowpath the residual evaporites in the aquifer are a possible endmember with low 87sr 86sr ratios clark 2015 gaillardet et al 1997 however as shown in fig 6 a large increase in cl or so4 2 in subgroup dg2 only leads to a small decrease in 87sr 86sr ratios implying that the effect of evaporites on 87sr 86sr ratios is limited moreover in subgroup dg1 there is a large variation in 87sr 86sr even if cl hardly changes and contents of so4 2 are low indicating that evaporite dissolution is not the cause of the low 87sr 86sr in the discharge area from the sampling points in subgroup rg2 in the deep part of the recharge area to groundwater in the discharge area silicate weathering seldom occurs because of the increasingly lower dissolved co2 along the flowpath which is supported by li isotopes fig s1 the plot of 87sr 86sr versus mg sr fig 7 shows that groundwater in subgroup rg2 and calcite are two endmembers of groundwater in discharge area even though mg and sr are both partly removed during the flowpaths from recharge to discharge areas 3 3 silicate and calcite weathering reflected in recharge area groundwater 3 3 1 determination of dissolved silicates and calcite using a three endmember model négrel et al 1993 proposed a method to calculate the contributions of different endmembers to river water by using budgets of cl na mg ca sr and 87sr 86sr which has been widely used in river water studies bickle et al 2005 gaillardet et al 1999 yu et al 2021 in in the recharge area we only need to consider three endmembers rainwater silicates and calcite by assuming that per liter groundwater in the recharge area is evolved from per liter infiltrated rainwater and there is no loss of dissolved sr2 in the recharge area we use the following two equations to quantify the contributions by silicate and carbonate weathering 5a sr 2 rg sr 2 rw m sil sr sil m cal sr cal 5b sr 2 rg 87 sr 86 sr rg sr 2 rw 87 sr 86 sr rw m sil sr sil 87 sr 86 sr sil m cal sr cal 87 sr 86 sr cal where sr2 rg μg l and 87sr 86sr rg are sr contents and 87sr 86sr ratios of groundwater samples in the recharge area respectively sr 2 rw μg l and 87 sr 86 sr ra are sr content and 87sr 86sr ratios of the rainwater endmember respectively sr sil μg g and sr cal μg g are typical sr contents in silicates and calcite respectively 87 sr 86 sr sil and 87 sr 86 sr cal are typical 87sr 86sr ratios of silicates and calcite respectively m sil g l and m cal g l are the masses of dissolved silicates and calcite in per liter water respectively by substituting the sr contents and 87sr 86sr ratios of the three endmembers listed in table 1 into equations 5a and 5b m sil and m cal in the recharge area can be obtained table 2 based on the typical sr contents of calcite and silicates for each groundwater sample we can also obtain the concentration of silicate derived sr2 in water sr2 sil w and the concentration of calcite derived sr2 in water sr2 cal w table 2 subgroup rg1 has a mean sr2 sil w sr2 cal w equaling 1 51 whereas subgroup rg2 has a mean sr2 sil w sr2 cal w equaling 1 05 the ratio sr2 sil w sr2 cal w being larger than 1 0 well explains why the sr isotopic ratios of groundwater in the recharge area are higher than those of rainwater 3 3 2 determination of co2 consumption by silicates and calcite because plagioclase is the dominant silicate in our study area we assume that the ca na ratio of silicates equaling 7 18 mol mol as listed in table 1 represents the ca na ratio of plagioclase in our study area therefore the chemical formula of silicates in our study area can be approximated as na0 12ca0 88al1 88si2 12o8 because montmorillonite is the major product of silicate weathering in our study area following drever 1997 the reaction of plagioclase with co2 can be expressed as 6 7 45 na 0 12 ca 0 88 al 1 88 si 2 12 o 8 12 co 2 6 2 si oh 4 0 89 na 5 56ca 2 3ca 0 33 al 4 67 si 7 33 o 20 oh 4 ca montmorillonite 12hco 3 0 4h 2 o the reaction of calcite with co2 can be written as 7 caco 3 co 2 h 2 o ca 2 2hco 3 based on m sil and m cal of each sample and the formula of plagioclase weathering and calcite weathering given in equations 6 and 7 the equivalent concentration of co2 consumed by silicates co2 sil and the equivalent concentration of co2 consumed by calcite co2 cal of each sample can be calculated directly table 2 co2 sil ranges from 1 29 to 1 94 mmol l whereas co2 cal varies from 0 95 to 1 87 mmol l we find co2 sil and co2 cal of groundwater in our study area are within the ranges of co2 sil and co2 cal in the 51 global rivers studied in gaillardet et al 1999 fig 8 indicating that the results of our calculation are reliable 3 4 silicate and calcite weathering reflected in discharge area groundwater with low concentrations of dissolved co2 3 4 1 determination of additional calcite weathering using a two endmember model as shown in fig 7 the sr isotope ratios of groundwater in discharge areas can be explained by mixing of two endmembers i e groundwater in subgroup rg2 and the trace calcite considering that sr2 have been partly removed along the long distance flowpaths by assuming that per liter groundwater in the discharge area is evolved from per liter groundwater in subgroup rg2 with an additional weathering of δm cal g l calcite the strontium isotopic budget can be written as 8 sr 2 rg2 δ m cal sr cal 87 sr 86 sr dg sr 2 rg2 87 sr 86 sr rg2 δ m cal sr cal 87 sr 86 sr cal where sr 2 rg2 μg l and 87 sr 86 sr rg2 are typical sr content and 87sr 86sr ratio in subgroup rg2 respectively 87 sr 86 sr dg is the 87sr 86sr ratio of a groundwater sample in the discharge area by rearranging equation 8 δm cal g can be obtained as 9 δ m cal sr 2 rg2 87 sr 86 sr rg2 87 sr 87 sr dg sr cal 87 sr 86 sr dg 87 sr 86 sr cal according to equation 9 δm cal ranges from 0 93 to 12 28 mmol l based on the binary mixing model we find f cal ranges from 19 0 to 75 7 fig 9 3 4 2 weathering in the discharge area based on equation 7 the required equivalent concentration of co2 consumption by additional calcite weathering δ co2 cal ranges from 0 93 mmol l to 12 28 mmol l however we find δ co2 cal of several samples sample dg1 2 and all samples in dg2 and dg3 are larger than the highest concentration of dissolved co2 in the recharge area equaling 4 37 mmol l sample rg2 3 table 2 if the upper limit of available co2 for additional weathering of calcite equals 4 37 mmol l we infer that the low 87sr 86sr ratios of these samples sample dg1 2 and all samples in dg2 and dg3 are caused not only by calcite weathering but also by calcite fluid equilibrium fantle and depaolo 2006 zhang and depaolo 2020 that does not consume co2 fig 4 hereafter we only use the five samples in dg1 dg1 2 excluded to discuss calcite weathering in the discharge area fig 9 table 3 we assume that the equivalent concentration of co2 consumed by silicates co2 sil of each sample in the discharge area equals 1 54 mmol l which is the mean co2 sil in subgroup rg2 the equivalent concentration of co2 consumed by calcite co2 cal can be obtained by the sum of average co2 cal in rg2 equaling 1 58 mmol l and δ co2 cal of each sample we find co2 cal of groundwater in the discharge area ranges from 2 51 to 4 97 mmol l which is larger than the maximum of co2 carb equaling 1 56 mmol l in the 51 large rivers studied in gaillerdet et al 1999 3 5 calculated hco3 versus measured hco3 implications to the degree of degassing based on equations 6 and 7 we can obtain the concentration of hco3 generated by silicate weathering hco3 sil and the concentration of hco3 generated by calcite weathering hco3 cal in the recharge area by adding hco3 from three sources i e silicate weathering calcite weathering and rainwater the calculated contents of hco3 range from 3 74 to 5 97 mmol l table 2 which are in the same order of magnitude as measured hco3 ranging between 3 34 and 3 66 mmol l fig 10 shows the relationship between calculated hco3 and measured hco3 of the 6 samples in the recharge area the measured hco3 being lower than the calculated hco3 can be explained by neoformation of clay minerals which would generate h and lead to co2 emission by reacting with hco3 for groundwater in the 5 samples in subgroup dg1 the measured hco3 co3 2 varying between 3 03 and 3 29 mmol l with a mean of 3 17 mmol l which is slightly lower than the measured hco3 co3 2 varying between 3 34 and 3 66 mmol l in the recharge area fig 11 this leads to the impression that only a small proportion of hco3 has been removed by degassing in fact the calculated hco3 ranges from 7 00 to 11 93 mmol l with a mean of 10 18 mmol l in subgroup dg1 table 3 fig 11 indicating that around 2 3 of total hco3 has been removed by degassing when groundwater flows from the deep to the well outlet fig 4 due to the difficulty of determining hco3 before degassing some previous studies mishra et al 2018 wood and hyndman 2017 simply assumed that the concentration of hco3 in groundwater before degassing equals twice of measured hco3 after degassing this indicates that the degree of degassing was underestimated in previous studies due to the removal of selected cations during the degassing process the residual ca2 mg2 and sr2 in groundwater samples could not represent the actual cations derived from calcite and silicates causing difficulty of using the plot of ca na versus mg na to quantify silicate and calcite weathering in this process precipitation of carbonates would cause ca and mg isotope fractionation lee et al 2014 tipper et al 2006b but does not change 87sr 86sr frost and toner 2004 négrel et al 2001 we believe that our method which quantitatively determined the weathered silicates and calcite in groundwater with improved mass balance equations of sr isotopes would be valuable to estimate the potential of deep aquifers as carbon sinks 3 6 the control of residence time and co2 availability on the ratio of silicate to calcite weathering because co2 consumed by carbonates and co2 consumed by silicates have different fates when hco3 got precipitated the ratio of co2 sil to co2 cal co2 sil co2 cal is critical to understanding the role of geological carbon cycle in global climate change among the 51 rivers studied in gaillardet et al 1999 31 rivers have co2 sil co2 cal 1 whereas 20 rivers have co2 sil co2 cal 1 therefore calcite weathering plays a larger role than silicate weathering in 61 of the rivers in our study area we find co2 sil co2 cal ranges from 1 33 to 1 47 in subgroup rg1 table 2 this could be a result of the high availability of co2 in the initial stage of groundwater circulation as well as the longer reaction times of groundwater than river water this is consistent with tipper et al s 2006a inference that a longer residence time of shallow groundwater would allow further dissolution of silicates and is also consistent with calmels et al s 2011 observation that 87sr 86sr ratios of shallow groundwater are higher than those of river water from rapid surface runoff based on the difference in 3h between subgroups rg1 and rg2 we infer that samples in subgroup rg2 have longer reaction times than samples in subgroup rg1 as shown in table 2 subgroup rg2 has almost the same mean co2 sil as subgroup rg1 but has larger mean co2 cal than subgroup rg1 therefore co2 sil co2 cal of subgroup rg2 ranges from 0 95 to 0 99 this is consistent with the slightly lower 87sr 86sr in subgroup rg2 than in subgroup rg1 in the discharge area we find co2 sil co2 cal ranges from 0 31 to 0 61 therefore when the concentration of dissolved co2 in groundwater is not high enough the remaining co2 cannot be consumed by silicates but can be consumed by calcite causing lower 87sr 86sr as reported in jasechko et al 2017 fossil groundwater comprises around 42 85 of total groundwater in the crust s uppermost 1 km therefore we believe that deep aquifers with fossil groundwater can be important carbon sinks which is consistent with the speculations in previous studies schopka and derry 2012 zhang and planavsky 2019 3 7 implications for interpreting sr isotopes in acetic acid leachates and silicate dominated aquifers in our study area old groundwater contributed by calcite weathering in the discharge area has low 87sr 86sr ratios but the calcite endmember represented by acetic acid leachates of sandstone has higher 87sr 86sr ratios than old groundwater based on this paradox we realize the shortcoming of using the acetic acid leachate to represent calcite we find the assumption that acetic acid leachates are contributed solely by calcite dissolution leads to not only erroneous 87sr 86sr and sr na of calcite but also erroneous sr na of silicates the proposed method in this study would be useful for interpreting the acetic acid leachate of rocks in future studies due to the poor understanding of 87sr 86sr of trace calcite in silicate dominated aquifer many existing studies attributed the decreasing 87sr 86sr of groundwater with flow distance to overlying or underlying sources with low 87sr 86sr ratios we believe that our approach can be applied to re interpret the evolution of 87sr 86sr in some silicate dominated aquifers which might lead to increased understanding of the potential of groundwater as a carbon sink 4 summary weathering of silicates and calcite largely determines the hydrochemical components of groundwater in sandstone aquifers but the occurrence of geochemical processes removing ions like ca2 mg2 sr2 k li and hco3 makes it difficult to infer the degrees of silicate and calcite weathering in groundwater by using cations only in this study we propose a three endmember strontium isotopic budget model for quantifying silicate and calcite weathering in the recharge area and a two endmember model for silicate and calcite weathering in the discharge area because of the abundant co2 in the vadose zone and in the shallow part of the aquifer and the longer residence time than river water we find the equivalent concentrations of co2 consumed by silicate and carbonate weathering in modern groundwater with ages 70 years are much larger than the majority of rivers studied by gaillerdet et al 1999 more evidences by using other isotopes are expected to identify the effect of residence times and availability of co2 on silicate and carbonate weathering in various water bodies the sr isotopes of old groundwater in discharge areas with ages in the range of 6000 8000 years reveal that the equivalent concentration of co2 consumption by carbonate weathering is higher than the maximum value in the 51 global rivers and the majority of total dissolved co2 has been transformed into hco3 or co3 2 by weathering further investigations are expected to examine the role of sandstone aquifers as a carbon sink this study increases understanding of the control of sr isotope evolution and processes of chemical weathering during groundwater circulation in silicate dominated aquifers the proposed method in this study would be valuable for investigating the roles of silicate and carbonate weathering in various water bodies in the future more studies are expected to identify whether silicate weathering or carbonate weathering dominates in groundwater with different ages in silicates dominated aquifers declaration

in the formation although the impact of heterogeneity has been investigated during co2 injection for many sequestration projects few studies have been reported for co2 circulation and associated heat extraction this study aims to numerically assess the impact of spatially correlated heterogeneity on both co2 plume development cpd and subsequential cpg operations in inclined and thinly layered geothermal reservoirs the simulated field is simplified from a typical depleted oil gas reservoir block located in a potential geothermal area in north oman which had undergone horizontal water flooding as the second oil recovery phase formation slope and heterogeneity properties including variance azimuth and correlation lengths are sampled using the latin hypercube approach in a high dimensional parameter space defined by their ranges a suite of numerical models simulating cpd cpg operations by a horizontal well doublet is set up using the slope and heterogeneity parameter samples performance metrics for cpd cpg including cpd time cpg time net injected co2 maximum pressure decline minimum co2 mass fraction in produced fluids total recovered heat energy and heat extraction rate are calculated from each of the numerical models a response surface model mapping the input slope and heterogeneity parameters and output performance metrics is developed using these model results using the response surface global sensitivity analysis is efficiently conducted to quantitatively evaluate the impact of slope and heterogeneity on the performance of cpd cpg operations it is found that steep slopes can enhance co2 injectivity facilitate high co2 fraction in produced fluids and heat extraction rate however it causes early cold co2 breakthrough to the production well and reduce total recovered heat energy high variance and x correlation length of heterogeneous fields create prominent high permeable preferential paths in the major flow direction x axis low permeable lenses created by large y correlation lengths are perpendicular to the x axis acting as flow barriers to both co2 and brine towards the production well as for z correlation length 15 m is found to be the critical value relative to 20 m of the reservoir thickness large z continuity scale facilitates fluid flow owing to the thick preferential paths when it is below 15 m but low permeable lenses tend to significantly block flow as they approximate to the reservoir thickness keywords inclined reservoir co2 storage geothermal energy spatially correlated heterogeneity correlation length data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction to mitigate climate change induced by an increasing concentration of atmospheric co2 various co2 capture utilization and storage ccus projects have been carried out around the world in the past two decades ipcc 2005 gccsi 2014 xu et al 2022 co2 geological storage cgs realized during co2 enhanced oil recovery co2 eor in depleted oil reservoirs has been demonstrated as a feasible ccus approach with recovered oil revenue to cover partial cgs costs hill et al 2013 shogenov and shogenova 2018 hedriana et al 2021 enhanced geothermal recovery egr in which co2 is used as a working fluid to extract heat from hot dry rock by fracturing the tight rock in deep reservoir has also been investigated pruess 2008 zhang et al 2013 in the past 10 years another ccus technology namely co2 plume geothermal cpg has attracted more and more attention randolph and saar 2011 adams et al 2015 cui et al 2017 fleming et al 2020 chen et al 2022a the cpg system uses partially stored co2 as the working fluid to extract heat energy from the cgs reservoirs the favorable thermodynamic properties of co2 make the cpg system more efficient than conventional water based geothermal extraction technology adams et al 2014 obviously incorporating cpg with cgs can not only produce clean geothermal energy and hence reduce fossil fuel consumption but also generate additional profits to partially cover cgs costs the studies on cgs cpg mentioned above assume homogeneous formations while in reality all reservoirs are naturally heterogeneous and embedded with multi scale fractures or channels spatial heterogeneity may significantly affect fluids flow and heat transfer in porous media and has been studied in co2 sequestration and conventional water based geothermal fields crooijmans et al 2016 and willems et al 2017 investigated the influences of heterogeneous facies on heat recovery from fluvial geothermal reservoirs and found geothermal lifespan could be overestimated due to facies heterogeneity liu et al 2019 studied spatially correlated heterogeneity and demonstrated preferential flow paths created by large correlation lengths continuity scales could lead to an early cold water breakthrough in the production well babaei and nick 2019 conducted thousands of numerical model simulations with various spatially correlated heterogeneity model parameters and doublet well placement and discharge their major conclusion is that anisotropy of heterogeneity could increase or reduce geothermal lifespan depending on the orientation of preferential flow channels and flow barriers in addition well distance should be significantly shorter in heterogeneous aquifers than in homogeneous ones babaei et al 2022 considered two types of heterogeneity namely spatially correlated heterogeneity simulated by variogram models and embedded 2d braided channels generated by the piecewise cubic hermite interpolating polynomial method fritsch and carlson 1980 in the optimization of doublet well spacing to maximize geothermal performance in addition to water based geothermal extraction cgs in heterogeneous reservoirs is also extensively investigated as the field implementations have been carried out in the past 20 years to give a few examples deng et al 2012 investigated the impacts of multi scale porosity permeability heterogeneity on co2 storage leakage and injectivity in an industry scale co2 storage site in rock spring uplift wyoming usa dai et al 2014a developed a framework for optimizing integrated cgs and co2 eor in a heterogeneous reservoir of the farnsworth unit of anadarko basin in texas usa williams and chadwick 2021 evaluated the impacts of reservoir scale heterogeneity on spatiotemporal dynamics of co2 plume at the sleipner field norway harris et al 2021 investigated the effects on capillary trapping of co2 in the captain sandstone laboratory experiments and numerical simulations of synthetic heterogeneous formations are also conducted to investigate co2 migration and trapping mechanisms heterogeneity impacts on dissolution trapping of co2 were evaluated using a 2d cell experiment by agartan et al 2015 and numerical simulations by abbaszadeh and shariatipour 2018 respectively heterogeneity induced trapping mechanism for cgs was comprehensively studied and demonstrated in various marine sediments by dai et al 2018 rasheed et al 2020 studied the effect of different levels of heterogeneity on co2 storage potential using numerical models furthermore a few studies have evaluated heterogeneity impacts on co2 eor and optimized well placement and operations as it is a feasible ccus technology practically implemented biu victor 2011 chen et al 2013 dai et al 2014b khan and mandal 2021 very limited studies have been reported on heterogeneity impacts on a cpg system probably due to the fact that cpg technology has emerged only in recent years xu et al 2017 presented a 3d modeling evaluation of cpg performance in a spatially correlated heterogeneous formation based on geothermal conditions of songliao basin china they found that as long as a highly permeable zone exists between the injection production wells high mobile co2 is more likely to flow through the high permeable zone acting as the preferential flow path the evaluation is conducted based on only one geostatistical model norouzi et al 2022 evaluated cpg simulations in a suite of heterogeneous fluvial formations embedded with synthetic 2d braided channel features and found the optimal doublet well spacing and required upscaling level both studies adopted a vertical well doublet placement which is only feasible for reservoirs with high permeability besides co2 mass fraction in produced fluids was not managed during cpg simulations which should be high enough for the appropriate operation of the surface co2 turbine generator it can be controlled by developing a sufficient co2 plume to cover the heat sweeping area chen et al 2022b investigated the impacts of six scenarios of spatially correlated porosity permeability heterogeneity on cpg operation in a high porous low permeable and thinly bedded formation which is a typical oil reservoir in north oman a horizontal well triplet is placed and demonstrated feasible for this type of reservoir the study assumed reservoir formation is saturated with co2 initially and didn t consider co2 plume development cpd stage based on the reviews of the existing three works on the heterogeneity impacts on cpg slope effects of the heterogeneous formation on cpg haven t been studied geological formations are always inclined to some extent in nature the density of supercritical co2 in the reservoir formation is smaller than brine and highly dynamic with reservoir pressure and temperature slope affects the co2 migration and heat recovery in both cpd and cpg operations as an extension of chen et al 2022b s work this study aims to investigate the combined impacts of both formation slope and heterogeneity on sequential cpd and cpg operations unlike the previous evaluations based on only several discrete scenarios slope and geostatistical model parameters variance azimuth correlation lengths are sampled in a high dimensional parameter space in their ranges as model inputs sequential simulations of cpd and cpg models based on these parameter samples are carried out and corresponding performance metrics of cpd cpg are calculated a response surface rs between input parameters and performance metrics is developed by which global sensitivity is analyzed and performance is evaluated continuously in the ranges of the sensitive parameters as one of the performance metrics co2 mass fraction in produced mixture and its sensitivity to formation slope and heterogeneity is evaluated which is lacking in the previous studies 2 modeling methods 2 1 co2 brine flow and heat model the models to simulate co2 brine flow and heat transfer are set up using nuft code a multiphase multi component non isothermal flow and solute transport simulator developed and maintained by lawrence livermore national laboratory of us department of energy nitao 1998 nuft has incorporated a well established equation of co2 and water and has been successfully applied in many co2 related underground reservoir studies in the past decade buscheck et al 2012 saar et al 2015 chen et al 2020 2022a as shown in fig 1 the reservoir domain is defined as a 2 km 3 km 20 m xyz cuboid inclined clockwise around the y axis at the anchor point of 0 0 which is simplified from typical fault blocks in north oman zhao et al 2012 rajabi et al 2021 the domain is spatially discretized into uniform 50 50 1 m3 blocks yielding 40 60 20 48 000 grid cells the anchor point i e the left top corner is assumed at the depth of 1500 m where pressure and temperature are specified as 17 mpa and 90 c accordingly the initial pressures at other grid cells are calculated based on depth and hydrostatics note that the depth of each cell varies with reservoir dip slope angle except the anchor point the initial temperature and salinity is assumed 90 c and 18 wt uniformly across the entire reservoir all boundaries are sealed except the right yz plane boundary bottom xy plane boundary is imposed 0 05 w m2 of constant heat flow source reservoir thermal conductivity and specific heat are specified as 2 1 w m oc and 1000 j kg oc respectively residual co2 and brine saturation are assumed to be 0 3 and 0 05 rock porosity and permeability are treated as spatially correlated random fields to be discussed in section 2 2 the reservoir models simulate two sequential operations namely co2 plume development cpd and co2 plume geothermal cpg production a horizontal well doublet with 600 m distance is placed on the top layer of the reservoir in the middle y range of the domain fig 1 during the 1st cpd stage pure cold 30 c co2 is injected into the horizontal injector under constant 15 mpa of overpressure linearly increased to the value in one year the injected co2 displaces native brine and migrates towards the right open boundary after 3 mt co2 is injected and the developed plume covers the well doublet the producer starts to extract hot fluids at 5 kg s linearly increased to the value in one year while co2 injection continues under the same overpressure initiating the 2nd cpg stage during the cpg stage partial injected co2 is circulated as the working fluid to extract geothermal heat the extracted fluid is mainly co2 with minor brine 10 co produced the fluids go through the surface power plant and cooled pure co2 is re injected into the reservoir with additional compensating co2 for co produced brine pump or compressor might not need if the thermosiphon effect is significant enough adam et al 2015 2 2 spatially correlated heterogeneity simulation heterogeneous porosity is modeled as a 3d spatially correlated gaussian random field using a geostatistical code cirpka 2003 chen et al 2022b rock intrinsic permeability k fields are derived from porosity ϕ by the equation k 192 ϕ 3 1 ϕ 2 abbaszadeh et al 2000 note that mean porosity is fixed as 0 25 and the corresponding mean permeability is 5 3 md representing high porous and low permeable heterogeneous formations fig 2 shows five examples of porosity fields s1 s5 with different combinations of correlation lengths in x y and z directions termed as corrlx corrly corrlz which measure continuous lengths of large or low porosity values in x y and z directions with 1000 m of corrlx and corrly s1 represents a large isotropic high or low porosity permeability region in xy plane in contrast s2 and s3 illustrate channel features in parallel to x and y with the ratio of corrlx corrly 10 and 0 1 respectively s4 and s5 differ from s2 and s3 by extending corrlz from 1 to 20 m indicating continuity scale in the z direction of the thin formation for s2 and s4 which both are characterized by channels in parallel to the general flow direction x axis perpendicular to horizontal wells with respective corrlz 1 and 20 m cpd cpg is simulated with two formation slopes 2 and 20 the four simulations are carried out to demonstrate the spatiotemporal behaviors of cpd and cpg in the channeled reservoirs as well as the comparative analysis of the combined impact of slope and corrlz 2 3 response surface model in order to systematically investigate the continuous impact of reservoir slope and heterogeneity in specified ranges on cpd cpg response surface models approximating relationships between specified inputs and outputs are developed based on the training dataset generated by physical nuft models chen et al 2020 as shown in fig 3 100 input samples are drawn from a 6 dimensional parameter space defined by specified ranges table 1 using the latin hypercube sampling approach mckay et al 1979 input parameters 2 6 including variance azimuth corrlx corrly and corrlz are for the geostatistical model to generate 10 equally probable realizations of the porosity field for each sample the geological indication of the correlation lengths has been discussed in the last section variance indicates the degree of spread in porosity values of 48 000 model grid cells azimuth is the axis of maximum continuity rotated in xy plane based on these 1000 porosity and derived permeability fields 1000 nuft models simulating sequential cpd and cpg are set up and run in the clusters at sultan qaboos university cpd model is simulated to the time when 3mt of co2 is injected cpg model then reads the values of primary variables pressure temperature liquid saturation co2 and salt concentrations at the end of cpd as the initial state and is simulated for 50 years seven output variables are designed as the performance indicators and described in table 2 with the 1st one from cpd and the other six from the cpg stage for each nuft model the seven outputs are calculated the 1000 output vectors are averaged over the associated 10 realizations for each input sample leading to 100 mean output vectors based on the 100 pairs of inputs outputs as the training dataset the rs model is fitted and validated using the bmars algorithm bühlmann 2003 chen et al 2020 global sensitivity measured by sobol total order indices sti sobol 2001 is efficiently calculated to evaluate the impact of inputs on outputs using the rs model chen et al 2021 all the algorithms used in rs development and analysis are from psuade problem solving environment for uncertainty quantification and design exploration a suite of uncertainty quantification algorithms developed by lawrence livermore national laboratory tong 2009 3 results and analysis 3 1 spatial and temporal behaviors of geothermal reservoirs in this section the four cpd cpg cases in heterogeneous scenarios s2 corrlz 1 m and s4 corrlz 20 m at the slope of 2 and 20 are discussed to illustrate and comparatively analyze spatial distributions of pressure temperature and co2 plume figs 4 8 time series of cumulative co2 injection during cpd fig 9 and co2 net injection rate producer temperature co2 mass fraction and thermal flux during cpg fig 10 3 1 1 spatial distribution of pressure fig 4 shows the pressure contour maps of the four cases at the end of cpd start of cpg when 3 mt co2 is injected under constant 32 mpa injection pressure initial 17 15 mpa overpressure from left to right pressure varies from 32 to 18 and 24 mpa with 2 and 20 slope respectively it is because the slope is defined as the clockwise angle around y axis at the anchor point x z 0 0 i e the left top corner the right boundary of the reservoir inclined by 20 is about 600 m deeper than that inclined 2 yielding 6 mpa of initial pressure difference according to hydrostatics pressures propagate farther and show stronger heterogeneous plume in xy plane with 20 m than 1 m of corrlz however pressure plumes show no apparent heterogeneity in the z direction even for cases with 1 m corrlz due to the thin thickness of the formation 20 m reservoir pressures drop after 50 years of fluid extraction at 5 kg s by the producer fig 5 as the injector pressure is fixed at 32 mpa the pressure gradient is sharp between the injector and the producer the producer pressure is greater than downstream in 2 slope cases but becomes a local minimum in 20 slope cases suggesting a larger portion of injected co2 could bypass the producer towards the downstream region in the former cases moreover partial co2 in the downstream area might be extracted to the producer according to the pressure gradient in 20 slope cases these findings indicate net injected co2 could be less in reservoirs with a steeper slope besides the impact of corrlz on the pressure distribution at the time seems minor 3 1 2 spatial distribution of co2 saturation unlike pressure co2 plumes show remarkable channel effects caused by 10 of the corrlx corrly ratio fig 6 preferential flow paths are formed in those high permeable channels with the same amount of co2 injected 3 mt plumes spread farther in the x direction in the 2 slope than in the 20 slope cases while channel effects are more prominent in the 20 m corrlz cases than those 1 m cases xz plumes in fig 6 demonstrate co2 can migrate farther in the z direction in the 20 m corrlz cases fig 7 presents co2 plumes after 50 years of cpg operation despite continuous fluids extraction by the producer a considerable amount of co2 from the injector bypassed the producer and spread to the right open boundary plumes almost fill up the top xy planes in 2 slope cases while only co2 in preferential paths reaches the right boundary in 20 slope cases similar to fig 6 co2 plumes in the two 20 m corrlz cases show a stronger channel effect unlike fig 6 plumes in middle xz slices show a similar degree of spread in z direction for both values of corrlz larger corrlz can enhance co2 flow in z direction in preferential channels meaning that it helps co2 propagate farther in z direction during the injection only cpd stage but also help co2 be attracted to the producer on the top xy layer during the cpg stage as a result co2 spread in the z direction after 50 years of cpg won t show an apparent difference between cases with different corrlz 3 1 3 spatial distribution of temperature in all four cases cold temperature plumes are restricted within 100 m from the injector at the end of cpd not presented and within the inter well heat sweeping zone after 50 years of cpg fig 8 similar to co2 plumes cold xy plumes show more significant channel effect in the two 20 m corrlz cases than the 1 m cases verifying that larger corrlz can enhance preferential co2 flows cold xz plumes show no heterogeneous behaviors in the z direction in all the cases 3 1 4 temporal behaviors of cpd cpg fig 9 compares the history of cumulative injected co2 and shows the required times to achieve the target of 3 mt mass injection during the cpd stage for the four cases it is seen that the injection rate is stabilized after 2 years under the constant injector overpressure the cpd time is 22 9 24 24 2 and 25 6 years in sequence for the case of 20 1 m 20 20 m 2 1 m and 2 20 m it looks that a steeper slope and shorter corrlz help to reduce cpd time fig 10 shows temporal behaviors of the geothermal reservoir during the 50 years of cpg the producer extracts fluids at a rate linearly increased from 0 to 5 kg s in the 1st year and remained constant thereafter in response the net injected co2 rates in the four cases drop drastically in the 1st year to the lowest point about 0 5 kg s where they rebound in the 2nd year and increase slowly thereafter fig 10a the stabilized rate after 4 years is higher in the two 20 slope cases than the other two with 2 slope corrlz shows slight influence on the net injected rate in the 20 slope cases the 1 m case leads to higher net injection than the 20 m case does produced fluid temperature averaged over the 1 km producer is continuously falling during cpg fig 10b obviously temperature declines faster in the cases with higher degree of slope resulting in a shorter lifespan of the geothermal reservoir in this study lifespan is defined as the cpg time timecpg when the produced temperature drops below 85 c dashed line it can be seen that timecpg of the two 20 slope cases is around 40 years while that for 2 slope cases is longer than 46 years co2 mass fraction in the produced fluids co2 and brine is mainly determined by the location of the producer chen et al 2022a and 94 is recommended for the sake of appropriate operation of the surface power plant as shown in fig 10c it drops abruptly in the first few years responding to the initiation of fluid extraction and then recovers smoothly it is found that the 20 1 m case achieves the greatest co2 mass fraction produced co2 thermal flux is a product of extracted co2 mass flux and enthalpy which depends on pressure and temperature as the hot fluids are extracted at a rate from 0 to 5 kg s in the 1st year it rises sharply from 0 to the maximum drops in the next 2 3 years and increases smoothly with co2 mass fraction and eventually decreases as the temperature drops fig 10d the comparison of the four curves shows that higher thermal flux results from the steeper slope and smaller corrlz 3 2 response surface analysis the quality of rs models are examined by comparing outputs between the physics based nuft model and data driven bmars model fig 11 shows two scatterplots of 100 outputs of netinj and totheat during rs model cross validation the 0 989 and 0 978 of r square values suggest the fitted rs models using bmars algorithm can well approximate the nuft model outputs as each bmars bagging mars model initiates 50 instantiations of mars models each dot and the associated crossed error bar in fig 11 represent the mean and one standard deviation of the 50 mars outputs in the next sub sections sti of the 7 outputs to the 6 inputs are conveniently computed using rs models and plotted in fig 12 for each output 2d joint rs of the most sensitive input abscissa and each of the other sensitive inputs ordinate are visualized in fig 13 the input parameters with sti 0 1 are considered insensitive and excluded from rs analysis in this section histograms of the outputs and pairwise joint probability between them are illustrated in fig 14 3 2 1 co2 plume development time timecpd the purpose of the cpd stage is to inject 3mt of co2 and develop a co2 plume for co2 circulation in the following cpg stage timecpd is the time required to achieve the injection target obviously co2 injectivity is reversely correlated to timecpd according to fig 12 timecpd is strongly sensitive to slope sti 0 69 and slightly sensitive to corrlx sti 0 12 and corrlz sti 0 17 as indicated by the 2d rss of slope corrlx and slope corrlz fig 13a timecpd is reduced from 30 to 20 years with a slope from 2 to 20 indicating injectivity could be enhanced with steeper slopes it slightly decreases with corrlx until 500 m and increases thereafter it increases with corrlz in the range 15 m with slope 10 these findings suggest that co2 injectivity is mainly affected by the formation slope rather than heterogeneity porosity permeability continuity in x axis major flow direction will enhance injectivity owing to the formed preferential flow paths along x axis if it is shorter than 500 m but will slightly block the fluid migration along y axis due to the low permeable flow barriers if it is longer than 500 m timecpd increases with corrlz in the bottom right area of the rs suggesting continuity extension in z axis somewhat blocks the flow especially in steep slope formations it might be caused by the increasing low permeable area acting as the flow barrier in z direction with the increase of corrlz however when corrlz 15 m its impact shows some irregular pattern it is probably due to the combined effects of large z continuity of both preferential flow paths and barriers 3 2 2 co2 geothermal production time timecpg co2 geothermal production stops when produced fluid temperature drops below 85 c so timecpg can be regarded as the indicator of cold plume breakthrough time to the producer unlike timecpd the impacts on timecpg are evenly distributed between slope and heterogeneity the sensitive input parameters are slope corrlz variance corrlx and corrly with sti in the sequence of 0 34 0 34 0 26 0 18 and 0 14 fig 13b shows the four 2d rss between slope and the other four sensitive input parameters similar to timecpd timecpg decreases from 40 to 25 years with slope it also decreases with variance especially with a steep slope and high variance top right area of the slope variance rs timecpg decreases with corrlx and increases with corrly mainly in slope 10 range these results suggest that prominent large variance channels in parallel with flow direction large corrlx small corrly can speed up cold plume breakthrough in steep slope reservoirs larger corrlz helps to reduce timecpg but it shows reverse effects near up limit of 20 m which is also the reservoir thickness it is because large corrlz could mean large continuity of both high and low porosity permeability zone timecpg decrease first with corrlz as the thicker high permeable zones help cold co2 flow to the producer however when corrlz is close to 20 m i e the formation thickness the low permeable zones could significantly block flow paths mainly on the x axis of cold co2 especially combined with large corrly this will slow down cold plume propagation yielding a long timecpg 3 2 3 net injected co2 netinj netinj stands for the cumulative net co2 injection by timecpg which ranges from 3 1 and 4 6 mt 3 0 mt of injection during cpd stage it is surprising that corrlz turns out to be the only parameter that controls netinj with a high sti of 0 87 fig 12 as the other five parameters are insensitive sti 0 1 only 1d rs for netinj versus corrlz is plotted fig 13c it shows that netinj decreases from 4 3 to the minimum as corrlz increases from 2 to 15 m and increases again to 3 7 mt at corrlz 20 m as the production rate is fixed as 5 kg s the netinj is positively correlated to the injectivity reverse of timecpd and timecpg which is verified by the joint probability distribution of netinj timecpd and netinj timecpg fig 14 both injectivity and timecpg decrease with corrlz in the range of 15 m and reverse the trend thereafter fig 13a and b causing the decrease of netinj to the lowest point at corrlz 15 m and then rebound another question has to be answered here why is slope the top sensitive parameter for timecpd injectivity and timecpg insensitive for netinj it could be explained by the fact that the steep slope enhances injectivity but reduce timecpg causing its insensitivity to netinj which is the cumulative product of net injection rate and time 3 2 4 pressure declines dpres dpres represents the maximum pressure declines at the producer during cpg its behavior should be similar to injectivity as they reflect flow conditions around the producer and injector respectively the larger the dpres or timecpd the worse the flow conditions around the producer or the injector consequently dpres changes with corrlx and corrlz in similar trends as timecpd does peaked at 15 m along corrlz and bottomed at 500 m along corrlx as shown in fig 13a and d whereas timecpd is significantly sensitive to the reservoir slope while dpres is insensitive to it fig 12 it is because the injector is located at the top left corner and impacted by downstream flow conditions only while the producer is at x 650 m and abstracts fluids from both upstream and downstream by which the slope s impact on the dpres is counteracted fig 14 demonstrates dpres is positively correlated with timecpd as well as its strong negative correlation to netinj 3 2 5 produced total heat totheat totheat is the cumulative extracted co2 heat energy by timecpg which is determined by produced co2 flux and duration as the produced fluid rate is constant at 5 kg s fracco2 determines the produced co2 mass flux consequently totheat is positively correlated to both fracco2 and timecpg as shown in fig 12 sensitive parameters and their stis are highly similar between totheat and timecpg suggesting they might be strongly positively correlated their joint probability of both the parameters in fig 14 confirms they are almost linearly correlated the four rss fig 13e of totheat corresponding to corrlz and the other four sensitive parameters show similar trends as those of timecpg the sensitivity analysis for totheat can hence refer to those for timecpg 3 2 6 co2 mass fraction in produced fluids fracco2 fracco2 is the lowest value of co2 mass fraction of the produced fluids which usually occurs in the first couple of years of cpg fig 10c generally 0 94 is considered the minimum feasible co2 mass fraction for a surface turbine generator the top two sensitive parameters for fracco2 are variance and corrlx followed by slight sensitive corrly and slope fig 13 the three rss in fig 13f show fracco2 is above 0 94 in most ranges of the four parameters owing to the well developed co2 plume and appropriate injector producer space fracco2 drops below 0 94 in a small area between up limits of both variance and corrlx suggesting strong heterogeneity and large continuity in the main flow direction x axis form prominent preferential flow paths for brine production from downstream steeper slopes facilitate higher fracco2 because brine density is greater than co2 and higher gravity helps to prevent it from migrating upward the producer from downstream fracco2 increases with corrly and becomes much more sensitive to corrly in the ranges of 800 m indicating large corrly close to the horizontal well length 1 km could generate low permeable lenses perpendicular to the x axis which serve as a flow barrier to brine production from downstream 3 2 7 produced thermal flux flxheat flxheat is calculated as the average produced thermal flux which is a product of the produced co2 mass flux and enthalpy as the fluid temperature in all the cases changes gradually from 90 to 85 c during cpg produced co2 enthalpy will not differ significantly hence flxheat mainly depends on produced co2 mass flux which in turn depends on fracco2 because the total production rate is constant the joint probability of flxheat and fracco2 fig 14 verifies that they are strongly and positively correlated the top two sensitive parameters are variance and corrlx for both flxheat and fracco2 fig 12 and their joint rs shows a similar pattern as shown in fig 13f and g slope and corrly also show themselves a positive relation to both flxheat and fracco2 4 conclusions and future studies the impact of formation heterogeneity variance azimuth correlation lengths and slope on the performance of coupled co2 geological storage and co2 circulated heat extraction are numerically evaluated for inclined low permeable semi closed 20 m thick reservoirs the major findings are concluded below in reservoirs s2 and s4 with channels corrlx corrly 10 in parallel to the main flow direction x axis channel effects on pressure co2 plume and temperature distributions on xy planes are significantly enhanced by large corrlz in contrast heterogeneity effects appear negligible in z direction due to the thin thickness 20 m steep reservoir slope can considerably reduce co2 plume development time timecpd and geothermal lifespan timecpg as well as the total recovered heat energy totheat on the contrary a steep slope can prevent heavier brine from migrating upward to the production well from downstream and hence can increase co2 mass fraction in the produced mixture fracco2 and associated co2 heat flow rate flxheat strong heterogeneity high variance of porosity permeability fields creates prominent preferential paths for upstream co2 which reduce timecpg and totheat and for downstream brine which lower fracco2 and flxheat the impact of the azimuth of spatially correlated heterogeneity is negligible on both cpd and cpg performance large continuity scale along major flow direction corrlx helps to form high permeable preferential flow paths in the x axis causing early cold co2 breakthrough from upstream short timecpg and associated low totheat large corrlx also facilitates brine abstraction from downstream reducing fracco2 and associated flxheat in contrast to corrlx large corrly may generate long low permeable lenses perpendicular to the flow direction acting as flow barriers to co2 and brine which slow down cold co2 breakthrough and brine abstraction at the producer as a result large corrly leads to large timecpg and totheat as well as high fracco2 and flxheat corrlz influences timecpd timecpg netinj dpres and totheat particularly for netinj corrlz is the only sensitive parameter and is an extremely significant one 15 m was found to be the critical value of corrlz relative to the 20 m thickness of the reservoir below 15 m preferential flow paths formed by large corrlz cause low injectivity large timecpd and early cold co2 breakthrough low timecpg which yields low net injected co2 mass and extracted co2 heat energy within timecpg above 15 m large corrlz generates low permeable lenses perpendicular flow direction that tends to cover the entire reservoir thickness significantly slowing down co2 breakthrough time at the producer in this study the well placement and operation scheme injector overpressure producer rate are fixed to investigate the influence of reservoir slope and heterogeneity exclusively future work may treat these parameters stochastic too and optimize them with the uncertainty of geological heterogeneity besides a surface power plant and wellbore model can also be coupled with the heterogeneous inclined geothermal reservoir to simulate a complete loop of co2 circulated geothermal power plant piao et al 2018 levy et al 2018 credit

2504,co2 plume geothermal cpg production is an emerging co2 utilization approach coupled with co2 geological sequestration geological heterogeneity plays an important role in co2 fluid and heat flow in the formation although the impact of heterogeneity has been investigated during co2 injection for many sequestration projects few studies have been reported for co2 circulation and associated heat extraction this study aims to numerically assess the impact of spatially correlated heterogeneity on both co2 plume development cpd and subsequential cpg operations in inclined and thinly layered geothermal reservoirs the simulated field is simplified from a typical depleted oil gas reservoir block located in a potential geothermal area in north oman which had undergone horizontal water flooding as the second oil recovery phase formation slope and heterogeneity properties including variance azimuth and correlation lengths are sampled using the latin hypercube approach in a high dimensional parameter space defined by their ranges a suite of numerical models simulating cpd cpg operations by a horizontal well doublet is set up using the slope and heterogeneity parameter samples performance metrics for cpd cpg including cpd time cpg time net injected co2 maximum pressure decline minimum co2 mass fraction in produced fluids total recovered heat energy and heat extraction rate are calculated from each of the numerical models a response surface model mapping the input slope and heterogeneity parameters and output performance metrics is developed using these model results using the response surface global sensitivity analysis is efficiently conducted to quantitatively evaluate the impact of slope and heterogeneity on the performance of cpd cpg operations it is found that steep slopes can enhance co2 injectivity facilitate high co2 fraction in produced fluids and heat extraction rate however it causes early cold co2 breakthrough to the production well and reduce total recovered heat energy high variance and x correlation length of heterogeneous fields create prominent high permeable preferential paths in the major flow direction x axis low permeable lenses created by large y correlation lengths are perpendicular to the x axis acting as flow barriers to both co2 and brine towards the production well as for z correlation length 15 m is found to be the critical value relative to 20 m of the reservoir thickness large z continuity scale facilitates fluid flow owing to the thick preferential paths when it is below 15 m but low permeable lenses tend to significantly block flow as they approximate to the reservoir thickness keywords inclined reservoir co2 storage geothermal energy spatially correlated heterogeneity correlation length data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction to mitigate climate change induced by an increasing concentration of atmospheric co2 various co2 capture utilization and storage ccus projects have been carried out around the world in the past two decades ipcc 2005 gccsi 2014 xu et al 2022 co2 geological storage cgs realized during co2 enhanced oil recovery co2 eor in depleted oil reservoirs has been demonstrated as a feasible ccus approach with recovered oil revenue to cover partial cgs costs hill et al 2013 shogenov and shogenova 2018 hedriana et al 2021 enhanced geothermal recovery egr in which co2 is used as a working fluid to extract heat from hot dry rock by fracturing the tight rock in deep reservoir has also been investigated pruess 2008 zhang et al 2013 in the past 10 years another ccus technology namely co2 plume geothermal cpg has attracted more and more attention randolph and saar 2011 adams et al 2015 cui et al 2017 fleming et al 2020 chen et al 2022a the cpg system uses partially stored co2 as the working fluid to extract heat energy from the cgs reservoirs the favorable thermodynamic properties of co2 make the cpg system more efficient than conventional water based geothermal extraction technology adams et al 2014 obviously incorporating cpg with cgs can not only produce clean geothermal energy and hence reduce fossil fuel consumption but also generate additional profits to partially cover cgs costs the studies on cgs cpg mentioned above assume homogeneous formations while in reality all reservoirs are naturally heterogeneous and embedded with multi scale fractures or channels spatial heterogeneity may significantly affect fluids flow and heat transfer in porous media and has been studied in co2 sequestration and conventional water based geothermal fields crooijmans et al 2016 and willems et al 2017 investigated the influences of heterogeneous facies on heat recovery from fluvial geothermal reservoirs and found geothermal lifespan could be overestimated due to facies heterogeneity liu et al 2019 studied spatially correlated heterogeneity and demonstrated preferential flow paths created by large correlation lengths continuity scales could lead to an early cold water breakthrough in the production well babaei and nick 2019 conducted thousands of numerical model simulations with various spatially correlated heterogeneity model parameters and doublet well placement and discharge their major conclusion is that anisotropy of heterogeneity could increase or reduce geothermal lifespan depending on the orientation of preferential flow channels and flow barriers in addition well distance should be significantly shorter in heterogeneous aquifers than in homogeneous ones babaei et al 2022 considered two types of heterogeneity namely spatially correlated heterogeneity simulated by variogram models and embedded 2d braided channels generated by the piecewise cubic hermite interpolating polynomial method fritsch and carlson 1980 in the optimization of doublet well spacing to maximize geothermal performance in addition to water based geothermal extraction cgs in heterogeneous reservoirs is also extensively investigated as the field implementations have been carried out in the past 20 years to give a few examples deng et al 2012 investigated the impacts of multi scale porosity permeability heterogeneity on co2 storage leakage and injectivity in an industry scale co2 storage site in rock spring uplift wyoming usa dai et al 2014a developed a framework for optimizing integrated cgs and co2 eor in a heterogeneous reservoir of the farnsworth unit of anadarko basin in texas usa williams and chadwick 2021 evaluated the impacts of reservoir scale heterogeneity on spatiotemporal dynamics of co2 plume at the sleipner field norway harris et al 2021 investigated the effects on capillary trapping of co2 in the captain sandstone laboratory experiments and numerical simulations of synthetic heterogeneous formations are also conducted to investigate co2 migration and trapping mechanisms heterogeneity impacts on dissolution trapping of co2 were evaluated using a 2d cell experiment by agartan et al 2015 and numerical simulations by abbaszadeh and shariatipour 2018 respectively heterogeneity induced trapping mechanism for cgs was comprehensively studied and demonstrated in various marine sediments by dai et al 2018 rasheed et al 2020 studied the effect of different levels of heterogeneity on co2 storage potential using numerical models furthermore a few studies have evaluated heterogeneity impacts on co2 eor and optimized well placement and operations as it is a feasible ccus technology practically implemented biu victor 2011 chen et al 2013 dai et al 2014b khan and mandal 2021 very limited studies have been reported on heterogeneity impacts on a cpg system probably due to the fact that cpg technology has emerged only in recent years xu et al 2017 presented a 3d modeling evaluation of cpg performance in a spatially correlated heterogeneous formation based on geothermal conditions of songliao basin china they found that as long as a highly permeable zone exists between the injection production wells high mobile co2 is more likely to flow through the high permeable zone acting as the preferential flow path the evaluation is conducted based on only one geostatistical model norouzi et al 2022 evaluated cpg simulations in a suite of heterogeneous fluvial formations embedded with synthetic 2d braided channel features and found the optimal doublet well spacing and required upscaling level both studies adopted a vertical well doublet placement which is only feasible for reservoirs with high permeability besides co2 mass fraction in produced fluids was not managed during cpg simulations which should be high enough for the appropriate operation of the surface co2 turbine generator it can be controlled by developing a sufficient co2 plume to cover the heat sweeping area chen et al 2022b investigated the impacts of six scenarios of spatially correlated porosity permeability heterogeneity on cpg operation in a high porous low permeable and thinly bedded formation which is a typical oil reservoir in north oman a horizontal well triplet is placed and demonstrated feasible for this type of reservoir the study assumed reservoir formation is saturated with co2 initially and didn t consider co2 plume development cpd stage based on the reviews of the existing three works on the heterogeneity impacts on cpg slope effects of the heterogeneous formation on cpg haven t been studied geological formations are always inclined to some extent in nature the density of supercritical co2 in the reservoir formation is smaller than brine and highly dynamic with reservoir pressure and temperature slope affects the co2 migration and heat recovery in both cpd and cpg operations as an extension of chen et al 2022b s work this study aims to investigate the combined impacts of both formation slope and heterogeneity on sequential cpd and cpg operations unlike the previous evaluations based on only several discrete scenarios slope and geostatistical model parameters variance azimuth correlation lengths are sampled in a high dimensional parameter space in their ranges as model inputs sequential simulations of cpd and cpg models based on these parameter samples are carried out and corresponding performance metrics of cpd cpg are calculated a response surface rs between input parameters and performance metrics is developed by which global sensitivity is analyzed and performance is evaluated continuously in the ranges of the sensitive parameters as one of the performance metrics co2 mass fraction in produced mixture and its sensitivity to formation slope and heterogeneity is evaluated which is lacking in the previous studies 2 modeling methods 2 1 co2 brine flow and heat model the models to simulate co2 brine flow and heat transfer are set up using nuft code a multiphase multi component non isothermal flow and solute transport simulator developed and maintained by lawrence livermore national laboratory of us department of energy nitao 1998 nuft has incorporated a well established equation of co2 and water and has been successfully applied in many co2 related underground reservoir studies in the past decade buscheck et al 2012 saar et al 2015 chen et al 2020 2022a as shown in fig 1 the reservoir domain is defined as a 2 km 3 km 20 m xyz cuboid inclined clockwise around the y axis at the anchor point of 0 0 which is simplified from typical fault blocks in north oman zhao et al 2012 rajabi et al 2021 the domain is spatially discretized into uniform 50 50 1 m3 blocks yielding 40 60 20 48 000 grid cells the anchor point i e the left top corner is assumed at the depth of 1500 m where pressure and temperature are specified as 17 mpa and 90 c accordingly the initial pressures at other grid cells are calculated based on depth and hydrostatics note that the depth of each cell varies with reservoir dip slope angle except the anchor point the initial temperature and salinity is assumed 90 c and 18 wt uniformly across the entire reservoir all boundaries are sealed except the right yz plane boundary bottom xy plane boundary is imposed 0 05 w m2 of constant heat flow source reservoir thermal conductivity and specific heat are specified as 2 1 w m oc and 1000 j kg oc respectively residual co2 and brine saturation are assumed to be 0 3 and 0 05 rock porosity and permeability are treated as spatially correlated random fields to be discussed in section 2 2 the reservoir models simulate two sequential operations namely co2 plume development cpd and co2 plume geothermal cpg production a horizontal well doublet with 600 m distance is placed on the top layer of the reservoir in the middle y range of the domain fig 1 during the 1st cpd stage pure cold 30 c co2 is injected into the horizontal injector under constant 15 mpa of overpressure linearly increased to the value in one year the injected co2 displaces native brine and migrates towards the right open boundary after 3 mt co2 is injected and the developed plume covers the well doublet the producer starts to extract hot fluids at 5 kg s linearly increased to the value in one year while co2 injection continues under the same overpressure initiating the 2nd cpg stage during the cpg stage partial injected co2 is circulated as the working fluid to extract geothermal heat the extracted fluid is mainly co2 with minor brine 10 co produced the fluids go through the surface power plant and cooled pure co2 is re injected into the reservoir with additional compensating co2 for co produced brine pump or compressor might not need if the thermosiphon effect is significant enough adam et al 2015 2 2 spatially correlated heterogeneity simulation heterogeneous porosity is modeled as a 3d spatially correlated gaussian random field using a geostatistical code cirpka 2003 chen et al 2022b rock intrinsic permeability k fields are derived from porosity ϕ by the equation k 192 ϕ 3 1 ϕ 2 abbaszadeh et al 2000 note that mean porosity is fixed as 0 25 and the corresponding mean permeability is 5 3 md representing high porous and low permeable heterogeneous formations fig 2 shows five examples of porosity fields s1 s5 with different combinations of correlation lengths in x y and z directions termed as corrlx corrly corrlz which measure continuous lengths of large or low porosity values in x y and z directions with 1000 m of corrlx and corrly s1 represents a large isotropic high or low porosity permeability region in xy plane in contrast s2 and s3 illustrate channel features in parallel to x and y with the ratio of corrlx corrly 10 and 0 1 respectively s4 and s5 differ from s2 and s3 by extending corrlz from 1 to 20 m indicating continuity scale in the z direction of the thin formation for s2 and s4 which both are characterized by channels in parallel to the general flow direction x axis perpendicular to horizontal wells with respective corrlz 1 and 20 m cpd cpg is simulated with two formation slopes 2 and 20 the four simulations are carried out to demonstrate the spatiotemporal behaviors of cpd and cpg in the channeled reservoirs as well as the comparative analysis of the combined impact of slope and corrlz 2 3 response surface model in order to systematically investigate the continuous impact of reservoir slope and heterogeneity in specified ranges on cpd cpg response surface models approximating relationships between specified inputs and outputs are developed based on the training dataset generated by physical nuft models chen et al 2020 as shown in fig 3 100 input samples are drawn from a 6 dimensional parameter space defined by specified ranges table 1 using the latin hypercube sampling approach mckay et al 1979 input parameters 2 6 including variance azimuth corrlx corrly and corrlz are for the geostatistical model to generate 10 equally probable realizations of the porosity field for each sample the geological indication of the correlation lengths has been discussed in the last section variance indicates the degree of spread in porosity values of 48 000 model grid cells azimuth is the axis of maximum continuity rotated in xy plane based on these 1000 porosity and derived permeability fields 1000 nuft models simulating sequential cpd and cpg are set up and run in the clusters at sultan qaboos university cpd model is simulated to the time when 3mt of co2 is injected cpg model then reads the values of primary variables pressure temperature liquid saturation co2 and salt concentrations at the end of cpd as the initial state and is simulated for 50 years seven output variables are designed as the performance indicators and described in table 2 with the 1st one from cpd and the other six from the cpg stage for each nuft model the seven outputs are calculated the 1000 output vectors are averaged over the associated 10 realizations for each input sample leading to 100 mean output vectors based on the 100 pairs of inputs outputs as the training dataset the rs model is fitted and validated using the bmars algorithm bühlmann 2003 chen et al 2020 global sensitivity measured by sobol total order indices sti sobol 2001 is efficiently calculated to evaluate the impact of inputs on outputs using the rs model chen et al 2021 all the algorithms used in rs development and analysis are from psuade problem solving environment for uncertainty quantification and design exploration a suite of uncertainty quantification algorithms developed by lawrence livermore national laboratory tong 2009 3 results and analysis 3 1 spatial and temporal behaviors of geothermal reservoirs in this section the four cpd cpg cases in heterogeneous scenarios s2 corrlz 1 m and s4 corrlz 20 m at the slope of 2 and 20 are discussed to illustrate and comparatively analyze spatial distributions of pressure temperature and co2 plume figs 4 8 time series of cumulative co2 injection during cpd fig 9 and co2 net injection rate producer temperature co2 mass fraction and thermal flux during cpg fig 10 3 1 1 spatial distribution of pressure fig 4 shows the pressure contour maps of the four cases at the end of cpd start of cpg when 3 mt co2 is injected under constant 32 mpa injection pressure initial 17 15 mpa overpressure from left to right pressure varies from 32 to 18 and 24 mpa with 2 and 20 slope respectively it is because the slope is defined as the clockwise angle around y axis at the anchor point x z 0 0 i e the left top corner the right boundary of the reservoir inclined by 20 is about 600 m deeper than that inclined 2 yielding 6 mpa of initial pressure difference according to hydrostatics pressures propagate farther and show stronger heterogeneous plume in xy plane with 20 m than 1 m of corrlz however pressure plumes show no apparent heterogeneity in the z direction even for cases with 1 m corrlz due to the thin thickness of the formation 20 m reservoir pressures drop after 50 years of fluid extraction at 5 kg s by the producer fig 5 as the injector pressure is fixed at 32 mpa the pressure gradient is sharp between the injector and the producer the producer pressure is greater than downstream in 2 slope cases but becomes a local minimum in 20 slope cases suggesting a larger portion of injected co2 could bypass the producer towards the downstream region in the former cases moreover partial co2 in the downstream area might be extracted to the producer according to the pressure gradient in 20 slope cases these findings indicate net injected co2 could be less in reservoirs with a steeper slope besides the impact of corrlz on the pressure distribution at the time seems minor 3 1 2 spatial distribution of co2 saturation unlike pressure co2 plumes show remarkable channel effects caused by 10 of the corrlx corrly ratio fig 6 preferential flow paths are formed in those high permeable channels with the same amount of co2 injected 3 mt plumes spread farther in the x direction in the 2 slope than in the 20 slope cases while channel effects are more prominent in the 20 m corrlz cases than those 1 m cases xz plumes in fig 6 demonstrate co2 can migrate farther in the z direction in the 20 m corrlz cases fig 7 presents co2 plumes after 50 years of cpg operation despite continuous fluids extraction by the producer a considerable amount of co2 from the injector bypassed the producer and spread to the right open boundary plumes almost fill up the top xy planes in 2 slope cases while only co2 in preferential paths reaches the right boundary in 20 slope cases similar to fig 6 co2 plumes in the two 20 m corrlz cases show a stronger channel effect unlike fig 6 plumes in middle xz slices show a similar degree of spread in z direction for both values of corrlz larger corrlz can enhance co2 flow in z direction in preferential channels meaning that it helps co2 propagate farther in z direction during the injection only cpd stage but also help co2 be attracted to the producer on the top xy layer during the cpg stage as a result co2 spread in the z direction after 50 years of cpg won t show an apparent difference between cases with different corrlz 3 1 3 spatial distribution of temperature in all four cases cold temperature plumes are restricted within 100 m from the injector at the end of cpd not presented and within the inter well heat sweeping zone after 50 years of cpg fig 8 similar to co2 plumes cold xy plumes show more significant channel effect in the two 20 m corrlz cases than the 1 m cases verifying that larger corrlz can enhance preferential co2 flows cold xz plumes show no heterogeneous behaviors in the z direction in all the cases 3 1 4 temporal behaviors of cpd cpg fig 9 compares the history of cumulative injected co2 and shows the required times to achieve the target of 3 mt mass injection during the cpd stage for the four cases it is seen that the injection rate is stabilized after 2 years under the constant injector overpressure the cpd time is 22 9 24 24 2 and 25 6 years in sequence for the case of 20 1 m 20 20 m 2 1 m and 2 20 m it looks that a steeper slope and shorter corrlz help to reduce cpd time fig 10 shows temporal behaviors of the geothermal reservoir during the 50 years of cpg the producer extracts fluids at a rate linearly increased from 0 to 5 kg s in the 1st year and remained constant thereafter in response the net injected co2 rates in the four cases drop drastically in the 1st year to the lowest point about 0 5 kg s where they rebound in the 2nd year and increase slowly thereafter fig 10a the stabilized rate after 4 years is higher in the two 20 slope cases than the other two with 2 slope corrlz shows slight influence on the net injected rate in the 20 slope cases the 1 m case leads to higher net injection than the 20 m case does produced fluid temperature averaged over the 1 km producer is continuously falling during cpg fig 10b obviously temperature declines faster in the cases with higher degree of slope resulting in a shorter lifespan of the geothermal reservoir in this study lifespan is defined as the cpg time timecpg when the produced temperature drops below 85 c dashed line it can be seen that timecpg of the two 20 slope cases is around 40 years while that for 2 slope cases is longer than 46 years co2 mass fraction in the produced fluids co2 and brine is mainly determined by the location of the producer chen et al 2022a and 94 is recommended for the sake of appropriate operation of the surface power plant as shown in fig 10c it drops abruptly in the first few years responding to the initiation of fluid extraction and then recovers smoothly it is found that the 20 1 m case achieves the greatest co2 mass fraction produced co2 thermal flux is a product of extracted co2 mass flux and enthalpy which depends on pressure and temperature as the hot fluids are extracted at a rate from 0 to 5 kg s in the 1st year it rises sharply from 0 to the maximum drops in the next 2 3 years and increases smoothly with co2 mass fraction and eventually decreases as the temperature drops fig 10d the comparison of the four curves shows that higher thermal flux results from the steeper slope and smaller corrlz 3 2 response surface analysis the quality of rs models are examined by comparing outputs between the physics based nuft model and data driven bmars model fig 11 shows two scatterplots of 100 outputs of netinj and totheat during rs model cross validation the 0 989 and 0 978 of r square values suggest the fitted rs models using bmars algorithm can well approximate the nuft model outputs as each bmars bagging mars model initiates 50 instantiations of mars models each dot and the associated crossed error bar in fig 11 represent the mean and one standard deviation of the 50 mars outputs in the next sub sections sti of the 7 outputs to the 6 inputs are conveniently computed using rs models and plotted in fig 12 for each output 2d joint rs of the most sensitive input abscissa and each of the other sensitive inputs ordinate are visualized in fig 13 the input parameters with sti 0 1 are considered insensitive and excluded from rs analysis in this section histograms of the outputs and pairwise joint probability between them are illustrated in fig 14 3 2 1 co2 plume development time timecpd the purpose of the cpd stage is to inject 3mt of co2 and develop a co2 plume for co2 circulation in the following cpg stage timecpd is the time required to achieve the injection target obviously co2 injectivity is reversely correlated to timecpd according to fig 12 timecpd is strongly sensitive to slope sti 0 69 and slightly sensitive to corrlx sti 0 12 and corrlz sti 0 17 as indicated by the 2d rss of slope corrlx and slope corrlz fig 13a timecpd is reduced from 30 to 20 years with a slope from 2 to 20 indicating injectivity could be enhanced with steeper slopes it slightly decreases with corrlx until 500 m and increases thereafter it increases with corrlz in the range 15 m with slope 10 these findings suggest that co2 injectivity is mainly affected by the formation slope rather than heterogeneity porosity permeability continuity in x axis major flow direction will enhance injectivity owing to the formed preferential flow paths along x axis if it is shorter than 500 m but will slightly block the fluid migration along y axis due to the low permeable flow barriers if it is longer than 500 m timecpd increases with corrlz in the bottom right area of the rs suggesting continuity extension in z axis somewhat blocks the flow especially in steep slope formations it might be caused by the increasing low permeable area acting as the flow barrier in z direction with the increase of corrlz however when corrlz 15 m its impact shows some irregular pattern it is probably due to the combined effects of large z continuity of both preferential flow paths and barriers 3 2 2 co2 geothermal production time timecpg co2 geothermal production stops when produced fluid temperature drops below 85 c so timecpg can be regarded as the indicator of cold plume breakthrough time to the producer unlike timecpd the impacts on timecpg are evenly distributed between slope and heterogeneity the sensitive input parameters are slope corrlz variance corrlx and corrly with sti in the sequence of 0 34 0 34 0 26 0 18 and 0 14 fig 13b shows the four 2d rss between slope and the other four sensitive input parameters similar to timecpd timecpg decreases from 40 to 25 years with slope it also decreases with variance especially with a steep slope and high variance top right area of the slope variance rs timecpg decreases with corrlx and increases with corrly mainly in slope 10 range these results suggest that prominent large variance channels in parallel with flow direction large corrlx small corrly can speed up cold plume breakthrough in steep slope reservoirs larger corrlz helps to reduce timecpg but it shows reverse effects near up limit of 20 m which is also the reservoir thickness it is because large corrlz could mean large continuity of both high and low porosity permeability zone timecpg decrease first with corrlz as the thicker high permeable zones help cold co2 flow to the producer however when corrlz is close to 20 m i e the formation thickness the low permeable zones could significantly block flow paths mainly on the x axis of cold co2 especially combined with large corrly this will slow down cold plume propagation yielding a long timecpg 3 2 3 net injected co2 netinj netinj stands for the cumulative net co2 injection by timecpg which ranges from 3 1 and 4 6 mt 3 0 mt of injection during cpd stage it is surprising that corrlz turns out to be the only parameter that controls netinj with a high sti of 0 87 fig 12 as the other five parameters are insensitive sti 0 1 only 1d rs for netinj versus corrlz is plotted fig 13c it shows that netinj decreases from 4 3 to the minimum as corrlz increases from 2 to 15 m and increases again to 3 7 mt at corrlz 20 m as the production rate is fixed as 5 kg s the netinj is positively correlated to the injectivity reverse of timecpd and timecpg which is verified by the joint probability distribution of netinj timecpd and netinj timecpg fig 14 both injectivity and timecpg decrease with corrlz in the range of 15 m and reverse the trend thereafter fig 13a and b causing the decrease of netinj to the lowest point at corrlz 15 m and then rebound another question has to be answered here why is slope the top sensitive parameter for timecpd injectivity and timecpg insensitive for netinj it could be explained by the fact that the steep slope enhances injectivity but reduce timecpg causing its insensitivity to netinj which is the cumulative product of net injection rate and time 3 2 4 pressure declines dpres dpres represents the maximum pressure declines at the producer during cpg its behavior should be similar to injectivity as they reflect flow conditions around the producer and injector respectively the larger the dpres or timecpd the worse the flow conditions around the producer or the injector consequently dpres changes with corrlx and corrlz in similar trends as timecpd does peaked at 15 m along corrlz and bottomed at 500 m along corrlx as shown in fig 13a and d whereas timecpd is significantly sensitive to the reservoir slope while dpres is insensitive to it fig 12 it is because the injector is located at the top left corner and impacted by downstream flow conditions only while the producer is at x 650 m and abstracts fluids from both upstream and downstream by which the slope s impact on the dpres is counteracted fig 14 demonstrates dpres is positively correlated with timecpd as well as its strong negative correlation to netinj 3 2 5 produced total heat totheat totheat is the cumulative extracted co2 heat energy by timecpg which is determined by produced co2 flux and duration as the produced fluid rate is constant at 5 kg s fracco2 determines the produced co2 mass flux consequently totheat is positively correlated to both fracco2 and timecpg as shown in fig 12 sensitive parameters and their stis are highly similar between totheat and timecpg suggesting they might be strongly positively correlated their joint probability of both the parameters in fig 14 confirms they are almost linearly correlated the four rss fig 13e of totheat corresponding to corrlz and the other four sensitive parameters show similar trends as those of timecpg the sensitivity analysis for totheat can hence refer to those for timecpg 3 2 6 co2 mass fraction in produced fluids fracco2 fracco2 is the lowest value of co2 mass fraction of the produced fluids which usually occurs in the first couple of years of cpg fig 10c generally 0 94 is considered the minimum feasible co2 mass fraction for a surface turbine generator the top two sensitive parameters for fracco2 are variance and corrlx followed by slight sensitive corrly and slope fig 13 the three rss in fig 13f show fracco2 is above 0 94 in most ranges of the four parameters owing to the well developed co2 plume and appropriate injector producer space fracco2 drops below 0 94 in a small area between up limits of both variance and corrlx suggesting strong heterogeneity and large continuity in the main flow direction x axis form prominent preferential flow paths for brine production from downstream steeper slopes facilitate higher fracco2 because brine density is greater than co2 and higher gravity helps to prevent it from migrating upward the producer from downstream fracco2 increases with corrly and becomes much more sensitive to corrly in the ranges of 800 m indicating large corrly close to the horizontal well length 1 km could generate low permeable lenses perpendicular to the x axis which serve as a flow barrier to brine production from downstream 3 2 7 produced thermal flux flxheat flxheat is calculated as the average produced thermal flux which is a product of the produced co2 mass flux and enthalpy as the fluid temperature in all the cases changes gradually from 90 to 85 c during cpg produced co2 enthalpy will not differ significantly hence flxheat mainly depends on produced co2 mass flux which in turn depends on fracco2 because the total production rate is constant the joint probability of flxheat and fracco2 fig 14 verifies that they are strongly and positively correlated the top two sensitive parameters are variance and corrlx for both flxheat and fracco2 fig 12 and their joint rs shows a similar pattern as shown in fig 13f and g slope and corrly also show themselves a positive relation to both flxheat and fracco2 4 conclusions and future studies the impact of formation heterogeneity variance azimuth correlation lengths and slope on the performance of coupled co2 geological storage and co2 circulated heat extraction are numerically evaluated for inclined low permeable semi closed 20 m thick reservoirs the major findings are concluded below in reservoirs s2 and s4 with channels corrlx corrly 10 in parallel to the main flow direction x axis channel effects on pressure co2 plume and temperature distributions on xy planes are significantly enhanced by large corrlz in contrast heterogeneity effects appear negligible in z direction due to the thin thickness 20 m steep reservoir slope can considerably reduce co2 plume development time timecpd and geothermal lifespan timecpg as well as the total recovered heat energy totheat on the contrary a steep slope can prevent heavier brine from migrating upward to the production well from downstream and hence can increase co2 mass fraction in the produced mixture fracco2 and associated co2 heat flow rate flxheat strong heterogeneity high variance of porosity permeability fields creates prominent preferential paths for upstream co2 which reduce timecpg and totheat and for downstream brine which lower fracco2 and flxheat the impact of the azimuth of spatially correlated heterogeneity is negligible on both cpd and cpg performance large continuity scale along major flow direction corrlx helps to form high permeable preferential flow paths in the x axis causing early cold co2 breakthrough from upstream short timecpg and associated low totheat large corrlx also facilitates brine abstraction from downstream reducing fracco2 and associated flxheat in contrast to corrlx large corrly may generate long low permeable lenses perpendicular to the flow direction acting as flow barriers to co2 and brine which slow down cold co2 breakthrough and brine abstraction at the producer as a result large corrly leads to large timecpg and totheat as well as high fracco2 and flxheat corrlz influences timecpd timecpg netinj dpres and totheat particularly for netinj corrlz is the only sensitive parameter and is an extremely significant one 15 m was found to be the critical value of corrlz relative to the 20 m thickness of the reservoir below 15 m preferential flow paths formed by large corrlz cause low injectivity large timecpd and early cold co2 breakthrough low timecpg which yields low net injected co2 mass and extracted co2 heat energy within timecpg above 15 m large corrlz generates low permeable lenses perpendicular flow direction that tends to cover the entire reservoir thickness significantly slowing down co2 breakthrough time at the producer in this study the well placement and operation scheme injector overpressure producer rate are fixed to investigate the influence of reservoir slope and heterogeneity exclusively future work may treat these parameters stochastic too and optimize them with the uncertainty of geological heterogeneity besides a surface power plant and
