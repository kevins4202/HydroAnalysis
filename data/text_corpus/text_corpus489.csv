2445,seasonal variation of vegetation profoundly affects the water cycle however the seasonal divergence of evapotranspiration et sensitivity in response to vegetation variations has not been fully understood here we derived an analytical solution to examine the impact of seasonal vegetation changes on et with an extended budyko framework based on an improved et algorithm with improved water balance constraints results reveal a clear seasonal divergence of et sensitivity to vegetation coverage changes across climate regimes and biomes generally the high et sensitivity to vegetation coverage has a clear north south shift trajectory from spring to winter for moderate humid regions 0 7 aridity index 1 0 vegetation exhibits higher importance in altering et in march september while for moderate dry regions 1 0 aridity index 1 4 the sensitivity of et to vegetation changes is the highest in september november moreover the spatial temporal pattern of et sensitivity to seasonal vegetation changes is different between short vegetation cover and forest additionally negative et sensitivity to vegetation coverage changes was discovered in regions with seasonal precipitation of less than 500 mm and sparse vegetation coverage predominant land cover types of grassland scrubland and savannas in summary our study provides an analytical solution to estimate et sensitivity to seasonal vegetation changes within the extended budyko framework the results highlight the difference in hydrological response to vegetation dynamics across seasons and vegetation types keywords evapotranspiration vegetation change analytical solution extended budyko framework data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction terrestrial evapotranspiration et is a critical nexus in the hydrological cycle that links the interaction between climate soil vegetation and terrain donohue et al 2012 fisher et al 2008 purdy et al 2018 wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 changes in et closely relate to the varying catchment landscape and the climatic feedback li et al 2015 madhu et al 2014 xia et al 2014 recent studies showed that large scale vegetation changes have occurred globally and are greatly affecting the terrestrial hydrological portioning the partitioning of precipitation p into et storage change δs and runoff r e g chen et al 2020 sun et al 2006 zhang et al 2010 zhang et al 2018 despite increasing efforts in advancing the fundamental understanding of the underlying vegetation impacts in regulating et patterns the varying seasonal governance of vegetation growth on global et patterns remain poorly quantified chen et al 2020 jung et al 2010 pei et al 2017 recent studies found that climate change may lead to greater seasonal asymmetry for instance higher warming rates in spring and winter he and li 2020 marsh and zhang 2022 sun et al 2006 xu et al 2013a xu et al 2013b such asymmetry will continually affect the seasonality of catchment conditions including fluxes such as soil moisture chou et al 2013 resulting in a clear seasonal divergence in response to the vegetation activities for instance pei et al 2017 found that under climate change the response of inter annual et to vegetation changes shows a seasonal divergence in the dry yellow river basin the lack of understanding of the role of vegetation variations in et changes limits our ability to model the terrestrial atmospheric biophysical feedback of the global hydrological cycle under future climate forzieri et al 2020 pei et al 2017 in this context a quantitative understanding of how seasonal vegetation dynamics can affect et across a full range of bio climates is requisite to achieve sustainable water management and get prepared to adapting the coming changes disentangling the contribution of vegetation dynamics from that of other environmental factors on surface hydrological partitioning is challenging due to the varying land atmosphere interactions across multiple spatial temporal scales ellison et al 2012 sun et al 2006 three methods have been primarily implemented to quantify the contribution of vegetation dynamics on surface hydrological partitioning zhang et al 2018 the first method is based on the investigation of the paired catchment experiments traditionally the paired catchment experiments are the most direct approaches to effectively measuring the change in water availability caused by vegetation altering bai et al 2020 wei et al 2008 this approach compares the difference in hydrological functioning between at least two adjacent small catchments that have similar climatic and landscape characteristics brown et al 2005 however scaling the results from small catchment experiments to large basins remains difficult due to the diversity of controlling factors of hydrology in large river basins wang et al 2013 the second method to determine the vegetation effect on hydrology is based on land surface modelling or remote sensing et algorithms that explicitly incorporate vegetation dynamics miralles et al 2011 shen et al 2013 the difference between numerical process based model runs with or without vegetation changes including the vegetation type and conditions is taken the net effect of vegetation dynamics in hydrological partitioning chen et al 2020 lei et al 2014 li et al 2011 while the physical mechanism behind the process based model is clear the results vary dramatically among models stemming from the complex combinations of embedded hypotheses or the simplifications of et processes bai et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 additionally the estimated difference between model runs does not necessarily exclude the effects of factors aside from vegetation dynamics on the model results sivapalan et al 2003 the third method is built on budyko framework the budyko framework which describes the hydrological partitioning as a functional balance between water supply precipitation p and energy supply potential evapotranspiration pet at the steady state has been recognized as a useful tool for quantifying hydrological response to landscape perturbations at the regional scale budyko 1958 1974 fu 1981 fu and wang 2019 greve and seneviratne 2015 the effects of vegetation dynamics on et are quantified through the links between the budyko parameter and vegetation indices li et al 2013 xu et al 2013a xu et al 2013b zhang et al 2018 compared with the other methods there are two advantages of using the budyko framework first the budyko framework aims to explain the hydrological behavior using empirical data with a simple model structure which eliminates the dependence on embedded hypotheses as in the process based models wang and tang 2014 zhang et al 2018 second the budyko framework has the ability to analytically isolate the individual impact of environmental factors on hydrological partitioning through the simulation of the budyko parameter roderick and farquhar 2011 wang and hejazi 2011 xu et al 2014 however two limitations of the budyko framework impede the application of the budyko equation in estimating the response of et to seasonal vegetation variation first the parameter in the budyko framework is usually considered a comprehensive representation of land surface and climatic characteristics including vegetation topography soil properties and climatic seasonality fu 1981 li et al 2013 potter and zhang 2009 roderick and farquhar 2011 wang and tang 2014 consequently the relationship between the budyko parameter and vegetation is usually empirical and the forms of expression vary greatly among studies li et al 2013 xu et al 2013a xu et al 2013b this limits the application of the budyko framework to regions where long term datasets are available to construct the empirical relationship zhang et al 2018 recently studies have attempted to solve this problem by adding a physical mechanism to link the budyko parameter and vegetation indices donohue et al 2012 yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 they found that the budyko parameter has a close relationship with the parameter in a soil moisture model i e the porporato model subsequently they examined the impact of vegetation changes on hydrological partitioning by developing a combined model that couples the budyko and porporato models however the budyko porporato model is developed to examine hydrological partitioning at the mean annual scale rather than to detect changes that occur at a shorter time scale zhang et al 2018 this limits our ability to develop a generic and unified physically based understanding of the short term hydrological response to seasonal vegetation changes second the budyko framework is derived based on a steady hydro climatological condition when the δs can be neglected which limits the application of the budyko framework to the long temporal scale e g mean annual scale recent research attempted to extend the budyko framework to the monthly scale chen et al 2013 zhang et al 2008a zhang et al 2008b for instance xing et al 2018 verified the ability of the budyko framework in describing the partitioning of p into r et and δs at the monthly scale and subsequently simulated et at the monthly scale using the budyko framework although studies have successfully applied the budyko framework at the monthly scale the application of the extended budyko framework to investigate the effects of seasonal vegetation changes on et is still lacking recently fu et al 2022 developed an et algorithm from the hydrological model in the extended budyko framework the new et algorithm provided an analytical solution for calculating the parameter in the budyko framework at multiple temporal scales moreover the combination of the energy balance from the remote sensing et model and the water balance constraints from the hydrological model enables the new algorithm to perform better than the energy balance based et model at multiple temporal scales here we improve the et algorithm from fu et al 2022 to build an analytical relationship between et and the monthly vegetation changes in the extended budyko framework then we derive an analytical solution to investigate the sensitivity of et to seasonal vegetation changes globally the specific objectives of this study are to i develop an analytical solution to examine the divergence of et sensitivity to seasonal vegetation changes ii investigate the global patterns of the et sensitivity to seasonal vegetation changes across various bioclimatic conditions and iii explore the response of et to seasonal vegetation changes under climate change our results may help to deepen the understanding of the atmosphere vegetation interactions and further reveal the underlying mechanisms 2 methodology 2 1 the proportionality hypothesis based et model satellite driven et algorithms serve as an effective way to estimate the global et however many algorithms are independent of water balance constraints which potentially limits their ability to estimate et to solve that fu et al 2022 developed an et model denoted as the pew model by combining the proportionality hypothesis based water balance constraints with the priestley taylor jet propulsion laboratory pt jpl et algorithm the proportionality hypothesis is that the ratio of continuing abstraction fa to its potential s is equal to the ratio of direct runoff q to its potential value p ia scs 1972 1 f a s q p i a where fa mm and s mm are the continuing abstraction in the hydrological processes and the potential value of fa respectively q mm is the direct runoff p mm is the precipitation and ia mm is the initial abstraction at the event scale precipitation is partitioned into q and soil wetting w mm where w includes ia and fa the physical meaning of ia is the amount of water loss before q is generated after water loss through ia the remaining water is partitioned into fa and q the proportionality hypothesis has been generalized by ponce and shetty 1995 to express the competition between different hydrological variables as 2 x x 0 x p x 0 y z x 0 where the amount of water resources z is partitioned into components x and y over a certain time interval x is limited by its potential value denoted as xp the initial water demand x0 is allocated to x before the competition between x and y which means x has a priority to meet x0 y is thus constrained by the total water available i e z x0 based on the generalized proportionality hypothesis the pew model is expressed as 3 et e 0 pet e 0 p δ s e t p δ s e 0 where e 0 mm is the initial evapotranspiration including evaporation through vegetation interception e c 0 mm and water storage in topsoils e s 0 mm δ s mm is the soil moisture change in eq 3 the p δ s is equivalent to effective precipitation p e m m in our study at each site the water storage s i 1 and s i was calculated by multiplying the measurements of soil moisture at the beginning and end of the process respectively by the soil water content height at the site scale the water storage s i 1 and s i was calculated by multiplying the soil water content height s i 1 is the soil water storage at the last time step last day or last month and s i is the soil water storage at the current time step the soil water content height at each site can be directly obtained from the variable information metadata in the fluxnet dataset pastorello et al 2020 for the pixel scale the s i 1 and s i were calculated based on the soil moisture data in the era5 land datasets then the soil water storage change δ s was calculated as δ s s i s i 1 and the effective precipitation p e was calculated as p e p δ s dividing the numerator and denominator of both sides of eq 3 by p e the pew model can be expressed as 4 et p e pet p e e 0 p e 2 1 pet p e 2 e 0 p e in fu et al 2022 the pew model performed better than the pt jpl model across multiple spatiotemporal scales results show that the incorporation of the water balance constraints in the energy balance based algorithm could improve the et estimation for the sake of brevity the detailed validation of the pew model is not reproduced here see fu et al 2022 for details in the pew model e 0 is a critical parameter which is estimated by the pt jpl algorithm by fu et al 2022 to better reflect the controlling effects of the environmental factors on et we improved the pew model by using the penman monteith mu algorithm pm mu instead of the pt jpl algorithm 2 2 the penman monteith mu algorithm the pm type models have been widely used in hydrological and climatological studies cleugh et al 2007 mu et al 2011 chen et al 2020 cleugh et al 2007 developed an et algorithm using the penman monteith equation driven by modis derived vegetation data and daily surface meteorological inputs subsequently many formulations based on the hypothesis of the pm equation have been modified to estimate the global et based on leaf area index lai or normalized difference vegetation index ndvi datasets in the pm type models et is generally calculated as the sum of the soil evaporation es transpiration ec evaporation from the wet soil surface es 0 and evaporation from canopy intercepted precipitation ec 0 mu et al 2011 estimated each part of the et based on pm equation with consideration of both aerodynamic conditions and surface resistances following the pm mu algorithm ec 0 in this study is estimated as 5 e c 0 δ r n c ρ c p es e a rhrc δ p a c p r v c λ ε r h r c f c f w e t where rnc is the canopy net radiation fwet is the relative surface wetness computed as fwet r h 4 and rh is the relative humidity fc is the vegetation cover fraction the aerodynamic resistance rhrc and wet canopy resistance rvc of the wet canopy surface are calculated based on wet canopy resistance to sensible heat rhc and resistance to radiative heat transfer through the air rrc as 6 rhc 1 g l sh l a i f w e t rrc ρ c p 4 σ t m 3 rhrc rhc r r c rhc r r c rvc 1 g l ewv l a i f w e t where g l sh is leaf conductance to sensible heat per unit lai g l ewv is leaf conductance to evaporated water vapor per unit lai σ is stefan boltzmann constant t m means average air temperature the calibration of g l ewv and g l sh in the pew mu model according to previous studies for each biome is shown in table 1 the es 0 in the pm mu algorithm is described as 7 e s 0 δ rns g ρ c p 1 f c es e a ras δ p a c p r t o t λ ε r a s f w e t where the total aerodynamic resistance to vapor transport rtot and the aerodynamic resistance at the soil

as pew mu 2 4 validation of the pew mu model the performance of the pew model has been comprehensively validated in the previous study at the multiple spatial temporal scales which shows improved et estimates compared with the pt jpl algorithm fu et al 2022 the main difference between the pew and the pew mu model is in the calculation of e 0 in the pew mu model e 0 is derived based on the pm mu algorithm given that both the pt jpl algorithm and pm mu algorithm are widely used to estimate et we validated the simulated et against observed et at 100 flux stations see section 3 for more information from two perspectives i e site level and biome level for both levels we compared the estimated and observed mean monthly et during the observation period of each flux site 2 5 sensitivity analysis of evapotranspiration to vegetation dynamics based on the pew mu model et can be expressed as a function of lai among other environmental factors 11 et f lai p e t p e r n t m v p d r h g l sh g l ewv to evaluate the impacts of vegetation changes on et we calculated the partial differentials of eq 11 12 ε lai e t l a i where ε lai is the et sensitivity to lai and can be calculated by the partial derivative of the eq 10 in the sensitivity analysis we used the mean monthly lai for the four seasons spring march may summer june august autumn september november and winter december february as a proxy for seasonal vegetation condition zhu et al 2017 it is noted that the months for the same seasons between the southern hemisphere and the northern hemisphere are different in this study the months have been labeled in the figures to avoid the confused identification of the seasons for the southern hemisphere 3 datasets and data processing the estimation of the seasonal divergence of the impact of vegetation changes on et was conducted by using both in situ observations and gridded forcing datasets we used half hourly latent heat le from 100 flux sites in fluxnet pastorello et al 2020 to calculate the monthly le records and evaluate the performance of the pew mu model in situ monthly meteorological data p tdew tm v sm and radiation observations rnsolar rnthermal combined with satellite vegetation data were used to estimate pew mu et these selected sites represent a wide range of major terrestrial biomes in the modis igbp classification fig 1 cropland cro 8 sites woody savannas wsa 4 sites permanent wetlands wet 2 sites open shrublands osh 7 sites closed shrublands csh 1 site deciduous broadleaf forests dbf 11 sites evergreen broadleaf forests ebf 5 sites evergreen needle leaf forests enf 27 sites grasslands gra 25 sites mixed forests mf 5 sites and savannas sav 5 sites moreover considering that the temporal coverage of the flux observations is site dependent we evaluated the model performance during the observation period of each flux site respectively to make full use of the available data the simulated et from the pew mu model was compared against et measured by the eddy covariance method at the flux towers we eliminated the observational et records of rainy days based on the 30 min flux data to avoid errors induced by biased records on days with rain additionally we also examined the energy balance closure the sum of the sensible and latent heat flux divided by the available energy the sites with an energy balance closure above 70 and a residual below 25 w m2 were selected in our study foken et al 2006 michel et al 2016 after filtering the energy balance closure across land cover types ranged from 73 to 99 with a mean value of 84 and the residual values ranged from 15 11 w m2 to 23 89 w m2 with a mean value of 8 76 w m2 in general the surface energy balance closure generally falls within the range of 70 to 90 foken et al 2006 michel et al 2016 with the energy balance closure of less than 70 the utility of the sensible and latent heat flux measurements for model validation or calibration is greatly reduced kustas et al 1999 moreover at the site scale the water flux from eddy covariance measurement has the inherent random error arising from the measurement instruments and the stochastic nature of turbulence and varying footprint mizoguchi et al 2009 in this study the random errors in soil storage measurements could lead to uncertainty in the estimation of supply side in the monthly water balance i e effective precipitation which may result in a larger measured et than the total water supply p δ s in the same period therefore the measured et records that are higher than the total water supply in the same period were removed to avoid random errors from eddy covariance measurements we then used datasets of surface soil moisture and meteorological data from a reanalysis dataset to estimate the seasonal impacts of vegetation changes on et globally to avoid the spatial scale mismatch between input variables all datasets used in this study were obtained from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts reanalysis ecmwf era5 land monthly averaged reanalysis data from 1981 to 2018 hersbach et al 2019 we used the 10 m u v component of wind u v m s 1 2 m dewpoint temperature tdew k 2 m temperature tm k surface net solar radiation rnsolar j m 2 surface net thermal radiation rnthermal j m 2 total precipitation mm and surface soil moisture sm m3 m 3 to estimate gridded et globally the monthly lai data was derived from the global land surface satellite glass lai product the 8 day glass lai product https glass product bnu edu cn en was estimated based on avhrr from 1981 to 2000 and on modis from 2001 to 2018 with 0 05 degree spatial resolution all gridded datasets with spatial resolution lower than 0 1 degree were resampled to a 0 1 0 1 degree grid using the majority method zhang et al 2018 it is noted that despite only providing surface soil moisture in our study recent in situ analyses have shown that surface soil moisture provides adequate predictive utility as rooting depth soil moisture for latent heat quantification dong et al 2022 to analyze the environmental controls on ε l a i we use the aridity index ai defined as the ratio of pet to p in our study as an integrated indicator of climate conditions for a given watershed the ai can effectively reflect the interactions between energy and water limitations on mean annual et following previous studies the study area was divided into energy limited ai 0 7 transition 0 7 ai 1 4 and water limited 1 4 ai regions based on the aridity conditions mcvicar et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 the transition regions were further divided into the relative humid regions 0 7 ai 1 and the relative arid regions 1 ai 1 4 in our study 4 results 4 1 validation against in situ et observations the validation of the et model across multiple spatial scale requires a comprehensive investigation and normally ground measurements of surface heat fluxes are widely used to evaluate et model performance in a previous study the performance of the pew model has been fully validated from in situ level to the global pixel scale fu et al 2022 it was found that the pew model has great performance at the large catchment scale and global pixel scale in this study we improve the pew model by only replacing the estimation method of initial evaporation without modifications in the main model hypothesis therefore the pew mu model was evaluated by comparing simulated monthly et with observations from the fluxnet sites subsequently we applied the pew mu model at the pixel scale to simulate global et sensitivity to lai change comparison between monthly estimated and observed et at the site scale is shown in fig 2 on average estimated et explains 83 of the variations in monthly observed et with a slope of the regression of the simulated versus actual values close to 1 0 pew mu 0 92 in addition the seasonal synchronization of the pew mu et and observed et is high along with the lai changes fig 3 this indicates that the developed method has good predictive capability in explaining the spatial temporal pattern of monthly et moreover the taylor diagrams in fig 4 show the model performance at the monthly scale with two axes representing the root mean square error rmse mm month and the curves representing pearson s correlation coefficient r overall the performance of the pew mu model is comparable with the pm mu model based on the et observations at the site scale or the biome level fig 4 on average the monthly modeled et from the pew mu model has a lower rmse value 11 69 mm month and higher correlation coefficient 0 91 compared to the pm mu model rmse 22 23 mm month correlation coefficient 0 83 which indicates that the pew mu et has a strong agreement with observations at the monthly scale fig 4a at the biome scale the pew mu model demonstrates great skill across multiple biome levels with 12 57 mm month rmse and 0 91 correlation coefficient on average fig 4b and table 2 the estimates in osh rmse 9 42 mm month and cro rmse 7 47 mm month have relatively small errors while et estimates for the other biomes have rmse values of around 15 mm month in terms of the correlation et estimates from the pew mu model show good agreement with the observations for all biomes fig 4b and table 2 these results demonstrate that the pew mu model is capable of capturing the intra annual variation in et under different biome conditions and thus can be used to assess the impacts of seasonal vegetation changes on et 4 2 divergence in global et sensitivity to seasonal vegetation changes given that the availability of observational datasets from flux towers is limited in the spatial domain we applied the pew mu model globally based on era5 land datasets to demonstrate the seasonal divergence of ε lai across climatic conditions and biomes the spatial patterns of global ε lai in different seasons are shown in fig 5 similar to the results from flux sites the global ε lai showed strong spatial variation in all seasons with a clear seasonal divergence in spring significantly positive values of ε lai were observed in the tropical regions the temperate regions in southeastern us and south asia while weakly negative values of ε lai were found in other regions in summer the ε lai shows the opposite changes between the northern hemisphere and the southern hemisphere for the regions in the northern hemisphere significant positive ε lai was found in the tropical and temperate regions however for mountain regions and cold areas i e the arctic circle the values of ε lai keep negative in summer by contrast in the southern hemisphere the regions with negative values of ε lai obviously expanded especially in south africa andes mountain and brazilian plateau in autumn ε lai shifted from positive to negative values in parts of siberia and the northern part of north america compared to summer while in central africa and parts of south america the values of ε lai changed positively in winter generally positive ε l a i values are observed in south america parts of south africa and malay peninsula meanwhile the expansion of the negative values of ε lai was found in the northern hemisphere and the northern parts of australia in general the seasonal divergence of the ε lai shows a clear trajectory with a clear north south shift trajectory from spring to winter for densely vegetated regions or areas with less energy supply the high positive ε lai shifted from equatorial regions to the north in summer and then toward the south in autumn and winter however the ε lai in the high mountain and dry e g desert regions stayed slightly negative the results suggest that the water energy supply e g precipitation and net radiation could have control on ε lai while the intra annual et sensitivity to lai variation in the mountainous or dry regions may be less prone to effect from the energy supply sides to further analyze the relationship between et sensitivity to lai and environmental factors we investigate the seasonal divergence of ε lai under different climatic conditions ai and vegetation coverage lai taking the northern hemisphere as an example fig 6 a d shows that the relationships between ε lai and ai vary among different seasons the higher values of ε lai are distributed in the relatively humid regions in the spring while the lowest values are found in the extremely wet regions and dry regions in the summer ε lai increased mostly in the wet and transition regions as a consequence of the significant increase in energy in these regions water availability is sufficient and the potential limitation of energy supply on et is weak as radiation rises therefore the ε lai in these regions becomes more sensitive due to the vegetation growth interestingly the ε lai decreases to negative values from wet and transition regions to dry regions with peak negative values in regions with ai around 2 this suggests that while the lai increases in the summer the response of et to vegetation growth differs the et increases due to vegetation growth in wet and transition regions but for dry regions the et decreases along with increasing lai subsequently from summer to winter the magnitude of ε lai is reduced especially in wet regions on the other hand the high value of ε lai shifted from relative humid regions ai around 0 8 to relative arid regions ai around 1 2 additionally compared with other ai conditions the ε lai in dry regions is relatively stable across all seasons the relationship between ε lai and ai shows that the seasonal divergence in sensitivity of ε lai to climatic conditions has a trajectory with the high value shift from wet regions to water limited areas from spring to winter the relationships between seasonal lai changes and ε lai the northern hemisphere are shown in fig 6e h compared with ai the seasonal divergence of the relationships between lai and ε lai is not significant with high positive values in the densely vegetated regions and slightly negative values under sparse vegetation conditions in the high vegetation coverage regions usually tropical forests where the water energy supply is sufficient ε lai remains high in all seasons during the summer ε lai has significantly negative values in the regions with sparse vegetation cover lai 0 2 it is noted that compared with ε l a i grouped by ai in fig 6a d the ε lai grouped by lai was much lower less than 10 mm in the less vegetated regions lai 0 4 in the summer this suggests that the negative values of ε lai are more relevant to the vegetation conditions than the dry and wet limits moreover we investigated the variation in ε lai among different vegetation biomes fig 7 shows the distribution of ε lai in different biomes types generally the seasonal pattern of ε lai at biome level has difference between northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere in the northern hemisphere seasonal divergence in forests except ebf wsa sav and cro is high as expected the values of ε lai in ebf remain stable median values from 9 4 mm season to 11 84 mm season in all seasons the ε lai in gra sav wsa and cro also show relatively high values in the autumn compared to other biomes the ε lai in cro is affected by the tillage cropping system and application of the agricultural technique e g irrigation which makes parts of cro have a high vegetation coverage and water energy supply in the autumn thus supports high ε lai in the southern hemisphere ε lai of different biome types show an approximate dipole pattern in summer and autumn versus spring and winter except for the osh csh and ebf the seasonal divergence of ε lai is not significant generally the results show that the variation of seasonal ε lai in short vegetation cover gra sav wsa and cro has different seasonal patterns of et response to lai change compared to forest igbp types while the ε lai is high in the summer winter for the southern hemisphere for both low vegetation and forest igbp types et remains sensitive to lai changes during autumn spring for the southern hemisphere in gra sav wsa and cro we further summarized the seasonal pattern of the εlai for the forest grassland and cropland fig s1 the results confirm the clear seasonal divergence of εlai between short and high vegetation coverage the seasonal divergence at the biome level highlights that when assessing the vegetation impact on evapotranspiration analyses should be stratified by vegetation biome types especially considering the difference between short and high vegetation coverage furthermore it is noted that the calendar season may not be able to depict the growing seasons therefore besides the calendar season we also categorized the seasons based on actual growing conditions for each pixel we divided the mean monthly lai laim into four periods based on interquartile range more than 75 75 50 50 25 25 as the proxy for actual seasonal vegetation growth the levels were determined according to the previous investigation of the seasonal lai changes where the most significant seasonal lai increase is twice larger than the lowest zhu et al 2017 fig 8 shows the global pattern of the ε lai based on the actual growing season the most notable positive values of the ε lai were in south america northeast america southeast asia south asia western europe and the northern part of siberia during the period lai 75 meanwhile negative ε lai values could be found in mountain and low vegetation coverage regions with significant negative values in central asia and northern australia the spatial pattern of ε lai under high vegetation growth conditions is similar to ε lai in summer winter for the southern hemisphere consistently decreasing ε lai occurred from positive to negative values along with a decreasing lai gradient except for the low latitude regions where water and energy supplies are sufficient the spatial pattern of ε lai during four vegetation growth seasons confirms a clear seasonal divergence of ε lai across regions the relationships between ai and ε lai for different seasons are shown in fig 9 consist with results based on calendar seasons the relationships of ai and ε lai during the vegetation growing seasons also show that the significant values of ε lai are distributed in the transition regions and the peak value of the ε lai shift from wet regions to arid regions as lai decreases 4 3 temporal variation of the seasonal ε lai we evaluated the temporal variation in ε lai under different biome conditions fig 10 and table 3 4 the manner kendall m k non parametric method was employed to analyze the temporal trend of global ε lai in different seasons with the corresponding p value test exploring the temporal variation in the sensitivities of et to vegetation changes among different seasons under climate change fig 10 we found substantial changes over the study period of the ε lai during the spring in the northern part of north america the central part of africa and the northern part of europe the temporal changes of ε lai are significant p 0 05 including both positive and negative trends in the summer robust changes cannot be detected in most of the regions only in the central us and central africa the extensive negative changes have been found significant during the autumn a significant negative trend can be detected in central south america western australia and central africa this significant negative trend also exists in winter in central south america and central africa ε lai has a significant negative trend along the eastern coast of australia while it becomes significantly positive in the central eastern of inland australia overall except in central africa where the ε lai significantly decreased across all seasons the temporal trend of ε lai is variant in different seasons to further understand the attributions of these temporal changes we explore the ε lai changes in different vegetation types tables 3 and 4 we found that the ε lai in forests has decreased along the years in all seasons except spring while the ε lai in the gra osh demonstrated a significant increase trend during the summer the possible mechanisms could be the difference in the photosynthetic pathway of grass and trees trees subject to drying soil and highly variable light have the objective to conserve water when the uptake of co2 is lightly limited rather than maximizing assimilation katul et al 2010 this could be the reason for the negative ε lai trend in central africa during summer where the precipitation is less than in tropical rainforests at the same latitude according to fig 5 in central africa ε lai is positive and has a negative trend along the years for summer which means that et becomes less sensitive to lai this may imply that in forests of central africa during summer et is more affected by other factors such as temperature or precipitation leading to a decoupled relationship between et and lai on the other hand the grass is more susceptible to water stress than trees resulting in a stronger ability to adjust stomata conductance during changing environments thus leading to positive changes in ε lai katul et al 2010 however during the summer the ε lai in some grassland has negative values and positive changes in ε lai could lead to a decoupled relationship between et and lai for example in central asia ε lai is negative during the summer fig 5 and the grassland demonstrates significantly positive changes in ε lai from 1981 to 2018 5 discussion 5 1 positive and negative et sensitivity to lai changes while previous studies showed that the et sensitivity has positive trends along with lai across multiple climatic and biome conditions studies based on statistical methods show negative effects of lai increase on et in the transition regions and parts of dry regions xu et al 2013a xu et al 2013b zhang et al 2018 forzieri et al 2020 per et al 2017 interestingly some studies found that the effects of vegetation coverage increase on et could be negative when the spatial scale of study regions changes and that the vegetation impact on et diminishes as region area increases which is consistent with results from paired catchment studies peel et al 2010 in our study we found weak negative ε lai in the sparse vegetation coverage or mountainous regions according to previous global studies that estimate the et sensitivity to lai changes within the budyko framework the budyko parameter has a weak negative correlation with the lai liu and you 2021 as a higher value of the budyko parameter tends to be accompanied by higher et for a given drought index liu et al 2018 the higher global lai favors a smaller value of the budyko parameter and leads to less et studies attributed this emerging phenomenon to variation in the catchment area liu and you 2021 moreover previous studies also found that lai has a strong positive connection with soil water capacity and a strong negative connection with bulk density liu and you 2021 meanwhile the budyko parameter has opposite connection with soil water capacity and bulk density respectively compared to the lai the results suggest that densely vegetation may has lower bulk density i e higher soil porosity and larger soil water capacity which favors a lower value of budyko parameter and leads to less et therefore we suppose that at a small catchment area scale or pixel scale the effects of vegetation coverage on hydrological processes are complex with interference from soil properties which could result in a weak negative connection between lai and et however besides the soil properties the hydrological processes of the vegetation system could also be affected by climatic conditions chen et al 2020 therefore to analyze the mechanism behind such an emerging pattern of negative ε lai from other perspectives we analyze the seasonal changes in ε lai under different precipitation and temperature conditions at the biome level as shown in fig 11 the northern hemisphere and fig 12 the southern hemisphere respectively results show a clear dependence on the background climate but the temporal pattern of ε lai varies for different biomes globally the higher positive ε lai has been found with seasonal precipitation around 500 mm and a seasonal average temperature of around 25 while the negative ε lai values are mostly seen in areas with precipitation less than 500 mm in accordance with previous studies the most evident and positive et lai relationship was found in the warm and moderate humid regions forzieri et al 2020 due to sufficient energy supply and low cooling effects from precipitation compared with high precipitation regions li et al 2019 meanwhile we found that the negative ε lai is mainly distributed in the grassland scrubland and savannas for these ecological systems the responses of vegetation activity to water shortage are different from forest with negative correlation between rooting depth and water availability therefore as the lai increases in the grassland scrubland and savannas the water availability is decreasing correspondingly the rooting depths could be longer for parts of the ecosystems and thus lead to larger soil water capacity and lower et liu and you 2021 however the connection between vegetation and hydrological processes is complex in the small regions except for the summer in the northern hemisphere the negative ε l a i also has been found in the forest fig 11 moreover according to the previous study chen et al 2020 the sensitivity of et to short vegetation cover gains in these regions still holds the same change direction with the increased ai but increased tree canopy cover could lead to a modest decrease in et in regions where thinner soil layer over the earth rock mountain at high elevation this significant difference in regulation patterns among various vegetation types could result in lower and even negative values of ε lai under high ai conditions in this regard future studies are needed to explore the linkages between vegetation properties and the hydrological processes in different biomes to better understand the physical basis of et sensitivity to vegetation change limitations it is widely recognized that vegetation has been experiencing substantial alterations globally which has a great influence on the terrestrial water cycle we herein derive a seasonal analytical solution to quantify the effects of vegetation changes on et by incorporating the pm mu equation in the proportionality hypothesis based pew model as a budyko type framework the pew mu holds the advantages of the traditional budyko model which gives the model the ability to develop the sensitivity method additionally it has reduced the uncertainty due to the parameter vegetation empirical relationship in the budyko model by incorporating clear physical linkages between land surface conditions and hydrological partitioning however limitations exist in our study firstly although the effect of vegetation types was taken into consideration through the constant parameter gl sh and gl ewv the dynamic changes in the vegetation types are lacking future efforts should thus be taken to fully simulate the dynamic changes in vegetation for example using mixed pixel based vegetation indices panciera et al 2011 second the pew mu is derived based on monthly water balance however the errors from soil water storage measurements may cause an imbalance in the monthly water cycle which could limit the pew mu model s ability to simulate the et processes with the emerging satellite based soil moisture products at higher spatial resolutions e g smap sentinel 1 1 km 3 km and more in situ observations from planned field campaigns future studies may benefit from more reliable soil moisture input for et estimation beck et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 third it is worth noting that although the analytical solution derived from the budyko type framework is an effective tool to attribute the hydrological response to p pet and other land surface properties e g vegetation properties and climatic seasonality the indirect interactions between climate factors and surface conditions e g the hydrological effect from vegetation response to precipitation are lacking in the solutions additionally it should be noted that the e 0 is not observed in the model framework but estimated through the pm mu algorithm therefore subject to uncertainty leveraging isotope observations may serve as a boundary to further guide calculation of e 0 only when the et components are measured separately with low uncertainty will the partitioned et components simulations begin to be properly constrained finally discrepancies exist regarding assessing the vegetation impacts on et between the budyko type framework li et al 2013 luo et al 2020 xu et al 2013a xu et al 2013b zhang et al 2018 and statistical methods forzieri et al 2020 pei et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 studies based on statistical methods show negative effects of lai increases on et in the transition regions and parts of dry regions meanwhile results from parts of solutions derived from the budyko type framework found that et sensitivity has positive trends along with lai across multiple climatic and biome conditions however other budyko type studies found the negative effects of increased vegetation e g density or area on et exist and the vegetation impact on et diminishes as region area increases which is consistent with results from paired catchment studies peel et al 2010 the emerging variations in the et sensitivity to vegetation changes highlight that the uncertainty for solutions derived from the budyko type framework or statistical methods is high possible reasons for the uncertainty could be a consequence of not having sufficient data to meaningfully fit the models even a good fit does not necessarily mean that the model is sufficient in representing the processes as described before most studies including budyko type studies and the statistical methods only consider changes in one of the vegetation properties e g lai fpar ndvi synchronous incorporations of multiple vegetation properties into the model may help to reduce this part of the uncertainties second and most importantly the interactions between factors including p radiations temperature pet lai etc might be large for specific places however most of the interactions especially the indirect interactions are neglected when constructing the solutions for example while the p pet and budyko parameter are assumed to be independent in the budyko equations evidence shows that interactions exist between land characteristics and climatic factors in the statistical methods despite increasing efforts to eliminate this part of the effect possible multi factor interactions among drivers still exist due to complex adjustments of land conditions sustaining et and hence adds to the uncertainty in the estimations therefore further studies need to be conducted to identify the interactions controlled by the choices of models and parameters when et sensitivity is estimated and more comprehensive work should be conducted to investigate the change in evapotranspiration processes with consideration of vegetation changes moreover inconsistencies in internal variability and trends in long term satellite lai products could be another source of uncertainty in ε lai analysis previous studies found that the widely used long term lai products were neither intra consistent over time nor inter consistent with each other jiang et al 2017 consequently future investigation of et sensitivity to lai requires comprehensive evaluation studies of global satellite lai products 6 conclusions our study provides an analytical solution to expressing the effects of seasonal lai changes on et within the extended budyko framework based on that we quantified divergence of hydrological partitioning in response to seasonal lai changes during spring and summer ε lai is highest in relative humid regions 0 7 ai 1 while in autumn and winter ε lai is highest in the relative arid regions 1 ai 1 4 moreover the weak negative ε lai was discovered in the regions with sparse vegetation coverage and seasonal precipitation less than 500 mm understanding the seasonal hydrological response to vegetation change is essential towards addressing the issues regarding water deficit and ecological deterioration based on the developed framework we provide the analytical solution to quantify the comprehensive effect of vegetation changes on hydrological partitioning across multiple temporal scales under various land surface conditions the pew mu model proposed here provides the possibility of developing an analytical solution for comprehensively analyzing the et sensitivity to seasonal vegetation activities overall our findings highlight the difference in hydrological response to vegetation dynamics across seasons and vegetation types thereby providing information in guiding the regional water resource and land use management strategies to adaptive local conditions credit authorship contribution statement jianyu fu

2445,seasonal variation of vegetation profoundly affects the water cycle however the seasonal divergence of evapotranspiration et sensitivity in response to vegetation variations has not been fully understood here we derived an analytical solution to examine the impact of seasonal vegetation changes on et with an extended budyko framework based on an improved et algorithm with improved water balance constraints results reveal a clear seasonal divergence of et sensitivity to vegetation coverage changes across climate regimes and biomes generally the high et sensitivity to vegetation coverage has a clear north south shift trajectory from spring to winter for moderate humid regions 0 7 aridity index 1 0 vegetation exhibits higher importance in altering et in march september while for moderate dry regions 1 0 aridity index 1 4 the sensitivity of et to vegetation changes is the highest in september november moreover the spatial temporal pattern of et sensitivity to seasonal vegetation changes is different between short vegetation cover and forest additionally negative et sensitivity to vegetation coverage changes was discovered in regions with seasonal precipitation of less than 500 mm and sparse vegetation coverage predominant land cover types of grassland scrubland and savannas in summary our study provides an analytical solution to estimate et sensitivity to seasonal vegetation changes within the extended budyko framework the results highlight the difference in hydrological response to vegetation dynamics across seasons and vegetation types keywords evapotranspiration vegetation change analytical solution extended budyko framework data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction terrestrial evapotranspiration et is a critical nexus in the hydrological cycle that links the interaction between climate soil vegetation and terrain donohue et al 2012 fisher et al 2008 purdy et al 2018 wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 changes in et closely relate to the varying catchment landscape and the climatic feedback li et al 2015 madhu et al 2014 xia et al 2014 recent studies showed that large scale vegetation changes have occurred globally and are greatly affecting the terrestrial hydrological portioning the partitioning of precipitation p into et storage change δs and runoff r e g chen et al 2020 sun et al 2006 zhang et al 2010 zhang et al 2018 despite increasing efforts in advancing the fundamental understanding of the underlying vegetation impacts in regulating et patterns the varying seasonal governance of vegetation growth on global et patterns remain poorly quantified chen et al 2020 jung et al 2010 pei et al 2017 recent studies found that climate change may lead to greater seasonal asymmetry for instance higher warming rates in spring and winter he and li 2020 marsh and zhang 2022 sun et al 2006 xu et al 2013a xu et al 2013b such asymmetry will continually affect the seasonality of catchment conditions including fluxes such as soil moisture chou et al 2013 resulting in a clear seasonal divergence in response to the vegetation activities for instance pei et al 2017 found that under climate change the response of inter annual et to vegetation changes shows a seasonal divergence in the dry yellow river basin the lack of understanding of the role of vegetation variations in et changes limits our ability to model the terrestrial atmospheric biophysical feedback of the global hydrological cycle under future climate forzieri et al 2020 pei et al 2017 in this context a quantitative understanding of how seasonal vegetation dynamics can affect et across a full range of bio climates is requisite to achieve sustainable water management and get prepared to adapting the coming changes disentangling the contribution of vegetation dynamics from that of other environmental factors on surface hydrological partitioning is challenging due to the varying land atmosphere interactions across multiple spatial temporal scales ellison et al 2012 sun et al 2006 three methods have been primarily implemented to quantify the contribution of vegetation dynamics on surface hydrological partitioning zhang et al 2018 the first method is based on the investigation of the paired catchment experiments traditionally the paired catchment experiments are the most direct approaches to effectively measuring the change in water availability caused by vegetation altering bai et al 2020 wei et al 2008 this approach compares the difference in hydrological functioning between at least two adjacent small catchments that have similar climatic and landscape characteristics brown et al 2005 however scaling the results from small catchment experiments to large basins remains difficult due to the diversity of controlling factors of hydrology in large river basins wang et al 2013 the second method to determine the vegetation effect on hydrology is based on land surface modelling or remote sensing et algorithms that explicitly incorporate vegetation dynamics miralles et al 2011 shen et al 2013 the difference between numerical process based model runs with or without vegetation changes including the vegetation type and conditions is taken the net effect of vegetation dynamics in hydrological partitioning chen et al 2020 lei et al 2014 li et al 2011 while the physical mechanism behind the process based model is clear the results vary dramatically among models stemming from the complex combinations of embedded hypotheses or the simplifications of et processes bai et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 additionally the estimated difference between model runs does not necessarily exclude the effects of factors aside from vegetation dynamics on the model results sivapalan et al 2003 the third method is built on budyko framework the budyko framework which describes the hydrological partitioning as a functional balance between water supply precipitation p and energy supply potential evapotranspiration pet at the steady state has been recognized as a useful tool for quantifying hydrological response to landscape perturbations at the regional scale budyko 1958 1974 fu 1981 fu and wang 2019 greve and seneviratne 2015 the effects of vegetation dynamics on et are quantified through the links between the budyko parameter and vegetation indices li et al 2013 xu et al 2013a xu et al 2013b zhang et al 2018 compared with the other methods there are two advantages of using the budyko framework first the budyko framework aims to explain the hydrological behavior using empirical data with a simple model structure which eliminates the dependence on embedded hypotheses as in the process based models wang and tang 2014 zhang et al 2018 second the budyko framework has the ability to analytically isolate the individual impact of environmental factors on hydrological partitioning through the simulation of the budyko parameter roderick and farquhar 2011 wang and hejazi 2011 xu et al 2014 however two limitations of the budyko framework impede the application of the budyko equation in estimating the response of et to seasonal vegetation variation first the parameter in the budyko framework is usually considered a comprehensive representation of land surface and climatic characteristics including vegetation topography soil properties and climatic seasonality fu 1981 li et al 2013 potter and zhang 2009 roderick and farquhar 2011 wang and tang 2014 consequently the relationship between the budyko parameter and vegetation is usually empirical and the forms of expression vary greatly among studies li et al 2013 xu et al 2013a xu et al 2013b this limits the application of the budyko framework to regions where long term datasets are available to construct the empirical relationship zhang et al 2018 recently studies have attempted to solve this problem by adding a physical mechanism to link the budyko parameter and vegetation indices donohue et al 2012 yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 they found that the budyko parameter has a close relationship with the parameter in a soil moisture model i e the porporato model subsequently they examined the impact of vegetation changes on hydrological partitioning by developing a combined model that couples the budyko and porporato models however the budyko porporato model is developed to examine hydrological partitioning at the mean annual scale rather than to detect changes that occur at a shorter time scale zhang et al 2018 this limits our ability to develop a generic and unified physically based understanding of the short term hydrological response to seasonal vegetation changes second the budyko framework is derived based on a steady hydro climatological condition when the δs can be neglected which limits the application of the budyko framework to the long temporal scale e g mean annual scale recent research attempted to extend the budyko framework to the monthly scale chen et al 2013 zhang et al 2008a zhang et al 2008b for instance xing et al 2018 verified the ability of the budyko framework in describing the partitioning of p into r et and δs at the monthly scale and subsequently simulated et at the monthly scale using the budyko framework although studies have successfully applied the budyko framework at the monthly scale the application of the extended budyko framework to investigate the effects of seasonal vegetation changes on et is still lacking recently fu et al 2022 developed an et algorithm from the hydrological model in the extended budyko framework the new et algorithm provided an analytical solution for calculating the parameter in the budyko framework at multiple temporal scales moreover the combination of the energy balance from the remote sensing et model and the water balance constraints from the hydrological model enables the new algorithm to perform better than the energy balance based et model at multiple temporal scales here we improve the et algorithm from fu et al 2022 to build an analytical relationship between et and the monthly vegetation changes in the extended budyko framework then we derive an analytical solution to investigate the sensitivity of et to seasonal vegetation changes globally the specific objectives of this study are to i develop an analytical solution to examine the divergence of et sensitivity to seasonal vegetation changes ii investigate the global patterns of the et sensitivity to seasonal vegetation changes across various bioclimatic conditions and iii explore the response of et to seasonal vegetation changes under climate change our results may help to deepen the understanding of the atmosphere vegetation interactions and further reveal the underlying mechanisms 2 methodology 2 1 the proportionality hypothesis based et model satellite driven et algorithms serve as an effective way to estimate the global et however many algorithms are independent of water balance constraints which potentially limits their ability to estimate et to solve that fu et al 2022 developed an et model denoted as the pew model by combining the proportionality hypothesis based water balance constraints with the priestley taylor jet propulsion laboratory pt jpl et algorithm the proportionality hypothesis is that the ratio of continuing abstraction fa to its potential s is equal to the ratio of direct runoff q to its potential value p ia scs 1972 1 f a s q p i a where fa mm and s mm are the continuing abstraction in the hydrological processes and the potential value of fa respectively q mm is the direct runoff p mm is the precipitation and ia mm is the initial abstraction at the event scale precipitation is partitioned into q and soil wetting w mm where w includes ia and fa the physical meaning of ia is the amount of water loss before q is generated after water loss through ia the remaining water is partitioned into fa and q the proportionality hypothesis has been generalized by ponce and shetty 1995 to express the competition between different hydrological variables as 2 x x 0 x p x 0 y z x 0 where the amount of water resources z is partitioned into components x and y over a certain time interval x is limited by its potential value denoted as xp the initial water demand x0 is allocated to x before the competition between x and y which means x has a priority to meet x0 y is thus constrained by the total water available i e z x0 based on the generalized proportionality hypothesis the pew model is expressed as 3 et e 0 pet e 0 p δ s e t p δ s e 0 where e 0 mm is the initial evapotranspiration including evaporation through vegetation interception e c 0 mm and water storage in topsoils e s 0 mm δ s mm is the soil moisture change in eq 3 the p δ s is equivalent to effective precipitation p e m m in our study at each site the water storage s i 1 and s i was calculated by multiplying the measurements of soil moisture at the beginning and end of the process respectively by the soil water content height at the site scale the water storage s i 1 and s i was calculated by multiplying the soil water content height s i 1 is the soil water storage at the last time step last day or last month and s i is the soil water storage at the current time step the soil water content height at each site can be directly obtained from the variable information metadata in the fluxnet dataset pastorello et al 2020 for the pixel scale the s i 1 and s i were calculated based on the soil moisture data in the era5 land datasets then the soil water storage change δ s was calculated as δ s s i s i 1 and the effective precipitation p e was calculated as p e p δ s dividing the numerator and denominator of both sides of eq 3 by p e the pew model can be expressed as 4 et p e pet p e e 0 p e 2 1 pet p e 2 e 0 p e in fu et al 2022 the pew model performed better than the pt jpl model across multiple spatiotemporal scales results show that the incorporation of the water balance constraints in the energy balance based algorithm could improve the et estimation for the sake of brevity the detailed validation of the pew model is not reproduced here see fu et al 2022 for details in the pew model e 0 is a critical parameter which is estimated by the pt jpl algorithm by fu et al 2022 to better reflect the controlling effects of the environmental factors on et we improved the pew model by using the penman monteith mu algorithm pm mu instead of the pt jpl algorithm 2 2 the penman monteith mu algorithm the pm type models have been widely used in hydrological and climatological studies cleugh et al 2007 mu et al 2011 chen et al 2020 cleugh et al 2007 developed an et algorithm using the penman monteith equation driven by modis derived vegetation data and daily surface meteorological inputs subsequently many formulations based on the hypothesis of the pm equation have been modified to estimate the global et based on leaf area index lai or normalized difference vegetation index ndvi datasets in the pm type models et is generally calculated as the sum of the soil evaporation es transpiration ec evaporation from the wet soil surface es 0 and evaporation from canopy intercepted precipitation ec 0 mu et al 2011 estimated each part of the et based on pm equation with consideration of both aerodynamic conditions and surface resistances following the pm mu algorithm ec 0 in this study is estimated as 5 e c 0 δ r n c ρ c p es e a rhrc δ p a c p r v c λ ε r h r c f c f w e t where rnc is the canopy net radiation fwet is the relative surface wetness computed as fwet r h 4 and rh is the relative humidity fc is the vegetation cover fraction the aerodynamic resistance rhrc and wet canopy resistance rvc of the wet canopy surface are calculated based on wet canopy resistance to sensible heat rhc and resistance to radiative heat transfer through the air rrc as 6 rhc 1 g l sh l a i f w e t rrc ρ c p 4 σ t m 3 rhrc rhc r r c rhc r r c rvc 1 g l ewv l a i f w e t where g l sh is leaf conductance to sensible heat per unit lai g l ewv is leaf conductance to evaporated water vapor per unit lai σ is stefan boltzmann constant t m means average air temperature the calibration of g l ewv and g l sh in the pew mu model according to previous studies for each biome is shown in table 1 the es 0 in the pm mu algorithm is described as 7 e s 0 δ rns g ρ c p 1 f c es e a ras δ p a c p r t o t λ ε r a s f w e t where the total aerodynamic resistance to vapor transport rtot and the aerodynamic resistance at the soil

estimates compared with the pt jpl algorithm fu et al 2022 the main difference between the pew and the pew mu model is in the calculation of e 0 in the pew mu model e 0 is derived based on the pm mu algorithm given that both the pt jpl algorithm and pm mu algorithm are widely used to estimate et we validated the simulated et against observed et at 100 flux stations see section 3 for more information from two perspectives i e site level and biome level for both levels we compared the estimated and observed mean monthly et during the observation period of each flux site 2 5 sensitivity analysis of evapotranspiration to vegetation dynamics based on the pew mu model et can be expressed as a function of lai among other environmental factors 11 et f lai p e t p e r n t m v p d r h g l sh g l ewv to evaluate the impacts of vegetation changes on et we calculated the partial differentials of eq 11 12 ε lai e t l a i where ε lai is the et sensitivity to lai and can be calculated by the partial derivative of the eq 10 in the sensitivity analysis we used the mean monthly lai for the four seasons spring march may summer june august autumn september november and winter december february as a proxy for seasonal vegetation condition zhu et al 2017 it is noted that the months for the same seasons between the southern hemisphere and the northern hemisphere are different in this study the months have been labeled in the figures to avoid the confused identification of the seasons for the southern hemisphere 3 datasets and data processing the estimation of the seasonal divergence of the impact of vegetation changes on et was conducted by using both in situ observations and gridded forcing datasets we used half hourly latent heat le from 100 flux sites in fluxnet pastorello et al 2020 to calculate the monthly le records and evaluate the performance of the pew mu model in situ monthly meteorological data p tdew tm v sm and radiation observations rnsolar rnthermal combined with satellite vegetation data were used to estimate pew mu et these selected sites represent a wide range of major terrestrial biomes in the modis igbp classification fig 1 cropland cro 8 sites woody savannas wsa 4 sites permanent wetlands wet 2 sites open shrublands osh 7 sites closed shrublands csh 1 site deciduous broadleaf forests dbf 11 sites evergreen broadleaf forests ebf 5 sites evergreen needle leaf forests enf 27 sites grasslands gra 25 sites mixed forests mf 5 sites and savannas sav 5 sites moreover considering that the temporal coverage of the flux observations is site dependent we evaluated the model performance during the observation period of each flux site respectively to make full use of the available data the simulated et from the pew mu model was compared against et measured by the eddy covariance method at the flux towers we eliminated the observational et records of rainy days based on the 30 min flux data to avoid errors induced by biased records on days with rain additionally we also examined the energy balance closure the sum of the sensible and latent heat flux divided by the available energy the sites with an energy balance closure above 70 and a residual below 25 w m2 were selected in our study foken et al 2006 michel et al 2016 after filtering the energy balance closure across land cover types ranged from 73 to 99 with a mean value of 84 and the residual values ranged from 15 11 w m2 to 23 89 w m2 with a mean value of 8 76 w m2 in general the surface energy balance closure generally falls within the range of 70 to 90 foken et al 2006 michel et al 2016 with the energy balance closure of less than 70 the utility of the sensible and latent heat flux measurements for model validation or calibration is greatly reduced kustas et al 1999 moreover at the site scale the water flux from eddy covariance measurement has the inherent random error arising from the measurement instruments and the stochastic nature of turbulence and varying footprint mizoguchi et al 2009 in this study the random errors in soil storage measurements could lead to uncertainty in the estimation of supply side in the monthly water balance i e effective precipitation which may result in a larger measured et than the total water supply p δ s in the same period therefore the measured et records that are higher than the total water supply in the same period were removed to avoid random errors from eddy covariance measurements we then used datasets of surface soil moisture and meteorological data from a reanalysis dataset to estimate the seasonal impacts of vegetation changes on et globally to avoid the spatial scale mismatch between input variables all datasets used in this study were obtained from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts reanalysis ecmwf era5 land monthly averaged reanalysis data from 1981 to 2018 hersbach et al 2019 we used the 10 m u v component of wind u v m s 1 2 m dewpoint temperature tdew k 2 m temperature tm k surface net solar radiation rnsolar j m 2 surface net thermal radiation rnthermal j m 2 total precipitation mm and surface soil moisture sm m3 m 3 to estimate gridded et globally the monthly lai data was derived from the global land surface satellite glass lai product the 8 day glass lai product https glass product bnu edu cn en was estimated based on avhrr from 1981 to 2000 and on modis from 2001 to 2018 with 0 05 degree spatial resolution all gridded datasets with spatial resolution lower than 0 1 degree were resampled to a 0 1 0 1 degree grid using the majority method zhang et al 2018 it is noted that despite only providing surface soil moisture in our study recent in situ analyses have shown that surface soil moisture provides adequate predictive utility as rooting depth soil moisture for latent heat quantification dong et al 2022 to analyze the environmental controls on ε l a i we use the aridity index ai defined as the ratio of pet to p in our study as an integrated indicator of climate conditions for a given watershed the ai can effectively reflect the interactions between energy and water limitations on mean annual et following previous studies the study area was divided into energy limited ai 0 7 transition 0 7 ai 1 4 and water limited 1 4 ai regions based on the aridity conditions mcvicar et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 the transition regions were further divided into the relative humid regions 0 7 ai 1 and the relative arid regions 1 ai 1 4 in our study 4 results 4 1 validation against in situ et observations the validation of the et model across multiple spatial scale requires a comprehensive investigation and normally ground measurements of surface heat fluxes are widely used to evaluate et model performance in a previous study the performance of the pew model has been fully validated from in situ level to the global pixel scale fu et al 2022 it was found that the pew model has great performance at the large catchment scale and global pixel scale in this study we improve the pew model by only replacing the estimation method of initial evaporation without modifications in the main model hypothesis therefore the pew mu model was evaluated by comparing simulated monthly et with observations from the fluxnet sites subsequently we applied the pew mu model at the pixel scale to simulate global et sensitivity to lai change comparison between monthly estimated and observed et at the site scale is shown in fig 2 on average estimated et explains 83 of the variations in monthly observed et with a slope of the regression of the simulated versus actual values close to 1 0 pew mu 0 92 in addition the seasonal synchronization of the pew mu et and observed et is high along with the lai changes fig 3 this indicates that the developed method has good predictive capability in explaining the spatial temporal pattern of monthly et moreover the taylor diagrams in fig 4 show the model performance at the monthly scale with two axes representing the root mean square error rmse mm month and the curves representing pearson s correlation coefficient r overall the performance of the pew mu model is comparable with the pm mu model based on the et observations at the site scale or the biome level fig 4 on average the monthly modeled et from the pew mu model has a lower rmse value 11 69 mm month and higher correlation coefficient 0 91 compared to the pm mu model rmse 22 23 mm month correlation coefficient 0 83 which indicates that the pew mu et has a strong agreement with observations at the monthly scale fig 4a at the biome scale the pew mu model demonstrates great skill across multiple biome levels with 12 57 mm month rmse and 0 91 correlation coefficient on average fig 4b and table 2 the estimates in osh rmse 9 42 mm month and cro rmse 7 47 mm month have relatively small errors while et estimates for the other biomes have rmse values of around 15 mm month in terms of the correlation et estimates from the pew mu model show good agreement with the observations for all biomes fig 4b and table 2 these results demonstrate that the pew mu model is capable of capturing the intra annual variation in et under different biome conditions and thus can be used to assess the impacts of seasonal vegetation changes on et 4 2 divergence in global et sensitivity to seasonal vegetation changes given that the availability of observational datasets from flux towers is limited in the spatial domain we applied the pew mu model globally based on era5 land datasets to demonstrate the seasonal divergence of ε lai across climatic conditions and biomes the spatial patterns of global ε lai in different seasons are shown in fig 5 similar to the results from flux sites the global ε lai showed strong spatial variation in all seasons with a clear seasonal divergence in spring significantly positive values of ε lai were observed in the tropical regions the temperate regions in southeastern us and south asia while weakly negative values of ε lai were found in other regions in summer the ε lai shows the opposite changes between the northern hemisphere and the southern hemisphere for the regions in the northern hemisphere significant positive ε lai was found in the tropical and temperate regions however for mountain regions and cold areas i e the arctic circle the values of ε lai keep negative in summer by contrast in the southern hemisphere the regions with negative values of ε lai obviously expanded especially in south africa andes mountain and brazilian plateau in autumn ε lai shifted from positive to negative values in parts of siberia and the northern part of north america compared to summer while in central africa and parts of south america the values of ε lai changed positively in winter generally positive ε l a i values are observed in south america parts of south africa and malay peninsula meanwhile the expansion of the negative values of ε lai was found in the northern hemisphere and the northern parts of australia in general the seasonal divergence of the ε lai shows a clear trajectory with a clear north south shift trajectory from spring to winter for densely vegetated regions or areas with less energy supply the high positive ε lai shifted from equatorial regions to the north in summer and then toward the south in autumn and winter however the ε lai in the high mountain and dry e g desert regions stayed slightly negative the results suggest that the water energy supply e g precipitation and net radiation could have control on ε lai while the intra annual et sensitivity to lai variation in the mountainous or dry regions may be less prone to effect from the energy supply sides to further analyze the relationship between et sensitivity to lai and environmental factors we investigate the seasonal divergence of ε lai under different climatic conditions ai and vegetation coverage lai taking the northern hemisphere as an example fig 6 a d shows that the relationships between ε lai and ai vary among different seasons the higher values of ε lai are distributed in the relatively humid regions in the spring while the lowest values are found in the extremely wet regions and dry regions in the summer ε lai increased mostly in the wet and transition regions as a consequence of the significant increase in energy in these regions water availability is sufficient and the potential limitation of energy supply on et is weak as radiation rises therefore the ε lai in these regions becomes more sensitive due to the vegetation growth interestingly the ε lai decreases to negative values from wet and transition regions to dry regions with peak negative values in regions with ai around 2 this suggests that while the lai increases in the summer the response of et to vegetation growth differs the et increases due to vegetation growth in wet and transition regions but for dry regions the et decreases along with increasing lai subsequently from summer to winter the magnitude of ε lai is reduced especially in wet regions on the other hand the high value of ε lai shifted from relative humid regions ai around 0 8 to relative arid regions ai around 1 2 additionally compared with other ai conditions the ε lai in dry regions is relatively stable across all seasons the relationship between ε lai and ai shows that the seasonal divergence in sensitivity of ε lai to climatic conditions has a trajectory with the high value shift from wet regions to water limited areas from spring to winter the relationships between seasonal lai changes and ε lai the northern hemisphere are shown in fig 6e h compared with ai the seasonal divergence of the relationships between lai and ε lai is not significant with high positive values in the densely vegetated regions and slightly negative values under sparse vegetation conditions in the high vegetation coverage regions usually tropical forests where the water energy supply is sufficient ε lai remains high in all seasons during the summer ε lai has significantly negative values in the regions with sparse vegetation cover lai 0 2 it is noted that compared with ε l a i grouped by ai in fig 6a d the ε lai grouped by lai was much lower less than 10 mm in the less vegetated regions lai 0 4 in the summer this suggests that the negative values of ε lai are more relevant to the vegetation conditions than the dry and wet limits moreover we investigated the variation in ε lai among different vegetation biomes fig 7 shows the distribution of ε lai in different biomes types generally the seasonal pattern of ε lai at biome level has difference between northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere in the northern hemisphere seasonal divergence in forests except ebf wsa sav and cro is high as expected the values of ε lai in ebf remain stable median values from 9 4 mm season to 11 84 mm season in all seasons the ε lai in gra sav wsa and cro also show relatively high values in the autumn compared to other biomes the ε lai in cro is affected by the tillage cropping system and application of the agricultural technique e g irrigation which makes parts of cro have a high vegetation coverage and water energy supply in the autumn thus supports high ε lai in the southern hemisphere ε lai of different biome types show an approximate dipole pattern in summer and autumn versus spring and winter except for the osh csh and ebf the seasonal divergence of ε lai is not significant generally the results show that the variation of seasonal ε lai in short vegetation cover gra sav wsa and cro has different seasonal patterns of et response to lai change compared to forest igbp types while the ε lai is high in the summer winter for the southern hemisphere for both low vegetation and forest igbp types et remains sensitive to lai changes during autumn spring for the southern hemisphere in gra sav wsa and cro we further summarized the seasonal pattern of the εlai for the forest grassland and cropland fig s1 the results confirm the clear seasonal divergence of εlai between short and high vegetation coverage the seasonal divergence at the biome level highlights that when assessing the vegetation impact on evapotranspiration analyses should be stratified by vegetation biome types especially considering the difference between short and high vegetation coverage furthermore it is noted that the calendar season may not be able to depict the growing seasons therefore besides the calendar season we also categorized the seasons based on actual growing conditions for each pixel we divided the mean monthly lai laim into four periods based on interquartile range more than 75 75 50 50 25 25 as the proxy for actual seasonal vegetation growth the levels were determined according to the previous investigation of the seasonal lai changes where the most significant seasonal lai increase is twice larger than the lowest zhu et al 2017 fig 8 shows the global pattern of the ε lai based on the actual growing season the most notable positive values of the ε lai were in south america northeast america southeast asia south asia western europe and the northern part of siberia during the period lai 75 meanwhile negative ε lai values could be found in mountain and low vegetation coverage regions with significant negative values in central asia and northern australia the spatial pattern of ε lai under high vegetation growth conditions is similar to ε lai in summer winter for the southern hemisphere consistently decreasing ε lai occurred from positive to negative values along with a decreasing lai gradient except for the low latitude regions where water and energy supplies are sufficient the spatial pattern of ε lai during four vegetation growth seasons confirms a clear seasonal divergence of ε lai across regions the relationships between ai and ε lai for different seasons are shown in fig 9 consist with results based on calendar seasons the relationships of ai and ε lai during the vegetation growing seasons also show that the significant values of ε lai are distributed in the transition regions and the peak value of the ε lai shift from wet regions to arid regions as lai decreases 4 3 temporal variation of the seasonal ε lai we evaluated the temporal variation in ε lai under different biome conditions fig 10 and table 3 4 the manner kendall m k non parametric method was employed to analyze the temporal trend of global ε lai in different seasons with the corresponding p value test exploring the temporal variation in the sensitivities of et to vegetation changes among different seasons under climate change fig 10 we found substantial changes over the study period of the ε lai during the spring in the northern part of north america the central part of africa and the northern part of europe the temporal changes of ε lai are significant p 0 05 including both positive and negative trends in the summer robust changes cannot be detected in most of the regions only in the central us and central africa the extensive negative changes have been found significant during the autumn a significant negative trend can be detected in central south america western australia and central africa this significant negative trend also exists in winter in central south america and central africa ε lai has a significant negative trend along the eastern coast of australia while it becomes significantly positive in the central eastern of inland australia overall except in central africa where the ε lai significantly decreased across all seasons the temporal trend of ε lai is variant in different seasons to further understand the attributions of these temporal changes we explore the ε lai changes in different vegetation types tables 3 and 4 we found that the ε lai in forests has decreased along the years in all seasons except spring while the ε lai in the gra osh demonstrated a significant increase trend during the summer the possible mechanisms could be the difference in the photosynthetic pathway of grass and trees trees subject to drying soil and highly variable light have the objective to conserve water when the uptake of co2 is lightly limited rather than maximizing assimilation katul et al 2010 this could be the reason for the negative ε lai trend in central africa during summer where the precipitation is less than in tropical rainforests at the same latitude according to fig 5 in central africa ε lai is positive and has a negative trend along the years for summer which means that et becomes less sensitive to lai this may imply that in forests of central africa during summer et is more affected by other factors such as temperature or precipitation leading to a decoupled relationship between et and lai on the other hand the grass is more susceptible to water stress than trees resulting in a stronger ability to adjust stomata conductance during changing environments thus leading to positive changes in ε lai katul et al 2010 however during the summer the ε lai in some grassland has negative values and positive changes in ε lai could lead to a decoupled relationship between et and lai for example in central asia ε lai is negative during the summer fig 5 and the grassland demonstrates significantly positive changes in ε lai from 1981 to 2018 5 discussion 5 1 positive and negative et sensitivity to lai changes while previous studies showed that the et sensitivity has positive trends along with lai across multiple climatic and biome conditions studies based on statistical methods show negative effects of lai increase on et in the transition regions and parts of dry regions xu et al 2013a xu et al 2013b zhang et al 2018 forzieri et al 2020 per et al 2017 interestingly some studies found that the effects of vegetation coverage increase on et could be negative when the spatial scale of study regions changes and that the vegetation impact on et diminishes as region area increases which is consistent with results from paired catchment studies peel et al 2010 in our study we found weak negative ε lai in the sparse vegetation coverage or mountainous regions according to previous global studies that estimate the et sensitivity to lai changes within the budyko framework the budyko parameter has a weak negative correlation with the lai liu and you 2021 as a higher value of the budyko parameter tends to be accompanied by higher et for a given drought index liu et al 2018 the higher global lai favors a smaller value of the budyko parameter and leads to less et studies attributed this emerging phenomenon to variation in the catchment area liu and you 2021 moreover previous studies also found that lai has a strong positive connection with soil water capacity and a strong negative connection with bulk density liu and you 2021 meanwhile the budyko parameter has opposite connection with soil water capacity and bulk density respectively compared to the lai the results suggest that densely vegetation may has lower bulk density i e higher soil porosity and larger soil water capacity which favors a lower value of budyko parameter and leads to less et therefore we suppose that at a small catchment area scale or pixel scale the effects of vegetation coverage on hydrological processes are complex with interference from soil properties which could result in a weak negative connection between lai and et however besides the soil properties the hydrological processes of the vegetation system could also be affected by climatic conditions chen et al 2020 therefore to analyze the mechanism behind such an emerging pattern of negative ε lai from other perspectives we analyze the seasonal changes in ε lai under different precipitation and temperature conditions at the biome level as shown in fig 11 the northern hemisphere and fig 12 the southern hemisphere respectively results show a clear dependence on the background climate but the temporal pattern of ε lai varies for different biomes globally the higher positive ε lai has been found with seasonal precipitation around 500 mm and a seasonal average temperature of around 25 while the negative ε lai values are mostly seen in areas with precipitation less than 500 mm in accordance with previous studies the most evident and positive et lai relationship was found in the warm and moderate humid regions forzieri et al 2020 due to sufficient energy supply and low cooling effects from precipitation compared with high precipitation regions li et al 2019 meanwhile we found that the negative ε lai is mainly distributed in the grassland scrubland and savannas for these ecological systems the responses of vegetation activity to water shortage are different from forest with negative correlation between rooting depth and water availability therefore as the lai increases in the grassland scrubland and savannas the water availability is decreasing correspondingly the rooting depths could be longer for parts of the ecosystems and thus lead to larger soil water capacity and lower et liu and you 2021 however the connection between vegetation and hydrological processes is complex in the small regions except for the summer in the northern hemisphere the negative ε l a i also has been found in the forest fig 11 moreover according to the previous study chen et al 2020 the sensitivity of et to short vegetation cover gains in these regions still holds the same change direction with the increased ai but increased tree canopy cover could lead to a modest decrease in et in regions where thinner soil layer over the earth rock mountain at high elevation this significant difference in regulation patterns among various vegetation types could result in lower and even negative values of ε lai under high ai conditions in this regard future studies are needed to explore the linkages between vegetation properties and the hydrological processes in different biomes to better understand the physical basis of et sensitivity to vegetation change limitations it is widely recognized that vegetation has been experiencing substantial alterations globally which has a great influence on the terrestrial water cycle we herein derive a seasonal analytical solution to quantify the effects of vegetation changes on et by incorporating the pm mu equation in the proportionality hypothesis based pew model as a budyko type framework the pew mu holds the advantages of the traditional budyko model which gives the model the ability to develop the sensitivity method additionally it has reduced the uncertainty due to the parameter vegetation empirical relationship in the budyko model by incorporating clear physical linkages between land surface conditions and hydrological partitioning however limitations exist in our study firstly although the effect of vegetation types was taken into consideration through the constant parameter gl sh and gl ewv the dynamic changes in the vegetation types are lacking future efforts should thus be taken to fully simulate the dynamic changes in vegetation for example using mixed pixel based vegetation indices panciera et al 2011 second the pew mu is derived based on monthly water balance however the errors from soil water storage measurements may cause an imbalance in the monthly water cycle which could limit the pew mu model s ability to simulate the et processes with the emerging satellite based soil moisture products at higher spatial resolutions e g smap sentinel 1 1 km 3 km and more in situ observations from planned field campaigns future studies may benefit from more reliable soil moisture input for et estimation beck et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 third it is worth noting that although the analytical solution derived from the budyko type framework is an effective tool to attribute the hydrological response to p pet and other land surface properties e g vegetation properties and climatic seasonality the indirect interactions between climate factors and surface conditions e g the hydrological effect from vegetation response to precipitation are lacking in the solutions additionally it should be noted that the e 0 is not observed in the model framework but estimated through the pm mu algorithm therefore subject to uncertainty leveraging isotope observations may serve as a boundary to further guide calculation of e 0 only when the et components are measured separately with low uncertainty will the partitioned et components simulations begin to be properly constrained finally discrepancies exist regarding assessing the vegetation impacts on et between the budyko type framework li et al 2013 luo et al 2020 xu et al 2013a xu et al 2013b zhang et al 2018 and statistical methods forzieri et al 2020 pei et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 studies based on statistical methods show negative effects of lai increases on et in the transition regions and parts of dry regions meanwhile results from parts of solutions derived from the budyko type framework found that et sensitivity has positive trends along with lai across multiple climatic and biome conditions however other budyko type studies found the negative effects of increased vegetation e g density or area on et exist and the vegetation impact on et diminishes as region area increases which is consistent with results from paired catchment studies peel et al 2010 the emerging variations in the et sensitivity to vegetation changes highlight that the uncertainty for solutions derived from the budyko type framework or statistical methods is high possible reasons for the uncertainty could be a consequence of not having sufficient data to meaningfully fit the models even a good fit does not necessarily mean that the model is sufficient in representing the processes as described before most studies including budyko type studies and the statistical methods only consider changes in one of the vegetation properties e g lai fpar ndvi synchronous incorporations of multiple vegetation properties into the model may help to reduce this part of the uncertainties second and most importantly the interactions between factors including p radiations temperature pet lai etc might be large for specific places however most of the interactions especially the indirect interactions are neglected when constructing the solutions for example while the p pet and budyko parameter are assumed to be independent in the budyko equations evidence shows that interactions exist between land characteristics and climatic factors in the statistical methods despite increasing efforts to eliminate this part of the effect possible multi factor interactions among drivers still exist due to complex adjustments of land conditions sustaining et and hence adds to the uncertainty in the estimations therefore further studies need to be conducted to identify the interactions controlled by the choices of models and parameters when et sensitivity is estimated and more comprehensive work should be conducted to investigate the change in evapotranspiration processes with consideration of vegetation changes moreover inconsistencies in internal variability and trends in long term satellite lai products could be another source of uncertainty in ε lai analysis previous studies found that the widely used long term lai products were neither intra consistent over time nor inter consistent with each other jiang et al 2017 consequently future investigation of et sensitivity to lai requires comprehensive evaluation studies of global satellite lai products 6 conclusions our study provides an analytical solution to expressing the effects of seasonal lai changes on et within the extended budyko framework based on that we quantified divergence of hydrological partitioning in response to seasonal lai changes during spring and summer ε lai is highest in relative humid regions 0 7 ai 1 while in autumn and winter ε lai is highest in the relative arid regions 1 ai 1 4 moreover the weak negative ε lai was discovered in the regions with sparse vegetation coverage and seasonal precipitation less than 500 mm understanding the seasonal hydrological response to vegetation change is essential towards addressing the issues regarding water deficit and ecological deterioration based on the developed framework we provide the analytical solution to quantify the comprehensive effect of vegetation changes on hydrological partitioning across multiple temporal scales under various land surface conditions the pew mu model proposed here provides the possibility of developing an analytical solution for comprehensively analyzing the et sensitivity to seasonal vegetation activities overall our findings highlight the difference in hydrological response to vegetation dynamics across seasons and vegetation types thereby providing information in guiding the regional water resource and land use management strategies to adaptive local conditions credit authorship contribution statement jianyu fu

2446,in mid high latitude areas seasonal freeze thaw cycles generate significant effects on pore structure of soils and in turn affect soil mechanical properties and soil erosion processes furthermore soil particles can be detached on ridged farmland by snowmelt or rainfall concentrated flow due to topographic relief during the spring snowmelt period to explore the changes in pore structure characteristics under freeze thaw effects on soil detachment rates under simulating concentrated flow fifteen soil columns and twenty soil tanks underwent a freeze thaw pre treatment of zero one five ten and fifteen cycles soil structure characteristics were quantitatively obtained by scanning soil columns with industrial computer tomography at a 25 μm resolution soil strength was measured by a portable vane shear instrument on the surface of soil tanks detachment rates of soil tanks were measured in a flume under changeless flow shear stress τ 2 32 pa results indicated that freeze thaw effects significantly decreased soil strength by changing pore network structure including increasing total imaged porosity and elongated pore porosity the detachment rate significantly rose with the rising freeze thaw cycles p 0 05 and had a power relationship with the soil strength r2 0 503 p 0 05 thus the increase in detachment rate was mainly caused by the decrease in soil strength which is dependent on large and elongated pores that formed during freeze thaw cycles and on the geometrical characteristics of the pore network the findings improve the understanding of the generation mechanism of soil erosion as a result of changes in pore structure characteristics during the spring snowmelt period keywords freeze thaw cycles mollisol pore structure characteristic soil strength detachment rates data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction mollisol black soil areas cover approximately 55 6 104 km2 and are one of the important commodity grain productions in china xu et al 2010 liu et al 2020 as a result of the climate frequent freeze thaw cycles in early spring and late autumn high rates of snowmelt runoff in spring most rainfall concentrated in summer and topographic characteristics long and gentle slopes ridge tillage is widely used in this region chen et al 2011 xu et al 2018a xu et al 2018b ridges oriented up and down the slopes can facilitate a concentrated flow of snowmelt and runoff water in the furrows which can result in soil detachment and therefore increase nutrient losses wang et al 2020b seasonal freeze thaw effects inevitably occur during the months of early spring and late autumn and influence soil physical properties including aggregate stability shear strength soil structure and soil water retention capacity which affect erodibility in turn chamberlain and gow 1979 li and fan 2014 chen et al 2016 liu et al 2017 sun et al 2020 liu et al 2021b liu et al 2023 as an important part of soil erosion processes soil detachment is described as the dislodgment of soil surface particles from the soil matrix under erosive forces which provides loose and non cohesive soil material for following transportation and deposition zhang et al 2003 however the soil detachment processes caused by snowmelt runoff are complicated because the unmelted subsoil layer that impedes water infiltration would result in an increase in snowmelt runoff and subsurface flow in the thawed layer henry 2007 iwata et al 2018 barnes et al 2016 exploring the mechanisms of soil detachment in response to freeze thaw effects is critical as it could be a first step towards the development of prevention and control techniques of soil erosion in mollisol during the spring melting period soil structure composed of two complementary components the solid phase soil particles and aggregates and pore system which have varying sizes shapes characteristics and spatial arrangements bronick and lal 2005 rabot et al 2018 as one important component of soil structure pore structure can be characterized by porosity pore shape pore size distribution branches and connectivity and serves as one of key factors that influences soil physical properties and erosion processes munkholm et al 2012 ma et al 2015 rabot et al 2018 liu et al 2021b liu et al 2023 changes in characteristics of pore structure induced by environmental factors e g freezing and thawing would affect soil physical properties such as soil strength and thus influence soil detachment rate by concentrated flow ferrick and gatto 2005 liu et al 2017 sun et al 2020 due to frequent changes in the water phase freeze thaw effects substantially modify the distribution and arrangement and connection of soil particles aggregates and pore space thus soil pore structure liu et al 2021a the resistance of topsoil to erosion by concentrated flow or erodibility of the soil mainly controlled soil erosion processes during concentrated flow knapen et al 2007b to characterize the resistance of soil erosion by concentrated flow some studies demonstrated that soil strength is an important mechanical property because of the relationship between soil strength and critical shear stress that must be overcome when soil materials start to dislodge by runoff knapen et al 2007a wang et al 2012 ni and shi 2014 suggested that freeze thaw effects could decrease soil strength by rearranging soil particles however knowledge about the mechanisms of how cyclic freeze thaw effects affect soil strength by changing characteristics of pore structure and then influence the processes of soil detachment is still lacking in recent decades imaging technology for x ray computer tomography ct was extensively applied to the quantification of pore network structure due to non destructive and rapid advantages peth et al 2008 zhou et al 2017 characteristics of pore networks have been widely investigated with respect to the relationships with soil mechanical properties munkholm et al 2012 have revealed positive correlations between density of branches and junctions within pore network investigated by x ray computer tomography and soil friability the tensile strength of aggregates is related to pore structure as described by naveed et al 2014 and a well developed and connected pore network would result in a lower tensile strength furthermore ma et al 2015 evaluated the contributions of changes in pore characteristics of aggregates using synchrotron based high resolution x ray micro ct to changes in soil detachment rates by simulating concentrated flow to better evaluate the complex mechanisms involved in the effect of soil strength on soil detachment rate by concentrated flow during the spring melting period it is advantageous to investigate the relationship between soil strength and changes in pore structure characteristics using high resolution x ray ct scanners under freeze thaw effects research to investigate soil detachment rates in response to soil strength and its relationship with pore structure characteristics under freeze thaw effects is necessary because of its guiding importance for establishing a generalizable soil erosion model in mollisol during the spring melting period the objectives of this study were 1 to quantify changes in pore structure characteristics including porosity pore shape pore size distribution branches fractal dimension and connectivity using high resolution industrial ct under cyclic freezing and thawing 2 to evaluate the effect of freeze thaw on soil strength and detachment rates by simulating concentrated flow and 3 to explore how pore structure characteristics change soil strength thus influencing detachment rates 2 material and methods 2 1 site description and soil sampling the sampling location was located in baiquan county which is situated in heilongjiang province northeast china the soil in this region is characterized by seasonal freeze thaw cycles which are periodically rise up and down around 0 c during the days of late october and late april zhao et al 2015 the annual mean temperature and precipitation are 1 2 c and 490 9 mm respectively with temperate continental climate before sampling crop stubble was taken away from the soil surface soil samples were gathered from 0 to 15 cm soil layer of a site with long term agricultural cultivation in oct 2016 and were delivered to the laboratory the pipette method was adopted to measure soil particle size the type of soil employed in this experiment was mollisol with 16 0 sand 47 6 silt and 36 4 clay usda soil taxonomy the organic matter content was 3 3 by the dilution heat potassium dichromate oxidation method burt 2004 2 2 soil sample preparation collected soil samples excluding roots and stones away were dried in a drafty laboratory with low humidity to ensure a uniform structure air dried soil was sieved to gain 5 mm aggregates and soil particles repacking into plexiglass columns 4 6 cm diameter and 9 cm high and soil steel tanks 0 5 m long 0 2 m wide and 0 1 m deep fig 1 a and b there are evenly distributed holes 4 mm in diameter at the bottoms of the columns and tanks the bottoms were covered with gauze to prevent soil loss to ensure structure uniformity the soil columns and tanks were filled layer by layer from bottom to top with a 1 00 cm mean thickness of each layer liu et al 2021a a total of 15 soil columns and 20 soil tanks were prepared the bulk density after repacking was 1 032 0 02 g cm3 to perform a statistical analysis of change process of soil structure it is necessary to reduce the heterogeneity of soil structure as a result of repacking soil columns and tanks with aggregates and soil particles of a specific size range the heterogeneity of soil structure which is often observed in a ploughed field can be reduced leuther and schlüter 2021 the water content of the sampling soil was roughly equal to the field capacity depending on a field assessment conducted during the freezing and thawing period the water content of soil columns and soil tanks was controlled by the slow wetting method liu et al 2021b the water content in mass was 36 17 1 01 close to the field capacity all soil samples were hermetically kept with fresh keeping film to prevent evaporation 2 3 freeze thaw cycles a closed condition was used for freeze thaw treatments assuming constant water content during the processes of freezing and thawing güllü 2015 based on the average air diurnal and nocturnal temperatures of the baiquan station from the china meteorological administration 1981 2010 the experimental temperatures and number of freeze thaw cycles were determined during the spring thawing period in this area ma et al 2021 one freeze thaw cycle comprised one freezing proceeding 10 c for 24 h and a subsequent thawing proceeding 6 c for 24 h during the soil freezing process water constantly moves from unfrozen soil horizon to frozen soil horizon causing the nonuniform distribution of water in frozen soil ala et al 2016 therefore a freezing proceeding in all directions was utilized to reduce the redistribution of soil water liu et al 2017 five different periodic freezing and thawing treatments were applied 1 f0 control treatment in which the samples did not undergo a cyclical freeze thaw pre treatment and 2 f1 f5 f10 and f15 in which the samples underwent 1 5 10 and 15 cyclical freeze thaw pre treatments respectively three replicate soil columns and four replicate soil tanks were subject to each freeze thaw pre treatment after freeze thaw pre treatments soil samples were conserved at 4 c 2 4 measurements of pore structure characteristics a set of 25 μm resolution industrial ct was used to scan soil columns with three replicates for each freeze thaw treatment soil columns placed on a rotating stage were rotated 360 in horizontal direction with the uniform space of 0 3 and scanned at 100 kv and 100 μa level after scanning the image processing software vgstudio max 2 2 was used to reconstruct images image processing visualizing procedure and quantifying procedure of images were performed by using imagej software 1 52a to avoid the disturbance of boundary effects on soil structure sub volume with 800 800 800 voxels i e 20 20 20 mm3 was cropped from the concentric part of each image for follow up analysis to diminish the brightness variation within a single sample brightness contrast plugin was used to normalize the images in imagej 1 52a then 3d median filter plugin in imagej 1 52a was performed to diminish noise effect zhou et al 2016 by comparing the binarized images with different methods the segmentation method used in this study is default method which used the modified isodata algorithm in imagej software sun et al 2021 the original gray images were segmented by combining with computer algorithm and visual comparison torre et al 2020 liu et al 2023 the threshold value was determined by the following steps the original grayscale images were duplicated then entered into imagej software then adjust the threshold value manually using default method to binarize the duplicated grayscale images finally the suitable threshold values were determined by visually contrasting binarized images with the original grayscale images the pores involved in this study refer to the pores that can be identified by the ct scanner which are greater than or equal to the resolution of the scanner 25 μm total imaged porosity was determined using imagej s volume fraction plugin liu et al 2021a using imagej s 3d object counter plugin we calculated the volume and surface area of each pore in 3d images munkholm et al 2012 the volume of each pore was converted into an equivalent diameter by calculating the sphere diameter corresponding to each pore volume ma et al 2015 in the light of the calculated equivalent diameter all pores were sorted into three classes 500 μm 100 500 μm and 100 μm liu et al 2021b the shape factor f of each pore was computed in this study as followed wadell 1932 1 f a e a where ae is the surface area of a sphere with the same volume as the measured pore and a is the measured pore surface area the pores were grouped as regular pores irregular pores and elongated pores on the basis of the parameter f value in the order 0 5 0 2 0 5 0 2 the skeletonization of pore space was reconstructed using a 3d thinning algorithm in a skeletonized 3d plugin zhang et al 2018 thereafter skeletonized binary stacks were determined for measuring length density using analyse skeleton plugin in imagej the length density increasing with the intensifying complexity and friability of pore network structure was used to quantify the length of pores skeletons in a unit volume of soil garbout et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 the fractal dimension plugin in imagej was applied to characterize the self similar and homogeneous properties of the pore space based the box counting algorithm doube et al 2010 this algorithm counts the number of boxes n δ containing the pores by using grids of diminishing size boxes δ within the image stack and then calculates the slope of the linear fitting function for these pairs of log n δ log δ values as the fractal dimension fazzalari and parkinson 1996 the value of fractal dimension increased with the increasing complexity of pore network structure connectivity density using connectivity plugin in imagej calculated an estimated number of local connecting structures in images divided by unit volume and increased with increasing pore structure connectivity toriwaki and yonekura 2002 segmented images were converted into the thickness images using thickness plugin in imagej by calculating the largest diameter of the sphere inscribed the pore dougherty and kunzelmann 2007 one sample was randomly selected from three replicates among each freeze thaw treatment to reconstruct the 3d thickness images using 3d viewer plugin in imagej displayed from the same angle as fig 2 the changes in the shown colors in 3d thickness images point the various sizes of pore the brighter the colors the larger the pore sizes 2 5 measurements of soil strength to measure soil strength one soil tank was randomly selected from four replicate soil tanks among each freeze thaw treatment soil strength was measured using a portable vane shear instrument at the upper middle and lower locations of the selected soil tank along the flume bed the stress range of a vane is 0 to 1 kg cm 2 which corresponds to the approximate range of torque by hand manipulation in this experiment a large vane of the portable vane shear instrument was applied for the repacking soil tanks and the measuring results was multiplied by a ratio of 0 2 to obtain soil strength 2 6 measurements of soil detachment rate under concentrated flow simulation remaining 15 soil tanks were used to measure detachment rates in the hydraulic flume with a 5 m long 0 3 m wide and 8 slope fig 1c aggregates and primary particles 5 mm were uniformly adhered to the surface of the flume bed so as to ensure the roughness of the surface of the hydraulic flume close to that of the surface of soil tanks remaining soil tanks that underwent different freeze thaw treatments were laid in a sample hatch of the flume bed 0 2 m away from the outflow of the flume and formed a continuous surface with the flume bed a pump provided a constant water flow maintaining the flow discharge constant 0 12 l s 1 in this experiment petroleum jelly was evenly spread the juncture between the soil tank and the flume for seal before the experiment calibration of flow discharge was proceeded by gathering and weighting water flow at the water outlet within 15 s for three times the surface flow velocity was measured by calculating the time for the front edge of a dyestuff permanganate potassium solution flowing through a distance of 4 2 m in the designed flume the surface flow velocity was multiplied by the coefficient 0 8 to acquire average flow velocity wang et al 2012 the measurements of the average flow velocity were repeated six times for a designated flow discharge the average flow depth was 0 0017 m which was calculated from flow discharge average flow velocity and width of the flume the flow shear stress τ pa was calculated as follows 2 τ ρghs where ρ is the density of water kg m 3 g is acceleration of gravity m s 2 h is average flow depth m and s is the tangent value of slope gradient the flow shear stress of 2 32 pa was generated due to the flow discharge 0 12 l s 1 and gradient of flume bed 8 referred to the experimental processes of knapen et al 2007a and b and wang et al 2012 soil detachment rates were measured under above designed conditions during each experimental run runoff water and separated soil material were gathered into plastic buckets at water outlet to reduce the latent influences of flow dynamic expect for shear force parallel to the hydraulic flume and uneven detachment within the soil tanks the detachment experiment runs lasted 70 s knapen et al 2007a ma et al 2015 the sediment in plastic buckets was kept static for 6 h and then separated from the water sucking the supernatant water by pipettes the residual sediments in plastic buckets were transferred into aluminum boxes and then kept in an electric control dryer at 105 until constant weight soil detachment rate dr kg m 2 s 1 was calculated as follows zhang et al 2003 3 dr δ w t a where w is the dry weight of detached soil kg t is the test duration s and a is the soil sample surface area m2 soil tanks with three replicates under each freeze thaw treatment were detached under designed flow shear stress 2 7 statistical analysis to compare whether significant differences existing in pore structure properties soil strength and detachment rate among the treatments analysis of variance anova was performed using spss software program for multiple comparisons mean values of parameters of pore structure properties soil strength and detachment rate were tested using the procedure of least significant difference lsd at the level of 95 confidence pearson correlation and stepwise multiple regression were applied to evaluate the relationships between parameters of pore structure characteristics and soil strength and to conduct the path analyses du and chen 2010 the path analyses can be used to explore the direct and indirect effects of independent variates on dependent variates as well as the importance of independent variates to dependent variates chen et al 2022 all figures were produced with origin 9 0 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 pore structure characteristics under freeze thaw effects renderings of 3d pore structure were observed from different freeze thaw treatments fig 2 these images clearly showed an evolution of pore microstructure after freeze thaw treatments the pore number in the 3d microstructure increased from the f0 to f15 treatments and the pore structure increasingly became intricate and continuous moreover most pores in the f0 treatment were isolated and less continuous as confirmed by the lower connectivity density with the increasing freeze thaw cycles from f0 to f15 treatments small and isolated pores gradually developed and got interconnected into larger pores similar observations were also found by liu et al 2021a who visualized the evolution processes of soil microstructure remoulded by 2 mm aggregates and particles under successive cyclic of freezing and thawing these observation results can be confirmed by the quantitative characteristics of pore structure table 1 the total imaged porosity in the f1 f5 f10 and f15 treatments were greater by 8 2 22 92 27 91 and 41 64 respectively compared to the f0 treatment total number of pores gradually increased with increases of approximately 2 93 40 53 21 69 and 72 67 for the f1 f5 f10 and f15 treatments respectively compared to the f0 treatment these results were consistent with wang et al 2020a who confirmed that freeze thaw effects increased the porosity of saline soil investigated by scanning electron microscopy with 2000 magnification fig 2 depicts 3d renderings of different samples taken from successive freeze thaw treatments pore size distribution as an important pore parameter related to soil strength and detachment rate under concentrated runoff can be affected by the arrangement of soil aggregates and particles under freeze thaw effects as shown in table 1 with the rising freeze thaw cycles the 100 μm porosity in the f1 treatment had the same value as the f0 treatment then showed an increasing trend with fluctuation with increases of approximately 44 89 25 89 and 86 23 in the f5 f10 and f15 treatments respectively relative to the f0 treatment the 100 500 μm porosity gradually increased during five freeze thaw cycles with the maximum value at the f5 treatment then decreased from f5 to f15 the 500 μm porosity had increased by 4 78 in f1 18 99 in f5 31 79 in f10 and 51 37 in f15 respectively relative to the f0 treatment the 500 μm porosity showed a similar trend as the total imaged porosity and accounted for 66 56 to 73 48 of the total imaged porosity during freeze thaw cycles changes in pore diameter distributions were dynamic pores with smaller diameters gradually developed and interconnected to form pores with larger diameters accompanied by the breakdown of pores with larger diameters similar results were summarized by yan et al 2017 who reported that parts of smaller pores developed into larger pores increasing the porosity of large pores under freeze thaw cycles to evaluate the relationships between soil pore characteristics the correlation coefficients were listed in table 2 a high correlation coefficient between the total imaged porosity and 500 μm porosity indicated that the increase in pores with larger pore equivalent diameters contributed more to the increase in the total imaged porosity under freeze thaw effects table 2 combined with the observations from fig 2 it can be deduced that small pores gradually appeared then these pores interconnected with other pores to form large pores with the increasing numbers of freeze thaw cycles with the gradual freezing of soils the phase transition within pores from liquid water to ice crystals increased its volume leading to enlarge micro fissures and gaps by extrusion deformation and cracking of soil materials ma et al 2021 then when ice crystals gradually melted the contractive volume of soil materials becomes insufficient to counteract the expansion caused by the growth of ice crystals wilen and dash 1995 rempel 2010 zhang et al 2016 liu et al 2021b on account of the alternating expansions and contractions of pore volume caused by the alternating transition between liquid phase and solid phase with the increasing number of freeze thaw cycles small and isolated pores appeared including the expansion of pores less than the resolution into those pores greater than resolution and the disconnection of large pores into multiple smaller pores and gradually developed to connect with other pores to form large pores with larger pore diameters these processes during freeze thaw cycles would facilitate the increases in porosity and number of pores pore shape is also a key parameter that affects soil aggregate stability and strength thereby influencing detachment rates of soils ma et al 2015 ma et al 2021 munkholm et al 2016 the elongated pore porosity first decreased by 13 34 in the f1 treatment and then gradually increased with increases of approximately 9 29 27 55 and 88 3 in the f5 f10 and f15 treatments respectively relative to the f0 treatment table 1 freeze thaw effects changed the initial cementing state between soil particles and aggregates then caused parts of elongated pores to disconnect into irregular pores increasing the porosity of irregular pores under the first freeze thaw cycles chen et al 2016 starkloff et al 2017 the irregular pore porosity and regular pore porosity were positively correlated with the 100 500 μm porosity table 2 and displayed a similar trend as the 100 500 μm porosity these indicated that the shapes of most pores with 100 500 μm diameter were irregular or regular the irregular pore porosity gradually increased with increases of approximately 31 4 37 9 29 37 and 27 06 in the f1 f5 f10 and f15 treatments respectively relative to the f0 treatment and the regular pore porosity increased by 14 45 25 58 23 17 and 13 73 in the f1 f5 f10 and f15 treatments respectively relative to the f0 treatment it is noteworthy that both the irregular pore porosity and regular pore porosity gradually increased and reached the maximum values at the f5 treatment then decreased with the increasing freeze thaw cycles it can be inferred that the cementation between soil particles and aggregates continuously receded due to the continual volumetric expansion of the water phase transition with the rise of freeze thaw cycles xu et al 2018a xu et al 2018b then a large part of irregular and regular pores was transformed into elongated pores under higher frequencies of freeze thaw cycles e g f10 and f15 these findings are supported by liu et al 2021a who reported that the porosity of irregular pores showed a trend that first increased and then decreased with the increasing freeze thaw cycles reaching the maximum values at 5 freeze thaw cycles because of the important relationship with soil properties such as friability erodibility and infiltrability the characteristics of pore network structure such as branching fractal dimension and connectivity under freeze thaw effects were quantitatively described peth et al 2008 munkholm et al 2012 sun et al 2021 relative to the f0 treatment in the f1 f5 f10 and f15 treatments respectively the length density has approximately increased by 7 13 43 28 30 89 and 103 98 table 1 on the basis of the higher correlation coefficients listed in table 2 the length density was more sensitive to the elongated pore porosity suggesting that the pores with elongated shapes had more branches ice lenses in frozen soils grow in branching with network shapes and the growth extruded soil which would increase the length density of the pore network torrance et al 2008 in comparison zhao et al 2021 found that the length density in the pore network of alpine meadows soil investigated by x ray computed tomography first decreased under three cycles of freeze thaw and then increased under six cycles of freeze thaw this may be because lower numbers of freeze thaw cycles facilitated the formations of smaller pores but the ct scanner cannot resolve these pores due to the lower resolution relative to the f0 treatment the fractal dimension increased with increases of approximately 1 06 2 71 2 24 and 3 71 in the f1 f5 f10 and f15 treatments respectively similar phenomena were reported by xu et al 2019 and liu et al 2021a in which the fractal dimension of pore network structure was enhanced due to freeze thaw effects the fractal dimension exhibited the highest correlation coefficient with the 100 μm porosity and regular pore porosity in characteristics of pore diameter distribution and pore shape respectively table 2 these indicated that the increasing the 100 μm porosity and regular pore porosity induced by freeze thaw effects may facilitate pore network structure more convoluted with increasing cyclic of freezing and thawing the connectivity density gradually increased and ranged from a minimum of 0 12 mm 3 to a maximum of 1 51 mm 3 indicating a more connective pore network structure ma et al 2021 using high resolution x ray computed tomography also suggested that continuous periodic freezing and thawing increased the connectivity of soil aggregates depending on the higher correlation coefficients the connectivity density showed more sensibility to the 500 μm porosity and elongated pore porosity in characteristics of pore diameter distribution and pore shape respectively table 2 demonstrating that the pores with great equivalent diameters and elongated shapes contributed more the connectivity of pore network based on the findings of rooney et al 2022 deformation within the first five freeze thaw cycles would decrease the pore network of resiliency to subsequent deformation thus increasing susceptibility of the pore network to disconnect combined with the observation results of 3d images fig 2 an increasing length density fractal dimension and connectivity density induced by freeze thaw effects signified a more complex branching and connected pore networks munkholm et al 2012 3 2 soil strength under freeze thaw effects and relationships between soil strength and pore structure characteristics soil strength has been recognized as an important parameter characterizing the resistance of soil erosion relating to pore structure characteristics cruse and larson 1977 ma et al 2015 the soil strength significantly decreased with the rising freeze thaw cycles p 0 05 relative to the f0 treatment the freeze thaw treatments caused significant decreases in the soil strength with decreases of approximately 12 75 39 43 42 99 and 59 58 in the f1 f5 f10 and f15 treatments respectively fig 3 similar results were stated by sun et al 2020 who suggested that freeze thaw effects significantly decreased soil strength to understand the relationships between pore structure characteristics and soil strength pearson correlation was performed among 11 soil structure parameters total imaged porosity total number of pores 100 μm porosity 100 500 μm porosity 500 μm porosity elongated pore porosity irregular pore porosity regular pore porosity length density fractal dimension and connectivity density and soil strength table 3 most correlations between pore structure characteristics and soil strength were significant p 0 05 or 0 01 after cyclic freeze thaw effects the growth and formation of ice crystals caused the expansion and appearance of pores 25 μm resolution increasing porosity then potential cracks and fissures induced by cyclic freeze thaw effects would be developed with the generated a number of fine pores xu et al 2018a xu et al 2018b in addition the soil strength was significantly negatively correlated with the length density fractal dimension and connectivity density table 3 this was because the branches and reconnections of ice lenses grew into network shapes and increased branch connectivity and complexity of pore structure resulting in structure fragment and a decrease in the soil strength these results indicated that changes in pore structure characteristics can change soil mechanical properties under freeze thaw effects these were consistent with the consequences suggested by li et al 2020 the stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed to further explore the relationships among pore structure characteristics and soil strength and the regression model was expressed as followed 4 ss 320 99 34 91 tip 2724 06 ep r2 0 767 p 0 05 where ss tip and ep are soil strength kpa total imaged porosity and elongated pore porosity the stepwise multiple regression excluded numerous pore structure characteristics such as the total number of pores pore diameter distribution length density fractal dimension and connectivity density the new equation suggested that the variation of soil strength can be better explained by the total imaged porosity and elongated pore porosity than other pore structure characteristics according to high coefficients of determination this regression model reveals the change processes of soil strength following freeze thaw effects from the perspective of pore structure while providing an empirical relationship for further predictions of how freeze thaw effects would influence the physical properties and snowmelt erosion processes as a key internal factor related to soil strength soil cohesion reflects various physical and chemical forces between soil particles which is determined by the distance between soil particles wei et al 2018 wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020c also reported that cohesion of chinese mollisol decreased with the increasing number of freeze thaw cycles reaching the minimum values at the 13 cycles in this study we also found that the total imaged porosity and elongated pore porosity were significantly correlated with the 500 μm porosity table 2 indicating that the total imaged porosity and elongated pore porosity increased as the number of large pores increased during freezing and thawing processes the increase in porosity with large equivalent diameters enlarged the distance distribution between soil particles and aggregates decreasing in soil cohesion ni and shi 2014 chen et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 with the size of pores in soils increasing larger aggregates gradually fragmented into smaller aggregates and irreversible deformations were generated which continually diminished the friction and cementation between soil particles wang et al 2020a yan et al 2017 these reasons can result in a decline in the soil strength under freeze thaw effects to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of the above pore structure characteristics the total imaged porosity and elongated pore porosity on the soil strength the results of path analyses were listed in table 4 as reflected by the absolute value of direct path coefficients the direct impacts of included pore structure characteristics on the soil strength were in the order total imaged porosity elongated pore porosity the elongated pore porosity can indirectly affect the total imaged porosity according to the indirect path coefficient thus exhibiting negative effects on the soil strength similarly munkholm et al 2002 demonstrated that the tensile strength of soil cores was inversely related to the macroporosity but the soil fragility was positively related to the connectivity of pore space and the authors also suggested that long straight pores and fractures where crack propagation probably would begin to a large extent resulted in higher connectivity of pore space as reflected by a higher correlation coefficient between the elongated pore porosity and connectivity density table 2 and the total imaged porosity and elongated pore porosity were significantly correlated with the length density and connectivity density indicating the formation and development of elongated pores under freeze thaw effects can increase the branch and connectivity of the pore network accordingly frequent freeze thaw cycles would generate numerous pores and fissures between soil particles and aggregates then increase the degree of fragmentation weakening the cementation between soil particles wang et al 2020a these implies that there is a high possibility of crack extension and interaction with the volume 9 larger after water freezing the expansive force would destroy the original linkage state among soil particles and aggregates and the irregular boundaries of soil particles and aggregates would collapse resulting in an increase in elongated pores of soil yan et al 2017 moreover the porosity with 100 μm in equivalent diameter was one of the predominant drivers controlling the tensile strength of soils those pores and cracks would pose a rising risk of propagating cracks regardless of the direction of the applied stress munkholm et al 2012 ma et al 2015 and the elongated pore porosity exhibited a significant correlation with the 500 μm porosity indicating that the elongated pores were with larger diameters table 2 ma et al 2021 reported that elongated porosity was significantly and negatively related to the mean weight diameter an index of the distribution and stability of soil aggregates these indicated that the increase in elongated porosity and porosity with large size under frequent freeze thaw cycles can separate internal soil particles within aggregates and weaken breaking down internal structure and decreasing soil strength munkholm et al 2002 because the larger the size of pores the larger the distance and the less the bonding force between soil particles thereby diminishing soil strength wang et al 2020a from the above findings these results suggested that freeze thaw effects resulted in a pore network structure of soils with increasing porosity elongated pore shapes and well connected decreasing the soil strength 3 3 soil detachment rate under freeze thaw effects and the relationships between detachment rate and soil strength the detachment rate of soil can reflect the soil erodibility under snowmelt runoff and rainfall during the spring snowmelt period as displayed in fig 4 the detachment rate significantly increased with the rising freeze thaw cycles p 0 05 specifically the detachment rate increased with increases of approximately 5 88 40 1 40 63 and 124 63 in the f1 f5 f10 and f15 treatments respectively compared with the f0 treatment these were in accordance with the consequences of liu et al 2017 who found that freeze thaw effects can intensify the detachment capacity of typical black soil by simulating runoff flow soil detachment capacity that is driven by concentrated runoff is tightly related to soil properties such as soil strength while dynamic processes of soil properties induced by freeze thaw effects can be put down to changes in soil pore structure liu et al 2023 revealed that the changes in pore structure characteristics particularly the increase in total imaged porosity branches and connectivity induced by freeze thaw effects can facilitate the fragmentation and rearrangement of soil aggregates by weakening cementation and loosening skeleton as aggregates were susceptible to be fragmented under freeze thaw effects soil mass generally loosened which reduced soil cohesion by weakening the friction and cementation between soil particles and aggregates these results indicate that freeze thaw effects changed soil structure influencing soil properties thus made soil mass less resistant to detachment by flowing runoff wang et al 2018 revealed that soil detachment rate decreased exponentially with a decrease in soil cohesion which is a key internal factor related to soil strength meanwhile sun et al 2020 found that the erodibility of rills was negatively correlated with soil strength therefore it is a feasible way to estimate the detachment rate by using the soil strength the best predicting equation between the detachment rate d r and soil strength s s was a power function r2 0 585 p 0 05 fig 5 from the preceding analysis it can be inferred that the changes in pore network structure induced by freeze thaw effects decreased cohesive forces between aggregates and soil particles and weakened soil skeleton thus resulting in the decrease in soil strength then increased the detachment rate the results of this study indicated that the detachment rate was closely related to the soil strength which was affected by soil pore structure characteristics total imaged porosity and elongated pore porosity seasonal freeze thaw cycles can provide effective material sources by changing the structure of surface soil knapen et al 2007a in mollisol region freeze thaw effects increase the detachment capacity of soil and surface soil can be detached by snowmelt runoff thus resulting in intensive soil erosion during the spring snowmelt period wang et al 2021 this study identified the effects of freeze thaw cycles on the parameters of pore structure characteristics and investigated the effects of them on soil strength thus explored the mechanisms of the effects of soil strength on soil erodibility from the scopes of microstructure under freeze thaw effects during the spring snowmelt period the existence of unmelted sublayers impeding water infiltration and the changes in soil water retention capacity induced by freeze thaw effects would result in an increase in snowmelt runoff and subsurface flow in the thawed layer increasing detachment rates and causing severe soil erosion fan and cai 2003 henry 2007 iwata et al 2010 barnes et al 2016 liu et al 2021b to explore how pore structure of various soil densities changes under freeze thaw effects a further set of experiments should be conducted using soil samples with various densities collected from the field since the equivalent diameter used in this study is not the actual diameter further investigations would apply the local thickness method to calculate the representative diameter the largest sphere fitting inside pore in the soil pore network and thus explore their change processes and their impacts on soil properties during freeze thaw effects 4 conclusions detailed changes in pore structure characteristics of mollisol subject to freeze thaw cycles were quantified by x ray computed tomography the effects of changes in pore structure characteristics on changes in soil strength following various freeze thaw cycles were evaluated using path analyses the results indicated that the decrease in soil strength was closely relative to the evolution of pore structure under freeze thaw cycles including the increases in total imaged porosity and elongated pores porosity a multiple regression model of equation 4 including total imaged porosity and elongated pores porosity was obtained for estimating soil strength results of laboratory experiments on soil strength and detachment under freeze thaw effects for disturbed mollisol surfaces showed that freeze thaw effects significantly decreased soil strength and increased detachment rate p 0 05 a power relationship between soil strength and detachment rate was observed for different freeze thaw treatments p 0 05 our findings indicate that soil with pore network containing large porosity and elongated pore shapes following freeze thaw effects would aggravate soil detachment capacity under concentrated flow by decreasing soil strength this study simply provided knowledge of the mechanisms of the effects of changes in pore structure characteristics during the seasonal freezing thawing period on soil detachment rate improving the understanding of the occurrences and progression of snowmelt erosion of mollisol in northeast china in consideration of difference of the microstructure of intact and repacked soil samples follow up similar experiments would be conducted

2446,in mid high latitude areas seasonal freeze thaw cycles generate significant effects on pore structure of soils and in turn affect soil mechanical properties and soil erosion processes furthermore soil particles can be detached on ridged farmland by snowmelt or rainfall concentrated flow due to topographic relief during the spring snowmelt period to explore the changes in pore structure characteristics under freeze thaw effects on soil detachment rates under simulating concentrated flow fifteen soil columns and twenty soil tanks underwent a freeze thaw pre treatment of zero one five ten and fifteen cycles soil structure characteristics were quantitatively obtained by scanning soil columns with industrial computer tomography at a 25 μm resolution soil strength was measured by a portable vane shear instrument on the surface of soil tanks detachment rates of soil tanks were measured in a flume under changeless flow shear stress τ 2 32 pa results indicated that freeze thaw effects significantly decreased soil strength by changing pore network structure including increasing total imaged porosity and elongated pore porosity the detachment rate significantly rose with the rising freeze thaw cycles p 0 05 and had a power relationship with the soil strength r2 0 503 p 0 05 thus the increase in detachment rate was mainly caused by the decrease in soil strength which is dependent on large and elongated pores that formed during freeze thaw cycles and on the geometrical characteristics of the pore network the findings improve the understanding of the generation mechanism of soil erosion as a result of changes in pore structure characteristics during the spring snowmelt period keywords freeze thaw cycles mollisol pore structure characteristic soil strength detachment rates data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction mollisol black soil areas cover approximately 55 6 104 km2 and are one of the important commodity grain productions in china xu et al 2010 liu et al 2020 as a result of the climate frequent freeze thaw cycles in early spring and late autumn high rates of snowmelt runoff in spring most rainfall concentrated in summer and topographic characteristics long and gentle slopes ridge tillage is widely used in this region chen et al 2011 xu et al 2018a xu et al 2018b ridges oriented up and down the slopes can facilitate a concentrated flow of snowmelt and runoff water in the furrows which can result in soil detachment and therefore increase nutrient losses wang et al 2020b seasonal freeze thaw effects inevitably occur during the months of early spring and late autumn and influence soil physical properties including aggregate stability shear strength soil structure and soil water retention capacity which affect erodibility in turn chamberlain and gow 1979 li and fan 2014 chen et al 2016 liu et al 2017 sun et al 2020 liu et al 2021b liu et al 2023 as an important part of soil erosion processes soil detachment is described as the dislodgment of soil surface particles from the soil matrix under erosive forces which provides loose and non cohesive soil material for following transportation and deposition zhang et al 2003 however the soil detachment processes caused by snowmelt runoff are complicated because the unmelted subsoil layer that impedes water infiltration would result in an increase in snowmelt runoff and subsurface flow in the thawed layer henry 2007 iwata et al 2018 barnes et al 2016 exploring the mechanisms of soil detachment in response to freeze thaw effects is critical as it could be a first step towards the development of prevention and control techniques of soil erosion in mollisol during the spring melting period soil structure composed of two complementary components the solid phase soil particles and aggregates and pore system which have varying sizes shapes characteristics and spatial arrangements bronick and lal 2005 rabot et al 2018 as one important component of soil structure pore structure can be characterized by porosity pore shape pore size distribution branches and connectivity and serves as one of key factors that influences soil physical properties and erosion processes munkholm et al 2012 ma et al 2015 rabot et al 2018 liu et al 2021b liu et al 2023 changes in characteristics of pore structure induced by environmental factors e g freezing and thawing would affect soil physical properties such as soil strength and thus influence soil detachment rate by concentrated flow ferrick and gatto 2005 liu et al 2017 sun et al 2020 due to frequent changes in the water phase freeze thaw effects substantially modify the distribution and arrangement and connection of soil particles aggregates and pore space thus soil pore structure liu et al 2021a the resistance of topsoil to erosion by concentrated flow or erodibility of the soil mainly controlled soil erosion processes during concentrated flow knapen et al 2007b to characterize the resistance of soil erosion by concentrated flow some studies demonstrated that soil strength is an important mechanical property because of the relationship between soil strength and critical shear stress that must be overcome when soil materials start to dislodge by runoff knapen et al 2007a wang et al 2012 ni and shi 2014 suggested that freeze thaw effects could decrease soil strength by rearranging soil particles however knowledge about the mechanisms of how cyclic freeze thaw effects affect soil strength by changing characteristics of pore structure and then influence the processes of soil detachment is still lacking in recent decades imaging technology for x ray computer tomography ct was extensively applied to the quantification of pore network structure due to non destructive and rapid advantages peth et al 2008 zhou et al 2017 characteristics of pore networks have been widely investigated with respect to the relationships with soil mechanical properties munkholm et al 2012 have revealed positive correlations between density of branches and junctions within pore network investigated by x ray computer tomography and soil friability the tensile strength of aggregates is related to pore structure as described by naveed et al 2014 and a well developed and connected pore network would result in a lower tensile strength furthermore ma et al 2015 evaluated the contributions of changes in pore characteristics of aggregates using synchrotron based high resolution x ray micro ct to changes in soil detachment rates by simulating concentrated flow to better evaluate the complex mechanisms involved in the effect of soil strength on soil detachment rate by concentrated flow during the spring melting period it is advantageous to investigate the relationship between soil strength and changes in pore structure characteristics using high resolution x ray ct scanners under freeze thaw effects research to investigate soil detachment rates in response to soil strength and its relationship with pore structure characteristics under freeze thaw effects is necessary because of its guiding importance for establishing a generalizable soil erosion model in mollisol during the spring melting period the objectives of this study were 1 to quantify changes in pore structure characteristics including porosity pore shape pore size distribution branches fractal dimension and connectivity using high resolution industrial ct under cyclic freezing and thawing 2 to evaluate the effect of freeze thaw on soil strength and detachment rates by simulating concentrated flow and 3 to explore how pore structure characteristics change soil strength thus influencing detachment rates 2 material and methods 2 1 site description and soil sampling the sampling location was located in baiquan county which is situated in heilongjiang province northeast china the soil in this region is characterized by seasonal freeze thaw cycles which are periodically rise up and down around 0 c during the days of late october and late april zhao et al 2015 the annual mean temperature and precipitation are 1 2 c and 490 9 mm respectively with temperate continental climate before sampling crop stubble was taken away from the soil surface soil samples were gathered from 0 to 15 cm soil layer of a site with long term agricultural cultivation in oct 2016 and were delivered to the laboratory the pipette method was adopted to measure soil particle size the type of soil employed in this experiment was mollisol with 16 0 sand 47 6 silt and 36 4 clay usda soil taxonomy the organic matter content was 3 3 by the dilution heat potassium dichromate oxidation method burt 2004 2 2 soil sample preparation collected soil samples excluding roots and stones away were dried in a drafty laboratory with low humidity to ensure a uniform structure air dried soil was sieved to gain 5 mm aggregates and soil particles repacking into plexiglass columns 4 6 cm diameter and 9 cm high and soil steel tanks 0 5 m long 0 2 m wide and 0 1 m deep fig 1 a and b there are evenly distributed holes 4 mm in diameter at the bottoms of the columns and tanks the bottoms were covered with gauze to prevent soil loss to ensure structure uniformity the soil columns and tanks were filled layer by layer from bottom to top with a 1 00 cm mean thickness of each layer liu et al 2021a a total of 15 soil columns and 20 soil tanks were prepared the bulk density after repacking was 1 032 0 02 g cm3 to perform a statistical analysis of change process of soil structure it is necessary to reduce the heterogeneity of soil structure as a result of repacking soil columns and tanks with aggregates and soil particles of a specific size range the heterogeneity of soil structure which is often observed in a ploughed field can be reduced leuther and schlüter 2021 the water content of the sampling soil was roughly equal to the field capacity depending on a field assessment conducted during the freezing and thawing period the water content of soil columns and soil tanks was controlled by the slow wetting method liu et al 2021b the water content in mass was 36 17 1 01 close to the field capacity all soil samples were hermetically kept with fresh keeping film to prevent evaporation 2 3 freeze thaw cycles a closed condition was used for freeze thaw treatments assuming constant water content during the processes of freezing and thawing güllü 2015 based on the average air diurnal and nocturnal temperatures of the baiquan station from the china meteorological administration 1981 2010 the experimental temperatures and number of freeze thaw cycles were determined during the spring thawing period in this area ma et al 2021 one freeze thaw cycle comprised one freezing proceeding 10 c for 24 h and a subsequent thawing proceeding 6 c for 24 h during the soil freezing process water constantly moves from unfrozen soil horizon to frozen soil horizon causing the nonuniform distribution of water in frozen soil ala et al 2016 therefore a freezing proceeding in all directions was utilized to reduce the redistribution of soil water liu et al 2017 five different periodic freezing and thawing treatments were applied 1 f0 control treatment in which the samples did not undergo a cyclical freeze thaw pre treatment and 2 f1 f5 f10 and f15 in which the samples underwent 1 5 10 and 15 cyclical freeze thaw pre treatments respectively three replicate soil columns and four replicate soil tanks were subject to each freeze thaw pre treatment after freeze thaw pre treatments soil samples were conserved at 4 c 2 4 measurements of pore structure characteristics a set of 25 μm resolution industrial ct was used to scan soil columns with three replicates for each freeze thaw treatment soil columns placed on a rotating stage were rotated 360 in horizontal direction with the uniform space of 0 3 and scanned at 100 kv and 100 μa level after scanning the image processing software vgstudio max 2 2 was used to reconstruct images image processing visualizing procedure and quantifying procedure of images were performed by using imagej software 1 52a to avoid the disturbance of boundary effects on soil structure sub volume with 800 800 800 voxels i e 20 20 20 mm3 was cropped from the concentric part of each image for follow up analysis to diminish the brightness variation within a single sample brightness contrast plugin was used to normalize the images in imagej 1 52a then 3d median filter plugin in imagej 1 52a was performed to diminish noise effect zhou et al 2016 by comparing the binarized images with different methods the segmentation method used in this study is default method which used the modified isodata algorithm in imagej software sun et al 2021 the original gray images were segmented by combining with computer algorithm and visual comparison torre et al 2020 liu et al 2023 the threshold value was determined by the following steps the original grayscale images were duplicated then entered into imagej software then adjust the threshold value manually using default method to binarize the duplicated grayscale images finally the suitable threshold values were determined by visually contrasting binarized images with the original grayscale images the pores involved in this study refer to the pores that can be identified by the ct scanner which are greater than or equal to the resolution of the scanner 25 μm total imaged porosity was determined using imagej s volume fraction plugin liu et al 2021a using imagej s 3d object counter plugin we calculated the volume and surface area of each pore in 3d images munkholm et al 2012 the volume of each pore was converted into an equivalent diameter by calculating the sphere diameter corresponding to each pore volume ma et al 2015 in the light of the calculated equivalent diameter all pores were sorted into three classes 500 μm 100 500 μm and 100 μm liu et al 2021b the shape factor f of each pore was computed in this study as followed wadell 1932 1 f a e a where ae is the surface area of a sphere with the same volume as the measured pore and a is the measured pore surface area the pores were grouped as regular pores irregular pores and elongated pores on the basis of the parameter f value in the order 0 5 0 2 0 5 0 2 the skeletonization of pore space was reconstructed using a 3d thinning algorithm in a skeletonized 3d plugin zhang et al 2018 thereafter skeletonized binary stacks were determined for measuring length density using analyse skeleton plugin in imagej the length density increasing with the intensifying complexity and friability of pore network structure was used to quantify the length of pores skeletons in a unit volume of soil garbout et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 the fractal dimension plugin in imagej was applied to characterize the self similar and homogeneous properties of the pore space based the box counting algorithm doube et al 2010 this algorithm counts the number of boxes n δ containing the pores by using grids of diminishing size boxes δ within the image stack and then calculates the slope of the linear fitting function for these pairs of log n δ log δ values as the fractal dimension fazzalari and parkinson 1996 the value of fractal dimension increased with the increasing complexity of pore network structure connectivity density using connectivity plugin in imagej calculated an estimated number of local connecting structures in images divided by unit volume and increased with increasing pore structure connectivity toriwaki and yonekura 2002 segmented images were converted into the thickness images using thickness plugin in imagej by calculating the largest diameter of the sphere inscribed the pore dougherty and kunzelmann 2007 one sample was randomly selected from three replicates among each freeze thaw treatment to reconstruct the 3d thickness images using 3d viewer plugin in imagej displayed from the same angle as fig 2 the changes in the shown colors in 3d thickness images point the various sizes of pore the brighter the colors the larger the pore sizes 2 5 measurements of soil strength to measure soil strength one soil tank was randomly selected from four replicate soil tanks among each freeze thaw treatment soil strength was measured using a portable vane shear instrument at the upper middle and lower locations of the selected soil tank along the flume bed the stress range of a vane is 0 to 1 kg cm 2 which corresponds to the approximate range of torque by hand manipulation in this experiment a large vane of the portable vane shear instrument was applied for the repacking soil tanks and the measuring results was multiplied by a ratio of 0 2 to obtain soil strength 2 6 measurements of soil detachment rate under concentrated flow simulation remaining 15 soil tanks were used to measure detachment rates in the hydraulic flume with a 5 m long 0 3 m wide and 8 slope fig 1c aggregates and primary particles 5 mm were uniformly adhered to the surface of the flume bed so as to ensure the roughness of the surface of the hydraulic flume close to that of the surface of soil tanks remaining soil tanks that underwent different freeze thaw treatments were laid in a sample hatch of the flume bed 0 2 m away from the outflow of the flume and formed a continuous surface with the flume bed a pump provided a constant water flow maintaining the flow discharge constant 0 12 l s 1 in this experiment petroleum jelly was evenly spread the juncture between the soil tank and the flume for seal before the experiment calibration of flow discharge was proceeded by gathering and weighting water flow at the water outlet within 15 s for three times the surface flow velocity was measured by calculating the time for the front edge of a dyestuff permanganate potassium solution flowing through a distance of 4 2 m in the designed flume the surface flow velocity was multiplied by the coefficient 0 8 to acquire average flow velocity wang et al 2012 the measurements of the average flow velocity were repeated six times for a designated flow discharge the average flow depth was 0 0017 m which was calculated from flow discharge average flow velocity and width of the flume the flow shear stress τ pa was calculated as follows 2 τ ρghs where ρ is the density of water kg m 3 g is acceleration of gravity m s 2 h is average flow depth m and s is the tangent value of slope gradient the flow shear stress of 2 32 pa was generated due to the flow discharge 0 12 l s 1 and gradient of flume bed 8 referred to the experimental processes of knapen et al 2007a and b and wang et al 2012 soil detachment rates were measured under above designed conditions during each experimental run runoff water and separated soil material were gathered into plastic buckets at water outlet to reduce the latent influences of flow dynamic expect for shear force parallel to the hydraulic flume and uneven detachment within the soil tanks the detachment experiment runs lasted 70 s knapen et al 2007a ma et al 2015 the sediment in plastic buckets was kept static for 6 h and then separated from the water sucking the supernatant water by pipettes the residual sediments in plastic buckets were transferred into aluminum boxes and then kept in an electric control dryer at 105 until constant weight soil detachment rate dr kg m 2 s 1 was calculated as follows zhang et al 2003 3 dr δ w t a where w is the dry weight of detached soil kg t is the test duration s and a is the soil sample surface area m2 soil tanks with three replicates under each freeze thaw treatment were detached under designed flow shear stress 2 7 statistical analysis to compare whether significant differences existing in pore structure properties soil strength and detachment rate among the treatments analysis of variance anova was performed using spss software program for multiple comparisons mean values of parameters of pore structure properties soil strength and detachment rate were tested using the procedure of least significant difference lsd at the level of 95 confidence pearson correlation and stepwise multiple regression were applied to evaluate the relationships between parameters of pore structure characteristics and soil strength and to conduct the path analyses du and chen 2010 the path analyses can be used to explore the direct and indirect effects of independent variates on dependent variates as well as the importance of independent variates to dependent variates chen et al 2022 all figures were produced with origin 9 0 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 pore structure characteristics under freeze thaw effects renderings of 3d pore structure were observed from different freeze thaw treatments fig 2 these images clearly showed an evolution of pore microstructure after freeze thaw treatments the pore number in the 3d microstructure increased from the f0 to f15 treatments and the pore structure increasingly became intricate and continuous moreover most pores in the f0 treatment were isolated and less continuous as confirmed by the lower connectivity density with the increasing freeze thaw cycles from f0 to f15 treatments small and isolated pores gradually developed and got interconnected into larger pores similar observations were also found by liu et al 2021a who visualized the evolution processes of soil microstructure remoulded by 2 mm aggregates and particles under successive cyclic of freezing and thawing these observation results can be confirmed by the quantitative characteristics of pore structure table 1 the total imaged porosity in the f1 f5 f10 and f15 treatments were greater by 8 2 22 92 27 91 and 41 64 respectively compared to the f0 treatment total number of pores gradually increased with increases of approximately 2 93 40 53 21 69 and 72 67 for the f1 f5 f10 and f15 treatments respectively compared to the f0 treatment these results were consistent with wang et al 2020a who confirmed that freeze thaw effects increased the porosity of saline soil investigated by scanning electron microscopy with 2000 magnification fig 2 depicts 3d renderings of different samples taken from successive freeze thaw treatments pore size distribution as an important pore parameter related to soil strength and detachment rate under concentrated runoff can be affected by the arrangement of soil aggregates and particles under freeze thaw effects as shown in table 1 with the rising freeze thaw cycles the 100 μm porosity in the f1 treatment had the same value as the f0 treatment then showed an increasing trend with fluctuation with increases of approximately 44 89 25 89 and 86 23 in the f5 f10 and f15 treatments respectively relative to the f0 treatment the 100 500 μm porosity gradually increased during five freeze thaw cycles with the maximum value at the f5 treatment then decreased from f5 to f15 the 500 μm porosity had increased by 4 78 in f1 18 99 in f5 31 79 in f10 and 51 37 in f15 respectively relative to the f0 treatment the 500 μm porosity showed a similar trend as the total imaged porosity and accounted for 66 56 to 73 48 of the total imaged porosity during freeze thaw cycles changes in pore diameter distributions were dynamic pores with smaller diameters gradually developed and interconnected to form pores with larger diameters accompanied by the breakdown of pores with larger diameters similar results were summarized by yan et al 2017 who reported that parts of smaller pores developed into larger pores increasing the porosity of large pores under freeze thaw cycles to evaluate the relationships between soil pore characteristics the correlation coefficients were listed in table 2 a high correlation coefficient between the total imaged porosity and 500 μm porosity indicated that the increase in pores with larger pore equivalent diameters contributed more to the increase in the total imaged porosity under freeze thaw effects table 2 combined with the observations from fig 2 it can be deduced that small pores gradually appeared then these pores interconnected with other pores to form large pores with the increasing numbers of freeze thaw cycles with the gradual freezing of soils the phase transition within pores from liquid water to ice crystals increased its volume leading to enlarge micro fissures and gaps by extrusion deformation and cracking of soil materials ma et al 2021 then when ice crystals gradually melted the contractive volume of soil materials becomes insufficient to counteract the expansion caused by the growth of ice crystals wilen and dash 1995 rempel 2010 zhang et al 2016 liu et al 2021b on account of the alternating expansions and contractions of pore volume caused by the alternating transition between liquid phase and solid phase with the increasing number of freeze thaw cycles small and isolated pores appeared including the expansion of pores less than the resolution into those pores greater than resolution and the disconnection of large pores into multiple smaller pores and gradually developed to connect with other pores to form large pores with larger pore diameters these processes during freeze thaw cycles would facilitate the increases in porosity and number of pores pore shape is also a key parameter that affects soil aggregate stability and strength thereby influencing detachment rates of soils ma et al 2015 ma et al 2021 munkholm et al 2016 the elongated pore porosity first decreased by 13 34 in the f1 treatment and then gradually increased with increases of approximately 9 29 27 55 and 88 3 in the f5 f10 and f15 treatments respectively relative to the f0 treatment table 1 freeze thaw effects changed the initial cementing state between soil particles and aggregates then caused parts of elongated pores to disconnect into irregular pores increasing the porosity of irregular pores under the first freeze thaw cycles chen et al 2016 starkloff et al 2017 the irregular pore porosity and regular pore porosity were positively correlated with the 100 500 μm porosity table 2 and displayed a similar trend as the 100 500 μm porosity these indicated that the shapes of most pores with 100 500 μm diameter were irregular or regular the irregular pore porosity gradually increased with increases of approximately 31 4 37 9 29 37 and 27 06 in the f1 f5 f10 and f15 treatments respectively relative to the f0 treatment and the regular pore porosity increased by 14 45 25 58 23 17 and 13 73 in the f1 f5 f10 and f15 treatments respectively relative to the f0 treatment it is noteworthy that both the irregular pore porosity and regular pore porosity gradually increased and reached the maximum values at the f5 treatment then decreased with the increasing freeze thaw cycles it can be inferred that the cementation between soil particles and aggregates continuously receded due to the continual volumetric expansion of the water phase transition with the rise of freeze thaw cycles xu et al 2018a xu et al 2018b then a large part of irregular and regular pores was transformed into elongated pores under higher frequencies of freeze thaw cycles e g f10 and f15 these findings are supported by liu et al 2021a who reported that the porosity of irregular pores showed a trend that first increased and then decreased with the increasing freeze thaw cycles reaching the maximum values at 5 freeze thaw cycles because of the important relationship with soil properties such as friability erodibility and infiltrability the characteristics of pore network structure such as branching fractal dimension and connectivity under freeze thaw effects were quantitatively described peth et al 2008 munkholm et al 2012 sun et al 2021 relative to the f0 treatment in the f1 f5 f10 and f15 treatments respectively the length density has approximately increased by 7 13 43 28 30 89 and 103 98 table 1 on the basis of the higher correlation coefficients listed in table 2 the length density was more sensitive to the elongated pore porosity suggesting that the pores with elongated shapes had more branches ice lenses in frozen soils grow in branching with network shapes and the growth extruded soil which would increase the length density of the pore network torrance et al 2008 in comparison zhao et al 2021 found that the length density in the pore network of alpine meadows soil investigated by x ray computed tomography first decreased under three cycles of freeze thaw and then increased under six cycles of freeze thaw this may be because lower numbers of freeze thaw cycles facilitated the formations of smaller pores but the ct scanner cannot resolve these pores due to the lower resolution relative to the f0 treatment the fractal dimension increased with increases of approximately 1 06 2 71 2 24 and 3 71 in the f1 f5 f10 and f15 treatments respectively similar phenomena were reported by xu et al 2019 and liu et al 2021a in which the fractal dimension of pore network structure was enhanced due to freeze thaw effects the fractal dimension exhibited the highest correlation coefficient with the 100 μm porosity and regular pore porosity in characteristics of pore diameter distribution and pore shape respectively table 2 these indicated that the increasing the 100 μm porosity and regular pore porosity induced by freeze thaw effects may facilitate pore network structure more convoluted with increasing cyclic of freezing and thawing the connectivity density gradually increased and ranged from a minimum of 0 12 mm 3 to a maximum of 1 51 mm 3 indicating a more connective pore network structure ma et al 2021 using high resolution x ray computed tomography also suggested that continuous periodic freezing and thawing increased the connectivity of soil aggregates depending on the higher correlation coefficients the connectivity density showed more sensibility to the 500 μm porosity and elongated pore porosity in characteristics of pore diameter distribution and pore shape respectively table 2 demonstrating that the pores with great equivalent diameters and elongated shapes contributed more the connectivity of pore network based on the findings of rooney et al 2022 deformation within the first five freeze thaw cycles would decrease the pore network of resiliency to subsequent deformation thus increasing susceptibility of the pore network to disconnect combined with the observation results of 3d images fig 2 an increasing length density fractal dimension and connectivity density induced by freeze thaw effects signified a more complex branching and connected pore networks munkholm et al 2012 3 2 soil strength under freeze thaw effects and relationships between soil strength and pore structure characteristics soil strength has been recognized as an important parameter characterizing the resistance of soil erosion relating to pore structure characteristics cruse and larson 1977 ma et al 2015 the soil strength significantly decreased with the rising freeze thaw cycles p 0 05 relative to the f0 treatment the freeze thaw treatments caused significant decreases in the soil strength with decreases of approximately 12 75 39 43 42 99 and 59 58 in the f1 f5 f10 and f15 treatments respectively fig 3 similar results were stated by sun et al 2020 who suggested that freeze thaw effects significantly decreased soil strength to understand the relationships between pore structure characteristics and soil strength pearson correlation was performed among 11 soil structure parameters total imaged porosity total number of pores 100 μm porosity 100 500 μm porosity 500 μm porosity elongated pore porosity irregular pore porosity regular pore porosity length density fractal dimension and connectivity density and soil strength table 3 most correlations between pore structure characteristics and soil strength were significant p 0 05 or 0 01 after cyclic freeze thaw effects the growth and formation of ice crystals caused the expansion and appearance of pores 25 μm resolution increasing porosity then potential cracks and fissures induced by cyclic freeze thaw effects would be developed with the generated a number of fine pores xu et al 2018a xu et al 2018b in addition the soil strength was significantly negatively correlated with the length density fractal dimension and connectivity density table 3 this was because the branches and reconnections of ice lenses grew into network shapes and increased branch connectivity and complexity of pore structure resulting in structure fragment and a decrease in the soil strength these results indicated that changes in pore structure characteristics can change soil mechanical properties under freeze thaw effects these were consistent with the consequences suggested by li et al 2020 the stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed to further explore the relationships among pore structure characteristics and soil strength and the regression model was expressed as followed 4 ss 320 99 34 91 tip 2724 06 ep r2 0 767 p 0 05 where ss tip and ep are soil strength kpa total imaged porosity and elongated pore porosity the stepwise multiple regression excluded numerous pore structure characteristics such as the total number of pores pore diameter distribution length density fractal dimension and connectivity density the new equation suggested that the variation of soil strength can be better explained by the total imaged porosity and elongated pore porosity than other pore structure characteristics according to high coefficients of determination this regression model reveals the change processes of soil strength following freeze thaw effects from the perspective of pore structure while providing an empirical relationship for further predictions of how freeze thaw effects would influence the physical properties and snowmelt erosion processes as a key internal factor related to soil strength soil cohesion reflects various physical and chemical forces between soil particles which is determined by the distance between soil particles wei et al 2018 wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020c also reported that cohesion of chinese mollisol decreased with the increasing number of freeze thaw cycles reaching the minimum values at the 13 cycles in this study we also found that the total imaged porosity and elongated pore porosity were significantly correlated with the 500 μm porosity table 2 indicating that the total imaged porosity and elongated pore porosity increased as the number of large pores increased during freezing and thawing processes the increase in porosity with large equivalent diameters enlarged the distance distribution between soil particles and aggregates decreasing in soil cohesion ni and shi 2014 chen et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 with the size of pores in soils increasing larger aggregates gradually fragmented into smaller aggregates and irreversible deformations were generated which continually diminished the friction and cementation between soil particles wang et al 2020a yan et al 2017 these reasons can result in a decline in the soil strength under freeze thaw effects to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of the above pore structure characteristics the total imaged porosity and elongated pore porosity on the soil strength the results of path analyses were listed in table 4 as reflected by the absolute value of direct path coefficients the direct impacts of included pore structure characteristics on the soil strength were in the order total imaged porosity elongated pore porosity the elongated pore porosity can indirectly affect the total imaged porosity according to the indirect path coefficient thus exhibiting negative effects on the soil strength similarly munkholm et al 2002 demonstrated that the tensile strength of soil cores was inversely related to the macroporosity but the soil fragility was positively related to the connectivity of pore space and the authors also suggested that long straight pores and fractures where crack propagation probably would begin to a large extent resulted in higher connectivity of pore space as reflected by a higher correlation coefficient between the elongated pore porosity and connectivity density table 2 and the total imaged porosity and elongated pore porosity were significantly correlated with the length density and connectivity density indicating the formation and development of elongated pores under freeze thaw effects can increase the branch and connectivity of the pore network accordingly frequent freeze thaw cycles would generate numerous pores and fissures between soil particles and aggregates then increase the degree of fragmentation weakening the cementation between soil particles wang et al 2020a these implies that there is a high possibility of crack extension and interaction with the volume 9 larger after water freezing the expansive force would destroy the original linkage state among soil particles and aggregates and the irregular boundaries of soil particles and aggregates would collapse resulting in an increase in elongated pores of soil yan et al 2017 moreover the porosity with 100 μm in equivalent diameter was one of the predominant drivers controlling the tensile strength of soils those pores and cracks would pose a rising risk of propagating cracks regardless of the direction of the applied stress munkholm et al 2012 ma et al 2015 and the elongated pore porosity exhibited a significant correlation with the 500 μm porosity indicating that the elongated pores were with larger diameters table 2 ma et al 2021 reported that elongated porosity was significantly and negatively related to the mean weight diameter an index of the distribution and stability of soil aggregates these indicated that the increase in elongated porosity and porosity with large size under frequent freeze thaw cycles can separate internal soil particles within aggregates and weaken breaking down internal structure and decreasing soil strength munkholm et al 2002 because the larger the size of pores the larger the distance and the less the bonding force between soil particles thereby diminishing soil strength wang et al 2020a from the above findings these results suggested that freeze thaw effects resulted in a pore network structure of soils with increasing porosity elongated pore shapes and well connected decreasing the soil strength 3 3 soil detachment rate under freeze thaw effects and the relationships between detachment rate and soil strength the detachment rate of soil can reflect the soil erodibility under snowmelt runoff and rainfall during the spring snowmelt period as displayed in fig 4 the detachment rate significantly increased with the rising freeze thaw cycles p 0 05 specifically the detachment rate increased with increases of approximately 5 88 40 1 40 63 and 124 63 in the f1 f5 f10 and f15 treatments respectively compared with the f0 treatment these were in accordance with the consequences of liu et al 2017 who found that freeze thaw effects can intensify the detachment capacity of typical black soil by simulating runoff flow soil detachment capacity that is driven by concentrated runoff is tightly related to soil properties such as soil strength while dynamic processes of soil properties induced by freeze thaw effects can be put down to changes in soil pore structure liu et al 2023 revealed that the changes in pore structure characteristics particularly the increase in total imaged porosity branches and connectivity induced by freeze thaw effects can facilitate the fragmentation and rearrangement of soil aggregates by weakening cementation and loosening skeleton as aggregates were susceptible to be fragmented under freeze thaw effects soil mass generally loosened which reduced soil cohesion by weakening the friction and cementation between soil particles and aggregates these results indicate that freeze thaw effects changed soil structure influencing soil properties thus made soil mass less resistant to detachment by flowing runoff wang et al 2018 revealed that soil detachment rate decreased exponentially with a decrease in soil cohesion which is a key internal factor related to soil strength meanwhile sun et al 2020 found that the erodibility of rills was negatively correlated with soil strength therefore it is a feasible way to estimate the detachment rate by using the soil strength the best predicting equation between the detachment rate d r and soil strength s s was a power function r2 0 585 p 0 05 fig 5 from the preceding analysis it can be inferred that the changes in pore network structure induced by freeze thaw effects decreased cohesive forces between aggregates and soil particles and weakened soil skeleton thus resulting in the decrease in soil strength then increased the detachment rate the results of this study indicated that the detachment rate was closely related to the soil strength which was affected by soil pore structure characteristics total imaged porosity and elongated pore porosity seasonal freeze thaw cycles can provide effective material sources by changing the structure of surface soil knapen et al 2007a in mollisol region freeze thaw effects increase the detachment capacity of soil and surface soil can be detached by snowmelt runoff thus resulting in intensive soil erosion during the spring snowmelt period wang et al 2021 this study identified the effects of freeze thaw cycles on the parameters of pore structure characteristics and investigated the effects of them on soil strength thus explored the mechanisms of the effects of soil strength on soil erodibility from the scopes of microstructure under freeze thaw effects during the spring snowmelt period the existence of unmelted sublayers impeding water infiltration and the changes in soil water retention capacity induced by freeze thaw effects would result in an increase in snowmelt runoff and subsurface flow in the thawed layer increasing detachment rates and causing severe soil erosion fan and cai 2003 henry 2007 iwata et al 2010 barnes et al 2016 liu et al 2021b to explore how pore structure of various soil densities changes under freeze thaw effects a further set of experiments should be conducted using soil samples with various densities collected from the field since the equivalent diameter used in this study is not the actual diameter further investigations would apply the local thickness method to calculate the representative diameter the largest sphere fitting inside pore in the soil pore network and thus explore their change processes and their impacts on soil properties during freeze thaw effects 4 conclusions detailed changes in pore structure characteristics of mollisol subject to freeze thaw cycles were quantified by x ray computed tomography the effects of changes in pore structure characteristics on changes in soil strength following various freeze thaw cycles were evaluated using path analyses the results indicated that the decrease in soil strength was closely relative to the evolution of pore structure under freeze thaw cycles including the increases in total imaged porosity and elongated pores porosity a multiple regression model of equation 4 including total imaged porosity and elongated pores porosity was obtained for estimating soil strength results of laboratory experiments on soil strength and detachment under freeze thaw effects for disturbed mollisol surfaces showed that freeze thaw effects significantly decreased soil strength and increased detachment rate p 0 05 a power relationship between soil strength and detachment rate was observed for different freeze thaw treatments p 0 05 our findings indicate that soil with pore network containing large porosity and elongated pore shapes following freeze thaw effects would aggravate soil detachment capacity under concentrated flow by decreasing soil strength this study simply provided knowledge of the mechanisms of the effects of changes in pore structure characteristics during the seasonal freezing thawing period on soil detachment rate improving the understanding of the occurrences and progression of snowmelt erosion of mollisol in northeast china in consideration of difference of the microstructure of intact and repacked soil samples follow up similar experiments would be conducted

ctrw models the results revealed that all measured btcs exhibited the characteristics of early arrival and late time tailing however stronger non fickian characteristics were observed as bw increased in content indicating that bw influenced the non fickian transport of the solute the optimised immobile water fraction of the mim model consistently increased with increasing estimated bw fraction moreover the coefficient of mass transfer rate α of mim decreased as bw increased meaning that the solute exchange between the mobile and immobile fluids became slower and consequently yielded strongly tailed btcs from the ctrw model the solute transport velocity v ctrw increased with increasing bw leading to a reduction in the breakthrough time of the solute an increase in bw yielded a decreasing power law exponent β ctrw of the ctrw model implying an enhancement of the non fickian transport characteristics furthermore the porous media with b w 16 4 showed moderately non fickian solute transport whereas those with b w 16 4 exhibited highly non fickian solute transport keywords bound water mixed porous media nuclear magnetic resonance solute transport non fickian transport data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction solute transport in saturated porous media normally follows a non fickian behaviour which is marked by early breakthrough and long tailed breakthrough curves btcs dou and zhou 2015 kwaw et al 2021 levy and berkowitz 2003 major et al 2011 the non fickian transport behaviour is partly due to the physically heterogeneous nature of saturated porous media at a pore scale berkowitz 2021 liu et al 2017 at this scale some of the water in the pore spaces are free to move whereas others are bound van genuchten and wierenga 1976 during solute transport the bound water serves as a secondary source of contamination where a portion of the solute is trapped in the bound water and gradually released into the movable water zone at later times berkowitz 2021 in groundwater remediation the secondary source of contamination induced by the presence of bound water is a problem since it delays the remediation process therefore quantitatively characterising bound water in different saturated porous media and assessing its impact on the degree of non fickian transport is important quantifying the physical non equilibrium processes responsible for non fickian transport behaviour particularly long tailing is often done using mathematical models such as continuous time random walk ctrw and mobile immobile mim model laboratory studies have shown that ctrw is robust in quantifying long tailed btcs gao et al 2009 kwaw et al 2021 levy and berkowitz 2003 liu et al 2017 zaheer et al 2017 however ctrw does not quantify both bound water and the mass transfer rate between free water and bound water to provide such information mim has been successfully used to quantify both bound water and mass transfer rate gao et al 2009 kwaw et al 2021 zaheer et al 2017 although solute transport models have been successful in quantifying non fickian characteristics the best fit bound water free water and mass transfer parameters need experimental corroboration to enhance our understanding of non fickian transport in saturated porous media to strengthen the physical meaning of the best fit parameters of mim swanson et al 2012 used bulk direct current electrical conductivity and fluid conductivity measurements low field nuclear magnetic resonance lf nmr measurements and the mim model to study solute transport in packed quartz sand and zeolite the hysteresis between bulk electrical conductivity and fluid conductivity provided evidence of minimal solute exchange in quartz sand and greater solute exchange in zeolite explaining the relatively long tailed btc for zeolite the authors also indicated that the lf nmr estimates for bound water and free water matched those of the mim model suggesting that the lf nmr technology and the mim model can be used to understand physical non equilibrium processes responsible for non fickian transport especially long tailing behaviour the authors findings are interesting however their work is limited purely quartz sand and zeolites were used as porous media in subsurface environments pure mineral composed sediments are not commonly present in such environments a mixture of different minerals occurs including quartz sand clay and non clay minerals wilson and pittma 1977 moreover the authors used 33 ms a proposed transverse relaxation time t 2 cut off used for sandstones coates et al 1999 to estimate bound water and free water even though they explained that the selected t 2 cut off matched the estimated effective pore diameter because different saturated porous media have different pore size distributions using one t 2 cut off for different porous media is questionable nmr t 2 cut off is often found by centrifuging saturated porous media to drain free water hu et al 2020 lai et al 2018 however centrifuging low strength porous media which sand clay mixtures packed in polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe columns are an example may destroy the pore structure because of the rotational speed testamanti and rezaee 2017 yuan et al 2018 yuan and rezaee 2019 to preserve the pore structures of sand clay mixtures lu et al 2020 used an oven drying approach to determine t 2 cut off by removing the free water at 40 c however removing free water at 40 c is time consuming therefore using the oven drying approach by testamanti and rezaee 2017 which uses a wide range of temperatures to desaturate porous media is important to address the limitations in the previous studies and further enhance our understanding on bound water influence on non fickian solute transport in saturated porous media this study set three objectives first this study used the lf nmr technology to establish t 2 cut offs and quantitatively characterise bound water and its spatial distribution in saturated mixed porous media whose mineral compositions comprised quartz sand calcite kaolinite and illite powders with different contents second conducted solute transport experiments in the mixed porous media and modelled the experimental data with ade mim and ctrw third assessed how the bound water resulting from increasing content of calcite kaolinite and illite powders influenced the non fickian transport of the solute note that the mixed porous media means homogenous mixtures of quartz sand and one powdered mineral two sets of porous media were prepared the first set of porous media was used for the lf nmr measurements to quantitatively characterise bound water and its spatial distribution the second set of porous media was used for the bench experiment of solute transport note that the fickian based ade model was used as a basis for comparison with the mim and ctrw models our study showed that different porous media have different t 2 cut offs and using a single t 2 cut off i e 33 ms to quantify bound water in different porous media as observed in previous studies may yield significant errors moreover compared to previous studies this study has provided more insights into the effect of bound water on non fickian solute transport in porous media whose mineral compositions are similar to what is observed in subsurface environments 2 nmr theory there exist several spinning hydrogen nuclei in water saturated porous media whose spin axes are randomly oriented when there is no external static magnetic field smf in the presence of smf the hydrogen nuclei in the water are polarised yielding nuclear magnetisation when a radio frequency rf pulse is applied perpendicular to smf the polarised nuclei are tipped 90 away from their original equilibrium site generating temporary nuclear magnetisation in the transverse plane when the rf pulse is later withdrawn there are decay to zero of nuclear magnetisation perpendicular to smf and recovery of nuclear magnetisation to its original equilibrium state the recovery and decaying of nuclear magnetisation are respectively characterised by longitudinal relaxation time t 1 and transverse relaxation time t 2 in this study only t 2 was used since it is faster to measure than t 1 the rate of t 2 relaxation is given as coates et al 1999 zhang et al 2018 1 1 t 2 1 t 2 b k 1 t 2 s f c 1 t 2 d i f where t 2 b k is t 2 relaxation time of the bulk fluid t 2 s f c is t 2 relaxation time at the grain surface t 2 d i f is t 2 relaxation time due to a diffusion mechanism induced by magnetic field gradients for water saturated porous media the relaxation of bulk water which signifies an exchange of energy among the hydrogen nuclei in water is small hence its effect can be neglected coates et al 1999 moreover when a low magnetic field is used coupled with a short pulse spacing the contribution of diffusion relaxation can be neglected keating et al 2020 kleinberg et al 1993b kleinberg et al 1993a thus the relaxation of pore fluid on the surfaces of the grains becomes the main mechanism in t 2 as shown in eq 2 2 1 t 2 1 t 2 s f c ρ 2 s v where ρ 2 is the transverse surface relaxivity which is dependent on pore surface mineralogy s and v respectively define pore surface area and pore volume the different t 2 relaxation times reflect the distribution of water filled pores in porous media in nmr measurement a pore space model is used to convert relaxation time to pore space for planar cylindrical and spherical pores the ratio of pore surface area to pore volume s v is equivalent to 1 r 2 r and 3 r respectively where r is the pore radius dou et al 2022 liu et al 2021 in this study the pores were assumed to be spherical and the relationship between t 2 and pore radius r becomes 3 1 t 2 ρ 2 3 r 3 materials and methods 3 1 experimental setup and materials fig 1 a b shows the experimental setup used in this study a is the lf nmr which will be simply called nmr thereafter system and b is the solute transport setup the nmr instrument was macromr12 150h i suzhou niumay analytical instrument china with a magnetic field strength of 0 3 t the solute transport setup comprised deionised di water a nacl tracer a tyd02 01 model syringe pump with an infusion rate ranging from 0 184 to 173 718 ml min control valves fluorinated ethylene propylene fep connecting tubes 2 65 mm internal diameter a ptfe column an effluent container and an electrical conductivity meter the ptfe column was 100 mm in length with an external diameter and thickness of 50 mm and 12 5 mm respectively inside the ptfe column was a 60 mm length 25 mm diameter porous medium to prevent the quartz sand and powdered minerals from flowing out the ends of the ptfe column were sealed with a 500 mesh nylon filter two sets of porous media were prepared with each set comprising 10 different porous media out of the 10 porous media in each set 9 were mixed porous media and the remaining 1 was mainly quartz sand as shown in table 1 it is important to mention that the two sets of porous media were prepared following the same procedure to achieve the same bulk densities one set was used for the nmr measurements and the other set for the bench solute transport experiments to achieve a uniform size of the coarse grain content the quartz sand purchased from henan bairun casting material co ltd china was sieved with a standard set of sieves gb t6003 1 2012 shaoxing shangyu huafeng hardware instrument co ltd china the quartz sand particles retained on the 30 mesh sieve whose aperture was 0 6 mm were used the calcite mineral was purchased from henan hongshu environmental protection material co ltd and the kaolinite and illite minerals were purchased from lingshou dehang mineral products co ltd all in china note that the calcite kaolinite and illite had the same particle size of 325 mesh 45 µm the reason was to control the particle sizes of the powdered minerals in the mixed porous media for comparison the chemical compositions of the powdered minerals were analysed with an x ray fluorescence xrf instrument panaco epsilon 3 model and the results are presented in table 2 fig 2 a c shows the x ray diffraction xrd results obtained from a dx 2700 x ray diffractometer dandong fangyuan instrument co ltd china and analysed with jade 6 software high resolution scanning electron microscopy sem images obtained from a hitachi s 4800 instrument were used to understand the microstructural characteristics of the powdered minerals calcite showed a rhombohedral morphology fig s1 a d kaolinite showed typical dense stacking plates booklet morphology fig s2 a d whilst illite displayed flat lying platy crystals fig s3 a d the sodium chloride nacl used for the solute transport experiments was purchased from tianjin beichen fangzheng regent factory china 3 2 sample preparation prior to the experiments the quartz sand was washed with di water purposely to remove any impurities on the surface and dried in an oven for 24 hr at 105 c known masses of the dried quartz sand and powdered minerals were measured and mixed thoroughly in a dried glass beaker a wet filling approach where water is first poured into a sample column followed by solid grains was used the ptfe column was held in a vertical position and small quantities of the mixtures were poured gradually through the di water stirred and pressed firmly with a clean glass rod purposely to eliminate any layers and also to obtain dense uniform porous media the di water was always above the mixtures and the reason was to prevent air entrapment in the packed porous media since the density of a packed porous medium has a considerable effect on porosity permeability and solute transport characteristics the masses and the lengths of the packed porous media were the same the porosities of the porous media summarised in table 3 were computed using a weighing method the weight of water resulting from the difference between the weights of the fully saturated porous media and the dry mixtures was converted to pore volume using the density of water ρ 0 997 g cm3 at 25 c 3 3 nmr measurements for the nmr measurements the free induction decay fid sequence was always used to set the macromr12 150h i instrument the t 2 relaxation times of the hydrogen nuclei in the water filled pores of the porous media were subsequently obtained using the carr purcell meiboom gill cpmg pulse sequence comprising a single 90 rf pulse and a series of 180 rf pulses carr and purcell 1954 meiboom and gill 1958 table 4 shows the parameters set for the cpmg pulse sequence for a stable magnetic field the temperature of the nmr magnet was always kept at 32 c two nmr measurements were performed first the t 2 spectra of the fully water saturated porous media were obtained to determine the distribution of pore sizes in the porous media second the same fully water saturated porous media were desaturated in an oven at a temperature range of 50 110 c testamanti and rezaee 2017 and measured their corresponding t 2 spectra at each temperature the porous media were heated for 4 hr and increased the temperature at an interval of 10 c for consistency the oven dried porous media were cooled to 32 c before measuring their t 2 spectra to verify the reproducibility of the nmr data the ptfe columns were emptied cleaned and refilled with the same mixtures and measured the t 2 spectra again when the t 2 spectra were compared there was no difference signifying good data reproducibility as shown in fig s4 and fig s5 3 4 solute transport experiments a solute is often entrapped in the lower section of a vertically oriented porous medium hence influencing the transport pattern of the solute for this reason the filled ptfe columns were laid horizontally and connected to two syringes of di water and nacl solution mounted on a tyd02 01 pump using fep tubes and control valves as shown in fig 1 b before the nacl tracer was injected 144 ml 12 pore volumes pv of di water was pumped through the porous media to achieve a steady flow 36 ml 3 pv of nacl solution whose concentration c 0 was 5 g l was injected into the porous media and subsequently flushed with 72 ml 6 pv of di water both the injection and flushing were controlled by the syringe pump at a constant flow rate of 0 2 ml min at 25 c at the outlet of the ptfe column 1 8 ml effluents were collected in 10 ml sized tubes over the entire experimental duration a portable electrical conductivity meter dzs 708l and djs 1 l inesa scientific instrument co ltd shanghai was employed to measure the electrical conductivity ec of the effluents to minimise errors in measuring ec the conductivity meter was rinsed with di water and wiped with a clean tissue before and after each conductivity measurement the ec values were then converted to concentrations c using the calibration curve of ec 1661 6 c 2 with a coefficient of determination r 2 equal to 0 999 the concentrations c of the effluents were normalised as c c 0 to generate the btcs to verify the reproducibility of data the ptfe columns were emptied cleaned and refilled for new solute transport experiments the btcs followed the same pattern as shown in fig s6 and fig s7 3 5 inverse models for solute transport 3 5 1 ade model the one dimensional ade for a solute is given as toride et al 2003 4 c t d x 2 c x 2 v c x where c is the solute concentration ml 3 v is the average pore water velocity lt 1 and d x is dispersion coefficient in the direction of flow l 2 t 1 t is time t and x is a distance l 3 5 2 mim model the mim model adopts two fluid zones mobile and immobile to describe solute transport in porous media the accumulation of solute in the immobile fluid zone and subsequent slow release from the zone are assumed to be driven by a single rate diffusion mechanism toride et al 1995 van genuchten and wierenga 1976 for a nonreactive solute the one dimensional transport is given as 5 θ m c m t θ im c im t θ m d m 2 c m x 2 θ m v m c m x 6 α c m c im θ im c im t where θ m and θ im are fluids in the mobile and immobile zones respectively c m and c im are the concentrations of solute in the mobile and immobile zones respectively v m is average flow velocity d m is dispersion coefficient and α is the first order solute mass exchange rate between the mobile and immobile fluid zones t 1 the fraction of mobile fluid β is given as β θ m θ m θ im 3 5 3 ctrw model the ctrw framework whose governing equation is centred on the fokker planck with a memory equation fpme is extensively used to describe solute transport in subsurface formations in the laplace space the one dimensional form of the fpme for a uniform system is given as cortis and berkowitz 2005 7 k c x k c 0 x m k v ψ x c x k d ψ 2 x 2 c x k where k defines the laplace variable c x k is laplace transformed ensemble average normalised concentration c 0 is the initial concentration x denotes the location in space v ψ and d ψ are transport velocity and generalised dispersion coefficient respectively and m k is the memory function which defines the non fickian transport behaviour induced by inherent heterogeneities occurring at all scales the memory function m k is expressed as 8 m k t k ψ k 1 ψ k where t is the characteristic time the memory function m k was defined using the widely used truncated power law tpl model berkowitz et al 2006 dentz et al 2004 9 ψ k 1 τ 2 k t 1 β exp t 1 k γ β τ 2 1 t 1 k γ β τ 2 1 where τ2 t2 t1 t1 is the start time for the power law behaviour t 2 is the upper threshold time that defines fickian transport г is an incomplete gamma function β denotes a constant exponent which defines solute transport behaviour the solute transport becomes highly non fickian when 0 β 1 and moderately non fickian when 1 β 2 for β 2 the solute transport is now fickian for t t 1 in this case the cut off time t 2 becomes irrelevant in the transport process 3 6 inversion of ade mim and ctrw models the solute transport parameters were estimated from the measured btcs through the inversion of ade mim models from cxtfit 2 0 software toride et al 1995 and ctrw model from ctrw matlab toolbox v 4 0 cortis et al 2020 the transport parameters obtained from the ade model served as the initial values for the ctrw model two metrics global error e j and determination coefficient r 2 were used to appraise the goodness of the fitted models 10 e j 1 n i 1 n c i nm c i sim 2 11 r 2 1 i 1 n c i nm c i sim 2 i 1 n c i nm c nm 2 where j represents ade mim or ctrw c i nm denotes the normalised measured concentrations c i sim represents the simulated concentrations c nm is the mean value of the normalised measured concentrations and n denotes the total number of normalised concentrations 4 results and discussion 4 1 t 2 spectra characteristics of water saturated porous media solute transport behaviour is sensitive to the distribution of water filled pores and how the pores are connected in space defining the velocity field of a porous medium for this reason the t 2 spectra of the porous media were measured since the amplitude of t 2 spectrum reveals the distribution of water filled pores in a porous medium for comparison the t 2 spectra were analysed based on different contents of the same powdered mineral mixed with quartz sand fig 3 a c and the same content of different powdered minerals mixed with quartz sand fig 3 d f the porous media with calcite kaolinite and illite unless otherwise stated will be respectively called q c q k and q i as evident in fig 3 a f the distributions of t 2 spanning from short to long relaxation times showed four distinct peaks p 1 p 2 p 3 and p 4 which ranged from 0 18 to 2086 7 ms p 1 and p 4 were common in all porous media however q k showed three peaks with p 2 and p 3 merged to form p 2 p 3 signifying good connectivity between p 2 and p 3 it must be mentioned that the characteristics of t 2 spectra i e the number size and location of t 2 spectrum peaks is important for realising the different forms of water filled pores and how they are connected overall q100 showed the highest p 4 and the lowest p 1 according to the theory of nmr t 2 relaxation times are comparable to the sizes of water filled pore spaces in water saturated porous media meaning that p 4 and p 3 correspond to large pores and p 1 and a portion of p 2 are related to small pores jin et al 2020 yao et al 2010 this analogy is based on the fact that hydrogen nuclei in large water filled pores take a longer time to relax than those in small water filled pores this suggests that large pores were well developed whereas small pores were less developed in q100 compared with q100 p 4 declined continuously whereas other peaks rose with increasing powdered mineral content 2 5 and 8 in q c q k and q i as shown in fig 3 a c this means that the powdered minerals filled portions of the large pores hence narrowing some of the large pores and increasing the number of small pores as evident in fig 3 d f p 4 in the t 2 spectra of q k and q i were lower than those in the t 2 spectra of q c implying that there were fewer large pores in q k and q i than in q c although the powdered mineral contents were the same this suggests that the kaolinite and illite particles interacted with the di water through the crystalline water adsorption process azari and leimkuhler 1990 aksu et al 2015 used x ray micro computed tomography µ ct to visualise the morphological alteration and extent of volume change and swelling of kaolinite in unconsolidated porous media before and after water saturation compared with the dry state of the porous media the authors observed some level of swelling of kaolinite in the water saturated porous media weaver 1965 used relative intensity measurements to investigate potassium content in 249 illite samples and reported that k2o content 9 10 had weakly bonded illite like layers or expandable layers supporting what was earlier proposed by mehra and jackson 1959 that there must be expandable layers in illite whose k2o content is lower than 10 moreover the authors findings support what was reported by dodd 1954 and hayatdavoudi 1999 that clay minerals swell to some extent when they come in contact with water with the degree of swelling depending on the chemical compositions of the clay minerals the k2o content of illite used in this study was 5 27 table 2 which is less than the 10 reported by the above authors hence ascribing the cause of the less large pores and more small pores in q k and q i to swelling is reasonable in this study comparing q k and q i as evident in fig 3 d f p 4 in the t 2 spectra of q i were higher than those in the t 2 spectra of q k suggesting relatively more large pores in q i it is documented that kaolinite particles stay within pores civan 2016 whereas that of illite are often attached to the walls of pores zhao et al 2020 accounting for the differences in p 4 additionally the t 2 spectra of q i especially q95 i5 and q92 i8 shifted somewhat to shorter relaxation times than those of q95 k5 and q92 k8 implying that smaller water filled pores occurred in q i than in q k here the difference could be due to the large amounts of hydrated cations na mg2 and ca2 present in the illite mineral 4 2 t 2 spectra of oven dried porous media and free water and bound water discrimination fig 4 a d and fig 5 a f show the t 2 spectra of water saturated porous media heated at different temperatures purposely to partition the t 2 distributions into free water and bound water as the temperature increased the peaks declined in all porous media with peak p 4 falling rapidly followed by p 3 this suggests that the water in the large pores was mobile and could easily be removed whereas those in the small pores p 1 and portion of p 2 were irreducible and could not easily be removed q100 showed very weak signal amplitude at 100 c and this was due to more large pores whose water content was easily removed at water boiling temperature leaving the irreducible water contained in the small pores the small pores in q100 were few explaining the observed weak signal amplitude compared with q100 the 2 powdered minerals in q98 c2 q98 k2 and q98 i2 respectively increased the small pores and more water was captured in such pore spaces the relatively large signal amplitudes shown by both q98 k2 and q98 i2 even at 110 c were due to their intrinsic water adsorption behaviour which formed nanometre sized hydrate films osipov 2012 increasing the powdered mineral content from 2 to 5 and then to 8 further increased the bound water content at 110 c the t 2 spectra shifted towards the left i e shorter relaxation times implying that while the surface areas of the pores remained constant the amount of water in the pores reduced and the hydrogen nuclei relaxed faster during heating the t 2 distribution curves kept changing until a point was reached where further heating did not yield much difference in the t 2 distribution curves especially the last three t 2 distribution curves as shown in fig s8 b d and fig s9 a f moreover the peaks of the last three t 2 distribution curves centred on the same transverse relaxation time which is consistent with what was reported by testamanti and rezaee 2017 who used increasing temperatures to determine nmr t 2 cut offs for bound water the last three t 2 distribution curves which did not change much upon further heating signified bound water whose contents in the porous media were computed using t 2 thresholds fig 6 a d and fig 7 a f show the t 2 thresholds t 2 c for determining the free water and bound water in the porous media the t 2 c values were computed following three procedures which are widely used to discriminate between free water and bound water when a centrifuging method or an oven drying approach is used to desaturate porous media coates et al 1999 hu et al 2020 lu et al 2020 testamanti and rezaee 2017 yuan et al 2018 yuan and rezaee 2019 first the t 2 distributions at the fully water saturated state and irreducible water state were considered second these t 2 spectra were converted to cumulative t 2 spectra with the maximum signal amplitudes at a fully water saturated state and irreducible water state being the porous medium s total porosity and bound water respectively as reported by coates et al 1999 third horizontal projection from the cumulative t 2 spectra at an irreducible water state to meet the cumulative t 2 spectra at a fully water saturated state and subsequent downward projection from the intersected point to the t 2 relaxation time axis the division of t 2 spectra into free water and bound water assumes that short t 2 relaxation times are associated with small pore water freedman 2006 the value of t 2 relaxation time is t 2c as shown in fig 6 a d and fig 7 a f the content of the quartz sand was large 90 yet the t 2c values differed from the 33 ms threshold proposed for sandstones coates et al 1999 the difference could be explained by distinct mineral composition texture pore wall chemistry pore sizes and pore throats it is important to note that using the proposed t 2c for sandstones to discriminate between free water and bound water in quartz sand dominated porous media would either underestimate or overestimate the contents of free water and bound water table 5 shows the estimated free water and bound water in the porous media using the computed t 2c as the content of powdered mineral increased the bound water also increased increasing the content of powdered minerals created more small pore spaces within which small amounts of water were trapped testamanti and rezaee 2017 discussed that water trapped in smaller pore spaces barely escapes even when porous media are heated at a temperature beyond 100 c the vapourised water condenses back to the liquid state as a result of cohesive attraction forces this explains why the bound water increased as the content of calcite a non clay mineral increased comparing the same powdered mineral content q k and q i showed larger bound water than q c explaining clay minerals capacity to hold substantial amounts of adsorbed water even when heated beyond 100 c hillel 2004 however q i had more bound water than q k the following were the reasons the layers of illite are held together by potassium ions precluding water from interacting with the layers however the occurrence of large amounts of hydrated cations na mg2 and ca2 in the illite table 2 coupled with its low k2o content 10 might have allowed water into the interlayers mehra and jackson 1959 weaver 1965 on the other hand the layers of kaolinite clay are held by a robust hydrogen bond which precludes water from coming between the layers and the water molecules adsorbed by the kaolinite were limited to its outer surface adams et al 2020 moreover comparing q k and q i the t 2 spectra of q i moved slightly to shorter relaxation times suggesting that smaller water filled pores existed in q i than in q k 4 3 influence of bound water on the measured btcs to understand the influence of bound water on the solute transport the measured btcs for variable contents of calcite kaolinite and illite were compared as shown in fig 8 a f all measured btcs showed distinct arrival times and late time tailings implying varying magnitudes of non fickian transport of solute in the porous media the difference in the non fickian characteristics was a result of microscale heterogeneities variable local advective velocities and solute retention and release caused by the variable bound water contents in the porous media the occurrence of early arrival and late time tailing characteristics in q100 which contained only quartz sand is consistent with the previous studies that non fickian behaviour characterises the transport of solute in uniformly packed porous media kwaw et al 2021 levy and berkowitz 2003 compared with the mixed porous media the solute arrival time was longer and the late time tailing was less heavy in q100 the longer arrival time of solute in q100 having a bound water content of 3 0 was due to weak preferential flow paths present on the other hand the less heavy late time tailing suggests that a small solute was trapped at an early time and slowly released at a late time by the small content of bound water even though not much difference was observed in the solute arrival times when 2 powdered minerals were mixed with the quartz sand the increased contents of bound water retained more solute than in q100 explaining the heavier late time tailings in q98 c2 q98 k2 and q98 i2 than in q100 fig 8 d f compared with the porous media with 2 powdered minerals the porous media with 5 powdered minerals showed stronger characteristics of arrival time and late time tailing this suggests that the larger bound water contents in the porous media with 5 powdered minerals caused more variations in the local advective velocity and formed stronger preferential flow paths along which portion of the solute advanced at a high velocity explaining the earlier solute arrival times in q95 c5 q95 k5 and q95 i5 compared with those in q98 c2 q98 k2 and q98 i2 the heavier late time tailings imply that more solute was retained by the larger contents of bound water in q95 c5 q95 k5 and q95 i5 even shorter arrival times and heavier late time tailings were observed in the porous media with 8 powdered minerals q92 c8 q92 k8 and q92 i8 the enlarged bound water in the porous media with 8 powdered minerals further enhanced the pore scale heterogeneity resulting more variable flow velocities and stronger preferential paths for flow as a result the early arrival time of solute in the porous media with 8 powdered minerals was shorter than those with 5 powdered minerals beyond 3 pv as shown in fig 8 a c the middle plateaus continued to rise for some time before declining despite the porous media being flushed with di water the variations in the length of concentration rise suggest variable amounts of solute in the porous media after the injection duration the longest length over the course of increased concentration was a result of the least advection mobile zone and vice versa the middle plateau depended on the advection dominated mobile zone which was influenced by the bound water another interesting observation was the effect of bound water on the maximum dimensionless concentration c c 0 m a x the c c 0 m a x for the porous media with 2 5 and 8 powdered minerals were respectively in the range of 94 6 95 7 90 4 95 6 and 86 6 92 5 implying that as bound water increased more solute particles were retained the retention of solute weakened the solute mixing process in the porous media the magnitude of the late time tailings depended on the rate at which the trapped solute diffused out of the immobile fluid zone into the mobile fluid zone when di water was injected to flush the solute in the porous media the heaviness of the late time tailings with respect to the mass exchange rate is discussed in detail in section 4 4 the results have shown that the variable contents of bound water in the porous media had a significant effect on the non fickian characteristics 4 4 analysis of solute transport models to understand the solute transport dynamics in the porous media the measured btcs were analysed and interpreted using the inverse models of ade mim and ctrw as shown in fig 9 a d and fig 10 a f the two metrics r 2 and e j which measured the goodness of the best fit solutions are presented in table 6 even though the ade model in most cases matched the arrival times it could not capture the peak concentrations and the late time tails of the btcs the fickian based ade model in most cases reached the dimensionless concentration c c 0 of 1 whereas the highest peak concentrations of the measured btcs ranged from 0 866 to 0 904 the ade model s relatively poor performance was affirmed by its lowest r 2 and highest e j values as shown in table 6 there exist flowing and immobile fluid zones in porous media and assuming that all pore fluids are movable which was the heart of ade formulation bear 1972 was the reason for the ade s relatively poor performance on the contrary the mim and ctrw models could match the measured btcs well especially the long concentration tailings considering their r 2 and e j values as presented in table 6 since the fickian based ade model could not properly match the asymptotically long transition time of solute emanating from the rate limited mass exchange between the mobile and immobile fluid zones the mim and ctrw models were used to analyse the non fickian solute transport for the mim model the optimised mobile fluid zone β mim and coefficient of mass transfer α parameters were analysed to understand the influence of bound water on the solute transport dynamics as shown in table 7 the values of β mim varied significantly an increase in bound water with increasing powdered mineral content resulted in a significant reduction in the mobile fluid fraction which was affirmed by the decreasing values of β mim the reduction in the values of β mim suggests that the areas of contact for solute exchange between the mobile and immobile fluids were weakened and this contributed significantly to the delay of solute mixing between the two fluids in the porous media the slower the solute mixing process the more strong were the solute arrival time and late time tailing characteristics even though the values of the optimised immobile water fraction of the mim model were larger than the estimated bound water fraction the cross plots of optimised immobile water fraction versus estimated bound water fraction showed a good positive linear relationship with r 2 ranging from 0 6596 to 0 906 fig 11 a b the mim model assumes complete solute mixing between the flowing and immobile fluid zones however failure to achieve complete solute mixing within the two fluid zones may lead to an overestimated immobile water fraction swanson et al 2012 this could be the reason for the relatively large optimised immobile water fraction observed in this study the exchange of solute between the mobile and immobile fluid zones in the porous media was analysed using the fitted coefficient of mass transfer rate α as shown in table 7 α varied significantly indicating that the bound water had a considerable effect on the solute exchange between the mobile fluid zone and immobile fluid zone with the exception of q95 c5 q98 k2 and q98 i2 α decreased with increasing bound water the reduction in the values of α suggests that as the bound water increased with increasing powdered mineral content the area of contact for the transfer of solute between the mobile and immobile fluid zones reduced and more time was required to achieve complete solute mixing in other words the rate of exchange of solute between the mobile and immobile fluid zones became slower with increasing bound water the slower solute mixing process was responsible for the enhanced late time tailing behaviour as the bound water increased in the porous media padilla et al 1999 the failure of q95 c5 q98 k2 and q98 i2 to follow the trend of decreasing α with increasing bound water could be explained by the poor fitted btcs by the mim model it must be mentioned that the combination of larger immobile water fraction lower solute exchange rate and strongly tailed btc has also been reported in other studies kuntz et al 2011 padilla et al 1999 the transport parameters of the ctrw model also provided important information concerning the magnitude of non fickian transport behaviour in the porous media the average water velocities computed from the flow data ranged from 0 099 to 0 113 cm min in the porous media as shown in table 7 the transport velocities of the solute v ctrw in the ctrw model were higher than the average water velocities except 0 097 cm min v ctrw in q100 the results agreed with the early arrival of solute i e appearing before 1 pv fig 8 a c this suggests stronger preferential pathways along which part of the solute advanced with high velocities the exception could be the poor fitting of the measured btc in q100 it was observed that the trend of decreasing arrival times of the measured btcs was consistent with increasing v ctrw values of the ctrw model which also agreed with increasing bound water content this suggests that as the bound water content increased not all fluid in the pore spaces participated in the flow process and the effective porosity for flow declined limited flow paths were available for the advective flux of the solute the limited flow paths caused the solute particles to move with greater velocities under the same injection rate of 0 2 ml min as evident in table 7 all β ctrw were less than 2 a threshold that defines the emergence of fickian behaviour the different values of β ctrw indicate different degrees of non fickian behaviour in all porous media the characterisation of non fickain transport in all porous media was based on two timescales t 1 and t 2 defined in the ctrw formulation as shown in table 7 the values of t 1 which initiated the power law behaviour were sufficiently low t 1 t moreover the values of t 2 were larger than the experimental durations t t 2 implying non fickian behaviour even at those longer times as evident in table 7 β ctrw decreased with increasing bound water signifying that as the bound water increased the characteristics of non fickian transport were enhanced some of the porous media for example q95 k5 q92 k8 q95 i5 and q92 i8 exhibited a highly non fickian behaviour 0 β c t r w 1 and this could be explained by their larger bound water b w 16 4 the other six porous media whose bound water contents were relatively small b w 16 4 showed a moderately non fickian behaviour 1 β ctrw 2 our modelling results have shown that the extent of non fickian characteristics was dependent on the bound water content in the mixed porous media 5 summary and conclusions this study investigated the influence of bound water on the characteristics of non fickian transport of solute in mixed porous media two sets of different porous media of quartz sand with variable contents of powdered minerals were prepared the first set of porous media was used for the nmr measurements to quantitatively characterise bound water and its spatial distribution the second set of porous media was used for the bench experiment of solute transport and the measured btcs were analysed using the inverse models of ade mim and ctrw based on the results the following conclusions were drawn all measured btcs exhibited the characteristics of early arrival and late time tailing however stronger non fickian characteristics were observed as the bound water increased in content signifying that the bound water influenced the non fickian transport of the solute the optimised immobile water fraction of the mim model consistently increased with increasing estimated bound water fraction the coefficient of mass transfer rate α of the mim model decreased in value with increasing bound water the reduction in α values implies that as the bound water increased in content the exchange of solute between the mobile and immobile fluids became slower and consequently yielded strongly tailed btcs from the ctrw model the solute transport velocity v ctrw increased with increasing bound water leading to a reduction in the breakthrough time of the solute the power law exponent β ctrw of the ctrw model decreased with increasing bound water indicating that the bound water enhanced the characteristics of non fickian transport furthermore the solute transport in the porous media with bound water 16 4 was moderately non fickian whereas that in the porous media with bound water greater or equal to 16 4 was highly non fickian credit authorship contribution statement albert kwame kwaw

2447,bound water bw has significant effects on the physical and chemical properties of soils and other geologic formations however little is known about its effect on the non fickian transport of solute in porous media this paper investigated the effect of bw on the non fickian solute transport characteristics in mixed porous media different porous media of quartz sand with variable contents of powdered minerals were prepared the low field nuclear magnetic resonance lf nmr was used to quantitatively characterise bw and its spatial distribution then solute transport experiments were conducted in different prepared porous media and the measured breakthrough curves btcs were analysed using the advection dispersion equation ade mobile immobile mim and continuous time random walk ctrw models the results revealed that all measured btcs exhibited the characteristics of early arrival and late time tailing however stronger non fickian characteristics were observed as bw increased in content indicating that bw influenced the non fickian transport of the solute the optimised immobile water fraction of the mim model consistently increased with increasing estimated bw fraction moreover the coefficient of mass transfer rate α of mim decreased as bw increased meaning that the solute exchange between the mobile and immobile fluids became slower and consequently yielded strongly tailed btcs from the ctrw model the solute transport velocity v ctrw increased with increasing bw leading to a reduction in the breakthrough time of the solute an increase in bw yielded a decreasing power law exponent β ctrw of the ctrw model implying an enhancement of the non fickian transport characteristics furthermore the porous media with b w 16 4 showed moderately non fickian solute transport whereas those with b w 16 4 exhibited highly non fickian solute transport keywords bound water mixed porous media nuclear magnetic resonance solute transport non fickian transport data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction solute transport in saturated porous media normally follows a non fickian behaviour which is marked by early breakthrough and long tailed breakthrough curves btcs dou and zhou 2015 kwaw et al 2021 levy and berkowitz 2003 major et al 2011 the non fickian transport behaviour is partly due to the physically heterogeneous nature of saturated porous media at a pore scale berkowitz 2021 liu et al 2017 at this scale some of the water in the pore spaces are free to move whereas others are bound van genuchten and wierenga 1976 during solute transport the bound water serves as a secondary source of contamination where a portion of the solute is trapped in the bound water and gradually released into the movable water zone at later times berkowitz 2021 in groundwater remediation the secondary source of contamination induced by the presence of bound water is a problem since it delays the remediation process therefore quantitatively characterising bound water in different saturated porous media and assessing its impact on the degree of non fickian transport is important quantifying the physical non equilibrium processes responsible for non fickian transport behaviour particularly long tailing is often done using mathematical models such as continuous time random walk ctrw and mobile immobile mim model laboratory studies have shown that ctrw is robust in quantifying long tailed btcs gao et al 2009 kwaw et al 2021 levy and berkowitz 2003 liu et al 2017 zaheer et al 2017 however ctrw does not quantify both bound water and the mass transfer rate between free water and bound water to provide such information mim has been successfully used to quantify both bound water and mass transfer rate gao et al 2009 kwaw et al 2021 zaheer et al 2017 although solute transport models have been successful in quantifying non fickian characteristics the best fit bound water free water and mass transfer parameters need experimental corroboration to enhance our understanding of non fickian transport in saturated porous media to strengthen the physical meaning of the best fit parameters of mim swanson et al 2012 used bulk direct current electrical conductivity and fluid conductivity measurements low field nuclear magnetic resonance lf nmr measurements and the mim model to study solute transport in packed quartz sand and zeolite the hysteresis between bulk electrical conductivity and fluid conductivity provided evidence of minimal solute exchange in quartz sand and greater solute exchange in zeolite explaining the relatively long tailed btc for zeolite the authors also indicated that the lf nmr estimates for bound water and free water matched those of the mim model suggesting that the lf nmr technology and the mim model can be used to understand physical non equilibrium processes responsible for non fickian transport especially long tailing behaviour the authors findings are interesting however their work is limited purely quartz sand and zeolites were used as porous media in subsurface environments pure mineral composed sediments are not commonly present in such environments a mixture of different minerals occurs including quartz sand clay and non clay minerals wilson and pittma 1977 moreover the authors used 33 ms a proposed transverse relaxation time t 2 cut off used for sandstones coates et al 1999 to estimate bound water and free water even though they explained that the selected t 2 cut off matched the estimated effective pore diameter because different saturated porous media have different pore size distributions using one t 2 cut off for different porous media is questionable nmr t 2 cut off is often found by centrifuging saturated porous media to drain free water hu et al 2020 lai et al 2018 however centrifuging low strength porous media which sand clay mixtures packed in polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe columns are an example may destroy the pore structure because of the rotational speed testamanti and rezaee 2017 yuan et al 2018 yuan and rezaee 2019 to preserve the pore structures of sand clay mixtures lu et al 2020 used an oven drying approach to determine t 2 cut off by removing the free water at 40 c however removing free water at 40 c is time consuming therefore using the oven drying approach by testamanti and rezaee 2017 which uses a wide range of temperatures to desaturate porous media is important to address the limitations in the previous studies and further enhance our understanding on bound water influence on non fickian solute transport in saturated porous media this study set three objectives first this study used the lf nmr technology to establish t 2 cut offs and quantitatively characterise bound water and its spatial distribution in saturated mixed porous media whose mineral compositions comprised quartz sand calcite kaolinite and illite powders with different contents second conducted solute transport experiments in the mixed porous media and modelled the experimental data with ade mim and ctrw third assessed how the bound water resulting from increasing content of calcite kaolinite and illite powders influenced the non fickian transport of the solute note that the mixed porous media means homogenous mixtures of quartz sand and one powdered mineral two sets of porous media were prepared the first set of porous media was used for the lf nmr measurements to quantitatively characterise bound water and its spatial distribution the second set of porous media was used for the bench experiment of solute transport note that the fickian based ade model was used as a basis for comparison with the mim and ctrw models our study showed that different porous media have different t 2 cut offs and using a single t 2 cut off i e 33 ms to quantify bound water in different porous media as observed in previous studies may yield significant errors moreover compared to previous studies this study has provided more insights into the effect of bound water on non fickian solute transport in porous media whose mineral compositions are similar to what is observed in subsurface environments 2 nmr theory there exist several spinning hydrogen nuclei in water saturated porous media whose spin axes are randomly oriented when there is no external static magnetic field smf in the presence of smf the hydrogen nuclei in the water are polarised yielding nuclear magnetisation when a radio frequency rf pulse is applied perpendicular to smf the polarised nuclei are tipped 90 away from their original equilibrium site generating temporary nuclear magnetisation in the transverse plane when the rf pulse is later withdrawn there are decay to zero of nuclear magnetisation perpendicular to smf and recovery of nuclear magnetisation to its original equilibrium state the recovery and decaying of nuclear magnetisation are respectively characterised by longitudinal relaxation time t 1 and transverse relaxation time t 2 in this study only t 2 was used since it is faster to measure than t 1 the rate of t 2 relaxation is given as coates et al 1999 zhang et al 2018 1 1 t 2 1 t 2 b k 1 t 2 s f c 1 t 2 d i f where t 2 b k is t 2 relaxation time of the bulk fluid t 2 s f c is t 2 relaxation time at the grain surface t 2 d i f is t 2 relaxation time due to a diffusion mechanism induced by magnetic field gradients for water saturated porous media the relaxation of bulk water which signifies an exchange of energy among the hydrogen nuclei in water is small hence its effect can be neglected coates et al 1999 moreover when a low magnetic field is used coupled with a short pulse spacing the contribution of diffusion relaxation can be neglected keating et al 2020 kleinberg et al 1993b kleinberg et al 1993a thus the relaxation of pore fluid on the surfaces of the grains becomes the main mechanism in t 2 as shown in eq 2 2 1 t 2 1 t 2 s f c ρ 2 s v where ρ 2 is the transverse surface relaxivity which is dependent on pore surface mineralogy s and v respectively define pore surface area and pore volume the different t 2 relaxation times reflect the distribution of water filled pores in porous media in nmr measurement a pore space model is used to convert relaxation time to pore space for planar cylindrical and spherical pores the ratio of pore surface area to pore volume s v is equivalent to 1 r 2 r and 3 r respectively where r is the pore radius dou et al 2022 liu et al 2021 in this study the pores were assumed to be spherical and the relationship between t 2 and pore radius r becomes 3 1 t 2 ρ 2 3 r 3 materials and methods 3 1 experimental setup and materials fig 1 a b shows the experimental setup used in this study a is the lf nmr which will be simply called nmr thereafter system and b is the solute transport setup the nmr instrument was macromr12 150h i suzhou niumay analytical instrument china with a magnetic field strength of 0 3 t the solute transport setup comprised deionised di water a nacl tracer a tyd02 01 model syringe pump with an infusion rate ranging from 0 184 to 173 718 ml min control valves fluorinated ethylene propylene fep connecting tubes 2 65 mm internal diameter a ptfe column an effluent container and an electrical conductivity meter the ptfe column was 100 mm in length with an external diameter and thickness of 50 mm and 12 5 mm respectively inside the ptfe column was a 60 mm length 25 mm diameter porous medium to prevent the quartz sand and powdered minerals from flowing out the ends of the ptfe column were sealed with a 500 mesh nylon filter two sets of porous media were prepared with each set comprising 10 different porous media out of the 10 porous media in each set 9 were mixed porous media and the remaining 1 was mainly quartz sand as shown in table 1 it is important to mention that the two sets of porous media were prepared following the same procedure to achieve the same bulk densities one set was used for the nmr measurements and the other set for the bench solute transport experiments to achieve a uniform size of the coarse grain content the quartz sand purchased from henan bairun casting material co ltd china was sieved with a standard set of sieves gb t6003 1 2012 shaoxing shangyu huafeng hardware instrument co ltd china the quartz sand particles retained on the 30 mesh sieve whose aperture was 0 6 mm were used the calcite mineral was purchased from henan hongshu environmental protection material co ltd and the kaolinite and illite minerals were purchased from lingshou dehang mineral products co ltd all in china note that the calcite kaolinite and illite had the same particle size of 325 mesh 45 µm the reason was to control the particle sizes of the powdered minerals in the mixed porous media for comparison the chemical compositions of the powdered minerals were analysed with an x ray fluorescence xrf instrument panaco epsilon 3 model and the results are presented in table 2 fig 2 a c shows the x ray diffraction xrd results obtained from a dx 2700 x ray diffractometer dandong fangyuan instrument co ltd china and analysed with jade 6 software high resolution scanning electron microscopy sem images obtained from a hitachi s 4800 instrument were used to understand the microstructural characteristics of the powdered minerals calcite showed a rhombohedral morphology fig s1 a d kaolinite showed typical dense stacking plates booklet morphology fig s2 a d whilst illite displayed flat lying platy crystals fig s3 a d the sodium chloride nacl used for the solute transport experiments was purchased from tianjin beichen fangzheng regent factory china 3 2 sample preparation prior to the experiments the quartz sand was washed with di water purposely to remove any impurities on the surface and dried in an oven for 24 hr at 105 c known masses of the dried quartz sand and powdered minerals were measured and mixed thoroughly in a dried glass beaker a wet filling approach where water is first poured into a sample column followed by solid grains was used the ptfe column was held in a vertical position and small quantities of the mixtures were poured gradually through the di water stirred and pressed firmly with a clean glass rod purposely to eliminate any layers and also to obtain dense uniform porous media the di water was always above the mixtures and the reason was to prevent air entrapment in the packed porous media since the density of a packed porous medium has a considerable effect on porosity permeability and solute transport characteristics the masses and the lengths of the packed porous media were the same the porosities of the porous media summarised in table 3 were computed using a weighing method the weight of water resulting from the difference between the weights of the fully saturated porous media and the dry mixtures was converted to pore volume using the density of water ρ 0 997 g cm3 at 25 c 3 3 nmr measurements for the nmr measurements the free induction decay fid sequence was always used to set the macromr12 150h i instrument the t 2 relaxation times of the hydrogen nuclei in the water filled pores of the porous media were subsequently obtained using the carr purcell meiboom gill cpmg pulse sequence comprising a single 90 rf pulse and a series of 180 rf pulses carr and purcell 1954 meiboom and gill 1958 table 4 shows the parameters set for the cpmg pulse sequence for a stable magnetic field the temperature of the nmr magnet was always kept at 32 c two nmr measurements were performed first the t 2 spectra of the fully water saturated porous media were obtained to determine the distribution of pore sizes in the porous media second the same fully water saturated porous media were desaturated in an oven at a temperature range of 50 110 c testamanti and rezaee 2017 and measured their corresponding t 2 spectra at each temperature the porous media were heated for 4 hr and increased the temperature at an interval of 10 c for consistency the oven dried porous media were cooled to 32 c before measuring their t 2 spectra to verify the reproducibility of the nmr data the ptfe columns were emptied cleaned and refilled with the same mixtures and measured the t 2 spectra again when the t 2 spectra were compared there was no difference signifying good data reproducibility as shown in fig s4 and fig s5 3 4 solute transport experiments a solute is often entrapped in the lower section of a vertically oriented porous medium hence influencing the transport pattern of the solute for this reason the filled ptfe columns were laid horizontally and connected to two syringes of di water and nacl solution mounted on a tyd02 01 pump using fep tubes and control valves as shown in fig 1 b before the nacl tracer was injected 144 ml 12 pore volumes pv of di water was pumped through the porous media to achieve a steady flow 36 ml 3 pv of nacl solution whose concentration c 0 was 5 g l was injected into the porous media and subsequently flushed with 72 ml 6 pv of di water both the injection and flushing were controlled by the syringe pump at a constant flow rate of 0 2 ml min at 25 c at the outlet of the ptfe column 1 8 ml effluents were collected in 10 ml sized tubes over the entire experimental duration a portable electrical conductivity meter dzs 708l and djs 1 l inesa scientific instrument co ltd shanghai was employed to measure the electrical conductivity ec of the effluents to minimise errors in measuring ec the conductivity meter was rinsed with di water and wiped with a clean tissue before and after each conductivity measurement the ec values were then converted to concentrations c using the calibration curve of ec 1661 6 c 2 with a coefficient of determination r 2 equal to 0 999 the concentrations c of the effluents were normalised as c c 0 to generate the btcs to verify the reproducibility of data the ptfe columns were emptied cleaned and refilled for new solute transport experiments the btcs followed the same pattern as shown in fig s6 and fig s7 3 5 inverse models for solute transport 3 5 1 ade model the one dimensional ade for a solute is given as toride et al 2003 4 c t d x 2 c x 2 v c x where c is the solute concentration ml 3 v is the average pore water velocity lt 1 and d x is dispersion coefficient in the direction of flow l 2 t 1 t is time t and x is a distance l 3 5 2 mim model the mim model adopts two fluid zones mobile and immobile to describe solute transport in porous media the accumulation of solute in the immobile fluid zone and subsequent slow release from the zone are assumed to be driven by a single rate diffusion mechanism toride et al 1995 van genuchten and wierenga 1976 for a nonreactive solute the one dimensional transport is given as 5 θ m c m t θ im c im t θ m d m 2 c m x 2 θ m v m c m x 6 α c m c im θ im c im t where θ m and θ im are fluids in the mobile and immobile zones respectively c m and c im are the concentrations of solute in the mobile and immobile zones respectively v m is average flow velocity d m is dispersion coefficient and α is the first order solute mass exchange rate between the mobile and immobile fluid zones t 1 the fraction of mobile fluid β is given as β θ m θ m θ im 3 5 3 ctrw model the ctrw framework whose governing equation is centred on the fokker planck with a memory equation fpme is extensively used to describe solute transport in subsurface formations in the laplace space the one dimensional form of the fpme for a uniform system is given as cortis and berkowitz 2005 7 k c x k c 0 x m k v ψ x c x k d ψ 2 x 2 c x k where k defines the laplace variable c x k is laplace transformed ensemble average normalised concentration c 0 is the initial concentration x denotes the location in space v ψ and d ψ are transport velocity and generalised dispersion coefficient respectively and m k is the memory function which defines the non fickian transport behaviour induced by inherent heterogeneities occurring at all scales the memory function m k is expressed as 8 m k t k ψ k 1 ψ k where t is the characteristic time the memory function m k was defined using the widely used truncated power law tpl model berkowitz et al 2006 dentz et al 2004 9 ψ k 1 τ 2 k t 1 β exp t 1 k γ β τ 2 1 t 1 k γ β τ 2 1 where τ2 t2 t1 t1 is the start time for the power law behaviour t 2 is the upper threshold time that defines fickian transport г is an incomplete gamma function β denotes a constant exponent which defines solute transport behaviour the solute transport becomes highly non fickian when 0 β 1 and moderately non fickian when 1 β 2 for β 2 the solute transport is now fickian for t t 1 in this case the cut off time t 2 becomes irrelevant in the transport process 3 6 inversion of ade mim and ctrw models the solute transport parameters were estimated from the measured btcs through the inversion of ade mim models from cxtfit 2 0 software toride et al 1995 and ctrw model from ctrw matlab toolbox v 4 0 cortis et al 2020 the transport parameters obtained from the ade model served as the initial values for the ctrw model two metrics global error e j and determination coefficient r 2 were used to appraise the goodness of the fitted models 10 e j 1 n i 1 n c i nm c i sim 2 11 r 2 1 i 1 n c i nm c i sim 2 i 1 n c i nm c nm 2 where j represents ade mim or ctrw c i nm denotes the normalised measured concentrations c i sim represents the simulated concentrations c nm is the mean value of the normalised measured concentrations and n denotes the total number of normalised concentrations 4 results and discussion 4 1 t 2 spectra characteristics of water saturated porous media solute transport behaviour is sensitive to the distribution of water filled pores and how the pores are connected in space defining the velocity field of a porous medium for this reason the t 2 spectra of the porous media were measured since the amplitude of t 2 spectrum reveals the distribution of water filled pores in a porous medium for comparison the t 2 spectra were analysed based on different contents of the same powdered mineral mixed with quartz sand fig 3 a c and the same content of different powdered minerals mixed with quartz sand fig 3 d f the porous media with calcite kaolinite and illite unless otherwise stated will be respectively called q c q k and q i as evident in fig 3 a f the distributions of t 2 spanning from short to long relaxation times showed four distinct peaks p 1 p 2 p 3 and p 4 which ranged from 0 18 to 2086 7 ms p 1 and p 4 were common in all porous media however q k showed three peaks with p 2 and p 3 merged to form p 2 p 3 signifying good connectivity between p 2 and p 3 it must be mentioned that the characteristics of t 2 spectra i e the number size and location of t 2 spectrum peaks is important for realising the different forms of water filled pores and how they are connected overall q100 showed the highest p 4 and the lowest p 1 according to the theory of nmr t 2 relaxation times are comparable to the sizes of water filled pore spaces in water saturated porous media meaning that p 4 and p 3 correspond to large pores and p 1 and a portion of p 2 are related to small pores jin et al 2020 yao et al 2010 this analogy is based on the fact that hydrogen nuclei in large water filled pores take a longer time to relax than those in small water filled pores this suggests that large pores were well developed whereas small pores were less developed in q100 compared with q100 p 4 declined continuously whereas other peaks rose with increasing powdered mineral content 2 5 and 8 in q c q k and q i as shown in fig 3 a c this means that the powdered minerals filled portions of the large pores hence narrowing some of the large pores and increasing the number of small pores as evident in fig 3 d f p 4 in the t 2 spectra of q k and q i were lower than those in the t 2 spectra of q c implying that there were fewer large pores in q k and q i than in q c although the powdered mineral contents were the same this suggests that the kaolinite and illite particles interacted with the di water through the crystalline water adsorption process azari and leimkuhler 1990 aksu et al 2015 used x ray micro computed tomography µ ct to visualise the morphological alteration and extent of volume change and swelling of kaolinite in unconsolidated porous media before and after water saturation compared with the dry state of the porous media the authors observed some level of swelling of kaolinite in the water saturated porous media weaver 1965 used relative intensity measurements to investigate potassium content in 249 illite samples and reported that k2o content 9 10 had weakly bonded illite like layers or expandable layers supporting what was earlier proposed by mehra and jackson 1959 that there must be expandable layers in illite whose k2o content is lower than 10 moreover the authors findings support what was reported by dodd 1954 and hayatdavoudi 1999 that clay minerals swell to some extent when they come in contact with water with the degree of swelling depending on the chemical compositions of the clay minerals the k2o content of illite used in this study was 5 27 table 2 which is less than the 10 reported by the above authors hence ascribing the cause of the less large pores and more small pores in q k and q i to swelling is reasonable in this study comparing q k and q i as evident in fig 3 d f p 4 in the t 2 spectra of q i were higher than those in the t 2 spectra of q k suggesting relatively more large pores in q i it is documented that kaolinite particles stay within pores civan 2016 whereas that of illite are often attached to the walls of pores zhao et al 2020 accounting for the differences in p 4 additionally the t 2 spectra of q i especially q95 i5 and q92 i8 shifted somewhat to shorter relaxation times than those of q95 k5 and q92 k8 implying that smaller water filled pores occurred in q i than in q k here the difference could be due to the large amounts of hydrated cations na mg2 and ca2 present in the illite mineral 4 2 t 2 spectra of oven dried porous media and free water and bound water discrimination fig 4 a d and fig 5 a f show the t 2 spectra of water saturated porous media heated at different temperatures purposely to partition the t 2 distributions into free water and bound water as the temperature increased the peaks declined in all porous media with peak p 4 falling rapidly followed by p 3 this suggests that the water in the large pores was mobile and could easily be removed whereas those in the small pores p 1 and portion of p 2 were irreducible and could not easily be removed q100 showed very weak signal amplitude at 100 c and this was due to more large pores whose water content was easily removed at water boiling temperature leaving the irreducible water contained in the small pores the small pores in q100 were few explaining the observed weak signal amplitude compared with q100 the 2 powdered minerals in q98 c2 q98 k2 and q98 i2 respectively increased the small pores and more water was captured in such pore spaces the relatively large signal amplitudes shown by both q98 k2 and q98 i2 even at 110 c were due to their intrinsic water adsorption behaviour which formed nanometre sized hydrate films osipov 2012 increasing the powdered mineral content from 2 to 5 and then to 8 further increased the bound water content at 110 c the t 2 spectra shifted towards the left i e shorter relaxation times implying that while the surface areas of the pores remained constant the amount of water in the pores reduced and the hydrogen nuclei relaxed faster during heating the t 2 distribution curves kept changing until a point was reached where further heating did not yield much difference in the t 2 distribution curves especially the last three t 2 distribution curves as shown in fig s8 b d and fig s9 a f moreover the peaks of the last three t 2 distribution curves centred on the same transverse relaxation time which is consistent with what was reported by testamanti and rezaee 2017 who used increasing temperatures to determine nmr t 2 cut offs for bound water the last three t 2 distribution curves which did not change much upon further heating signified bound water whose contents in the porous media were computed using t 2 thresholds fig 6 a d and fig 7 a f show the t 2 thresholds t 2 c for determining the free water and bound water in the porous media the t 2 c values were computed following three procedures which are widely used to discriminate between free water and bound water when a centrifuging method or an oven drying approach is used to desaturate porous media coates et al 1999 hu et al 2020 lu et al 2020 testamanti and rezaee 2017 yuan et al 2018 yuan and rezaee 2019 first the t 2 distributions at the fully water saturated state and irreducible water state were considered second these t 2 spectra were converted to cumulative t 2 spectra with the maximum signal amplitudes at a fully water saturated state and irreducible water state being the porous medium s total porosity and bound water respectively as reported by coates et al 1999 third horizontal projection from the cumulative t 2 spectra at an irreducible water state to meet the cumulative t 2 spectra at a fully water saturated state and subsequent downward projection from the intersected point to the t 2 relaxation time axis the division of t 2 spectra into free water and bound water assumes that short t 2 relaxation times are associated with small pore water freedman 2006 the value of t 2 relaxation time is t 2c as shown in fig 6 a d and fig 7 a f the content of the quartz sand was large 90 yet the t 2c values differed from the 33 ms threshold proposed for sandstones coates et al 1999 the difference could be explained by distinct mineral composition texture pore wall chemistry pore sizes and pore throats it is important to note that using the proposed t 2c for sandstones to discriminate between free water and bound water in quartz sand dominated porous media would either underestimate or overestimate the contents of free water and bound water table 5 shows the estimated free water and bound water in the porous media using the computed t 2c as the content of powdered mineral increased the bound water also increased increasing the content of powdered minerals created more small pore spaces within which small amounts of water were trapped testamanti and rezaee 2017 discussed that water trapped in smaller pore spaces barely escapes even when porous media are heated at a temperature beyond 100 c the vapourised water condenses back to the liquid state as a result of cohesive attraction forces this explains why the bound water increased as the content of calcite a non clay mineral increased comparing the same powdered mineral content q k and q i showed larger bound water than q c explaining clay minerals capacity to hold substantial amounts of adsorbed water even when heated beyond 100 c hillel 2004 however q i had more bound water than q k the following were the reasons the layers of illite are held together by potassium ions precluding water from interacting with the layers however the occurrence of large amounts of hydrated cations na mg2 and ca2 in the illite table 2 coupled with its low k2o content 10 might have allowed water into the interlayers mehra and jackson 1959 weaver 1965 on the other hand the layers of kaolinite clay are held by a robust hydrogen bond which precludes water from coming between the layers and the water molecules adsorbed by the kaolinite were limited to its outer surface adams et al 2020 moreover comparing q k and q i the t 2 spectra of q i moved slightly to shorter relaxation times suggesting that smaller water filled pores existed in q i than in q k 4 3 influence of bound water on the measured btcs to understand the influence of bound water on the solute transport the measured btcs for variable contents of calcite kaolinite and illite were compared as shown in fig 8 a f all measured btcs showed distinct arrival times and late time tailings implying varying magnitudes of non fickian transport of solute in the porous media the difference in the non fickian characteristics was a result of microscale heterogeneities variable local advective velocities and solute retention and release caused by the variable bound water contents in the porous media the occurrence of early arrival and late time tailing characteristics in q100 which contained only quartz sand is consistent with the previous studies that non fickian behaviour characterises the transport of solute in uniformly packed porous media kwaw et al 2021 levy and berkowitz 2003 compared with the mixed porous media the solute arrival time was longer and the late time tailing was less heavy in q100 the longer arrival time of solute in q100 having a bound water content of 3 0 was due to weak preferential flow paths present on the other hand the less heavy late time tailing suggests that a small solute was trapped at an early time and slowly released at a late time by the small content of bound water even though not much difference was observed in the solute arrival times when 2 powdered minerals were mixed with the quartz sand the increased contents of bound water retained more solute than in q100 explaining the heavier late time tailings in q98 c2 q98 k2 and q98 i2 than in q100 fig 8 d f compared with the porous media with 2 powdered minerals the porous media with 5 powdered minerals showed stronger characteristics of arrival time and late time tailing this suggests that the larger bound water contents in the porous media with 5 powdered minerals caused more variations in the local advective velocity and formed stronger preferential flow paths along which portion of the solute advanced at a high velocity explaining the earlier solute arrival times in q95 c5 q95 k5 and q95 i5 compared with those in q98 c2 q98 k2 and q98 i2 the heavier late time tailings imply that more solute was retained by the larger contents of bound water in q95 c5 q95 k5 and q95 i5 even shorter arrival times and heavier late time tailings were observed in the porous media with 8 powdered minerals q92 c8 q92 k8 and q92 i8 the enlarged bound water in the porous media with 8 powdered minerals further enhanced the pore scale heterogeneity resulting more variable flow velocities and stronger preferential paths for flow as a result the early arrival time of solute in the porous media with 8 powdered minerals was shorter than those with 5 powdered minerals beyond 3 pv as shown in fig 8 a c the middle plateaus continued to rise for some time before declining despite the porous media being flushed with di water the variations in the length of concentration rise suggest variable amounts of solute in the porous media after the injection duration the longest length over the course of increased concentration was a result of the least advection mobile zone and vice versa the middle plateau depended on the advection dominated mobile zone which was influenced by the bound water another interesting observation was the effect of bound water on the maximum dimensionless concentration c c 0 m a x the c c 0 m a x for the porous media with 2 5 and 8 powdered minerals were respectively in the range of 94 6 95 7 90 4 95 6 and 86 6 92 5 implying that as bound water increased more solute particles were retained the retention of solute weakened the solute mixing process in the porous media the magnitude of the late time tailings depended on the rate at which the trapped solute diffused out of the immobile fluid zone into the mobile fluid zone when di water was injected to flush the solute in the porous media the heaviness of the late time tailings with respect to the mass exchange rate is discussed in detail in section 4 4 the results have shown that the variable contents of bound water in the porous media had a significant effect on the non fickian characteristics 4 4 analysis of solute transport models to understand the solute transport dynamics in the porous media the measured btcs were analysed and interpreted using the inverse models of ade mim and ctrw as shown in fig 9 a d and fig 10 a f the two metrics r 2 and e j which measured the goodness of the best fit solutions are presented in table 6 even though the ade model in most cases matched the arrival times it could not capture the peak concentrations and the late time tails of the btcs the fickian based ade model in most cases reached the dimensionless concentration c c 0 of 1 whereas the highest peak concentrations of the measured btcs ranged from 0 866 to 0 904 the ade model s relatively poor performance was affirmed by its lowest r 2 and highest e j values as shown in table 6 there exist flowing and immobile fluid zones in porous media and assuming that all pore fluids are movable which was the heart of ade formulation bear 1972 was the reason for the ade s relatively poor performance on the contrary the mim and ctrw models could match the measured btcs well especially the long concentration tailings considering their r 2 and e j values as presented in table 6 since the fickian based ade model could not properly match the asymptotically long transition time of solute emanating from the rate limited mass exchange between the mobile and immobile fluid zones the mim and ctrw models were used to analyse the non fickian solute transport for the mim model the optimised mobile fluid zone β mim and coefficient of mass transfer α parameters were analysed to understand the influence of bound water on the solute transport dynamics as shown in table 7 the values of β mim varied significantly an increase in bound water with increasing powdered mineral content resulted in a significant reduction in the mobile fluid fraction which was affirmed by the decreasing values of β mim the reduction in the values of β mim suggests that the areas of contact for solute exchange between the mobile and immobile fluids were weakened and this contributed significantly to the delay of solute mixing between the two fluids in the porous media the slower the solute mixing process the more strong were the solute arrival time and late time tailing characteristics even though the values of the optimised immobile water fraction of the mim model were larger than the estimated bound water fraction the cross plots of optimised immobile water fraction versus estimated bound water fraction showed a good positive linear relationship with r 2 ranging from 0 6596 to 0 906 fig 11 a b the mim model assumes complete solute mixing between the flowing and immobile fluid zones however failure to achieve complete solute mixing within the two fluid zones may lead to an overestimated immobile water fraction swanson et al 2012 this could be the reason for the relatively large optimised immobile water fraction observed in this study the exchange of solute between the mobile and immobile fluid zones in the porous media was analysed using the fitted coefficient of mass transfer rate α as shown in table 7 α varied significantly indicating that the bound water had a considerable effect on the solute exchange between the mobile fluid zone and immobile fluid zone with the exception of q95 c5 q98 k2 and q98 i2 α decreased with increasing bound water the reduction in the values of α suggests that as the bound water increased with increasing powdered mineral content the area of contact for the transfer of solute between the mobile and immobile fluid zones reduced and more time was required to achieve complete solute mixing in other words the rate of exchange of solute between the mobile and immobile fluid zones became slower with increasing bound water the slower solute mixing process was responsible for the enhanced late time tailing behaviour as the bound water increased in the porous media padilla et al 1999 the failure of q95 c5 q98 k2 and q98 i2 to follow the trend of decreasing α with increasing bound water could be explained by the poor fitted btcs by the mim model it must be mentioned that the combination of larger immobile water fraction lower solute exchange rate and strongly tailed btc has also been reported in other studies kuntz et al 2011 padilla et al 1999 the transport parameters of the ctrw model also provided important information concerning the magnitude of non fickian transport behaviour in the porous media the average water velocities computed from the flow data ranged from 0 099 to 0 113 cm min in the porous media as shown in table 7 the transport velocities of the solute v ctrw in the ctrw model were higher than the average water velocities except 0 097 cm min v ctrw in q100 the results agreed with the early arrival of solute i e appearing before 1 pv fig 8 a c this suggests stronger preferential pathways along which part of the solute advanced with high velocities the exception could be the poor fitting of the measured btc in q100 it was observed that the trend of decreasing arrival times of the measured btcs was consistent with increasing v ctrw values of the ctrw model which also agreed with increasing bound water content this suggests that as the bound water content increased not all fluid in the pore spaces participated in the flow process and the effective porosity for flow declined limited flow paths were available for the advective flux of the solute the limited flow paths caused the solute particles to move with greater velocities under the same injection rate of 0 2 ml min as evident in table 7 all β ctrw were less than 2 a threshold that defines the emergence of fickian behaviour the different values of β ctrw indicate different degrees of non fickian behaviour in all porous media the characterisation of non fickain transport in all porous media was based on two timescales t 1 and t 2 defined in the ctrw formulation as shown in table 7 the values of t 1 which initiated the power law behaviour were sufficiently low t 1 t moreover the values of t 2 were larger than the experimental durations t t 2 implying non fickian behaviour even at those longer times as evident in table 7 β ctrw decreased with increasing bound water signifying that as the bound water increased the characteristics of non fickian transport were enhanced some of the porous media for example q95 k5 q92 k8 q95 i5 and q92 i8 exhibited a highly non fickian behaviour 0 β c t r w 1 and this could be explained by their larger bound water b w 16 4 the other six porous media whose bound water contents were relatively small b w 16 4 showed a moderately non fickian behaviour 1 β ctrw 2 our modelling results have shown that the extent of non fickian characteristics was dependent on the bound water content in the mixed porous media 5 summary and conclusions this study investigated the influence of bound water on the characteristics of non fickian transport of solute in mixed porous media two sets of different porous media of quartz sand with variable contents of powdered minerals were prepared the first set of porous media was used for the nmr measurements to quantitatively characterise bound water and its spatial distribution the second set of porous media was used for the bench experiment of solute transport and the measured btcs were analysed using the inverse models of ade mim and ctrw based on the results the following conclusions were drawn all measured btcs exhibited the characteristics of early arrival and late time tailing however stronger non fickian characteristics were observed as the bound water increased in content signifying that the bound water influenced the non fickian transport of the solute the optimised immobile water fraction of the mim model consistently increased with increasing estimated bound water fraction the coefficient of mass transfer rate α of the mim model decreased in value with increasing bound water the reduction in α values implies that as the bound water increased in content the exchange of solute between the mobile and immobile fluids became slower and consequently yielded strongly tailed btcs from the ctrw model the solute transport velocity v ctrw increased with increasing bound water leading to a reduction in the breakthrough time of the solute the power law exponent β ctrw of the ctrw model decreased with increasing bound water indicating that the bound water enhanced the characteristics of non fickian transport furthermore the solute transport in the porous media with bound water 16 4 was moderately non fickian whereas that in the porous media with bound water greater or equal to 16 4 was highly non fickian credit authorship contribution statement albert kwame kwaw

2448,various models are available for large scale evapotranspiration et estimation the performance of these models generally differs due to their differences in forcing data model structure mathematical representations of the et process and parameter estimation model comparison is the most straightforward way to identify the strengths weaknesses and uncertainty sources of a model in this study three widely used remote sensing et models were considered the air relative humidity based two source arts model priestley taylor jet propulsion laboratory pt jpl model and penman monteith leuning pml model the three models were evaluated based on measurements from 12 eddy covariance ec towers and water balance based et estimates from 286 basins the evaluation results indicate that the pml model performs the best on both the site and basin scales the advantage of the pml model may be due to i the land cover based parameter configuration and ii the consideration of differences in the responses of soil evaporation and transpiration to soil water deficit we also investigated the consistencies and differences between the models in simulating the spatiotemporal variation and component partitioning of et that is interception loss ei soil evaporation es and transpiration et the three models show high consistency in estimating nationwide multi year average et 416 3 438 2 mm yr and its spatial pattern but large discrepancies in et trends 0 10 0 98 mm yr2 and component partitioning the pt jpl model considerably overestimates the ratio of ei et thereby underestimating the ratio of es et because of the negative correlation between ei and es the arts model presents better applicability in grasslands than in croplands or forestlands this may be because its parameter value constant for all biomes and the water constraint scheme are more suitable for grasslands finally we proposed specific modifications to address the potential issues of each model keywords evapotranspiration model comparison evaporation remote sensing data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is a critical component of the global water cycle accounting for the largest water flux other than precipitation globally over 60 of the annual terrestrial precipitation returns to the atmosphere through et oki and kanae 2006 long term shifts in et directly affect water availability in a region milly et al 2005 et is also a nexus connecting the exchange of matter and energy between terrestrial and atmospheric systems jung et al 2010 the latent heat of evaporation accounts for approximately 50 of the solar energy received by the land surface trenberth et al 2009 therefore accurate estimation of et has important scientific and practical significance however accurate et estimation is challenging on a large spatial scale et is a complicated process that is highly variable in space and time additionally it is regulated by multiple factors associated with the climate and landscape fisher et al 2017 liu et al 2021 unlike the other water balance components such as precipitation and runoff et cannot be measured directly because of its invisibility existing indirect measurement technologies e g eddy covariance ec bowen ratio and lysimeters can only provide site specific or local scale et measurements and often suffer from large observational errors owing to their strict applicable conditions wang and dickinson 2012 for example mu et al 2011 reported that the uncertainty in et measurements from an ec site ranges between 10 and 30 feigenwinter et al 2008 documented that the accuracy of ec based flux measurements is affected by terrain uncertainties in et observations further complicate the reasonable estimation of et on a large spatial scale the development of remote sensing rs technology has greatly promoted the application of some et methods because land surface variables retrieved by rs can be used as inputs to many et models zhang et al 2016a fisher et al 2017 commonly used land surface variables for et estimation include albedo emissivity land surface temperature and vegetation related indexes e g leaf area index lai and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi albedo and emissivity are often used to estimate the net radiation in rs et models land surface temperature is usually used to calculate outgoing long wave radiation and surface soil wetness in combination with rs based vegetation information long and singh 2012 zhang et al 2021a rs based vegetation information is typically used in et estimates for i calculating surface energy components bastiaanssen et al 1998a ii allocating the available energy to the vegetation canopy and soil surface leuning et al 2008 and iii constructing biophysical constraints for et estimates fisher et al 2008 numerous rs et models have been developed to estimate et these models can be roughly divided into three categories hu et al 2021 i data driven models ii energy balance models and iii water energy balance models data driven models do not require knowledge of the physical mechanisms underlying et and can directly relate et observations to various types of forcing data such models have attracted increasing attention with the development of artificial intelligence and the advent of the big data era xu et al 2018 however data driven models usually require a large amount of observation data to train the model and offer few mechanistic explanations beyond its fitting capability energy balance models include a variety of algorithms with varying complexities and assumptions two representative energy balance models are the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998a bastiaanssen et al 1998b and penman monteith pm penman 1948 monteith 1965 sebal type models treat et as the residual term of the surface energy budget latent heat and use various empirical or physical parameterization schemes to estimate other energy balance components beyond latent heat such as sensible heat and soil heat storage however such models usually require some unknown variables to be solved iteratively on each grid limiting their application on large spatial scales yang et al 2015 zhang et al 2016a pm type models incorporate energy balance and water vapor transfer principles to estimate et they are also recognized as a type of method with a solid physical basis a major difficulty in applying the pm type method is the accurate estimation of resistance parameters wang and dickinson 2012 water energy balance models include various land surface and hydrological models in which et is only one of the variables that the models focus on liang et al 1994 dai et al 2003 such models also use the energy balance principle to estimate et but restrict et estimation on a water balance framework ensuring that the long term et estimation is less than precipitation model comparison is the most straightforward method to screen for an ideal model such comparisons have been extensively carried out using et models gao and long 2008 zhu et al 2016 sörensson and ruscica 2018 for example chen et al 2014 compared eight et models using ec measurements at 23 flux sites in china and found that three process based models performed better than the other models wu et al 2020 compared three et models with different complexities and found that the most complex model a water energy balance performed better than the other two energy balance based models hu et al 2021 evaluated five et models at 49 flux sites worldwide concluding that the three data driven models generally outperform the energy balance based models overall these results indicate that no single model is better than the other in all instances highlighting the need for model comparisons in addition it is challenging to interpret the internal mechanisms that cause differences in model performance differences in forcing data model structures and parameter estimates can all affect the model comparison results nevertheless model comparisons provide users and developers with useful information to help them identify model strengths limitations and uncertainties several calibration free rs et models have been developed in recent years such as the priestley taylor jet propulsion laboratory pt jpl model fisher et al 2008 penman monteith leuning pml model and air relative humidity based two source arts model yan et al 2012 the term calibration free here does not mean that these models do not contain parameters but rather that developers provide specific parameter values thereby avoiding the need for users to determine parameters the parameter values provided by model developers are generally based on literature reviews and or parameter calibrations at limited flux sites although pre specified parameters may introduce uncertainty in et estimates this makes et models eliminate the dependence on observations allowing them to be applied in any location with forcing data nevertheless research conducted to compare these calibration free et models and identify their uncertainties has been limited in this study three calibration free rs et models were compared the arts pt jpl and pml models leuning et al 2008 the objectives of this study were to i compare the performance of the three models ii investigate the consistency of the models in estimating the spatiotemporal variation and component partitioning of et and iii identify potential model uncertainties and provide specific suggestions for model improvement in the following sections we briefly introduced the methodologies and datasets used in this study we then compared the consistency and discrepancy of these models in et simulations in china and evaluated their performance based on flux tower measurements and water balance based et estimates finally we discussed the potential uncertainty in each model and provided specific solutions to reduce model uncertainty 2 methodology and data 2 1 the three remote sensing et models the three rs et models considered are arts yan et al 2012 pt jpl fisher et al 2008 and pml fig 1 detailed model equations and variables can be found in the appendix the arts model is a simplified version of the pm model which introduces a simple biophysical equation to calculate canopy conductance the inverse of canopy resistance specifically the canopy conductance in this model is expressed as a function of the maximum stomatal conductance gsmax 12 mm s multiplied by the air relative humidity and lai eq a3 another feature of the model is that it develops a simple soil water balance model to simulate the water constraint on et this model has been validated at global flux sites and has shown comparable performance to other et models yan et al 2012 hajji et al 2018 here a simple one layer tank model bai et al 2018 see eq a1 was incorporated into the arts model to facilitate its comparison with the other two models both of which include ei estimation the pt jpl model is also a simplification of the pm model which achieves a good balance between model complexity and accuracy and has thus been widely used for large scale et simulations chen et al 2014 purdy et al 2018 shao et al 2019 the model is based on the priestley taylor equation priestley and taylor 1972 to calculate potential et pet and treats the aerodynamic term in the pm model as a fixed ratio of the radiative term through an empirical coefficient see eq a8 thus avoiding aerodynamic resistance estimation the pt jpl model utilizes rs vegetation information to assign net radiation to the canopy and soil surface and then reduces pet to actual et estimates through multiple biophysical constraints fisher et al 2008 the pt jpl model has a parsimonious structure and low input requirements only routine meteorological data net radiation temperature and relative humidity and ndvi are required to force the model other vegetation variables in the model such as lai and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation fapar are treated as state variables and calculated using ndvi based empirical equations fisher et al 2008 while several modified pt jpl versions have been developed yao et al 2013 purdy et al 2018 li et al 2020 their superiority of lacks extensive validation under a wide range of climatic conditions therefore the original pt jpl model was used in this study see appendix a2 leuning et al 2008 proposed a biophysical surface conductance model based on the classical pm equation and developed a two source et model i e the pml model the model uses a jarvis stewart type jarvis 1976 equation to describe the response of plant stomata to environmental variables here we incorporated an ei module used in the variable infiltration capacity vic model eq a 15 in the pml model allowing it to simulate ei the original pml model includes six parameters appendix a3 however the model is only sensitive to two of these parameters the maximum stomatal conductance gsmax and the ratio of es to the equilibrium rate f leuning et al 2008 found that fixing the insensitive parameters did not degrade the model performance zhang et al 2010b further developed a parameterization scheme for f using 30 days of antecedent precipitation and soil equilibrium evaporation the only parameter in the model is gsmax which is difficult to determine reasonably on a large spatial scale zhang et al 2010b used the multi year average et calculated by a budyko based model as benchmark data to calibrate the spatial distribution of gsmax across australia and provided a land cover based lookup table for gsmax estimation the gsmax values suggested by zhang et al 2010b were used in this study 2 2 data sources and processing the three et models were run on a daily time scale and the spatial resolution of the forcing data was 0 05 0 05 gauge based meteorological data from 824 stations fig 2 including daily precipitation temperature relative humidity wind speed and sunshine duration were provided by the china meteorological administration https data cma cn we used the professional meteorological interpolation software anusplin hutchinson and xu 2004 to interpolate gauge based data into gridded data this software considers the effects of topography on interpolated meteorological variables land surface data include land cover albedo lai ndvi and digital elevation model dem data the sources and spatial resolutions of the land surface data are listed in table 1 land cover data and dem were upscaled to the same resolution 0 05 0 05 as that of the meteorological forcing using the pixel averaging method net radiation rn is one of the key inputs to the three et models however it is not a routinely observed variable by the chinese meteorological stations allen et al 1998 proposed an equation to calculate daily rn using conventional meteorological observations here the method of allen et al 1994 combined with rs albedo was used to calculate the rn data rn simulations are compared with rn observations at 10 of the 12 flux sites shown in fig 2 the results showed a good agreement between the observations and simulations see supplementary materials the three models were evaluated at 12 flux sites against ec based observations and 286 basins against water balance based et estimates the 12 flux sites could be grouped into three biome types grasslands g1 g4 croplands c1 c4 and forestlands f1 f4 the water balance method assumes that the change in water storage is negligible at a multi year scale and then the basin scale et can be estimated as the difference between precipitation and runoff liu et al 2016 bai and liu 2018 natural runoff observed runoff plus human withdrawal data of 286 basins were obtained from the hydrological bureau of the ministry of water resources in china covering the period 1982 2000 these basins cover a broad range of climatic conditions with an aridity index ranging from 0 47 to 2 73 fig 2 limited by the length of the runoff data the basin scale model evaluation was only carried out from 1982 to 2000 2 3 model evaluation metrics the model performance was evaluated using three metrics the coefficient of determination r2 percent relative bias bias and kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 the r2 quantifies the degree of linear correlation between the observed and simulated values bias measures the degree to which the simulated values are overestimated positive value or underestimated negative value relative to the observations kge was used as a comprehensive indicator to measure the consistency between the observed and simulated values the expressions of r2 bias and kge are given as 1 r 2 i 1 n y obs i y obs y sim i y sim i 1 n y sim i y sim 2 i 1 n y obs i y obs 2 2 2 bias i 1 n y obs i y sim i i 1 n y obs i 100 3 kge 1 1 γ 2 1 α 2 1 β 2 with α σ s σ o and β μ s μ o where ysim and yobs are the simulated and observed values respectively y sim and y obs are the average simulated and observed values respectively n is the length of the data time series μs and μo are the averages for the simulations and observations respectively and σs and σo are the standard deviations for the simulations and observations respectively 3 results 3 1 the models consistency in estimating the spatiotemporal variation of et here we compared the consistency of the three models in depicting the spatiotemporal variation in et over china as shown in fig 3 the spatial pattern of the multi year average et estimated by the three models is similar to that of the aridity index showing a decreasing trend from southeast to northwest china noticeable discrepancies in et estimates from these models can be found in northwest and southeast china the pt jpl model yields higher et estimates for the arid region of northwestern china than the others while the pml model produces higher et estimates for the humid region of southeast china than the others the nationwide average annual et estimates from the three models have little difference of which the pml model yielded the highest value 438 2 mm yr followed by the pt jpl model 433 4 mm yr and the arts model 416 3 mm yr a significant p 0 05 increase in et was detected by models other than the pt jpl model and the trends in annual et obtained by the three models diverged substantially the pml model suggests the strongest et enhancement and its trend 0 98 mm yr2 is roughly twice that of the arts model 0 48 mm yr2 and ten times that of the pt jpl model 0 10 mm yr2 fig 4 also shows the interannual variation and trend of each et component fig 4b d which explains the reason for the difference in et trends between the models among the three models the pml model gives the strongest increase in et 1 36 mm yr2 and the smallest decrease in es 0 19 mm yr2 making the trend of et simulated by this model the most pronounced 0 98 mm yr2 in contrast the pt jpl model shows the most pronounced decreasing trend in ei 0 23 mm yr2 and es 0 92 mm yr2 simulations leading to the weakest increase in et 0 10 mm yr2 we also examined the ratio of each et component to total et for the three models across china on a multi year average scale fig 5 the three models generally share the same first order et partitioning nationwide et is dominated by es followed by et and ei however specific to the ratio of each component to et there was a large discrepancy between the models for instance the ei et ranged from 3 1 to 14 5 and the et et ranged from 29 2 to 37 0 overall the arts and pml models yielded similar et partitioning results whereas the pt jpl model yielded a higher ei et and a lower et et potential reasons for this are discussed later 3 2 model evaluation at the flux sites model performance was evaluated against observations from 12 flux towers the results indicated that none of the models consistently outperformed the others at all flux sites table 2 confirming that each model has unique strengths overall the pml model outperformed the other two models it achieved the highest kge score at 8 of 12 sites while the arts and pt jpl models obtained the highest kge scores separately at the other two sites fig 6 compares the observed and simulated et values for three biomes that is grasslands croplands and forestlands for a more concise presentation of the evaluation results the numbers in paratheses of the subsequent texts represent the kge scores for grassland sites the arts and pml models performed similarly 0 72 versus 0 72 and remarkably outperformed the pt jpl model 0 42 for cropland sites the pml model performed the best 0 75 followed by pt jpl 0 59 and arts 0 53 the three models exhibited higher kge scores 0 73 0 79 for forest sites than for grassland and cropland sites and the relative ranking of the models was the same as that for cropland sites in terms of the kge score in addition the three models systematically underestimated et at the grassland and cropland sites as indicated by the negative bias values fig 6 3 3 model evaluation at the basin scale we also evaluated the performance of the three et models for 286 basins in china using et estimates from the water balance method wb et as benchmark data overall the three models reproduce the mean annual et over the test basins well the kge scores of the three models were above 0 70 fig 7 the pml model outperformed the other two models as indicated by its higher r2 0 71 and kge score 0 79 the pt jpl model is slightly inferior to the pml model but performs better than the arts model the kge scores for the pt jpl and arts models were 0 76 and 0 70 respectively 4 discussions 4 1 the simulation results our results indicate that the nationwide annual et estimates by the pml and arts models are significantly p 0 05 increasing since the early 1980 s this result agree with prior finding bai and liu 2018 li et al 2021 liu et al 2022 some studies have attributed the increasing et in china over the past three decades li et al 2018 bai et al 2020 li et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b su et al 2022 two general conclusions were drawn from these studies i climate changes rather than vegetation greening dominate the variability and trend in et and ii vegetation greening is an important contributor to the increase in et in addition the three models used here presented large discrepancies in et trend see fig 3d previous studies have also reported divergent trends in et estimates in china zhang et al 2016c bai and liu 2018 yin et al 2020 it is challenging for an et model to capture et trend adequately even if it has good performance statistics miralles et al 2015 differences in the model forcing data structures and parameters can affect et trends given that uniform forcing data were used for the three models discrepancies in model estimates may largely stem from differences in model structures and parameters the three models showed considerable differences in et partitioning figs 4 and 7 compared to the other two models the pt jpl model yielded a higher ei et ratio but a lower et et ratio for example the ratio of ei et exceeded 40 for parts of northeastern and southern china this ratio is considerably higher than that reported in the literature for forested areas of southern china zhang et al 2006 su et al 2016 liu et al 2018 sun et al 2022 overestimation of ei et by the pt jpl model has also been reported by luo et al 2022 in china and by miralles et al 2015 on a global scale the overestimation of ei by the pt jpl model is likely due to its unreasonable parametrization scheme for relative surface wetness fwet also called the wet canopy fraction the pt jpl model calculates fwet as a function of the fourth power of relative humidity rh and assumes that canopy interception only occurs when rh exceeds 70 see appendix a2 this assumption is theoretically flawed because rh is not a good indicator of precipitation precipitation and rh are often decoupled particularly in the humid regions of china where high relative humidity but no precipitation is common during the rainy season luo et al 2022 therefore the current fwet equation in the pt jpl model overestimates the probability of precipitation resulting in an overestimated ei the overestimation of ei directly results in the underestimation of et because they are tightly coupled in the model a negative correlation between ei and et unrealistic et partitioning for the pt jpl model has also been reported in previous studies miralles et al 2015 talsma et al 2018 luo et al 2022 therefore it is necessary to re parameterize the ei scheme for the pt jpl model to achieve reasonable et partitioning talsma et al 2018 explained why the total et estimates from different models are consistent but the individual component estimates diverge widely they found that systematic biases in the component estimates were greatly mitigated when they were aggregated into total et estimates this finding suggests that accurate total et estimates do not ensure reasonable component estimates our results also show that the three models systematically underestimated et at cropland sites see table 2 and fig 5 an underestimation of et has also been reported by yang et al 2010 fang et al 2020 and luo et al 2022 for cropland sites in china using different models the reasons for et underestimation at cropland sites are easy to understand croplands often require extensive irrigation to maintain high yields especially in arid regions most irrigation water eventually evaporates into the atmosphere resulting in high et fluxes in the croplands if models do not explicitly account for the effects of irrigation on et or assign specific parameters to croplands for example the arts and pt jpl models an underestimation of et is likely to occur for these models 4 2 why does the pml model perform better than the other two models the answer to this question may help provide inspiration for improving et models by revisiting the model structure it can be observed that the arts and pml models are similar in the pet calculation both are based on the pm equation however a more sophisticated gc equation was used in the pml model eq a 18 this equation accounts for the combined effect of radiation temperature and vapor pressure deficit vpd on stomatal aperture and has been widely tested at many flux sites worldwide li et al 2015 zhang et al 2016b in contrast the simple gc equation used in the arts model only includes the effects of rh and lai and lacks extensive validation another apparent difference in model strictures between arts and pml is that the latter considers differences in the responses of es and et to soil water deficit the es rate is mainly constrained by surface soil moisture or et al 2013 whereas the et rate is jointly regulated by root zone soil moisture and vpd fang et al 2021 abundant evidence indicates that vpd plays a more critical role in regulating et rate than soil moisture in humid regions novick et al 2016 lu et al 2022 vegetation in humid regions dominated by forests can maintain water demands for photosynthesis by absorbing deep soil water and groundwater through its deep root system even in the case of a surface soil water deficit zhu et al 2019 green et al 2020 some sap flow observation experiments also support the conclusion that the vpd dominates the temporal variability of et in humid regions herbst et al 2007 clausnitzer et al 2011 however in dry regions the relative importance of soil moisture and vpd on et may differ from that in humid regions liu et al 2020 vegetation in dry regions is usually dominated by grass where topsoil water deficit would also reduce the et rate for short root vegetation such as grass this may be a reason for the arts model performing better in grassland sites than in cropland and forest sites the superiority of the pml model may partly be due to its land cover based parameter configuration unlike the arts and pt jpl models with constant parameters the pml model configures its parameter gsmax according to the land cover type that is the gsmax lookup table constructed by zhang et al 2010b based on budyko based parameter calibration see section 2 1 the budyko based parameter calibration has a solid scientific foundation on the one hand budyko based models take into account the combined effects of water and energy limitations on et and can provide reliable multi year average et estimates which have been confirmed by numerous studies yang et al 2007 li et al 2013 yang et al 2014 on the other hand budyko based calibration restricts et estimates to a water balance framework compensating for the insufficiency of rs et models in considering water constraints thereby reducing the biases in et estimates some studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of budyko based calibration in improving the performance of et models zhang et al 2010b bai et al 2020 kim et al 2022 4 3 the direction of model improvements the three models still have room for improvement based on the evaluation results the arts model can be improved by i optimizing the parameter gsmax and ii considering the different responses of es and et to soil moisture deficit for simplicity the arts model sets its only parameter gsmax to a constant value gsmax 12 2 mm s for all vegetation types this value is close to the surface conductance of the reference crop 14 3 10 3m s corresponding to a surface resistance of 70 s m defined in the fao 56 method allen et al 1998 it is well known that the reference crop defined in the fao 56 pm method closely resembles open grasslands thus the value of gsmax in the arts model may be more suitable for et estimation in grasslands as shown in fig 6 it is recommended to reassign the gsmax value for each biome using available flux observations globally such as the fluxnet 2015 dataset pastorello et al 2020 in addition different water constraint functions for es and et are suggested to be designed for the arts model given the difference in the responses of es and et to water deficit the new constraint function for et should respond more slowly to water deficit than the constraint function for es the pt jpl model balances the model complexity and accuracy well and has been widely used for modeling large scale et michel et al 2016 shao et al 2019 pan et al 2020 the major problem with the pt jpl model is unrealistic et partitioning the model is likely to overestimate the ratio of ei et and underestimate the ratio of et et however the accuracy of the total et estimation is acceptable see figs 4 and 5 luo et al 2022 provided an in depth analysis of the reasons for the overestimation of ei et and underestimation of e t et in the pt jpl model they found that a negative correlation exists between ei and et overestimated ei must be accompanied by underestimated et and vice versa making the total et estimation relatively reasonable under the premise of modifying the model structure as little as possible the improvement in the pt jpl model can be considered by increasing the exponent of the f wet function f wet rh4 see eq a10 to reduce the overestimation of ei et whether increasing the exponent of f wet function affects the performance of the pt jpl model requires extensive evaluation the major problem of the pml model lies in the constraint scheme of es similar to most rs et models fisher et al 2008 zhang et al 2010a mu et al 2011 the pml model uses meteorological variables to indirectly represent the water constraint on es f see eq a17 because of a lack of spatiotemporally continuous soil moisture observations zhang et al 2010b the pml model calculates f as the ratio of the accumulated precipitation to the equilibrium evaporation over the previous 30 days see eq a17 where precipitation and equilibrium evaporation act as the supply and consumption terms of surface soil moisture respectively the method for f estimates is easy to use but has some drawbacks first solid precipitation snow does not immediately replenish current soil moisture and it has a lagging effect on the soil moisture supply ignoring precipitation states may overestimate f during the cold season and underestimate f during the melt season second the method for f estimates assigns the same weight to 30 days of antecedent precipitation equilibrium evaporation for simplicity this may lead to unrealistic f estimates because the effect of precipitation on soil moisture gradually decreases over time after a precipitation event these two drawbacks of f estimation may greatly affect the accuracy of et estimates in areas with sparse vegetation where et is dominated by es better f estimates can be achieved by distinguishing precipitation types rainfall or snow and adding a weight that decays over time to f estimates these two modifications are easy to implement because many relevant empirical formulas are available 5 conclusions in this study we evaluated three et models in china based on flux tower observations and basin scale water balance estimates the evaluation results indicated that the arts model had better applicability in grassland sites than in cropland and forest sites the pt jpl model significantly overestimated the ratio of ei et and underestimated the ratio of et et because of the unreasonable parameterization scheme of f wet overall the pml model performed the best among the models and was recommended as the preferred model for et simulations in addition the three models showed high consistency in estimating nationwide multi year average et and its spatial pattern but considerable discrepancies in et trends and component partitioning therefore it is not recommended to use a single model to simulate et particularly when focusing on et trends and or components we also provided specific modification suggestions

2448,various models are available for large scale evapotranspiration et estimation the performance of these models generally differs due to their differences in forcing data model structure mathematical representations of the et process and parameter estimation model comparison is the most straightforward way to identify the strengths weaknesses and uncertainty sources of a model in this study three widely used remote sensing et models were considered the air relative humidity based two source arts model priestley taylor jet propulsion laboratory pt jpl model and penman monteith leuning pml model the three models were evaluated based on measurements from 12 eddy covariance ec towers and water balance based et estimates from 286 basins the evaluation results indicate that the pml model performs the best on both the site and basin scales the advantage of the pml model may be due to i the land cover based parameter configuration and ii the consideration of differences in the responses of soil evaporation and transpiration to soil water deficit we also investigated the consistencies and differences between the models in simulating the spatiotemporal variation and component partitioning of et that is interception loss ei soil evaporation es and transpiration et the three models show high consistency in estimating nationwide multi year average et 416 3 438 2 mm yr and its spatial pattern but large discrepancies in et trends 0 10 0 98 mm yr2 and component partitioning the pt jpl model considerably overestimates the ratio of ei et thereby underestimating the ratio of es et because of the negative correlation between ei and es the arts model presents better applicability in grasslands than in croplands or forestlands this may be because its parameter value constant for all biomes and the water constraint scheme are more suitable for grasslands finally we proposed specific modifications to address the potential issues of each model keywords evapotranspiration model comparison evaporation remote sensing data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is a critical component of the global water cycle accounting for the largest water flux other than precipitation globally over 60 of the annual terrestrial precipitation returns to the atmosphere through et oki and kanae 2006 long term shifts in et directly affect water availability in a region milly et al 2005 et is also a nexus connecting the exchange of matter and energy between terrestrial and atmospheric systems jung et al 2010 the latent heat of evaporation accounts for approximately 50 of the solar energy received by the land surface trenberth et al 2009 therefore accurate estimation of et has important scientific and practical significance however accurate et estimation is challenging on a large spatial scale et is a complicated process that is highly variable in space and time additionally it is regulated by multiple factors associated with the climate and landscape fisher et al 2017 liu et al 2021 unlike the other water balance components such as precipitation and runoff et cannot be measured directly because of its invisibility existing indirect measurement technologies e g eddy covariance ec bowen ratio and lysimeters can only provide site specific or local scale et measurements and often suffer from large observational errors owing to their strict applicable conditions wang and dickinson 2012 for example mu et al 2011 reported that the uncertainty in et measurements from an ec site ranges between 10 and 30 feigenwinter et al 2008 documented that the accuracy of ec based flux measurements is affected by terrain uncertainties in et observations further complicate the reasonable estimation of et on a large spatial scale the development of remote sensing rs technology has greatly promoted the application of some et methods because land surface variables retrieved by rs can be used as inputs to many et models zhang et al 2016a fisher et al 2017 commonly used land surface variables for et estimation include albedo emissivity land surface temperature and vegetation related indexes e g leaf area index lai and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi albedo and emissivity are often used to estimate the net radiation in rs et models land surface temperature is usually used to calculate outgoing long wave radiation and surface soil wetness in combination with rs based vegetation information long and singh 2012 zhang et al 2021a rs based vegetation information is typically used in et estimates for i calculating surface energy components bastiaanssen et al 1998a ii allocating the available energy to the vegetation canopy and soil surface leuning et al 2008 and iii constructing biophysical constraints for et estimates fisher et al 2008 numerous rs et models have been developed to estimate et these models can be roughly divided into three categories hu et al 2021 i data driven models ii energy balance models and iii water energy balance models data driven models do not require knowledge of the physical mechanisms underlying et and can directly relate et observations to various types of forcing data such models have attracted increasing attention with the development of artificial intelligence and the advent of the big data era xu et al 2018 however data driven models usually require a large amount of observation data to train the model and offer few mechanistic explanations beyond its fitting capability energy balance models include a variety of algorithms with varying complexities and assumptions two representative energy balance models are the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998a bastiaanssen et al 1998b and penman monteith pm penman 1948 monteith 1965 sebal type models treat et as the residual term of the surface energy budget latent heat and use various empirical or physical parameterization schemes to estimate other energy balance components beyond latent heat such as sensible heat and soil heat storage however such models usually require some unknown variables to be solved iteratively on each grid limiting their application on large spatial scales yang et al 2015 zhang et al 2016a pm type models incorporate energy balance and water vapor transfer principles to estimate et they are also recognized as a type of method with a solid physical basis a major difficulty in applying the pm type method is the accurate estimation of resistance parameters wang and dickinson 2012 water energy balance models include various land surface and hydrological models in which et is only one of the variables that the models focus on liang et al 1994 dai et al 2003 such models also use the energy balance principle to estimate et but restrict et estimation on a water balance framework ensuring that the long term et estimation is less than precipitation model comparison is the most straightforward method to screen for an ideal model such comparisons have been extensively carried out using et models gao and long 2008 zhu et al 2016 sörensson and ruscica 2018 for example chen et al 2014 compared eight et models using ec measurements at 23 flux sites in china and found that three process based models performed better than the other models wu et al 2020 compared three et models with different complexities and found that the most complex model a water energy balance performed better than the other two energy balance based models hu et al 2021 evaluated five et models at 49 flux sites worldwide concluding that the three data driven models generally outperform the energy balance based models overall these results indicate that no single model is better than the other in all instances highlighting the need for model comparisons in addition it is challenging to interpret the internal mechanisms that cause differences in model performance differences in forcing data model structures and parameter estimates can all affect the model comparison results nevertheless model comparisons provide users and developers with useful information to help them identify model strengths limitations and uncertainties several calibration free rs et models have been developed in recent years such as the priestley taylor jet propulsion laboratory pt jpl model fisher et al 2008 penman monteith leuning pml model and air relative humidity based two source arts model yan et al 2012 the term calibration free here does not mean that these models do not contain parameters but rather that developers provide specific parameter values thereby avoiding the need for users to determine parameters the parameter values provided by model developers are generally based on literature reviews and or parameter calibrations at limited flux sites although pre specified parameters may introduce uncertainty in et estimates this makes et models eliminate the dependence on observations allowing them to be applied in any location with forcing data nevertheless research conducted to compare these calibration free et models and identify their uncertainties has been limited in this study three calibration free rs et models were compared the arts pt jpl and pml models leuning et al 2008 the objectives of this study were to i compare the performance of the three models ii investigate the consistency of the models in estimating the spatiotemporal variation and component partitioning of et and iii identify potential model uncertainties and provide specific suggestions for model improvement in the following sections we briefly introduced the methodologies and datasets used in this study we then compared the consistency and discrepancy of these models in et simulations in china and evaluated their performance based on flux tower measurements and water balance based et estimates finally we discussed the potential uncertainty in each model and provided specific solutions to reduce model uncertainty 2 methodology and data 2 1 the three remote sensing et models the three rs et models considered are arts yan et al 2012 pt jpl fisher et al 2008 and pml fig 1 detailed model equations and variables can be found in the appendix the arts model is a simplified version of the pm model which introduces a simple biophysical equation to calculate canopy conductance the inverse of canopy resistance specifically the canopy conductance in this model is expressed as a function of the maximum stomatal conductance gsmax 12 mm s multiplied by the air relative humidity and lai eq a3 another feature of the model is that it develops a simple soil water balance model to simulate the water constraint on et this model has been validated at global flux sites and has shown comparable performance to other et models yan et al 2012 hajji et al 2018 here a simple one layer tank model bai et al 2018 see eq a1 was incorporated into the arts model to facilitate its comparison with the other two models both of which include ei estimation the pt jpl model is also a simplification of the pm model which achieves a good balance between model complexity and accuracy and has thus been widely used for large scale et simulations chen et al 2014 purdy et al 2018 shao et al 2019 the model is based on the priestley taylor equation priestley and taylor 1972 to calculate potential et pet and treats the aerodynamic term in the pm model as a fixed ratio of the radiative term through an empirical coefficient see eq a8 thus avoiding aerodynamic resistance estimation the pt jpl model utilizes rs vegetation information to assign net radiation to the canopy and soil surface and then reduces pet to actual et estimates through multiple biophysical constraints fisher et al 2008 the pt jpl model has a parsimonious structure and low input requirements only routine meteorological data net radiation temperature and relative humidity and ndvi are required to force the model other vegetation variables in the model such as lai and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation fapar are treated as state variables and calculated using ndvi based empirical equations fisher et al 2008 while several modified pt jpl versions have been developed yao et al 2013 purdy et al 2018 li et al 2020 their superiority of lacks extensive validation under a wide range of climatic conditions therefore the original pt jpl model was used in this study see appendix a2 leuning et al 2008 proposed a biophysical surface conductance model based on the classical pm equation and developed a two source et model i e the pml model the model uses a jarvis stewart type jarvis 1976 equation to describe the response of plant stomata to environmental variables here we incorporated an ei module used in the variable infiltration capacity vic model eq a 15 in the pml model allowing it to simulate ei the original pml model includes six parameters appendix a3 however the model is only sensitive to two of these parameters the maximum stomatal conductance gsmax and the ratio of es to the equilibrium rate f leuning et al 2008 found that fixing the insensitive parameters did not degrade the model performance zhang et al 2010b further developed a parameterization scheme for f using 30 days of antecedent precipitation and soil equilibrium evaporation the only parameter in the model is gsmax which is difficult to determine reasonably on a large spatial scale zhang et al 2010b used the multi year average et calculated by a budyko based model as benchmark data to calibrate the spatial distribution of gsmax across australia and provided a land cover based lookup table for gsmax estimation the gsmax values suggested by zhang et al 2010b were used in this study 2 2 data sources and processing the three et models were run on a daily time scale and the spatial resolution of the forcing data was 0 05 0 05 gauge based meteorological data from 824 stations fig 2 including daily precipitation temperature relative humidity wind speed and sunshine duration were provided by the china meteorological administration https data cma cn we used the professional meteorological interpolation software anusplin hutchinson and xu 2004 to interpolate gauge based data into gridded data this software considers the effects of topography on interpolated meteorological variables land surface data include land cover albedo lai ndvi and digital elevation model dem data the sources and spatial resolutions of the land surface data are listed in table 1 land cover data and dem were upscaled to the same resolution 0 05 0 05 as that of the meteorological forcing using the pixel averaging method net radiation rn is one of the key inputs to the three et models however it is not a routinely observed variable by the chinese meteorological stations allen et al 1998 proposed an equation to calculate daily rn using conventional meteorological observations here the method of allen et al 1994 combined with rs albedo was used to calculate the rn data rn simulations are compared with rn observations at 10 of the 12 flux sites shown in fig 2 the results showed a good agreement between the observations and simulations see supplementary materials the three models were evaluated at 12 flux sites against ec based observations and 286 basins against water balance based et estimates the 12 flux sites could be grouped into three biome types grasslands g1 g4 croplands c1 c4 and forestlands f1 f4 the water balance method assumes that the change in water storage is negligible at a multi year scale and then the basin scale et can be estimated as the difference between precipitation and runoff liu et al 2016 bai and liu 2018 natural runoff observed runoff plus human withdrawal data of 286 basins were obtained from the hydrological bureau of the ministry of water resources in china covering the period 1982 2000 these basins cover a broad range of climatic conditions with an aridity index ranging from 0 47 to 2 73 fig 2 limited by the length of the runoff data the basin scale model evaluation was only carried out from 1982 to 2000 2 3 model evaluation metrics the model performance was evaluated using three metrics the coefficient of determination r2 percent relative bias bias and kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 the r2 quantifies the degree of linear correlation between the observed and simulated values bias measures the degree to which the simulated values are overestimated positive value or underestimated negative value relative

simulations and observations respectively and σs and σo are the standard deviations for the simulations and observations respectively 3 results 3 1 the models consistency in estimating the spatiotemporal variation of et here we compared the consistency of the three models in depicting the spatiotemporal variation in et over china as shown in fig 3 the spatial pattern of the multi year average et estimated by the three models is similar to that of the aridity index showing a decreasing trend from southeast to northwest china noticeable discrepancies in et estimates from these models can be found in northwest and southeast china the pt jpl model yields higher et estimates for the arid region of northwestern china than the others while the pml model produces higher et estimates for the humid region of southeast china than the others the nationwide average annual et estimates from the three models have little difference of which the pml model yielded the highest value 438 2 mm yr followed by the pt jpl model 433 4 mm yr and the arts model 416 3 mm yr a significant p 0 05 increase in et was detected by models other than the pt jpl model and the trends in annual et obtained by the three models diverged substantially the pml model suggests the strongest et enhancement and its trend 0 98 mm yr2 is roughly twice that of the arts model 0 48 mm yr2 and ten times that of the pt jpl model 0 10 mm yr2 fig 4 also shows the interannual variation and trend of each et component fig 4b d which explains the reason for the difference in et trends between the models among the three models the pml model gives the strongest increase in et 1 36 mm yr2 and the smallest decrease in es 0 19 mm yr2 making the trend of et simulated by this model the most pronounced 0 98 mm yr2 in contrast the pt jpl model shows the most pronounced decreasing trend in ei 0 23 mm yr2 and es 0 92 mm yr2 simulations leading to the weakest increase in et 0 10 mm yr2 we also examined the ratio of each et component to total et for the three models across china on a multi year average scale fig 5 the three models generally share the same first order et partitioning nationwide et is dominated by es followed by et and ei however specific to the ratio of each component to et there was a large discrepancy between the models for instance the ei et ranged from 3 1 to 14 5 and the et et ranged from 29 2 to 37 0 overall the arts and pml models yielded similar et partitioning results whereas the pt jpl model yielded a higher ei et and a lower et et potential reasons for this are discussed later 3 2 model evaluation at the flux sites model performance was evaluated against observations from 12 flux towers the results indicated that none of the models consistently outperformed the others at all flux sites table 2 confirming that each model has unique strengths overall the pml model outperformed the other two models it achieved the highest kge score at 8 of 12 sites while the arts and pt jpl models obtained the highest kge scores separately at the other two sites fig 6 compares the observed and simulated et values for three biomes that is grasslands croplands and forestlands for a more concise presentation of the evaluation results the numbers in paratheses of the subsequent texts represent the kge scores for grassland sites the arts and pml models performed similarly 0 72 versus 0 72 and remarkably outperformed the pt jpl model 0 42 for cropland sites the pml model performed the best 0 75 followed by pt jpl 0 59 and arts 0 53 the three models exhibited higher kge scores 0 73 0 79 for forest sites than for grassland and cropland sites and the relative ranking of the models was the same as that for cropland sites in terms of the kge score in addition the three models systematically underestimated et at the grassland and cropland sites as indicated by the negative bias values fig 6 3 3 model evaluation at the basin scale we also evaluated the performance of the three et models for 286 basins in china using et estimates from the water balance method wb et as benchmark data overall the three models reproduce the mean annual et over the test basins well the kge scores of the three models were above 0 70 fig 7 the pml model outperformed the other two models as indicated by its higher r2 0 71 and kge score 0 79 the pt jpl model is slightly inferior to the pml model but performs better than the arts model the kge scores for the pt jpl and arts models were 0 76 and 0 70 respectively 4 discussions 4 1 the simulation results our results indicate that the nationwide annual et estimates by the pml and arts models are significantly p 0 05 increasing since the early 1980 s this result agree with prior finding bai and liu 2018 li et al 2021 liu et al 2022 some studies have attributed the increasing et in china over the past three decades li et al 2018 bai et al 2020 li et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b su et al 2022 two general conclusions were drawn from these studies i climate changes rather than vegetation greening dominate the variability and trend in et and ii vegetation greening is an important contributor to the increase in et in addition the three models used here presented large discrepancies in et trend see fig 3d previous studies have also reported divergent trends in et estimates in china zhang et al 2016c bai and liu 2018 yin et al 2020 it is challenging for an et model to capture et trend adequately even if it has good performance statistics miralles et al 2015 differences in the model forcing data structures and parameters can affect et trends given that uniform forcing data were used for the three models discrepancies in model estimates may largely stem from differences in model structures and parameters the three models showed considerable differences in et partitioning figs 4 and 7 compared to the other two models the pt jpl model yielded a higher ei et ratio but a lower et et ratio for example the ratio of ei et exceeded 40 for parts of northeastern and southern china this ratio is considerably higher than that reported in the literature for forested areas of southern china zhang et al 2006 su et al 2016 liu et al 2018 sun et al 2022 overestimation of ei et by the pt jpl model has also been reported by luo et al 2022 in china and by miralles et al 2015 on a global scale the overestimation of ei by the pt jpl model is likely due to its unreasonable parametrization scheme for relative surface wetness fwet also called the wet canopy fraction the pt jpl model calculates fwet as a function of the fourth power of relative humidity rh and assumes that canopy interception only occurs when rh exceeds 70 see appendix a2 this assumption is theoretically flawed because rh is not a good indicator of precipitation precipitation and rh are often decoupled particularly in the humid regions of china where high relative humidity but no precipitation is common during the rainy season luo et al 2022 therefore the current fwet equation in the pt jpl model overestimates the probability of precipitation resulting in an overestimated ei the overestimation of ei directly results in the underestimation of et because they are tightly coupled in the model a negative correlation between ei and et unrealistic et partitioning for the pt jpl model has also been reported in previous studies miralles et al 2015 talsma et al 2018 luo et al 2022 therefore it is necessary to re parameterize the ei scheme for the pt jpl model to achieve reasonable et partitioning talsma et al 2018 explained why the total et estimates from different models are consistent but the individual component estimates diverge widely they found that systematic biases in the component estimates were greatly mitigated when they were aggregated into total et estimates this finding suggests that accurate total et estimates do not ensure reasonable component estimates our results also show that the three models systematically underestimated et at cropland sites see table 2 and fig 5 an underestimation of et has also been reported by yang et al 2010 fang et al 2020 and luo et al 2022 for cropland sites in china using different models the reasons for et underestimation at cropland sites are easy to understand croplands often require extensive irrigation to maintain high yields especially in arid regions most irrigation water eventually evaporates into the atmosphere resulting in high et fluxes in the croplands if models do not explicitly account for the effects of irrigation on et or assign specific parameters to croplands for example the arts and pt jpl models an underestimation of et is likely to occur for these models 4 2 why does the pml model perform better than the other two models the answer to this question may help provide inspiration for improving et models by revisiting the model structure it can be observed that the arts and pml models are similar in the pet calculation both are based on the pm equation however a more sophisticated gc equation was used in the pml model eq a 18 this equation accounts for the combined effect of radiation temperature and vapor pressure deficit vpd on stomatal aperture and has been widely tested at many flux sites worldwide li et al 2015 zhang et al 2016b in contrast the simple gc equation used in the arts model only includes the effects of rh and lai and lacks extensive validation another apparent difference in model strictures between arts and pml is that the latter considers differences in the responses of es and et to soil water deficit the es rate is mainly constrained by surface soil moisture or et al 2013 whereas the et rate is jointly regulated by root zone soil moisture and vpd fang et al 2021 abundant evidence indicates that vpd plays a more critical role in regulating et rate than soil moisture in humid regions novick et al 2016 lu et al 2022 vegetation in humid regions dominated by forests can maintain water demands for photosynthesis by absorbing deep soil water and groundwater through its deep root system even in the case of a surface soil water deficit zhu et al 2019 green et al 2020 some sap flow observation experiments also support the conclusion that the vpd dominates the temporal variability of et in humid regions herbst et al 2007 clausnitzer et al 2011 however in dry regions the relative importance of soil moisture and vpd on et may differ from that in humid regions liu et al 2020 vegetation in dry regions is usually dominated by grass where topsoil water deficit would also reduce the et rate for short root vegetation such as grass this may be a reason for the arts model performing better in grassland sites than in cropland and forest sites the superiority of the pml model may partly be due to its land cover based parameter configuration unlike the arts and pt jpl models with constant parameters the pml model configures its parameter gsmax according to the land cover type that is the gsmax lookup table constructed by zhang et al 2010b based on budyko based parameter calibration see section 2 1 the budyko based parameter calibration has a solid scientific foundation on the one hand budyko based models take into account the combined effects of water and energy limitations on et and can provide reliable multi year average et estimates which have been confirmed by numerous studies yang et al 2007 li et al 2013 yang et al 2014 on the other hand budyko based calibration restricts et estimates to a water balance framework compensating for the insufficiency of rs et models in considering water constraints thereby reducing the biases in et estimates some studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of budyko based calibration in improving the performance of et models zhang et al 2010b bai et al 2020 kim et al 2022 4 3 the direction of model improvements the three models still have room for improvement based on the evaluation results the arts model can be improved by i optimizing the parameter gsmax and ii considering the different responses of es and et to soil moisture deficit for simplicity the arts model sets its only parameter gsmax to a constant value gsmax 12 2 mm s for all vegetation types this value is close to the surface conductance of the reference crop 14 3 10 3m s corresponding to a surface resistance of 70 s m defined in the fao 56 method allen et al 1998 it is well known that the reference crop defined in the fao 56 pm method closely resembles open grasslands thus the value of gsmax in the arts model may be more suitable for et estimation in grasslands as shown in fig 6 it is recommended to reassign the gsmax value for each biome using available flux observations globally such as the fluxnet 2015 dataset pastorello et al 2020 in addition different water constraint functions for es and et are suggested to be designed for the arts model given the difference in the responses of es and et to water deficit the new constraint function for et should respond more slowly to water deficit than the constraint function for es the pt jpl model balances the model complexity and accuracy well and has been widely used for modeling large scale et michel et al 2016 shao et al 2019 pan et al 2020 the major problem with the pt jpl model is unrealistic et partitioning the model is likely to overestimate the ratio of ei et and underestimate the ratio of et et however the accuracy of the total et estimation is acceptable see figs 4 and 5 luo et al 2022 provided an in depth analysis of the reasons for the overestimation of ei et and underestimation of e t et in the pt jpl model they found that a negative correlation exists between ei and et overestimated ei must be accompanied by underestimated et and vice versa making the total et estimation relatively reasonable under the premise of modifying the model structure as little as possible the improvement in the pt jpl model can be considered by increasing the exponent of the f wet function f wet rh4 see eq a10 to reduce the overestimation of ei et whether increasing the exponent of f wet function affects the performance of the pt jpl model requires extensive evaluation the major problem of the pml model lies in the constraint scheme of es similar to most rs et models fisher et al 2008 zhang et al 2010a mu et al 2011 the pml model uses meteorological variables to indirectly represent the water constraint on es f see eq a17 because of a lack of spatiotemporally continuous soil moisture observations zhang et al 2010b the pml model calculates f as the ratio of the accumulated precipitation to the equilibrium evaporation over the previous 30 days see eq a17 where precipitation and equilibrium evaporation act as the supply and consumption terms of surface soil moisture respectively the method for f estimates is easy to use but has some drawbacks first solid precipitation snow does not immediately replenish current soil moisture and it has a lagging effect on the soil moisture supply ignoring precipitation states may overestimate f during the cold season and underestimate f during the melt season second the method for f estimates assigns the same weight to 30 days of antecedent precipitation equilibrium evaporation for simplicity this may lead to unrealistic f estimates because the effect of precipitation on soil moisture gradually decreases over time after a precipitation event these two drawbacks of f estimation may greatly affect the accuracy of et estimates in areas with sparse vegetation where et is dominated by es better f estimates can be achieved by distinguishing precipitation types rainfall or snow and adding a weight that decays over time to f estimates these two modifications are easy to implement because many relevant empirical formulas are available 5 conclusions in this study we evaluated three et models in china based on flux tower observations and basin scale water balance estimates the evaluation results indicated that the arts model had better applicability in grassland sites than in cropland and forest sites the pt jpl model significantly overestimated the ratio of ei et and underestimated the ratio of et et because of the unreasonable parameterization scheme of f wet overall the pml model performed the best among the models and was recommended as the preferred model for et simulations in addition the three models showed high consistency in estimating nationwide multi year average et and its spatial pattern but considerable discrepancies in et trends and component partitioning therefore it is not recommended to use a single model to simulate et particularly when focusing on et trends and or components we also provided specific modification suggestions

2449,streamflow and its components such as baseflow are momentous links of the hydrological cycle and their spatiotemporal variations are affected by both climate change and human activities cchu however discrepancies in the influence of cchu on streamflow and hydrological components are not fully understood in this study meteorological factors precipitation and potential evapotranspiration and hydrological variables streamflow and baseflow were analyzed to quantify the responses of the streamflow and baseflow in the bahe river to the cchu during 1959 2016 the hydrometeorological variables in the bahe river showed a downward trend except for the baseflow at the luolicun hydrological station llc while the mutation point at the maduwang hydrological station mdw was in 1989 and llc was mutated in 1980 and 1989 precipitation was closely related to streamflow in comparison with baseflow r 0 871 0 034 whereas potential evapotranspiration was the opposite the streamflow and baseflow at mdw had closer relationships with precipitation than at llc r 0 828 0 077 while llc was more affected by potential evapotranspiration r 0 698 0 004 streamflow and baseflow upstream of the bahe river were mainly affected by human activities 67 75 and 74 78 respectively and baseflow midstream due to climate change 90 147 the contributions of climate change and human activities to midstream streamflow were 37 75 and 25 63 respectively our findings highlight the responses of streamflow and baseflow to environmental changes which will enhance our understanding of the response mechanisms of the hydrological cycle in a changing environment keywords streamflow baseflow bahe river climate change human activities data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction streamflow is usually divided into surface runoff and baseflow the latter originating from groundwater storage and other from delayed sources hall 1968 that replenish surface water as important links in the water cycle streamflow and baseflow are influenced by the two major drivers climate change and human activities cchu which alter the structure and function of hydrological and water resource systems yang et al 2020 quantifying the influence of these two major factors on streamflow and baseflow has become a frontier issue in the field of hydrology berdimbetov et al 2020 wei et al 2020 mo et al 2021 tang et al 2021 thereby providing insights into the mechanism of hydrological changes zhai and tao 2017 zhang et al 2019b wang et al 2020b sharifi et al 2021 climate variability and change and human activity affect hydrological processes and water resources mo et al 2018 the precipitation of the bahe river showed a fluctuating downward trend and will continue to show a downward trend over the next few years song et al 2017 previous research on the impacts of climate change has focused on two main aspects one is the influence of climate change on sediment transport xia et al 2018 and precipitation has a greater impact on the relationship between water and sediment compared with other climatic factors however research has focused on the relationship between climate change and hydrological processes hu et al 2017 he et al 2019 current research on responses of the hydrological processes to cchu has mainly focused on the total streamflow while little attention has been given to groundwater nyenje and batelaan 2009 mu et al 2022 climate change affects streamflow by altering precipitation and potential evapotranspiration thereby affecting regional hydrological processes and the distribution of water resources xia et al 2014 zhai and tao 2017 wang et al 2020b xu et al 2021 human activities e g land use changes and deforestation have increased with economic growth resulting in water resource issues kong et al 2016 sharifi et al 2021 at present the methods commonly used to study the influence of cchu on streamflow include statistical analysis the climate elasticity coefficient method and the establishment of hydrological models in hydrological models the widely used soil and water assessment tool swat model simulates streamflow by setting different scenarios to quantitatively analyze streamflow responses to cchu fan et al 2010 zhang et al 2012 xu et al 2013 dong et al 2014 yin et al 2017 zhang et al 2017b however hydrological models require more parameters and the data requirements for the simulation area are greater zeng et al 2015 wu et al 2017a wang et al 2021b statistical analysis methods include regression models lei et al 2021 wang et al 2022 and the slope change ratio of cumulative quantity scrcq wang et al 2015 wu et al 2017b cheng et al 2019 wang et al 2020a wang et al 2021b double cumulative curve and reduction methods zhang et al 2010 these methods have been widely used to analyze the impacts of cchu on streamflow but the reduction and scrcq methods have rarely been applied to baseflow in addition studies on the differences in the response of streamflow and baseflow to cchu are lacking because of the complex nature of the streamflow generation process exploring the variation characteristics and influencing factors of its components is conducive to clarifying the mechanism of streamflow change and maintaining regional ecological balance baseflow is a key component of streamflow and is a significant link in the hydrological cycle studies have also focused on baseflow and its influencing factors fan et al 2013 huang et al 2016 sun et al 2020 yao et al 2021 bacause of the increasing intensity of cchu unlike streamflow baseflow has not been agreed upon in theory and baseflow cannot be directly obtained by experiments therefore there is still an uncertainty in the analysis of baseflow in existing studies the digital filtering method is based on the basic data of daily flow for high and low frequency analysis and has been widely used because of its objectivity and repeatability gnann et al 2019 tram et al 2019 voutchkova et al 2019 based on previous studies zhang et al 2014a cheng et al 2016 zhang et al 2017a zhang et al 2019a zhang et al 2020 the baseflow separation method was evaluated and improved which effectively improved the estimation accuracy of the baseflow and achieved better simulation results in large scale watersheds zhang et al 2014b zhang et al 2019a zhang et al 2020 lyu et al 2022 however few studies have been conducted in the qinling mountains as an important water source in central china the qinling mountains provide water to the guanzhong plain the most critical water source is baseflow which plays an essential role in the regional ecological health and urban water supply climate and underlying surface changes have profound impacts on streamflow and baseflow in a typical basin of the qinling mountains using a variety of methods to quantitatively evaluate the impacts of cchu on streamflow and baseflow in a typical basin of the qinling mountains will help solve the regional water shortage and provide rational suggestions for promoting ecological protection and high quality economic development of the yellow river basin to fully understand the variation trends and dynamic mechanisms of streamflow and baseflow in a typical basin of the qinling mountains this study quantitatively analyzed the streamflow and baseflow in the bahe river from 1959 to 2016 the objectives are as follows 1 separate baseflow using daily streamflow data 2 analyze the trends of streamflow baseflow meteorological variables and land use changes 3 quantify and analyze the responses of streamflow and baseflow to cchu 2 study area and data sources 2 1 study area the bahe river is a first class tributary of the weihe river originating in jianyuling lantian county shaanxi province north of the qinling mountains with a length of approximately 78 km from north to south covering an area of 2581 km2 the upper and middle reaches of the river system are well developed with more than 60 tributaries at all levels the bahe river belongs to the warm temperate continental monsoon region with four distinct seasons and its terrain is high in the south and low in the north influenced by topographic and meteorological factors the precipitation in the basin shows an increasing trend from north to south the average annual precipitation is 720 mm and precipitation is mostly concentrated from july to october the land use types in the basin are mainly forest and cultivated land accounting for 85 of the basin area and the vegetation belongs to a warm temperate coniferous and broad leaved mixed forest in recent years with the expansion of urbanization the population in the basin has grown and the area of construction land has rapidly expanded the gauging stations of luolicun llc and maduwang mdw are located in the upper and middle reaches of the main river channel respectively fig 1 2 2 data sources land use data were obtained from the data center for resources and environmental sciences at the chinese academy of sciences resdc https www resdc cn daily streamflow two hydrometric stations and during 1959 2016 was collected from the hydrologic yearbook of the yellow river basin to separate baseflow the annual average streamflow and baseflow calculated based on the daily

were collected from the national meteorological administration of china https data cma cn including daily precipitation average maximum temperature average minimum temperature sunshine duration average wind speed and relative humidity the potential evapotranspiration data used in this study were calculated using the penman monteith method the two hydrological stations were used as water outlets to calculate basin averaged precipitation and et0 in the upstream and midstream regions of the bahe river the locations of the hydrometric and meteorological stations are summarized in table 1

zhang et al 2019a 2 the linear analysis mann kendall trend test song et al 2021 and theil sen median methods were used to analyze the annual change trends in precipitation potential evapotranspiration streamflow and baseflow 3 the cumulative anomaly and mann kendall mutation point test method were used to analyze the mutation points 4 a continuous wavelet transform cwt hu et al 2017 was used to discuss the multiple time scale characteristics of meteorological and hydrological variables 5 land use transfer matrices and change maps were utilized to analyze land use changes in the bahe river 6 correlation and partial correlation analyses were used to analyze the correlation between meteorological and hydrological variables from a qualitative perspective 7 the scrcq wang et al 2015 cheng et al 2019 wang et al 2020a wang et al 2021b and reduction methods were used to quantify the contribution rates of the cchu to streamflow and baseflow 3 1 mann kendall test and the theil sen median method the mann kendall test was used to analyze the trends of long term hydrometeorological variables in this study because the method is widely used wu et al 2020 lian et al 2021 and has the advantage that the measurements are not required to obey a normal distribution or affected by missing values the theil sen median method also known as sen s slope theil 1950 sen 1968 was used to calculate trend values and often used in conjunction with the mann kendall test 3 2 cumulative anomaly method the cumulative anomaly method was used to determine changing trends and mutation points wang et al 2015 wang et al 2021b specifically a positive or negative cumulative anomaly indicates that the corresponding data points are above or below average respectively 3 3 continuous wavelet transform the wavelet transform stretches the time series to time frequency intervals to identify local intermittent periods which is a useful mathematical tool for analyzing the periodic characteristics of several time series of hydrological variables the cwt can more accurately determine the periodicities in the time series and show their time dependencies which has advantages in the context of signal feature extraction hu et al 2017 3 4 land use transfer matrix the land use transfer matrix is a quantitative description of the change in land use types which reflects the dynamic process of mutual transformation of various land areas in the bahe river over a period of time based on the analyses of land use types in 1980 and 2010 this study obtained a land use transition matrix which was used to calculate the area changes of each land use type from 1980 to 2010 3 5 correlation and partial correlation analysis correlation and partial correlation analyses were used to study the close correlation between hydrometeorological variables before the correlation analysis the data were standardized so that they obeyed a normal distribution partial correlation analysis was adopted because it can eliminate the influence of the third variable to better analyze the correlation between the other two variables 3 6 baseflow separation method the lyne hollick method lyne and hollick 1979 is based on signal analysis which uses different wavelengths corresponding to quick flow qq and baseflow qb to extract baseflow in streamflow it first calculates the quick flow qq as 1 q q i α q q i 1 1 α 2 q i q i 1 where q is the total streamflow m3 d qq is the quick flow mm d i is the time step days and α is the recession constant 1 day the baseflow qb m3 d can subsequently be calculated as qi minus qq the recession constant typically adopts an empirical value of 0 925 which makes it difficult to reflect the basic properties of the watershed brutsaert and nieber 1977 proposed the recession analysis method bn77 and cheng et al 2016 developed the abit method to automate the recession analysis method in this study the recession constant was estimated using the abit method and then the recession constant was used to separate the baseflow by lyne hollick filter the abit method was used successfully to revise the digital filter baseflow separation method the performance has been validated by the comparison with chemical hydrograph methods see zhang et al 2017a showing that the revised method was physically meaningful and noticeably improved the estimated accuracy of non tracer baseflow separation methods zhang et al 2017a and has been widely used to separate the baseflow in many catchments zhang et al 2019a lyu et al 2022 including the weihe river 3 7 quantification method 3 7 1 reduction method according to the mutation point the period was divided into the base and change periods assuming that the base period was not affected by human activity the differences between the measured streamflow depth baseflow depth in the change period and values in the base period were influenced by cchu the reduction method established the precipitation streamflow and precipitation baseflow correlations before the mutation and the precipitation during the change period was introduced into the regression equation of the base period to quantitatively evaluate the influences of human activities on streamflow and baseflow 2 δ r y 2 y 1 δ r 1 δ r 2 3 δ r 1 y 2 y 1 4 δ r 2 δ r δ r 1 y 2 y 2 5 y 1 δ r 1 δ r 100 6 y 2 δ r 2 δ r 100 δr is the amount of change in streamflow depth δr1 is the amount of influence of changes in precipitation and δr2 is the amount of influence of human activities where y2 is the streamflow depth regression sequence after mutation y2 is the streamflow depth after mutation and y1 is the streamflow depth before mutation y1 is the contribution of climate change to streamflow change and y2 is the contribution of human activities the contribution rate of the baseflow is calculated using the same method 3 7 2 scrcq the scrcq method wang et al 2012 was used to quantify the influence of cchu on streamflow changes the slopes of the linear relationship between the cumulative streamflow and time are sra and srb for the two periods before and after the change point respectively the slopes of the linear relationship between the cumulative precipitation and time are spa and spb for the two periods before and after the change point respectively and the slopes of the linear relationship between the cumulative potential transpiration and time are set0a and set0b for the two periods before and after the change point respectively the scrcq method was calculated as follows the contribution rate of baseflow was calculated using the same method 7 r sr s rb s ra s ra 8 r sp s pb s pa s pa 9 r s e t 0 s e t 0 b s e t 0 a s e t 0 a 10 c p 100 r sp r sr 11 c e t 0 100 r s e t 0 r sr 12 c h 100 c p c e t 0 4 results 4 1 baseflow separation the abit method adopted in this study to estimate the recession constant performed significantly better than the default parameters 0 925 our baseflow separation results showed that the average timescale recession constant and baseflow index bfi in the bahe river were 26 15 0 45 days 0 962 0 0006 and 0 303 0 007 in 1959 2016 respectively fig 2 and table 2 4 2 trends of hydrometeorological variables the theil sen median and mann kendall nonparametric tests were used to identify the magnitude of trends and detect the significance of hydrometeorological variables at annual scales from 1959 to 2016 as shown in fig 3 the maximum annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration were 1165 7 mm in 1983 and 918 86 mm in 1995 and the minimums were 426 25 mm in 1995 and 490 13 mm in 1984 the annual change trends of the basin averaged precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in the upstream and midstream regions of the bahe river were basically the same for two main reasons the first reason was that the basin was small so the spatial difference of the annual meteorological data was not obvious the second reason was that the lack of meteorological station data caused less data can be used the annual streamflow and baseflow at mdw were 1 25 108 10 51 108 m3 and 0 52 108 3 24 108 m3 respectively and the mean values of streamflow and baseflow were 4 55 108 m3 and 1 41 108 m3 respectively however the annual streamflow and baseflow of llc were 0 66 108 5 31 108 m3 mean 2 18 108 m3 and 0 26 108 1 49 108 m3 mean 0 65 108 m3 respectively with respect to annual hydrometeorological variables over the study period significant decreasing trends were detected in the streamflow of mdw and precipitation of llc from 1959 to 2016 table 3 no significant trends were found in the annual potential evapotranspiration precipitation of mdw streamflow of llc and baseflow of mdw and llc the hydrometeorological variables in the bahe river showed a decreasing trend except for baseflow at llc the cwt power spectrum of the bahe river is shown in fig 4 the fine solid line indicates the influence cone and the energy spectrum outside the influence cone was not considered because it was susceptible to boundary effects the thick solid line indicates critical values that passed the 95 confidence level significance test the timescale change characteristics of annual precipitation potential evapotranspiration streamflow and baseflow in the upstream and midstream regions of the bahe river are similar as they are located in the same area the timescale characteristics of streamflow were similar to those of precipitation whereas the differences were mainly due to different cycles the streamflow of llc had four timescale changes 1 2a 1997 2004 2 5 3a 1964 1965 4 5 5 1985 1990 and 7 9a 1977 1984 however the significant difference between precipitation and streamflow was that precipitation failed the significance test during 1997 1984 moreover the timescale characteristics of streamflow in mdw had similar change periods as llc 1 2a 1999 2004 2 4a 1964 1968 4 6a 1983 1989 and 7 8a 1976 1983 the basin averaged precipitation midstream of the bahe river has two cycles which is different from the streamflow series in 1964 1968 and 1976 1983 which did not pass the significance test the differences in precipitation and streamflow may be due to the combined effects of other influencing factors the potential evaporation at llc had two cycles whereas that at mdw had one cycle the streamflow of the bahe river had four cycles while the baseflow had two cycles and they had similar timescale change characteristics 4 3 mutation points the determination of the mutation points is related to the division of the base and change periods 1988 was considered the mutation point of precipitation according to the principle of the cumulative anomaly method fig 5 similarly the mutation points of potential evapotranspiration were 1979 and 1993 and the mutation point of the streamflow and baseflow at mdw was 1989 while llc had two mutation points 1980 and 1989 the mann kendall method obtained a large number of intersection points and was more concentrated and the trends of the hydrometeorological variables fluctuated fig 6 therefore the cumulative anomaly method was used to analyze the mutation points 4 4 contributions of cchu to streamflow and baseflow change the reduction and scrcq methods were used to estimate the contributions of the cchu to streamflow and baseflow change in the bahe river during 1959 2016 the research period of mdw was divided into the base period 1959 1989 and the change period 1990 2016 while llc was divided into the base period 1959 1980 change period i 1981 1989 and change period ii 1990 2016 the basin averaged precipitation at llc during the base period and the total change period 1981 2016 were 786 83 and 744 62 mm respectively of which the precipitation in change period i and change period ii were 864 79 and 704 56 mm while potential evapotranspiration in the base period and total change period were 921 92 and 852 98 mm respectively and 782 65 and 876 42 mm in change period i and change period ii respectively in change period i compared to the base period precipitation increased significantly while potential evapotranspiration decreased significantly the basin averaged precipitation at mdw during the base period and the change period were 801 8 and 700 46 mm respectively while potential evapotranspiration in the two periods were 888 28 and 887 99 mm change period ii and the base period had little change in streamflow and baseflow at llc therefore the study mainly compared the differences between change period i and the base period based on the reduction method the contributions of climate change and human activities to the streamflow were 75 and 25 at mdw respectively whereas the contributions to the baseflow were 147 and 47 respectively the contributions of climate change and human activities to streamflow were 25 and 75 respectively at llc whereas the contributions to baseflow were 22 and 78 table 4 according to the scrcq method the contributions of climate change and human activities to streamflow at mdw were 37 and 63 respectively while those of baseflow 90 and 10 respectively the contributions of climate change and human activities to the streamflow at llc were 33 and 67 respectively whereas the contribution rates to the baseflow were 26 and 74 respectively table 5 therefore streamflow and baseflow upstream of the bahe river were mainly affected by human activities 67 75 and 74 78 respectively and baseflow midstream were mainly affected due to climate change 90 147 the contributions of climate change and human activities to the streamflow at mdw were 37 75 and 25 63 respectively 5 discussion 5 1 baseflow estimation the drainage characteristic storage delay brutsaert 2005 and storage coefficient zhang et al 2014a zhang et al 2014b are reflected in the characteristic drainage timescale of the baseflow both the timescale and bfi displayed an increasing trend from upstream to midstream in the river recession processes in a variety of stream reaches can also change with catchment characteristics zhang et al 2019a the land use types at mdw and llc were mainly farmland therefore the timescale and bfi showed only a small difference between the two hydrological gauges 5 2 responses of streamflow and baseflow to climate change the results showed that the annual precipitation displayed the same trend as streamflow and baseflow in the bahe river with the potential evapotranspiration showing the opposite trend the relationships between annual streamflow baseflow precipitation and potential evapotranspiration showed that streamflow and baseflow had closer positive relationships with precipitation in comparison with potential evapotranspiration except of baseflow at llc table 6 and fig 7 however potential evapotranspiration was negatively correlated with streamflow and baseflow precipitation had a closer relationship with streamflow than baseflow while potential evapotranspiration showed the opposite trend the streamflow in the bahe river was mainly recharged by precipitation and the infiltration of precipitation was affected by vegetation and soil resulting in fewer precipitation effects on baseflow in addition the increase in potential evapotranspiration led to high soil water evaporation therefore soil water recharged by precipitation decreased thereby indirectly reducing the generation of baseflow chen et al 2006 therefore baseflow in the bahe river is more susceptible to potential evapotranspiration moreover the streamflow and baseflow at mdw had a closer relationship with precipitation than llc while llc was more affected by potential evapotranspiration this is mainly because llc is located upstream of the bahe river basin in the qinling mountains with substantial vegetation cover mo et al 2016 mdw was less affected by vegetation therefore precipitation was more likely to contribute to surface runoff whereas llc was more susceptible to potential evapotranspiration many scholars have studied the impact of climate change on streamflow and baseflow in different regions most of the results showed that precipitation had a more significant impact on steamflow while baseflow was more affected by potential evapotranspiration lei et al 2018 mo et al 2021 the relationship between precipitation and streamflow was positive wu et al 2020 while potential evapotranspiration was negative li et al 2021 which are consistent with the results of this study in some special areas such as the qinghai tibet plateau and the northwest areas climate change has a stronger impact on streamflow and baseflow because climate change leads to melting of glaciers and changes in the vertical distribution of permafrost and vegetation which lead to changes in streamflow and baseflow fan et al 2013 yang et al 2020 li et al 2021 5 3 responses of streamflow and baseflow to human activities with societal and economic development the impact of human activities on hydrological processes has increased we tried to identify the long term impacts of land use in the bahe river from 1959 to 2016 farmland forest and grassland were the main land use types over the study period fig 8 in terms of the spatial distribution of land use patterns forests were widely distributed especially in the east central and south of the bahe river at higher altitudes in contrast construction land was distributed at dots or blocks along the river and the overall distribution was sporadic the conversion of grassland to farmland mainly occurred in the northwest region whereas the conversion of farmland to grassland was concentrated in the northeast northwest and south regions from 1980 to 2010 the total area of farmland and forest in bahe river increased by 44 36 km2 and 35 46 km2 respectively table 7 further analysis demonstrated that population growth drove the conversion of grassland to farmland 36 24 km2 and rapid urbanization had led to the expansion of construction land 21 63 km2 over the study period urbanization will lead to a decrease in streamflow and baseflow through large amounts of water withdrawal by agriculture industry and life moreover the policy of returning farmland to forest or grassland had driven the large scale conversion of farmland into forest and grassland 9 36 km2 and 15 81 km2 which could also contribute to the decrease in streamflow and baseflow in addition to the impacts of climate change many scholars have studied the impacts of human activities on the streamflow and baseflow in different regions human activities have gradually become the dominant factor controlling changes in watershed streamflow and baseflow wang et al 2015 chen et al 2018 wang et al 2018 the impacts of land use on streamflow were mainly due to the conversion of grassland and cultivated land the increase in vegetation coverage promotes canopy interception reduces peak streamflow and increases baseflow wu et al 2020 the determinants in different river reaches were also inconsistent climate change in the tarim river played a major role in baseflow at the headstream and temperature was the decisive factor with an increase in precipitation the bfi decreased indicating that an increase in precipitation can promote more surface runoff human activities are more significant in the main reaches li et al 2021 vegetation changes in the upper yellow river basin were the dominant factors with an increase in vegetation coverage or leaf area index lai streamflow decreases linearly wang et al 2021a other studies have also pointed out that the impacts of human activities are more significant in the loess plateau wang et al 2022 owing to the choice of data and methods the results of different studies also had certain differences lian et al 2021 5 4 uncertainty analysis to simultaneously quantify the effects of cchu on streamflow and baseflow and analyze the differences between streamflow and baseflow this study selected two quantification methods reduction and scrcq which had some uncertainties 1 there was uncertainty in the selection of parameters the influences of different meteorological factors precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration on hydrological variables will cause certain differences and the quantitative contribution rate of different study areas or timescales will also differ in this study the scrcq method analyzed the impacts of climate changes on hydrological variables based on two meteorological factors precipitation and potential evapotranspiration while the reduction method only focused on the influence of precipitation on streamflow and baseflow in terms of climate change so there were some differences between the two methods according to the results of the correlation analysis the streamflow and baseflow at mdw had closer relationships with precipitation than at llc and precipitation was closely related to streamflow in comparison with baseflow so contributions of climate changes to streamflow and baseflow based on the reduction method were larger than the scrcq method future studies should improve the method to consider the differences in the impacts of more factors on hydrological variables 2 owing to the lack of specific data concerning human activities the scrcq method is frequently used to first estimate the effect of climate change and then regard the remaining amount as the impact of human activities which has uncertainties future research should analyze and quantify the contribution rate differences caused by specific human activities 3 streamflow variations are driven by complex factors and interactions between these drivers including climate change and variability climate change induced vegetation change and human activities the two quantification methods ignored the impact of the interaction of various factors on streamflow components combined human activities climate change and variability and hydrological variables are complex and influence each other vegetation restoration was significantly different in the individual geomorphological areas of the bahe river the increase in vegetation coverage in the upstream region was the most significant and the midstream was slow whereas downstream caused vegetation degradation due to the increase in construction land in addition the impact of annual precipitation on vegetation cover varies greatly in different regions and the impact on the middle reaches is significantly positively correlated yang et al 2022 climate change affects vegetation coverage which in turn affects changes in streamflow different types of anthropogenic activities e g agricultural irrigation and land use change reinforce or inhibit each other wang et al 2018 thereby indirectly affecting streamflow changes 6 conclusions this study utilized various methods to study the trends periodic changes and correlations between meteorological factors precipitation and potential evapotranspiration and hydrological variables streamflow and baseflow in the bahe river from 1959 to 2016 and quantified the effects of cchu on streamflow and baseflow the main conclusions are as follows 1 the characteristic drainage timescale of baseflow and bfi have significant spatial attributes and an increasing trend from the upstream to downstream the average timescale and bfi are 26 15 0 45 days and 0 303 0 007 respectively 2 from 1959 to 2016 significant decreasing trends were detected in the streamflow at mdw and the precipitation at llc no significant trends were found in the annual potential evapotranspiration and precipitation of mdw streamflow at llc and baseflow at mdw and llc the hydrometeorological variables in the bahe river showed a decreasing trend except for baseflow at llc 3 the streamflow was susceptible to precipitation whereas the baseflow was susceptible to potential evapotranspiration in the bahe river mdw was more affected by precipitation whereas llc was more affected by potential evapotranspiration 4 the responses of streamflow and baseflow to cchu were unequal streamflow and baseflow upstream of the bahe river were mainly affected by human activities 67 75 and 74 78 respectively and baseflow midstream due to climate change 90 147 the contributions of climate change and human activities to the streamflow at mdw were 37 75 and 25 63 respectively credit authorship contribution statement yuna shi formal analysis methodology writing original draft software visualization jinxi song

2449,streamflow and its components such as baseflow are momentous links of the hydrological cycle and their spatiotemporal variations are affected by both climate change and human activities cchu however discrepancies in the influence of cchu on streamflow and hydrological components are not fully understood in this study meteorological factors precipitation and potential evapotranspiration and hydrological variables streamflow and baseflow were analyzed to quantify the responses of the streamflow and baseflow in the bahe river to the cchu during 1959 2016 the hydrometeorological variables in the bahe river showed a downward trend except for the baseflow at the luolicun hydrological station llc while the mutation point at the maduwang hydrological station mdw was in 1989 and llc was mutated in 1980 and 1989 precipitation was closely related to streamflow in comparison with baseflow r 0 871 0 034 whereas potential evapotranspiration was the opposite the streamflow and baseflow at mdw had closer relationships with precipitation than at llc r 0 828 0 077 while llc was more affected by potential evapotranspiration r 0 698 0 004 streamflow and baseflow upstream of the bahe river were mainly affected by human activities 67 75 and 74 78 respectively and baseflow midstream due to climate change 90 147 the contributions of climate change and human activities to midstream streamflow were 37 75 and 25 63 respectively our findings highlight the responses of streamflow and baseflow to environmental changes which will enhance our understanding of the response mechanisms of the hydrological cycle in a changing environment keywords streamflow baseflow bahe river climate change human activities data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction streamflow is usually divided into surface runoff and baseflow the latter originating from groundwater storage and other from delayed sources hall 1968 that replenish surface water as important links in the water cycle streamflow and baseflow are influenced by the two major drivers climate change and human activities cchu which alter the structure and function of hydrological and water resource systems yang et al 2020 quantifying the influence of these two major factors on streamflow and baseflow has become a frontier issue in the field of hydrology berdimbetov et al 2020 wei et al 2020 mo et al 2021 tang et al 2021 thereby providing insights into the mechanism of hydrological changes zhai and tao 2017 zhang et al 2019b wang et al 2020b sharifi et al 2021 climate variability and change and human activity affect hydrological processes and water resources mo et al 2018 the precipitation of the bahe river showed a fluctuating downward trend and will continue to show a downward trend over the next few years song et al 2017 previous research on the impacts of climate change has focused on two main aspects one is the influence of climate change on sediment transport xia et al 2018 and precipitation has a greater impact on the relationship between water and sediment compared with other climatic factors however research has focused on the relationship between climate change and hydrological processes hu et al 2017 he et al 2019 current research on responses of the hydrological processes to cchu has mainly focused on the total streamflow while little attention has been given to groundwater nyenje and batelaan 2009 mu et al 2022 climate change affects streamflow by altering precipitation and potential evapotranspiration thereby affecting regional hydrological processes and the distribution of water resources xia et al 2014 zhai and tao 2017 wang et al 2020b xu et al 2021 human activities e g land use changes and deforestation have increased with economic growth resulting in water resource issues kong et al 2016 sharifi et al 2021 at present the methods commonly used to study the influence of cchu on streamflow include statistical analysis the climate elasticity coefficient method and the establishment of hydrological models in hydrological models the widely used soil and water assessment tool swat model simulates streamflow by setting different scenarios to quantitatively analyze streamflow responses to cchu fan et al 2010 zhang et al 2012 xu et al 2013 dong et al 2014 yin et al 2017 zhang et al 2017b however hydrological models require more parameters and the data requirements for the simulation area are greater zeng et al 2015 wu et al 2017a wang et al 2021b statistical analysis methods include regression models lei et al 2021 wang et al 2022 and the slope change ratio of cumulative quantity scrcq wang et al 2015 wu et al 2017b cheng et al 2019 wang et al 2020a wang et al 2021b double cumulative curve and reduction methods zhang et al 2010 these methods have been widely used to analyze the impacts of cchu on streamflow but the reduction and scrcq methods have rarely been applied to baseflow in addition studies on the differences in the response of streamflow and baseflow to cchu are lacking because of the complex nature of the streamflow generation process exploring the variation characteristics and influencing factors of its components is conducive to clarifying the mechanism of streamflow change and maintaining regional ecological balance baseflow is a key component of streamflow and is a significant link in the hydrological cycle studies have also focused on baseflow and its influencing factors fan et al 2013 huang et al 2016 sun et al 2020 yao et al 2021 bacause of the increasing intensity of cchu unlike streamflow baseflow has not been agreed upon in theory and baseflow cannot be directly obtained by experiments therefore there is still an uncertainty in the analysis of baseflow in existing studies the digital filtering method is based on the basic data of daily flow for high and low frequency analysis and has been widely used because of its objectivity and repeatability gnann et al 2019 tram et al 2019 voutchkova et al 2019 based on previous studies zhang et al 2014a cheng et al 2016 zhang et al 2017a zhang et al 2019a zhang et al 2020 the baseflow separation method was evaluated and improved which effectively improved the estimation accuracy of the baseflow and achieved better simulation results in large scale watersheds zhang et al 2014b zhang et al 2019a zhang et al 2020 lyu et al 2022 however few studies have been conducted in the qinling mountains as an important water source in central china the qinling mountains provide water to the guanzhong plain the most critical water source is baseflow which plays an essential role in the regional ecological health and urban water supply climate and underlying surface changes have profound impacts on streamflow and baseflow in a typical basin of the qinling mountains using a variety of methods to quantitatively evaluate the impacts of cchu on streamflow and baseflow in a typical basin of the qinling mountains will help solve the regional water shortage and provide rational suggestions for promoting ecological protection and high quality economic development of the yellow river basin to fully understand the variation trends and dynamic mechanisms of streamflow and baseflow in a typical basin of the qinling mountains this study quantitatively analyzed the streamflow and baseflow in the bahe river from 1959 to 2016 the objectives are as follows 1 separate baseflow using daily streamflow data 2 analyze the trends of streamflow baseflow meteorological variables and land use changes 3 quantify and analyze the responses of streamflow and baseflow to cchu 2 study area and data sources 2 1 study area the bahe river is a first class tributary of the weihe river originating in jianyuling lantian county shaanxi province north of the qinling mountains with a length of approximately 78 km from north to south covering an area of 2581 km2 the upper and middle reaches of the river system are well developed with more than 60 tributaries at all levels the bahe river belongs to the warm temperate continental monsoon region with four distinct seasons and its terrain is high in the south and low in the north influenced by topographic and meteorological factors the precipitation in the basin shows an increasing trend from north to south the average annual precipitation is 720 mm and precipitation is mostly concentrated from july to october the land use types in the basin are mainly forest and cultivated land accounting for 85 of the basin area and the vegetation belongs to a warm temperate coniferous and broad leaved mixed forest in recent years with the expansion of urbanization the population in the basin has grown and the area of construction land has rapidly expanded the gauging stations of luolicun llc and maduwang mdw are located in the upper and middle reaches of the main river channel respectively fig 1 2 2 data sources land use data were obtained from the data center for resources and environmental sciences at the chinese academy of sciences resdc https www resdc cn daily streamflow two hydrometric stations and during 1959 2016 was collected from the hydrologic yearbook of the yellow river basin to separate baseflow the annual average streamflow and baseflow calculated based on the daily streamflow and baseflow data were used to analyze the interannual variation trends of the hydrological variables meteorological data nine representative meteorological stations and during 1959 2016 were collected from the national meteorological administration of china https data cma cn including daily precipitation average maximum temperature average minimum temperature sunshine duration average wind speed and relative humidity the potential evapotranspiration data used in this study were calculated using the penman monteith method the two hydrological stations were used as water outlets to calculate basin averaged precipitation and et0 in the upstream and midstream regions of the bahe river the locations of the hydrometric and meteorological stations are summarized in table 1 3 methods the main methodology used in this study can be divided into seven parts 1 the baseflow separation method brutsaert and nieber 1977 lyne and hollick 1979 cheng et al 2016 zhang et al 2017a zhang et al 2019a 2 the linear analysis mann kendall trend test song et al 2021 and theil sen median methods were used to analyze the annual change trends in precipitation potential evapotranspiration streamflow and baseflow 3 the cumulative anomaly and mann kendall mutation point test method were used to analyze the mutation points 4 a continuous wavelet transform cwt hu et al 2017 was used to discuss the multiple time scale characteristics of meteorological and hydrological variables 5 land use transfer matrices and change maps were utilized to analyze land use changes in the bahe river 6 correlation and partial correlation analyses were used to analyze the correlation between meteorological and hydrological variables from a qualitative perspective 7 the scrcq wang et al 2015 cheng et al 2019 wang et al 2020a wang et al 2021b and reduction methods were used to quantify the contribution rates of the cchu to streamflow and baseflow 3 1 mann kendall test and the theil sen median method the mann kendall test was used to analyze the trends of long term hydrometeorological variables in this study because the method is widely used wu et al 2020 lian et al 2021 and has the advantage that the measurements are not required to obey a normal distribution or affected by missing values the theil sen median method also known as sen s slope theil 1950 sen 1968 was used to calculate trend values and often used in conjunction with the mann kendall test 3 2 cumulative anomaly method the cumulative anomaly method was used to determine changing trends and mutation points wang et al 2015 wang et al 2021b specifically a positive or negative cumulative anomaly indicates that the corresponding data points are above or below average respectively 3 3 continuous wavelet transform the wavelet transform stretches the time series to time frequency intervals to identify local intermittent periods which is a useful mathematical tool for analyzing the periodic characteristics of several time series of hydrological variables the cwt can more accurately determine the periodicities in the time series and show their time dependencies which has advantages in the context of signal feature extraction hu et al 2017 3 4 land use transfer matrix the land use transfer matrix is a quantitative description of the change in land use types which reflects the dynamic process of mutual transformation of various land areas in the bahe river over a period of time based on the analyses of land use types in 1980 and 2010 this study obtained a land use transition matrix which was used to calculate the area changes of each land use type from 1980 to 2010 3 5 correlation and partial correlation analysis correlation and partial correlation analyses were used to study the close correlation between hydrometeorological variables before the correlation analysis the data were standardized so that they obeyed a normal distribution partial correlation analysis was adopted because it can eliminate the influence of the third variable to better analyze the correlation between the other two variables 3 6 baseflow separation method the lyne hollick method lyne and hollick 1979 is based on signal analysis which uses different wavelengths corresponding to quick flow qq and baseflow qb to extract baseflow in streamflow it first calculates the quick flow qq as 1 q q i α q q i 1 1 α 2 q i q i 1 where q is the total streamflow m3 d qq is the quick flow mm d i is the time step days and α is the recession constant 1 day the baseflow qb m3 d can subsequently be calculated as qi minus qq the recession constant typically adopts an empirical value of 0 925 which makes it difficult to reflect the basic properties of the watershed brutsaert and nieber 1977 proposed the recession analysis method bn77 and cheng et al 2016 developed the abit method to automate the recession analysis method in this study the recession constant was estimated using the abit method and then the recession constant was used to separate the baseflow by lyne hollick filter the abit method was used successfully to revise the digital filter baseflow separation method the performance has been validated by the comparison with chemical hydrograph methods see zhang et al 2017a showing that the revised method was physically meaningful and noticeably improved the estimated accuracy of non tracer baseflow separation methods zhang et al 2017a and has been widely used to separate the baseflow in many catchments zhang et al 2019a lyu et al 2022 including the weihe river 3 7 quantification method 3 7 1 reduction method according to the mutation point the period was divided into the base and change periods assuming that the base period was not affected by human activity the differences between the measured streamflow depth baseflow depth in the change period and values in the base period were influenced by cchu the reduction method established the precipitation streamflow and precipitation baseflow correlations before the mutation and the precipitation during the change period was introduced into the regression equation of the base period to quantitatively evaluate the influences of human activities on streamflow and baseflow 2 δ r y 2 y 1 δ r 1 δ r 2 3 δ r 1 y 2 y 1 4 δ r 2 δ r δ r 1 y 2 y 2 5 y 1 δ r 1 δ r 100 6 y 2 δ r 2 δ r 100 δr is the amount of change in streamflow depth δr1 is the amount of influence of changes in precipitation and δr2 is the amount of influence of human activities where y2 is the streamflow depth regression sequence after mutation y2 is the streamflow depth after mutation and y1 is the streamflow depth before mutation y1 is the contribution of climate change to streamflow change and y2 is the contribution of human activities the contribution rate of the baseflow is calculated using the same method 3 7 2 scrcq the scrcq method wang et al 2012 was used to quantify the influence of cchu on streamflow changes the slopes of the linear relationship between the cumulative streamflow and time are sra and srb for the two periods before and after the change point respectively the slopes of the linear relationship between the cumulative precipitation and time are spa and spb for the two periods before and after the change point respectively and the slopes of the linear relationship between the cumulative potential transpiration and time are set0a and set0b for the two periods before and after the change point respectively the scrcq method was calculated as follows the contribution rate of baseflow was calculated using the same method 7 r sr s rb s ra s ra 8 r sp s pb s pa s pa 9 r s e t 0 s e t 0 b s e t 0 a s e t 0 a 10 c p 100 r sp r sr 11 c e t 0 100 r s e t 0 r sr 12 c h 100 c p c e t 0 4 results 4 1 baseflow separation the abit method adopted in this study to estimate the recession constant performed significantly better than the default parameters 0 925 our baseflow separation results showed that the average timescale recession constant and baseflow index bfi in the bahe river were 26 15 0 45 days 0 962 0 0006 and 0 303 0 007 in 1959 2016 respectively fig 2 and table 2 4 2 trends of hydrometeorological variables the theil sen median and mann kendall nonparametric tests were used to identify the magnitude of trends and detect the significance of hydrometeorological variables at annual scales from 1959 to 2016 as shown in fig 3 the maximum annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration were 1165 7 mm in 1983 and 918 86 mm in 1995 and the minimums were 426 25 mm in 1995 and 490 13 mm in 1984 the annual change trends of the basin averaged precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in the upstream and midstream regions of the bahe river were basically the same for two main reasons the first reason was that the basin was small so the spatial difference of the annual meteorological data was not obvious the second reason was that the lack of meteorological station data caused less data can be used the annual streamflow and baseflow at mdw were 1 25 108 10 51 108 m3 and 0 52 108 3 24 108 m3 respectively and the mean values of streamflow and baseflow were 4 55 108 m3 and 1 41 108 m3 respectively however the annual streamflow and baseflow of llc were 0 66 108 5 31 108 m3 mean 2 18 108 m3 and 0 26 108 1 49 108 m3 mean 0 65 108 m3 respectively with respect to annual hydrometeorological variables over the study period significant decreasing trends were detected in the streamflow of mdw and precipitation of llc from 1959 to 2016 table 3 no significant trends were found in the annual potential evapotranspiration precipitation of mdw streamflow of llc and baseflow of mdw and llc the hydrometeorological variables in the bahe river showed a decreasing trend except for baseflow at llc the cwt power spectrum of the bahe river is shown in fig 4 the fine solid line indicates the influence cone and the energy spectrum outside the influence cone was not considered because it was susceptible to boundary effects the thick solid line indicates critical values that passed the 95 confidence level significance test the timescale change characteristics of annual precipitation potential evapotranspiration streamflow and baseflow in the upstream and midstream regions of the bahe river are similar as they are located in the same area the timescale characteristics of streamflow were similar to those of precipitation whereas the differences were mainly due to different cycles the streamflow of llc had four timescale changes 1 2a 1997 2004 2 5 3a 1964 1965 4 5 5 1985 1990 and 7 9a 1977 1984 however the significant difference between precipitation and streamflow was that precipitation failed the significance test during 1997 1984 moreover the timescale characteristics of streamflow in mdw had similar change periods as llc 1 2a 1999 2004 2 4a 1964 1968 4 6a 1983 1989 and 7 8a 1976 1983 the basin averaged precipitation midstream of the bahe river has two cycles which is different from the streamflow series in 1964 1968 and 1976 1983 which did not pass the significance test the differences in precipitation and streamflow may be due to the combined effects of other influencing factors the potential evaporation at llc had two cycles whereas that at mdw had one cycle the streamflow of the bahe river had four cycles while the baseflow had two cycles and they had similar timescale change characteristics 4 3 mutation points the determination of the mutation points is related to the division of the base and change periods 1988 was considered the mutation point of precipitation according to the principle of the cumulative anomaly method fig 5 similarly the mutation points of potential evapotranspiration were 1979 and 1993 and the mutation point of the streamflow and baseflow at mdw was 1989 while llc had two mutation points 1980 and 1989 the mann kendall method obtained a large number of intersection points and was more concentrated and the trends of the hydrometeorological variables fluctuated fig 6 therefore the cumulative anomaly method was used to analyze the mutation points 4 4 contributions of cchu to streamflow and baseflow change the reduction and scrcq methods were used to estimate the contributions of the cchu to streamflow and baseflow change in the bahe river during 1959 2016 the research period of mdw was divided into the base period 1959 1989 and the change period 1990 2016 while llc was divided into the base period 1959 1980 change period i 1981 1989 and change period ii 1990 2016 the basin averaged precipitation at llc during the base period and the total change period 1981 2016 were 786 83 and 744 62 mm respectively of which the precipitation in change period i and change period ii were 864 79 and 704 56 mm while potential evapotranspiration in the base period and total change period were 921 92 and 852 98 mm respectively and 782 65 and 876 42 mm in change period i and change period ii respectively in change period i compared to the base period precipitation increased significantly while potential evapotranspiration decreased significantly the basin averaged precipitation at mdw during the base period and the change period were 801 8 and 700 46 mm respectively while potential evapotranspiration in the two periods were 888 28 and 887 99 mm change period ii and the base period had little change in streamflow and baseflow at llc therefore the study mainly compared the differences between change period i and the base period based on the reduction method the contributions of climate change and human activities to the streamflow were 75 and 25 at mdw respectively whereas the contributions to the baseflow were 147 and 47 respectively the contributions of climate change and human activities to streamflow were 25 and 75 respectively at llc whereas the contributions to baseflow were 22 and 78 table 4 according to the scrcq method the contributions of climate change and human activities to streamflow at mdw were 37 and 63 respectively while those of baseflow 90 and 10 respectively the contributions of climate change and human activities to the streamflow at llc were 33 and 67 respectively whereas the contribution rates to the baseflow were 26 and 74 respectively table 5 therefore streamflow and baseflow upstream of the bahe river were mainly affected by human activities 67 75 and 74 78 respectively and baseflow midstream were mainly affected due to climate change 90 147 the contributions of climate change and human activities to the streamflow at mdw were 37 75 and 25 63 respectively 5 discussion 5 1 baseflow estimation the drainage characteristic storage delay brutsaert 2005 and storage coefficient zhang et al 2014a zhang et al 2014b are reflected in the characteristic drainage timescale of the baseflow both the timescale and bfi displayed an increasing trend from upstream to midstream in the river recession processes in a variety of stream reaches can also change with catchment characteristics zhang et al 2019a the land use types at mdw and llc were mainly farmland therefore the timescale and bfi showed only a small difference between the two hydrological gauges 5 2 responses of streamflow and baseflow to climate change the results showed that the annual precipitation displayed the same trend as streamflow and baseflow in the bahe river with the potential evapotranspiration showing the opposite trend the relationships between annual streamflow baseflow precipitation and potential evapotranspiration showed that streamflow and baseflow had closer positive relationships with precipitation in comparison with potential evapotranspiration except of baseflow at llc table 6 and fig 7 however potential evapotranspiration was negatively correlated with streamflow and baseflow precipitation had a closer relationship with streamflow than baseflow while potential evapotranspiration showed the opposite trend the streamflow in the bahe river was mainly recharged by precipitation and the infiltration of precipitation was affected by vegetation and soil resulting in fewer precipitation effects on baseflow in addition the increase in potential evapotranspiration led to high soil water evaporation therefore soil water recharged by precipitation decreased thereby indirectly reducing the generation of baseflow chen et al 2006 therefore baseflow in the bahe river is more susceptible to potential evapotranspiration moreover the streamflow and baseflow at mdw had a closer relationship with precipitation than llc while llc was more affected by potential evapotranspiration this is mainly because llc is located upstream of the bahe river basin in the qinling mountains with substantial vegetation cover mo et al 2016 mdw was less affected by vegetation therefore precipitation was more likely to contribute to surface runoff whereas llc was more susceptible to potential evapotranspiration many scholars have studied the impact of climate change on streamflow and baseflow in different regions most of the results showed that precipitation had a more significant impact on steamflow while baseflow was more affected by potential evapotranspiration lei et al 2018 mo et al 2021 the relationship between precipitation and streamflow was positive wu et al 2020 while potential evapotranspiration was negative li et al 2021 which are consistent with the results of this study in some special areas such as the qinghai tibet plateau and the northwest areas climate change has a stronger impact on streamflow and baseflow because climate change leads to melting of glaciers and changes in the vertical distribution of permafrost and vegetation which lead to changes in streamflow and baseflow fan et al 2013 yang et al 2020 li et al 2021 5 3 responses of streamflow and baseflow to human activities with societal and economic development the impact of human activities on hydrological processes has increased we tried to identify the long term impacts of land use in the bahe river from 1959 to 2016 farmland forest and grassland were the main land use types over the study period fig 8 in terms of the spatial distribution of land use patterns forests were widely distributed especially in the east central and south of the bahe river at higher altitudes in contrast construction land was distributed at dots or blocks along the river and the overall distribution was sporadic the conversion of grassland to farmland mainly occurred in the northwest region whereas the conversion of farmland to grassland was concentrated in the northeast northwest and south regions from 1980 to 2010 the total area of farmland and forest in bahe river increased by 44 36 km2 and 35 46 km2 respectively table 7 further analysis demonstrated that population growth drove the conversion of grassland to farmland 36 24 km2 and rapid urbanization had led to the expansion of construction land 21 63 km2 over the study period urbanization will lead to a decrease in streamflow and baseflow through large amounts of water withdrawal by agriculture industry and life moreover the policy of returning farmland to forest or grassland had driven the large scale conversion of farmland into forest and grassland 9 36 km2 and 15 81 km2 which could also contribute to the decrease in streamflow and baseflow in addition to the impacts of climate change many scholars have studied the impacts of human activities on the streamflow and baseflow in different regions human activities have gradually become the dominant factor controlling changes in watershed streamflow and baseflow wang et al 2015 chen et al 2018 wang et al 2018 the impacts of land use on streamflow were mainly due to the conversion of grassland and cultivated land the increase in vegetation coverage promotes canopy interception reduces peak streamflow and increases baseflow wu et al 2020 the determinants in different river reaches were also inconsistent climate change in the tarim river played a major role in baseflow at the headstream and temperature was the decisive factor with an increase in precipitation the bfi decreased indicating that an increase in precipitation can promote more surface runoff human activities are more significant in the main reaches li et al 2021 vegetation changes in the upper yellow river basin were the dominant factors with an increase in vegetation coverage or leaf area index lai streamflow decreases linearly wang et al 2021a other studies have also pointed out that the impacts of human activities are more significant in the loess plateau wang et al 2022 owing to the choice of data and methods the results of different studies also had certain differences lian et al 2021 5 4 uncertainty analysis to simultaneously quantify the effects of cchu on streamflow and baseflow and analyze the differences between streamflow and baseflow this study selected two quantification methods reduction and scrcq which had some uncertainties 1 there was uncertainty in the selection of parameters the influences of different meteorological factors precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration on hydrological variables will cause certain differences and the quantitative contribution rate of different study areas or timescales will also differ in this study the scrcq method analyzed the impacts of climate changes on hydrological variables based on two meteorological factors precipitation and potential evapotranspiration while the reduction method only focused on the influence of precipitation on streamflow and baseflow in terms of climate change so there were some differences between the two methods according to the results of the correlation analysis the streamflow and baseflow at mdw had closer relationships with precipitation than at llc and precipitation was closely related to streamflow in comparison with baseflow so contributions of climate changes to streamflow and baseflow based on the reduction method were larger than the scrcq method future studies should improve the method to consider the differences in the impacts of more factors on hydrological variables 2 owing to the lack of specific data concerning human activities the scrcq method is frequently used to first estimate the effect of climate change and then regard the remaining amount as the impact of human activities which has uncertainties future research should analyze and quantify the contribution rate differences caused by specific human activities 3 streamflow variations are driven by complex factors and interactions between these drivers including climate change and variability climate change induced vegetation change and human activities the two quantification methods ignored the impact of the interaction of various factors on streamflow components combined human activities climate change and variability and hydrological variables are complex and influence each other vegetation restoration was significantly different in the individual geomorphological areas of the bahe river the increase in vegetation coverage in the upstream region was the most significant and the midstream was slow whereas downstream caused vegetation degradation due to the increase in construction land in addition the impact of annual precipitation on vegetation cover varies greatly in different regions and the impact on the middle reaches is significantly positively correlated yang et al 2022 climate change affects vegetation coverage which in turn affects changes in streamflow different types of anthropogenic activities e g agricultural irrigation and land use change reinforce or inhibit each other wang et al 2018 thereby indirectly affecting streamflow changes 6 conclusions this study utilized various methods to study the trends periodic changes and correlations between meteorological factors precipitation and potential evapotranspiration and hydrological variables streamflow and baseflow in the bahe river from 1959 to 2016 and quantified the effects of cchu on streamflow and baseflow the main conclusions are as follows 1 the characteristic drainage timescale of baseflow and bfi have significant spatial attributes and an increasing trend from the upstream to downstream the average timescale and bfi are 26 15 0 45 days and 0 303 0 007 respectively 2 from 1959 to 2016 significant decreasing trends were detected in the streamflow at mdw and the precipitation at llc no significant trends were found in the annual potential evapotranspiration and precipitation of mdw streamflow at llc and baseflow at mdw and llc the hydrometeorological variables in the bahe river showed a decreasing trend except for baseflow at llc 3 the streamflow was susceptible to precipitation whereas the baseflow was susceptible to potential evapotranspiration in the bahe river mdw was more affected by precipitation whereas llc was more affected by potential evapotranspiration 4 the responses of streamflow and baseflow to cchu were unequal streamflow and baseflow upstream of the bahe river were mainly affected by human activities 67 75 and 74 78 respectively and baseflow midstream due to climate change 90 147 the contributions of climate change and human activities to the streamflow at mdw were 37 75 and 25 63 respectively credit authorship contribution statement yuna shi formal analysis methodology writing original draft software visualization jinxi song
