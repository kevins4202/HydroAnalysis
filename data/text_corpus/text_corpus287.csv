1435,low permeability zones lpzs are major sources of groundwater contamination after active remediation to remove pollutants in adjacent high permeability zones hpzs slow back diffusion from lpzs to hpzs can extend management of polluted sites by decades numerical models are often used to simulate back diffusion estimate cleanup times and develop site management strategies sharp concentration gradients of pollutants are present at the interface between hpzs and lpzs and hence accurate simulation requires fine grid sizes resulting in high computational burden since the modflow family of codes is widely used in practice we develop a new approach for modeling pollutant back diffusion using modflow rt3d that eliminates the need for fine discretization of the lpz instead the lpz is treated as an impermeable region in modflow while in rt3d the lpz is conceptualized as a series of immobile zones coupled with a mobile zone at the hpz lpz interface finite volume discretization of diffusion and reaction within the lpz is then modeled as mass transfer and reaction among several immobile species this results in a simulation domain with significantly fewer grid cells compared to that required if all lpzs are discretized providing potential for improved computational efficiency cases including a layer of hpz over an lpz a thin thick lens of lpz embedded in hpz and multiple lens of lpzs embedded in hpz are tested by the new approach for tracer and reactive scenarios keywords back diffusion modflow rt3d low permeable zone numerical model mass transfer 1 introduction back diffusion from low permeability zones lpzs is recognized as one of the most important reasons for persistent contaminant plumes after treatment or isolation of source zones ball et al 1997 chapman and parker 2005 parker et al 2008 parker et al 1994 sale et al 2013 back diffusion has been extensively studied in the laboratory berns et al 2019 sale et al 2008 yang et al 2014 and field chapman and parker 2005 liu and ball 2002 parker et al 2008 parker et al 2004 yang et al 2017 parker et al 2008 demonstrated that even thin layers of clay which store contaminants in the lpz via diffusion i e forward diffusion phase act as sources of contamination during back diffusion over long time periods this results in extended concentration tails of contaminant elution at downgradient monitoring points that can exceed maximum contaminant levels mcls in aquifers for decades it is therefore not surprising that remediation methods based on pumping which primarily increase the velocity magnitude in high permeability zones hpzs have been shown to be inefficient in decreasing remediation time scales when transport is limited by back diffusion mackay and cherry 1989 tatti et al 2018 a number of researchers have focused on modeling flow and transport at back diffusion sites in order to predict remediation end points and facilitate site management simulations identify sharp concentration gradients near lpz hpz interfaces and this necessitates application of high resolution grids in numerical models to accurately capture the controlling diffusion processes chapman et al 2012 seyedabbasi et al 2012 this requirement increases computational demands for simulating back diffusion sites especially when there are multiple and heterogeneously distributed lpzs within an aquifer efforts to resolve this computational challenge have used analytical sale et al 2008 yang et al 2015 semi analytical falta and wang 2017 muskus and falta 2018 and 1 d local numerical transport models carey et al 2015 analytical models are applicable to relatively simple shaped and thick lpzs that can be treated as semi infinite domains seyedabbasi et al 2012 and more often as one dimensional domains yang et al 2016 with simple first order decay carey et al 2015 falta and wang 2017 developed a semi analytical model based on a heat conduction model vinsome and westerveld 1980 which used an approximate analytical solution for 1d diffusion and first order reaction muskus and falta 2018 extended this approach to the case of finite thickness lenses that can be spatially distributed within a three dimensional domain with uniform flow the main advantage of this model is its fast run time since there is no need to discretize low permeability zones however these semi analytical models cannot be used for cases with large lpzs which affect the flow field in the hpz also all reactions in both the lpz and hpz are restricted to first order kinetics alternatively 1 d local transport models can be used to simulate back diffusion from lpzs and they can be integrated into a 3d global domain for example carey et al 2015 integrated a 1d local diffusion model for lpz into mt3dms the new model is called isr mt3dms the lpz region is inactive within the 3d mt3dms domain a numerical solution to 1d diffusion in the lpz is then coupled to the hpz along the lpz boundary this allows finer discretization in the vertical direction and coarser discretization in the horizontal direction in the 1d local domain representing the lpz compared to the global 3 d domain while the code can simulate multiple species it is a custom code that to the extent we know is not publicly or commercially available moreover its application in its current form is limited to nonreactive solutes or first order redox reactions therefore this model cannot be used for simulating more complex reactions numerical simulators like modflow coupled with rt3d can model more complex systems with nonuniform unsteady flow and multiple lpzs embedded within an hpz domain with multiple reactions these simulators are part of sophisticated modeling systems like gms 2aquaveo com and are widely used in practice however accurate simulations by these models require high resolution grids to capture large concentration gradients in the lpz cells chapman et al 2012 this makes it computationally inefficient to use these models for large field sites with complicated heterogeneous structure the goal of this study is to introduce a new approach for modeling transport and reaction in variably distributed high and low permeability zones by taking advantage of key features in the rt3d simulator i e user defined reaction functions and spatially localized reactions to simulate diffusion and higher order reactions we do this within rt3d by approximating 1d vertical diffusion in lpzs with first order mass transfer between adjacent immobile zones and then coupling this with transformation reactions of varying complexity e g first order second order monod kinetics within the user defined reaction module we then apply the new modeling approach to simulate four scenarios of back diffusion and reaction in lpzs 1 a sand layer hpz overlaying a clay layer lpz case i 2 a thin lens of clay embedded in a sand zone case ii and 3 a thick lens of clay embedded in a sand zone case iii and 4 multiple lenses of clay surrounded by sand case iv for each scenario a conservative tracer and reactive contaminant are modeled solute loading followed by elution is simulated in order to study both forward and back diffusion the contaminant considered is tce which undergoes anaerobic biotic transformation reactions with hydrogen as the electron donor via monod kinetics berns et al 2019 this approach restricts diffusive transport in lpzs to only the vertical direction and limits transformation reactions to the lpzs we assess the accuracy of our new immobile zone rt3d imz rt3d model by comparing with results from the fully discretized rt3d model 2 method the new imz rt3d model is developed to simulate diffusion and reaction in low permeability zones within the rt3d model framework the governing equations are derived assuming the simple case of a thick clay layer lpz underlying a sand layer hpz fig 1 for a conservative tracer the conservation of mass for transport of the tracer is given by eq 1 eq 1 r c t v x c x x d eff α l v x c x z d eff α tv v x c z where c is the tracer concentration mg ml t is time d x is horizontal coordinate z is vertical coordinate cm deff is effective diffusion coefficient cm2 d αl is longitudinal dispersivity cm vx is the horizontal pore water velocity cm d αtv is transverse dispersivity cm and r is the retardation factor in deriving eq 1 we assumed advection only occurs in the x direction the presented equations are based on a 2d cross section domain but the approach can also be applied in 3d if the hydraulic conductivity in the sand is much higher than in clay flow in the latter is negligible then the time scale over which the mass gets transported through the hpz is much shorter than the time scale of diffusion within the lpz thus it is reasonable to assume that diffusion is primarily vertical longitudinal concentration gradient is negligible in diffusion dominated areas therefore the conservation of mass in the lpz reduces to eq 2 eq 2 r c t z d eff c z where c and r refer to the concentration and retardation factor in the lpz finite volume discretization of eq 2 turns the pde into a system of odes eq 3 known as the method of lines mol eq 3 r d c j d t 1 z j d e f f c j 1 c j z j 1 z j d e f f c j c j 1 z j z j 1 j 1 n in which zj is the coordinate center of the jth immobile zone and δzj is the thickness of the jth immobile zone note that eq 3 can be interpreted as sequential mass transfer between a series of immobile species if c j is interpreted as an immobile species concentration in grid block j for case i the following set of first order reactive equations eq 4 7 represent diffusive transport of conservative tracer in the lpz eq 4 r dc m dt 1 z m d eff c im 1 c m z 1 z m k 0 c im 1 c m eq 5 r dc im 1

components respectively note that we use immobile species or immobile components terminology throughout this paper instead of immobile zones because each immobile zone is defined as a chemical component in rt3d the above equations show how the first order mass transfer rate coefficients are related to the diffusion coefficient and the grid size table 1 explicitly shows the expressions for computing kj fig 1 illustrates the equivalence between lpz diffusion in the full model and sequential mass transfer in the imz rt3d note that immobile zones are spread along the length of lpz and only contribute to transport of solutes in the lpz by vertical diffusion when a lens of lpz is embedded in hpz eq 7 will be modified to eq 8 where the last immobile zone is in contact with the mobile species eq 8 r dc im n dt 1 z im n d eff c m c im n z m z n d eff c im n c im n 1 z n z n 1 k n 1 c m c im n k n c im n c im n 1 j n if the mobile concentration at the bottom of lens i e c m in eq 8 is equal to the mobile concentration at the top of lens i e c m in eq 4 one could benefit from the symmetry of the problem and model only half thickness of the lens even though this method needs less number of immobile zones it requires manual adjustments to account for the mass stored and exchanged in the other half of the lens another method used in this paper is to involve both top and bottom rows around the lpz in the reaction module this way the first immobile zone eq 5 and the last immobile zone eq 8 will exchange mass with mobile species on top and bottom respectively this automatically accounts for the mass exchanged and stored over the total thickness of the lpz the latter method will be flexible and accurate when the mobile concentration on top of the lens is different than the bottom e g when two sources of contamination with different strengths are released on top and bottom of the lens it is worth noting that when all immobile zones have identical thickness eq 5 7 will be represented by three mass transfer coefficients k0 k1 and k2 any variability in thickness of immobile zones adds to the number of reaction rates i e kj in rt3d rt3d allows for user defined arbitrary reactions that can be localized in space we deactivated the lpz cells in the full rt3d model domain fig 1 and then integrated sequential mass transfer between mobile species in the grid blocks along the lpz boundary and the immobile species representing each discrete slice of the lpz transport of mobile components in the hpz was handled by the advection dispersion pde solver in rt3d and transport between immobile components was computed via the reaction module ode solver a no flux boundary condition at the bottom of the lpz was applied via eq 7 which was for the immobile component corresponding to the lpz region at the boundary case i it is worth noting that the mobile component c m is the linkage that establishes diffusive transport of solute from hpz to lpz during forward diffusion or vice versa during back diffusion in eq 5 or eq 8 under anaerobic conditions and in the presence of sufficient electron donor and dechlorinating bacteria tce can sequentially transform to dichloroethylene dce vinyl chloride vc and then ethene berns et al 2019 assuming dual monod kinetics eq 4 7 are modified as follows for reaction of tce with molecular hydrogen to form dce eq 9 r dtce m dt 1 z m d eff tce im 1 tce m z 1 z m eq 10 r dtce im 1 dt 1 z im 1 d eff tce im 2 tce im 1 z 2 z 1 d eff tce im 1 tce m z 1 z m q tce x tce im 1 tce im 1 k s tce h im 1 h im 1 k s h j 1

substrate utilization rate mol tce cell d ks h is hydrogen half saturation constant mol h2 l and ks tce is tce half saturation constant mol tce l biomass concentration is assumed to be constant and equal to 1 0e 09 cell l a similar set of equations is used for hydrogen and dce formation also additional reactions can be added for further transformation of dce in deriving eq 9 12 we assume reactions occur only in the lpz advective transport occurs in the hpz and transport in the lpz is merely due to molecular diffusion in the vertical direction this is reasonable if the time scale for transport in the hpz is fast relative to the timescale for mixing and reaction and or if mixing of two solute species primarily occurs in the lpz the imz rt3d model however is easily adaptable to consider reaction in the hpz and or other boundary or initial conditions 2 1 model scenarios and input parameters the imz rt3d model is tested for the four scenarios illustrated in figs 1 and 2 in case i an 18 cm lpz layer underlies a 10 cm hpz fig 1 in case ii a thin 8 cm lpz lens length to thickness ratio of 11 25 1 is surrounded by hpz in a 28 110 cm domain in case iii a thicker 16 cm lpz lens length to thickness ratio of 5 1 is surrounded by hpz in a 28 110 cm domain in case iv multiple lpzs of varying geometry are surrounded by hpz in a 84 107 cm domain case i represents field sites in parker et al 2004 while case iv is adapted from chapman et al 2012 for all cases a solute is injected from the left boundary into the sand layer for a specific time period during which it diffuses into the lpz next either solute free water or a second solute is injected from the left boundary into the sand layer allowing the initial solute to diffuse out of the lpz and in some cases react in the lpz with the second solute for each scenario modflow is first run to obtain the velocity field for rt3d the velocity field is then used as input to rt3d where the lpz cells in the imz rt3d model are set inactive simulations are then performed for either a conservative tracer or tce reacting with hydrogen and results from the imz rt3d are compared to those from fully discretized domains for the tracer solute is injected from the left boundary for 22 days and then flushed for 100 days for tce transformation in case i iv 10 mm of tce is injected from the left boundary for 22 days and then 1 mm of hydrogen is injected from the left boundary for 100 days during this time tce is biotically transformed to dce in the lpz via dual monod kinetics considering constant bacterial concentration x the boundary conditions used in modflow rt3d are presented in table 2 model input parameters are presented in table 3 and they are primarily adapted from two sources berns et al 2019 chapman et al 2012 they are considered example values and are not intended to represent the full range of previously measured parameter values berns et al 2019 report published ranges of select parameter values in their supporting information and such a comparison is not within the scope of this work 2 2 model implementation in order to implement the imz rt3d model 1 grid cells within the lpz are made inactive in rt3d except those along the boundary in direct contact with hpz grid cells and 2 each mobile species is coupled to n immobile components with n equal to the number of immobile zones in the lpz the transport and reaction within the lpz are incorporated into the rt3d code with the user defined reaction module mesh independency of the fully discretized version for a single low permeable lens case ii was evaluated and grid cells of 2 0 5 cm were chosen for further detail see supporting information fig s 1 3 results and discussion two main quantities are presented in this study to compare performance of the imz rt3d with the fully discretized rt3d i e full rt3d model 1 total mass of solute stored in the lpz versus time and 2 flux averaged outflow concentration versus time sum of squared errors sse normalized with the fully discretized model were computed to quantify errors between the two model results and are presented in table s1 and s2 of the supporting information for selected cases vertical concentration profiles in lpzs are also shown 3 1 case i two layer system the results of the tracer simulation in the two layer case are shown in fig 3a and b they indicate good agreement between the imz rt3d and full rt3d models for both total mass stored in the lpz and flux averaged outflow concentration in addition increasing the number of immobile species from 4 to 8 slightly improves estimation of imz model for case i while increasing to 12 immobile zones does not seem to improve the results table s1 a depth profile of tracer in the mid section of the entire domain x 55 cm is shown in fig 3c 22 days and fig 3d 44 days four immobile zones accurately capture the lpz profile at day 22 but result in small errors after 44 days based on all comparisons 8 immobile zones may be needed to accurately simulate tracer back diffusion in case i the results of the tce simulation in case i are shown in fig 4 since tce reacts with hydrogen to form dce results for dce are also shown the results indicate good agreement between the imz rt3d and full rt3d models for four immobile zones with respect to both mass remaining in the lpz and flux averaged outflow concentration from the entire domain there is slight improvement when the number of immobile zones is increased to 8 or 12 but less so than with the tracer table s2 the difference between 8imz rt3d and full model is less than 10 for the reactive scenario this is especially encouraging because the concentration of dce is one to four orders of magnitude smaller than that of tce making small mass balance errors with reaction of tce very noticeable 3 2 case ii and case iii single low permeable lens the results of applying the imz rt3d model for tracer simulation in case ii are demonstrated in fig 5a b overall they indicate good agreement between the imz rt3d and full rt3d models for both total mass stored in the lpz and flux averaged outflow concentration the results of imz rt3d for case ii become more accurate as the number of immobile species increases from 3 to 5 reducing the error in mass stored from 110 to 37 table s1 total mass stored in the lpz and flux averaged outflow concentration are always slightly overestimated by the imz rt3d model table s1 as time progresses this difference becomes more noticeable the results of applying the imz rt3d model for a tracer simulation in case iii are demonstrated in fig 5c d here too there is good agreement between the imz rt3d and full rt3d models when 7 imz is considered since the error for total mass stored in the lpz and flux averaged outflow concentration is 12 and 8 respectively however the results of imz rt3d model with 5 immobile zones are not in good agreement with the full model especially for tracer mass remaining in the lpz where the error is around 51 table s1 assuming 7 imzs for both case ii and case iii the discrepancy between the imz rt3d and full rt3d model is higher in case ii than in case iii table s1 this could be related to the larger mass transfer rates k0 k1 k2 used for case ii compared to case iii as they result in faster changes in the diffusive flux and possibly larger errors in numerical approximation the results of applying imz rt3d for tce transformation to dce in case ii are shown in fig 6 the imz rt3d results reasonably match the full rt3d model with respect to both total moles of tce stored in the lpz and outflow tce concentrations fig 6a b the errors decrease from 200 to 55 for total moles of tce stored in the lpz and from 56 to 32 for dce when the number of immobile zones is increased from 3 to 5 table s2 for both imz numbers the imz rt3d model overestimates both tce moles stored in the lpz and outflow concentration from the domain noticeable dce is produced after enough hydrogen diffuses into the lpz by around day 25 for 5 imzs total moles of dce stored in the lpz from the imz rt3d model are equal to or slightly greater than total moles from the full model fig 6c however the average outflow concentration of dce is initially underestimated by imz rt3d and later overestimated fig 6d in both cases by small amounts relative to concentration values the results of imz rt3d for tce transformation to dce in case iii are shown in fig 7 the imz rt3d profiles overestimate total moles of solutes stored in the lpz from the full rt3d model fig 7a c however flux averaged outflow concentration is in good agreement with full rt3d model fig 7b d for the reactive scenario in the thick lens increasing the number of immobile zones does not appear to improve the result which is opposite of the tracer results for this case table s2 a closer look at the results of the tracer scenario in case iii shows that most of the error in fig 5c d arises during the flushing phase when the tracer concentration is declining rapidly in the lpz similar behavior is noticeable for the thin lens case ii in which after 66 days the dce concentration starts dropping perhaps due to a decline in tce concentration but in case iii dce is still in the phase of production after 122 days fig 7c d which makes the difference between 5imz and 7imz indistinguishable 3 3 case iv multiple low permeable lenses the setup is inspired from chapman et al 2012 with slight modifications to simplify the geometry this setup is the most complex considered and is more representative of greater complexity encountered in field scenarios in total 32 immobile zones are used for 3 lenses in the imz rt3d model in which the thickness of each lens varies from 1 2 2 4 cm simulation results for multiple lpz lenses case iv are shown in figs 8 and 9 for tracer and tce transformation scenarios respectively in fig 8 the imz rt3d model overestimates tracer mass retained in the lpz during back diffusion by 22 in contrast the imz rt3d model predicts the outflow concentration throughout the simulation with only 8 error table s1 evaluating tracer mass stored in individual low permeable lenses reveals that lenses which are thicker and closer to the source contribute more error to tracer mass retained i e lens iii and then lens ii are mainly responsible for the discrepancy in total mass remaining in the lpz since they have more area exposed to the source for further details refer to fig s 2 in supporting information thicker lenses store more solute mass and therefore contribute more to error in fig 9 the imz rt3d model btcs for tce are in good agreement with the full rt3d model with respect to both mass remaining and average outflow concentration errors of about 10 14 based on table s2 this encouraging result suggests the new modeling approach is capable of conserving mass in heterogeneous environments with complex reactions provided a sufficient number of immobile zones is provided results for dce are also good but 11 and 18 errors are evident in total moles stored in the lpz and btc of outflow dce respectively specifically there is slight overestimation of dce mass remaining by the imz rt3d model compared to the full rt3d model and there is slight underestimation of dce outflow concentration due to limitations regarding the maximum number of components in rt3d we were not able to evaluate finer grids for case iv 4 conclusions a new model called imz rt3d was developed based on the mathematical equivalence between finite volume discretization of a 1d diffusion dominated zone and an approximation using mass transfer between multiple immobile species in sequence and incorporation of monod kinetic expressions into the rt3d user defined reaction module the imz rt3d model was evaluated by comparing simulation results with those from the fully discretized model for several lpz geometrical set ups including two layers a single thin lpz lens surrounded by hpz a single thick lpz lens surrounded by hpz and multiple lpz lenses surrounded by an hpz as long as each lpz is divided into a sufficient number of immobile species the imz rt3d model profiles are in good agreement with the full rt3d model with respect to predicting mass of solute remaining in the model domain and average outflow concentration for all cases however one obvious discrepancy is the consistent and small overestimation of total mass of solutes stored in the lpz by the imz rt3d compared to the full rt3d model another discrepancy is larger errors between the imz and full model for the thin lens compared to the thick lens this could be attributed to larger gradients of concentration in the thin relative to the thick lens which can cause higher mass transfer rates and consequently larger errors in numerical approximation however considering that imz rt3d model is estimating the full model the discrepancies are slight as long as enough immobile zones are used for imz rt3d model the imz rt3d model is limited to cases in which the transport of solutes in the lpz can be presented by eq 2 this means any significant advection or dispersion in the lpz which deviates transport from merely vertical diffusion contradicts the assumption of imz rt3d and causes large errors in estimation fig s4 of supporting information shows how our method fails when the time scale of diffusion in the lpz is small relative to the time scale of advection in the hpz defined by a modified peclet number pe 1 an inherent weakness of the new imz rt3d model is that it is constrained by the existing capabilities of rt3d which is no longer under active development even though it is still widely used in practice for example the maximum number of immobile zones is limited because only 100 total species are allowed in rt3d since the current implementation of imz rt3d requires a separate species for each immobile zone this limits application of rt3d to one or a few lpzs with each having reactions involving a small number of species e g a few sequential dual monod reactions it cannot be applied to more complicated domains or multi species reactions without further modification of the underling rt3d code since chapman et al 2012 declared that accurate modeling of back diffusion depends on high resolution grids for low permeable cells different techniques have been suggested to resolve this computational inefficiency although some techniques run faster prior approaches have all been limited to either equilibrium sorption or simple first order reactions carey et al 2015 falta and wang 2017 muskus and falta 2018 the imz rt3d model presented here on the other hand is available for users of modflow rt3d and is capable of modeling a flow field with complex heterogeneous lpz structures as well as arbitrary reaction kinetics like dual monod it also has strong rt3d solvers available for solving a system of reactions consequently the imz rt3d model runs faster than the full model for the more complex structures like case iv in this study that involve nonlinear reactions however despite considerable decrease in the number of grid blocks by imz rt3d this model runs slower than the full model for simpler cases see table s3 for run time of studied cases there are constraints when running rt3d within gms that do not allow the user to take advantage of options within rt3d for more computationally efficient solution of reaction odes to enhance the computational efficiency of imz rt3d simpler ode solvers can be used instead of the more general stiff solvers implemented in rt3d other approaches to increase computational efficiency such as using a smaller number of mobile and immobile zones will be studied in our future work

1435,low permeability zones lpzs are major sources of groundwater contamination after active remediation to remove pollutants in adjacent high permeability zones hpzs slow back diffusion from lpzs to hpzs can extend management of polluted sites by decades numerical models are often used to simulate back diffusion estimate cleanup times and develop site management strategies sharp concentration gradients of pollutants are present at the interface between hpzs and lpzs and hence accurate simulation requires fine grid sizes resulting in high computational burden since the modflow family of codes is widely used in practice we develop a new approach for modeling pollutant back diffusion using modflow rt3d that eliminates the need for fine discretization of the lpz instead the lpz is treated as an impermeable region in modflow while in rt3d the lpz is conceptualized as a series of immobile zones coupled with a mobile zone at the hpz lpz interface finite volume discretization of diffusion and reaction within the lpz is then modeled as mass transfer and reaction among several immobile species this results in a simulation domain with significantly fewer grid cells compared to that required if all lpzs are discretized providing potential for improved computational efficiency cases including a layer of hpz over an lpz a thin thick lens of lpz embedded in hpz and multiple lens of lpzs embedded in hpz are tested by the new approach for tracer and reactive scenarios keywords back diffusion modflow rt3d low permeable zone numerical model mass transfer 1 introduction back diffusion from low permeability zones lpzs is recognized as one of the most important reasons for persistent contaminant plumes after treatment or isolation of source zones ball et al 1997 chapman and parker 2005 parker et al 2008 parker et al 1994 sale et al 2013 back diffusion has been extensively studied in the laboratory berns et al 2019 sale et al 2008 yang et al 2014 and field chapman and parker 2005 liu and ball 2002 parker et al 2008 parker et al 2004 yang et al 2017 parker et al 2008 demonstrated that even thin layers of clay which store contaminants in the lpz via diffusion i e forward diffusion phase act as sources of contamination during back diffusion over long time periods this results in extended concentration tails of contaminant elution at downgradient monitoring points that can exceed maximum contaminant levels mcls in aquifers for decades it is therefore not surprising that remediation methods based on pumping which primarily increase the velocity magnitude in high permeability zones hpzs have been shown to be inefficient in decreasing remediation time scales when transport is limited by back diffusion mackay and cherry 1989 tatti et al 2018 a number of researchers have focused on modeling flow and transport at back diffusion sites in order to predict remediation end points and facilitate site management simulations identify sharp concentration gradients near lpz hpz interfaces and this necessitates application of high resolution grids in numerical models to accurately capture the controlling diffusion processes chapman et al 2012 seyedabbasi et al 2012 this requirement increases computational demands for simulating back diffusion sites especially when there are multiple and heterogeneously distributed lpzs within an aquifer efforts to resolve this computational challenge have used analytical sale et al 2008 yang et al 2015 semi analytical falta and wang 2017 muskus and falta 2018 and 1 d local numerical transport models carey et al 2015 analytical models are applicable to relatively simple shaped and thick lpzs that can be treated as semi infinite domains seyedabbasi et al 2012 and more often as one dimensional domains yang et al 2016 with simple first order decay carey et al 2015 falta and wang 2017 developed a semi analytical model based on a heat conduction model vinsome and westerveld 1980 which used an approximate analytical solution for 1d diffusion and first order reaction muskus and falta 2018 extended this approach to the case of finite thickness lenses that can be spatially distributed within a three dimensional domain with uniform flow the main advantage of this model is its fast run time since there is no need to discretize low permeability zones however these semi analytical models cannot be used for cases with large lpzs which affect the flow field in the hpz also all reactions in both the lpz and hpz are restricted to first order kinetics alternatively 1 d local transport models can be used to simulate back diffusion from lpzs and they can be integrated into a 3d global domain for example carey et al 2015 integrated a 1d local diffusion model for lpz into mt3dms the new model is called isr mt3dms the lpz region is inactive within the 3d mt3dms domain a numerical solution to 1d diffusion in the lpz is then coupled to the hpz along the lpz boundary this allows finer discretization in the vertical direction and coarser discretization in the horizontal direction in the 1d local domain representing the lpz compared to the global 3 d domain while the code can simulate multiple species it is a custom code that to the extent we know is not publicly or commercially available moreover its application in its current form is limited to nonreactive solutes or first order redox reactions therefore this model cannot be used for simulating more complex reactions numerical simulators like modflow coupled with rt3d can model more complex systems with nonuniform unsteady flow and multiple lpzs embedded within an hpz domain with multiple reactions these simulators are part of sophisticated modeling systems like gms 2aquaveo com and are widely used in practice however accurate simulations by these models require high resolution grids to capture large concentration gradients in the lpz cells chapman et al 2012 this makes it computationally inefficient to use these models for large field sites with complicated heterogeneous structure the goal of this study is to introduce a new approach for modeling transport and reaction in variably distributed high and low permeability zones by taking advantage of key features in the rt3d simulator i e user defined reaction functions and spatially localized reactions to simulate diffusion and higher order reactions we do this within rt3d by approximating 1d vertical diffusion in lpzs with first order mass transfer between adjacent immobile zones and then coupling this with transformation reactions of varying complexity e g first order second order monod kinetics within the user defined reaction module we then apply the new modeling approach to simulate four scenarios of back diffusion and reaction in lpzs 1 a sand layer hpz overlaying a clay layer lpz case i 2 a thin lens of clay embedded in a sand zone case ii and 3 a thick lens of clay embedded in a sand zone case iii and 4 multiple lenses of clay surrounded by sand case iv for each scenario a conservative tracer and reactive contaminant are modeled solute loading followed by elution is simulated in order to study both forward and back diffusion the contaminant considered is tce which undergoes anaerobic biotic transformation reactions with hydrogen as the electron donor via monod kinetics berns et al 2019 this approach restricts diffusive transport in lpzs to only the vertical direction and limits transformation reactions to the lpzs we assess the accuracy of our new immobile zone rt3d imz rt3d model by comparing with results from the fully discretized rt3d model 2 method the new imz rt3d model is developed to simulate diffusion and reaction in low permeability zones within the rt3d model framework the governing equations are derived assuming the simple case of a thick clay layer lpz underlying a sand layer hpz fig 1 for a conservative tracer the conservation of mass for transport of the tracer is given by eq 1 eq 1 r c t v x c x x d eff α l v x c x z d eff α tv v x c z where c is the tracer concentration mg ml t is time d x is horizontal coordinate z is vertical coordinate cm deff is effective diffusion coefficient cm2 d αl is longitudinal dispersivity cm vx is the horizontal pore water velocity cm d αtv is transverse dispersivity cm and r is the retardation factor in deriving eq 1 we assumed advection only occurs in the x direction the presented equations are based on a 2d cross section domain but the approach can also be applied in 3d if the hydraulic conductivity in the sand is much higher than in clay flow in the latter is negligible then the time scale over which the mass gets transported through the hpz is much shorter than the time scale of diffusion within the lpz thus it is reasonable to assume that diffusion is primarily vertical longitudinal concentration gradient is negligible in diffusion dominated areas therefore the conservation of mass in the lpz reduces to eq 2 eq 2 r c t z d eff c z where c and r refer to the concentration and retardation factor in the lpz finite volume discretization of eq 2 turns the pde into a system of odes eq 3 known as the method of lines mol eq 3 r d c j d t 1 z j d e f f c j 1 c j z j 1 z j d e f f c j c j 1 z j z j 1 j 1 n in which zj is the coordinate center of the jth immobile zone and δzj is the thickness of the jth immobile zone note that eq 3 can be interpreted as sequential mass transfer between a series of immobile species if c j is interpreted as an immobile species concentration in grid block j for case i the following set of first order reactive equations eq 4 7 represent diffusive transport of conservative tracer in the lpz eq 4 r dc m dt 1 z m d eff c im 1 c m z 1 z m k 0 c im 1 c m eq 5 r dc im 1

components respectively note that we use immobile species or immobile components terminology throughout this paper instead of immobile zones because each immobile zone is defined as a chemical component in rt3d the above equations show how the first order mass transfer rate coefficients are related to the diffusion coefficient and the grid size table 1 explicitly shows the expressions for computing kj fig 1 illustrates the equivalence between lpz diffusion in the full model and sequential mass transfer in the imz rt3d note that immobile zones are spread along the length of lpz and only contribute to transport of solutes in the lpz by vertical diffusion when a lens of lpz is embedded in hpz eq 7 will be modified to eq 8 where the last immobile zone is in contact with the mobile species eq 8 r dc im n dt 1 z im n d eff c m c im n z m z n d eff c im n c im n 1 z n z n 1 k n 1 c m c im n k n c im n c im n 1 j n if the mobile concentration at the bottom of lens i e c m in eq 8 is equal to the mobile concentration at the top of lens i e c m in eq 4 one could benefit from the symmetry of the problem and model only half thickness of the lens even though this method needs less number of immobile zones it requires manual adjustments to account for the mass stored and exchanged in the other half of the lens another method used in this paper is to involve both top and bottom rows around the lpz in the reaction module this way the first immobile zone eq 5 and the last immobile zone eq 8 will exchange mass with mobile species on top and bottom respectively this automatically accounts for the mass exchanged and stored over the total thickness of the lpz the latter method will be flexible and accurate when the mobile concentration on top of the lens is different than the bottom e g when two sources of contamination with different strengths are released on top and bottom of the lens it is worth noting that when all immobile zones have identical thickness eq 5 7 will be represented by three mass transfer coefficients k0 k1 and k2 any variability in thickness of immobile zones adds to the number of reaction rates i e kj in rt3d rt3d allows for user defined arbitrary reactions that can be localized in space we deactivated the lpz cells in the full rt3d model domain fig 1 and then integrated sequential mass transfer between mobile species in the grid blocks along the lpz boundary and the immobile species representing each discrete slice of the lpz transport of mobile components in the hpz was handled by the advection dispersion pde solver in rt3d and transport between immobile components was computed via the reaction module ode solver a no flux boundary condition at the bottom of the lpz was applied via eq 7 which was for the immobile component corresponding to the lpz region at the boundary case i it is worth noting that the mobile component c m is the linkage that establishes diffusive transport of solute from hpz to lpz during forward diffusion or vice versa during back diffusion in eq 5 or eq 8 under anaerobic conditions and in the presence of sufficient electron donor and dechlorinating bacteria tce can sequentially transform to dichloroethylene dce vinyl chloride vc and then ethene berns et al 2019 assuming dual monod kinetics eq 4 7 are modified as follows for reaction of tce with molecular hydrogen to form dce eq 9 r dtce m dt 1 z m d eff tce im 1 tce m z 1 z m eq 10 r dtce im 1 dt 1 z im 1 d eff tce im 2 tce im 1 z 2 z 1 d eff tce im 1 tce m z 1 z m q tce x tce im 1 tce im 1 k s tce h im 1 h im 1 k s h j 1

substrate utilization rate mol tce cell d ks h is hydrogen half saturation constant mol h2 l and ks tce is tce half saturation constant mol tce l biomass concentration is assumed to be constant and equal to 1 0e 09 cell l a similar set of equations is used for hydrogen and dce formation also additional reactions can be added for further transformation of dce in deriving eq 9 12 we assume reactions occur only in the lpz advective transport occurs in the hpz and transport in the lpz is merely due to molecular diffusion in the vertical direction this is reasonable if the time scale for transport in the hpz is fast relative to the timescale for mixing and reaction and or if mixing of two solute species primarily occurs in the lpz the imz rt3d model however is easily adaptable to consider reaction in the hpz and or other boundary or initial conditions 2 1 model scenarios and input parameters the imz rt3d model is tested for the four scenarios illustrated in figs 1 and 2 in case i an 18 cm lpz layer underlies a 10 cm hpz fig 1 in case ii a thin 8 cm lpz lens length to thickness ratio of 11 25 1 is surrounded by hpz in a 28 110 cm domain in case iii a thicker 16 cm lpz lens length to thickness ratio of 5 1 is surrounded by hpz in a 28 110 cm domain in case iv multiple lpzs of varying geometry are surrounded by hpz in a 84 107 cm domain case i represents field sites in parker et al 2004 while case iv is adapted from chapman et al 2012 for all cases a solute is injected from the left boundary into the sand layer for a specific time period during which it diffuses into the lpz next either solute free water or a second solute is injected from the left boundary into the sand layer allowing the initial solute to diffuse out of the lpz and in some cases react in the lpz with the second solute for each scenario modflow is first run to obtain the velocity field for rt3d the velocity field is then used as input to rt3d where the lpz cells in the imz rt3d model are set inactive simulations are then performed for either a conservative tracer or tce reacting with hydrogen and results from the imz rt3d are compared to those from fully discretized domains for the tracer solute is injected from the left boundary for 22 days and then flushed for 100 days for tce transformation in case i iv 10 mm of tce is injected from the left boundary for 22 days and then 1 mm of hydrogen is injected from the left boundary for 100 days during this time tce is biotically transformed to dce in the lpz via dual monod kinetics considering constant bacterial concentration x the boundary conditions used in modflow rt3d are presented in table 2 model input parameters are presented in table 3 and they are primarily adapted from two sources berns et al 2019 chapman et al 2012 they are considered example values and are not intended to represent the full range of previously measured parameter values berns et al 2019 report published ranges of select parameter values in their supporting information and such a comparison is not within the scope of this work 2 2 model implementation in order to implement the imz rt3d model 1 grid cells within the lpz are made inactive in rt3d except those along the boundary in direct contact with hpz grid cells and 2 each mobile species is coupled to n immobile components with n equal to the number of immobile zones in the lpz the transport and reaction within the lpz are incorporated into the rt3d code with the user defined reaction module mesh independency of the fully discretized version for a single low permeable lens case ii was evaluated and grid cells of 2 0 5 cm were chosen for further detail see supporting information fig s 1 3 results and discussion two main quantities are presented in this study to compare performance of the imz rt3d with the fully discretized rt3d i e full rt3d model 1 total mass of solute stored in the lpz versus time and 2 flux averaged outflow concentration versus time sum of squared errors sse normalized with the fully discretized model were computed to quantify errors between the two model results and are presented in table s1 and s2 of the supporting information for selected cases vertical concentration profiles in lpzs are also shown 3 1 case i two layer system the results of the tracer simulation in the two layer case are shown in fig 3a and b they indicate good agreement between the imz rt3d and full rt3d models for both total mass stored in the lpz and flux averaged outflow concentration in addition increasing the number of immobile species from 4 to 8 slightly improves estimation of imz model for case i while increasing to 12 immobile zones does not seem to improve the results table s1 a depth profile of tracer in the mid section of the entire domain x 55 cm is shown in fig 3c 22 days and fig 3d 44 days four immobile zones accurately capture the lpz profile at day 22 but result in small errors after 44 days based on all comparisons 8 immobile zones may be needed to accurately simulate tracer back diffusion in case i the results of the tce simulation in case i are shown in fig 4 since tce reacts with hydrogen to form dce results for dce are also shown the results indicate good agreement between the imz rt3d and full rt3d models for four immobile zones with respect to both mass remaining in the lpz and flux averaged outflow concentration from the entire domain there is slight improvement when the number of immobile zones is increased to 8 or 12 but less so than with the tracer table s2 the difference between 8imz rt3d and full model is less than 10 for the reactive scenario this is especially encouraging because the concentration of dce is one to four orders of magnitude smaller than that of tce making small mass balance errors with reaction of tce very noticeable 3 2 case ii and case iii single low permeable lens the results of applying the imz rt3d model for tracer simulation in case ii are demonstrated in fig 5a b overall they indicate good agreement between the imz rt3d and full rt3d models for both total mass stored in the lpz and flux averaged outflow concentration the results of imz rt3d for case ii become more accurate as the number of immobile species increases from 3 to 5 reducing the error in mass stored from 110 to 37 table s1 total mass stored in the lpz and flux averaged outflow concentration are always slightly overestimated by the imz rt3d model table s1 as time progresses this difference becomes more noticeable the results of applying the imz rt3d model for a tracer simulation in case iii are demonstrated in fig 5c d here too there is good agreement between the imz rt3d and full rt3d models when 7 imz is considered since the error for total mass stored in the lpz and flux averaged outflow concentration is 12 and 8 respectively however the results of imz rt3d model with 5 immobile zones are not in good agreement with the full model especially for tracer mass remaining in the lpz where the error is around 51 table s1 assuming 7 imzs for both case ii and case iii the discrepancy between the imz rt3d and full rt3d model is higher in case ii than in case iii table s1 this could be related to the larger mass transfer rates k0 k1 k2 used for case ii compared to case iii as they result in faster changes in the diffusive flux and possibly larger errors in numerical approximation the results of applying imz rt3d for tce transformation to dce in case ii are shown in fig 6 the imz rt3d results reasonably match the full rt3d model with respect to both total moles of tce stored in the lpz and outflow tce concentrations fig 6a b the errors decrease from 200 to 55 for total moles of tce stored in the lpz and from 56 to 32 for dce when the number of immobile zones is increased from 3 to 5 table s2 for both imz numbers the imz rt3d model overestimates both tce moles stored in the lpz and outflow concentration from the domain noticeable dce is produced after enough hydrogen diffuses into the lpz by around day 25 for 5 imzs total moles of dce stored in the lpz from the imz rt3d model are equal to or slightly greater than total moles from the full model fig 6c however the average outflow concentration of dce is initially underestimated by imz rt3d and later overestimated fig 6d in both cases by small amounts relative to concentration values the results of imz rt3d for tce transformation to dce in case iii are shown in fig 7 the imz rt3d profiles overestimate total moles of solutes stored in the lpz from the full rt3d model fig 7a c however flux averaged outflow concentration is in good agreement with full rt3d model fig 7b d for the reactive scenario in the thick lens increasing the number of immobile zones does not appear to improve the result which is opposite of the tracer results for this case table s2 a closer look at the results of the tracer scenario in case iii shows that most of the error in fig 5c d arises during the flushing phase when the tracer concentration is declining rapidly in the lpz similar behavior is noticeable for the thin lens case ii in which after 66 days the dce concentration starts dropping perhaps due to a decline in tce concentration but in case iii dce is still in the phase of production after 122 days fig 7c d which makes the difference between 5imz and 7imz indistinguishable 3 3 case iv multiple low permeable lenses the setup is inspired from chapman et al 2012 with slight modifications to simplify the geometry this setup is the most complex considered and is more representative of greater complexity encountered in field scenarios in total 32 immobile zones are used for 3 lenses in the imz rt3d model in which the thickness of each lens varies from 1 2 2 4 cm simulation results for multiple lpz lenses case iv are shown in figs 8 and 9 for tracer and tce transformation scenarios respectively in fig 8 the imz rt3d model overestimates tracer mass retained in the lpz during back diffusion by 22 in contrast the imz rt3d model predicts the outflow concentration throughout the simulation with only 8 error table s1 evaluating tracer mass stored in individual low permeable lenses reveals that lenses which are thicker and closer to the source contribute more error to tracer mass retained i e lens iii and then lens ii are mainly responsible for the discrepancy in total mass remaining in the lpz since they have more area exposed to the source for further details refer to fig s 2 in supporting information thicker lenses store more solute mass and therefore contribute more to error in fig 9 the imz rt3d model btcs for tce are in good agreement with the full rt3d model with respect to both mass remaining and average outflow concentration errors of about 10 14 based on table s2 this encouraging result suggests the new modeling approach is capable of conserving mass in heterogeneous environments with complex reactions provided a sufficient number of immobile zones is provided results for dce are also good but 11 and 18 errors are evident in total moles stored in the lpz and btc of outflow dce respectively specifically there is slight overestimation of dce mass remaining by the imz rt3d model compared to the full rt3d model and there is slight underestimation of dce outflow concentration due to limitations regarding the maximum number of components in rt3d we were not able to evaluate finer grids for case iv 4 conclusions a new model called imz rt3d was developed based on the mathematical equivalence between finite volume discretization of a 1d diffusion dominated zone and an approximation using mass transfer between multiple immobile species in sequence and incorporation of monod kinetic expressions into the rt3d user defined reaction module the imz rt3d model was evaluated by comparing simulation results with those from the fully discretized model for several lpz geometrical set ups including two layers a single thin lpz lens surrounded by hpz a single thick lpz lens surrounded by hpz and multiple lpz lenses surrounded by an hpz as long as each lpz is divided into a sufficient number of immobile species the imz rt3d model profiles are in good agreement with the full rt3d model with respect to predicting mass of solute remaining in the model domain and average outflow concentration for all cases however one obvious discrepancy is the consistent and small overestimation of total mass of solutes stored in the lpz by the imz rt3d compared to the full rt3d model another discrepancy is larger errors between the imz and full model for the thin lens compared to the thick lens this could be attributed to larger gradients of concentration in the thin relative to the thick lens which can cause higher mass transfer rates and consequently larger errors in numerical approximation however considering that imz rt3d model is estimating the full model the discrepancies are slight as long as enough immobile zones are used for imz rt3d model the imz rt3d model is limited to cases in which the transport of solutes in the lpz can be presented by eq 2 this means any significant advection or dispersion in the lpz which deviates transport from merely vertical diffusion contradicts the assumption of imz rt3d and causes large errors in estimation fig s4 of supporting information shows how our method fails when the time scale of diffusion in the lpz is small relative to the time scale of advection in the hpz defined by a modified peclet number pe 1 an inherent weakness of the new imz rt3d model is that it is constrained by the existing capabilities of rt3d which is no longer under active development even though it is still widely used in practice for example the maximum number of immobile zones is limited because only 100 total species are allowed in rt3d since the current implementation of imz rt3d requires a separate species for each immobile zone this limits application of rt3d to one or a few lpzs with each having reactions involving a small number of species e g a few sequential dual monod reactions it cannot be applied to more complicated domains or multi species reactions without further modification of the underling rt3d code since chapman et al 2012 declared that accurate modeling of back diffusion depends on high resolution grids for low permeable cells different techniques have been suggested to resolve this computational inefficiency although some techniques run faster prior approaches have all been limited to either equilibrium sorption or simple first order reactions carey et al 2015 falta and wang 2017 muskus and falta 2018 the imz rt3d model presented here on the other hand is available for users of modflow rt3d and is capable of modeling a flow field with complex heterogeneous lpz structures as well as arbitrary reaction kinetics like dual monod it also has strong rt3d solvers available for solving a system of reactions consequently the imz rt3d model runs faster than the full model for the more complex structures like case iv in this study that involve nonlinear reactions however despite considerable decrease in the number of grid blocks by imz rt3d this model runs slower than the full model for simpler cases see table s3 for run time of studied cases there are constraints when running rt3d within gms that do not allow the user to take advantage of options within rt3d for more computationally efficient solution of reaction odes to enhance the computational efficiency of imz rt3d simpler ode solvers can be used instead of the more general stiff solvers implemented in rt3d other approaches to increase computational efficiency such as using a smaller number of mobile and immobile zones will be studied in our future work

1436,pollution caused due to discharge of toxic and hazardous chemical contaminants from industrial processes is an issue of major environmental concern hexavalent chromium cr vi is one such known toxic heavy metal contaminant emanated largely from various industrial processes since physical chemical treatment techniques are beset with several problems there is an increased attention on the use of waste biomaterials biomass as sorbents for the elimination of heavy metals from aqueous matrices the main purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of some low cost waste biomaterials such as fruit wastes agricultural and industrial waste byproducts waste parts of photosynthetic plants aquatic plants and fungal biomass collected from different sources for the biosorption of cr vi from aqueous matrices amid the tested biomaterials wood apple shell was biomass limonia acidissima was found to be highly efficient biosorbent for cr vi sorption in majority of biomass it was observed that biosorption of cr vi took place at acidic ph with optimum ph ranging from 2 0 to 5 0 loading capacity of was biomass 29 37 mg g was higher than that of conventional adsorbent activated charcoal 26 56 mg g which was used as control cr vi treated biomass was was characterized using instrumental techniques such as scanned electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive x ray edx confirmed the adsorption of cr vi boehm titration and ftir studies were conducted to ascertain the presence of functional groups responsible for cr vi sorption by was biomass the was biomass removed cr vi from industrial wastewater with an efficiency of 99 9 thus complying with the statutory limits considering the economical aspect the selected biomass can be viewed as a potential candidate for the elimination of toxic contaminant from wastewater keywords biosorption hexavalent chromium limonia acidissima loading capacity wood apple shell was biomass 1 introduction chromium is considered as a metal with two facades that is it is valuable and as well as hazardous not only to humans but also to plants animals and microorganisms the action of chromium metal depends on its oxidation state and concentration bhusari et al 2016 in aqueous matrices it usually exists in both hexavalent cr vi and trivalent cr iii form cr iii acts as micronutrient and is essential for functioning of vital organs in humans whereas cr vi is of great concern because of its toxic nature hu et al 2019 patil and itankar 2020 cr iii is relatively insoluble in aqueous medium whereas compounds of cr vi shows high solubility and thus mobility in ecosystem daoud et al 2016 mystrioti et al 2016 cr vi being water soluble and mobile in nature can penetrate the cell membrane and reduce to cr iii producing reactive hydroxyl radicals during the process which in turn produce oxidative stress in cell causing oxidative deterioration of biological macromolecules jaishankar et al 2014 stohs et al 2001 cr vi is a well known human carcinogen and mutagen international agency for research on cancer 1990 lytras et al 2017 leong and chang 2020 usepa 1998 and is 500 1000 times more toxic than cr iii atsdr 2000 dayan and paine 2001 kowalski 1994 itankar and patil 2014 zhang et al 2017 international agency for research on cancer 1990 had reported that there are ample evidences in human for the carcinogenic action of cr vi compounds established on the basis of joint result of epidemiological and cancer studies in experimental animals xie et al 2017 toxic cr vi finds its way in nature due to anthropogenic activities industries such as electroplating metallurgy leather tanning textile dyeing metal finishing welding of alloys steel ceramics manufacturing and several others emanate huge volumes of effluents containing cr vi gupta and babu 2009 ihsanullah al khaldi et al 2016 malkoc and nuhoglu 2007 due to negative environmental impact many industrially developed countries have been forced to set discharge limit to both cr iii and cr vi bhattacharya et al 2008 most surface water contains 1 to 10 μg l of cr vi while the guidelines prescribed by who is 0 05 mg l world health organization 1998 the total chromium concentration in drinking water has been reduced to 50 μg l or 50 ppb world health organization 1998 as against the earlier recommended levels of 100 μg l or 100 ppb usepa 1998 as per the ministry of environment forest and climate change moefcc govt of india the discharge limit set for effluent containing cr vi in surface inland waters is 0 1 mg l in order to satisfy the prescribed limits set by the various regulatory bodies it is necessary for industries to treat and eliminate cr vi from the effluent before it is released in the ecosystem or either use the treated wastewater for recycling reuse purpose different physical chemical techniques devised to remove cr vi from wastewater include chemical reduction followed by chemical precipitation fu and wang 2011 jawed et al 2020 ion exchange sahu et al 2009 electrochemical oxidation reduction lewinsky 2007 electrochemical treatment oztekin and yazicigil 2006 reverse osmosis wenten 2016 and solvent extraction el nadi 2017 among these the most commonly used is chemical reduction precipitation method however this process generates toxic sludge and requires license disposal in a developing country like india such chemical sludge s are disposed of in a specially designed engineered landfill called tsdf treatment storage disposal facility since such facilities being less in number transiting chemical sludge s from industrial location to tsdf facilities become highly energy intensive also the process of chemical reduction precipitation is not suitable for effluents containing relatively low concentration of cr vi other processes although efficient are beset with several problems such as high capital cost requirement of skilled manpower to operate the system energy intensive and thus prove to be uneconomical in view of this researchers are exploring biomass based processes to address this problem due to their several advantages biosorption is a physiochemical process that happens naturally in definite biomass which permits it to passively adhere and concentrate contaminants onto its cellular structure lian et al 2020 sengupta et al 2017 volesky 2003 the major advantages of biosorption over conventional treatment methods include low cost high efficiency reduction or no chemical and or biological sludge not subject to toxicity no requirement of supplementary nutrient renewal of biosorbent and probability of metal recovery sayago et al 2020 zong et al 2013 although biosorption of cr vi from aqueous solutions using variety of biomass have been studied by several researchers majority of these studies are centered on employing only one or two different type of biomass just by simple random selection rather than scientifically screening large number of low cost biomass which is amply available in a country like india and then selecting short listing the most efficient candidate i e biomass further selection of right efficient biosorbent candidate through comprehensive screening program is one of the essential steps in the development of sorption based process the authors in this paper focuses on the screening of diverse range of low cost waste biomass biomaterials for the sorption removal of cr vi from aqueous matrices and selection of the efficient biomaterial for actual process development 2 materials and methods 2 1 glassware chemicals reagents and analytical

3 days followed by drying in hot air oven bio informatics india model bti 29 at 100 c for 24 72 h cooled in dessicator and weighted the cycle of drying and cooling was repeated till consistent weight was attained in case of biomass such as ganoderma lucidum ganoderma applanatum and wood rotting fungi the researcher awaited for the natural cycle for its complete growth waste flowers collected from temples were segregated to remove spoiled flowers the selected one were than washed with distilled water cut into small pieces and soaked in water over night to remove colour the soaked sample was further cleaned using ultra sonicator and left for sun drying the samples were then weighed and further dryed in hot air oven at 100 c for 6 7 h till constant weight was obtained the acasia sawdust

subjected to simple acid wash before final drying to remove colour and odour to obtain homogenous particle size of 500 μm 0 5 mm the oven dried biomass was powdered using electric mixer and sieved to obtained desired particle size our literature survey showed that out of 40 biomass that were screened 5 of them were never employed by any researcher before for biosorption capacity towards cr vi removal and these were namely cardamom tamarind seeds cardamom tamarind pod cover ganoderma applanatum vigna unguiculata yardlong beans phaseolus coccineus runners rest of the biomass biomass were either used in their native state or carbonaceous form or used after treatment with acids and base or complexing agents 2 3 sorption experiments to assess all 40 biomass for their ability to remove cr vi from aqueous solution a batch equilibration system was implemented a set of 150 ml stoppered erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 ml of 50 mg l of cr vi solution was contacted with 1 g of biosorbent i e powdered biomass all the flasks were placed on a rotary shaker at 150 rpm for 60 min at 30 2 c the contents of the flasks were filtered using whatman filter paper no 2 and then the filtrate was analyzed for residual cr vi concentration by dpc method all the experiments were conducted in duplicates and reiterated twice to affirm the results appropriate positive and negative controls were used simultaneously alongside experiments in the form of activated charcoal ac and flask without biomass respectively the biosorption was deduced in terms of percentage and adsorption capacity using eq 1

phase of shortlisted biomass for cr vi was studied by contacting 1 g biosorbents powder with 50 ml cr vi solution of concentration 50 mg l at two different ph 3 0 4 0 and at two different particle size 250 and 500 μm until saturation was achieved 2 4 physicochemical properties of selected biomass wood apple shell was biomass shortlisted from earlier experiments was further studied for its physic chemical properties to determine oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of wasb boehm titration was carried out boehm 1994 üner et al 2019 in erlenmeyer flask 1 g of was biomass was contacted with 50 ml of the subsequent solutions of 0 1 n each and they were hydrochloric acid hcl sodium hydroxide naoh sodium carbonate na2co3 and sodium bicarbonate nahco3 the flasks were mounted on rotary shaker and agitated for 24 h at 100 rpm and then filtered 5 ml of filtrate was pipetted in a flask and to this 10 ml of standardized 0 05 n naoh was added the solution was then back titrated with 0 1 n hcl using phenolphthalein as an indicator to determine the basic functional groups similarly 5 ml aliquots were taken each of naoh na2co3 and nahco3 samples and were acidified with 10 ml standardized 0 05 n hcl solution the excess acid was back titrated with 0 1 n naoh the number of acidic sites present on was biomass surface was found under following supposition nahco3 neutralizes only carboxylic groups na2co3 neutralizes carboxylic and lactonic groups whereas naoh neutralizes carboxylic lactonic and phenolic groups the physico chemical properties of selected biomass were analyzed for specific surface area using sears method ebisike et al 2020 sears 1956 specific gravity apparent density bulk density webb 2001 was determined by using specific gravity bottle to determine total carbon percentage proximate analysis was conducted under which the moisture content volatile matter and ash content were determined ekpete and horsfall 2011 scanning electron microscopy sem was performed to adjudge the surface properties and possible adsorption behavior of was biomass towards cr vi ion sorption onto its surface ftir spectra of was biomass with and without cr vi loading was obtained by means of ftir spectrum jasco ftir 6100 with wave number in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 by the following standard procedure was biomass 0 5 g was mixed with 0 5 g of kbr and the mixture was crushed in mortar and pestle so as to obtain a homogenous mixture it was then introduced in a mould which was then subjected to ftir analysis background scan of the instrument was obtained without placing the pellet standard software provided with the instrument was used to obtain the data points further the data points were plotted using origin 8 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 waste biomass and cr vi removal efficiencies it is well known that certain types of natural waste biomass possess high metal binding sorption capacity at the same time they are metal selective the metal ions adsorption from aqueous solutions is entirely due to chemical functional groups existing on the surface of biomass dead and therefore metabolically inactive and by virtue of this it could be exploited for the application of biosorption process volesky 2003 with biosorption applications in mind it makes sense to screen diverse range of biomass that is accessible and available in large quantities based on the availability and cost efficiency biomass sources can be categorized as one which is obtained from water environment for examples unwanted plants like eicchornia sp and algae and the other as industrial waste which is found as by product on large scale for example saw dust sugarcane bagasse etc also there are multiple sources from where low cost biomass can be procured especially in agriculture rich country like india these include the vegetable waste waste flowers from temples and coconut husk etc so in order to find the right biosorbent candidate it was necessary to screen variety of biomass occurring in environment and determine their potential for further process development table 2 summarizes the results obtained for cr vi biosorption for all the 40 biomass tested the results obtained showed that maximum sorption in terms of percentage of 50 mg l of cr vi was found in the range as low as 1 39 to as high as 99 8 wood apple shell was biomass was found to be most efficient 99 8 while sugarcane bagasse showed the least sorption 1 39 apart from was other efficient biomass for cr vi sorption were coconut husk 89 34 acacia saw dust 74 and tectona grandis leaves 68 26 activated charcoal which was used as a reference material showed 98 1 of cr vi sorption it was found that the sorption percentage of activated charcoal was lower than was biomass there was no loss of cr vi in the control flasks without sorbent during the sorption time period this confirms the fact that biosorption is the only mechanism acting in the removal of cr vi from solutions for the present study all 40 biomass were tested for its biosorption capacity at ph 3 0 the selection of ph 3 0 for screening experiment was based on the literature review indicating maximum cr vi biosorption in acidic condition i e between 1 5 and 5 0 and dominant ph being 3 0 altun et al 2016 dehghani et al 2016 it was therefore thought worthwhile to select ph 3 0 for screening experiment on the basis of maximum cr vi uptake values biosorption obtained at ph 3 0 four biomass were shortlisted viz wood apple shell was coconut husk ch tectona grandis leaves and acacia saw dust for further experiments on loading capacity activated charcoal was taken as a reference material 3 2 cr vi loading capacity the cr vi loading capacity mg g bound per gram weight of the biosorbent powder was determined by contacting 1 g of biosorbent powder several times with fresh batches of 50 ml cr vi solution 50 mg l having ph 3 0 and 4 0 at two different particle size 250 and 500 until saturation was achieved each cycle of contact was operated for one hour duration the results on loading capacity of few selected biomass are depicted in table 3 it could be seen from the data in table 3 that with decrease in particle size and at low ph the sorption capacity of tested biomass increased at ph 3 was had the maximum loading capacity 29 37 mg g among the shortlisted biomass which was higher than the activated charcoal 26 56 mg g taken as positive control apart from was coconut husk showed reasonably good metal uptake 23 99 mg g under same experimental condition the metal loading capacity ability of the biomass could be taken equivalent to number of binding sites present on biomass several researchers have reported the adsorption capacity mg g of diverse range of biomaterials ahalya et al 2006 in general the reported loading capacity ranges from 0 2 mg g to 125 mg g masri and friedman 1974 sumathi et al 2005 surprisingly in few cases researchers have reported two or three different loading capacity values for same type of biomass kaya et al 2014 nameni et al 2008 in our studies the loading capacity of was biomass was found to be 29 37 mg g this value was higher when compared to most of the reported values if not all el nemr 2009 tang et al 2003 the observed higher loading capacity of was as compared to activated charcoal opens up novel likelihoods of developing an efficient biomass technology process for the removal and recovery of metal ions species from wastewaters based on the results obtained the present study was further focused on to was for the development of cr vi removal process details of the process development data for cr vi removal and recovery has not been given here as the focus of this paper was limited to screening of diverse waste biomass to identify efficient biomass candidate for cr vi removal and to elucidate sorption mechanism 3 3 physicochemical properties of sorbent the data in table 4 depicts the boehm s titration outcome for was it is clear from the results that the acidic sites are mainly due to the presence of carboxylic 0 08 meq g phenolic 0 25 meq g and lactonic groups 0 40 meq g while the total acidic groups were 0 73 meq g these results suggest that the amount of acidic groups were marginally higher than total basic groups several researchers have used boehm s titration to determine acidic and basic functional groups goertzen et al 2010 yunus et al 2020 however it has been reported that this method offers only semi quantitative analysis of the surface functionalities because it is known that chemical groups are far more complex than explained by boehm s titrations ekpete and horsfall 2011 in regard to the current study it could be deduced that acidic functional groups might have played a vital role in the biosorption of cr vi as chromium in solution exist in the form of chromate oxyanion form specific surface area of was biomass was also determined using sears method it was observed to be 399 63 m2 g which signifying the presence of more binding sites thus leading to more sorption this suggested that was biomass was a potential biosorbent for cr vi table 5 depicts the results of physicochemical parameters of was biomass specific gravity apparent density bulk density webb 2001 and some parameters of proximate analysis such as moisture content volatile matter and ash content was determined it was observed that the moisture and ash content of the was biomass was very less i e 3 6 and 9 62 respectively less amount of moisture content in was implies that drying will consume less time and energy which is very crucial from the economics view point of the process moreover the biomass powder can be easily prepared because of low moisture content 3 4 scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive x ray sem edx sem provides valuable information concerning structure orientation of materials external morphology texture chemical composition and crystalline structure kuang et al 2020 vernè et al 2005 to adjudge this morphological features of was sample was examined using high resolution sem edx jeol model jsm 6360 a the sample was coated with platinum for 30 90 s at 50 ma current in vacuum before obtaining the sem micrograph before sem edx analysis the biomass sample was contacted with cr vi solution multiple times until saturation point to ascertain biosorption of metal ion on the surface of biomass sem image of pre and post sorption of cr vi on was biomass was obtained at varying magnification to detect their surface texture and sorbent porosity figs 1 2 and 3 shows the sem image of was biomass before cr vi loading while fig 4 5 and 6 shows the sem image of was biomass after cr vi loading the figs 1 6 clearly revealed the alteration in the biomass morphology biomass without cr vi loading shows tubular cylindrical structure with significant number of micropores figs 1 3 whereas the biomass enriched with cr vi reveals the disappearance of micropores and slight irregularity in the structure it is also evident that the surface of the materials and their shape has transformed to shiny whitish structure after cr vi biosorption figs 4 6 the development of white film pockets on the surface of the was sorbent implies that the sorbent is loaded with cr vi ions aravind et al 2015 an edx spectrum helps to recognize specific element and their relative fraction atomic in the biomass the images obtained through edx shows y axis displaying the counts i e number of x rays received and processed by the detectors while the x axis displays the energy level of those counts figs 7 and 8 depicts sem edx analysis of was biomass before and after loading of cr vi respectively edx spectrum of cr vi loaded was clearly shows the presence of peak for cr vi which confirms the potential of was as good material for biosorption table 6 shows the quantitative result of edx images of was biomass before and after cr vi loading edx images and tabular data confirms the adhesion of cr vi on biomass surface 3 5 ftir study ir spectroscopy is a powerful analytical techniques for the identification of chemical constituents present on the surface of the biomaterial nurchi and villaescusa 2011 this technique provides valuable information on bonding interaction between sorbate metal and sorbent biomaterial michalak et al 2013 petrović et al 2016 fig 9 shows the ftir spectrum of was biomass before and after cr vi biosorption number of absorption peaks obtain reflects the complex nature of the biomass it could be seen that there was a noteworthy shift of absorption peaks suggesting the coordination between metal and the biomass the spectra of sorbents shows a broad band at 3448 cm 1 which corresponds to presence of oh stretching vibration on the sorbent surface blanes et al 2016 namasivayam and sureshkumar 2008 the shift of the band from 3448 cm 1 to 3391 cm 1 may be attributed to complexation of hydrogen bonded oh group with the cr vi ions the peak at 2909 cm 1 signifies the presence of ch oh stretch representing carboxyl group the change in intensity to lower frequency 2904 cm 1 attributes to interaction between cr vi and carboxyl functional group present on was abdullah et al 2017 the shift observed from 1734 cm 1 to higher frequency 1740 cm 1 signifies characteristic frequency of co stretching indicating the presence of aldehydes similarly further shifts noticed from 1656 5 cm 1 to 1659 7 cm 1 and 1592 cm 1 to 1594 cm 1 may be because of interaction of nitrogen from amino group with cr vi ions confirming the presence of amide group begonja et al 2012 it was also seen that ch rocking of alkanes was represented by the shift from 1330 cm 1 to 1371 cm 1 shift to a lower frequency was observed from 1255 cm 1 to 1243 cm 1 which can be due to cn stretching due to aliphatic amines interaction of cr vi with nitrogen from amino group may result into next shift noticed between 1161 cm 1 to 1159 54 cm 1 1089 50 cm 1 to 1076 47 cm 1 as reported by niu and volesky 2006 characteristic peak of dichromate are located between 800 and 950 cm 1 in the present study an absorption peak shifted from 900 cm 1 to 899 cm 1 indicating stretching frequencies of cro in cr2o7 2 group which confirms that cr vi ions were bound on the surface of was biomass the weak shift from 618 40 cm 1 to 609 cm 1 and 570 23 cm 1 to 563 34 cm 1 corresponds to the o c o scissoring vibration the above changes in the spectra may be ascribed to the interaction of cr vi with the amino nh hydroxyl oh and carboxyl cooh groups existing on the surface of the biomass these results evidently indicates the binding of cr vi to the biomass and agrees equally well with the boehm titration results table 7 summarizes all the peaks and bands representing the functional group present on the surface of was biomass pre and post loading with cr vi 3 6 experiment on electroplating industrial waste water after ascertaining the efficiency of was biomass for cr vi removal it was experimented with cr vi containing wastewater procured from electroplating industry located in pune india a batch mode biosorption experiment was performed in 150 ml erlenmeyer flask containing 25 ml of chromium laden effluent prior to the experiment the original effluent was diluted to attain 50 mg l concentration studies were carried out under optimized condition of ph 4 0 particle size 500 μm 35 c temperature contact time of 60 mins and biomass quantity of 1 g it was found that the was biomass removed the cr vi from industrial waste with an efficient of 99 9 thus complying with the statutory limits as per indian statutory norms of 0 1 mg l for discharge of effluent on inland surface waters it was also observed that was biomass was efficient in the removal of other metal contaminants in the industrial effluents such as copper iron and zinc data not shown the effluent once treated and free from cr vi could be used for diluting the original effluent thereby reducing the demand for fresh water thus the experimental results showed that was biomass was highly efficient and can be a prospective candidate for cr vi removal from dilute solutions and can help in environmental cleanup 4 conclusions india being an agricultural and hot tropical nation is bestowed with abundant waste biomass which is cheaply available and accessible there is a plenty scope for converting this waste biomass into energy generation and pollution control applications however only 3 of such biomass has been tapped in india so far yogesh and prakash 2015 considering that biomass inherently has got several surface charges functional groups they could be exploited for the removal of diverse range of contaminants from wastewaters thereby resulting into environmental cleanup in view of this the present study was therefore focused on screening of diverse range of biomass for the removal of cr vi from aqueous matrices investigations were carried out on 40 different biomass obtained from diverse sources the results showed that wood apple shell was biomass was found to be most efficient 99 8 for cr vi biosorption which was followed coconut husk 89 34 acacia saw dust 74 and tectona grandis leaves 68 26 activated charcoal which was used as a reference material showed 98 1 of cr vi sorption further the loading capacity experiment carried out on the four shortlisted biomass also revealed that was biomass was the most efficient biomass in removing cr vi from solutions interestingly in both the major experiments that is screening and loading capacity it was found that was biomass was more efficient than the conventional activated charcoal which was used as control this opens up novel likelihoods of developing an efficient biomass based technology process for the removal and recovery of metal ions species from wastewaters mechanism of cr vi biosorption was elucidated by subjecting the cr vi loaded was biomass to chemical method and instrumental analysis edx analysis confirmed the adhesion of cr vi on the surface of was biomass while sem analysis revealed the presence of micropores on natural was biomass surface and that these micropores helped in adsorption of metal on the surface of the biomass sem analysis confirmed the pre and post adsorption of cr vi on biomass ftir analysis showed that changes in the spectra may be ascribed to the interaction of cr vi with the amino nh hydroxyl oh and carboxyl cooh functional groups existing on the surface of was biomass these results evidently indicates the binding of cr vi to the biomass and agrees equally well with the boehm titration results investigations were also carried out on the removal of cr vi using was biomass from actual industrial wastewater obtained from electroplating unit it was observed that wasb removed the cr vi from industrial wastewater with an efficiency of 99 9 thus complying with the statutory limits as per indian statutory norms of 0 1 mg l for discharge of effluent on inland surface waters wasb was also efficient in the removal of other metal contaminants in the industrial effluents such as copper iron and zinc considering the economical aspect the selected biomass can be viewed as a potential candidate for the removal of toxic contaminant from the wastewater in this study the authors have screened 40 different types of waste biomass from the futuristic perspective the potential of other biomass available elsewhere can be explored and at the same time was biomass can be tested for the removal of other heavy metals present in the wastewaters heavy metals whether toxic or precious are known to be non renewable and finite resource and therefore it is important to remove and recover metals from industrial matrices to achieve sustainability the following are the supplementary data related to this article table s1 adsorption at equilibrium of various biomass for

1436,pollution caused due to discharge of toxic and hazardous chemical contaminants from industrial processes is an issue of major environmental concern hexavalent chromium cr vi is one such known toxic heavy metal contaminant emanated largely from various industrial processes since physical chemical treatment techniques are beset with several problems there is an increased attention on the use of waste biomaterials biomass as sorbents for the elimination of heavy metals from aqueous matrices the main purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of some low cost waste biomaterials such as fruit wastes agricultural and industrial waste byproducts waste parts of photosynthetic plants aquatic plants and fungal biomass collected from different sources for the biosorption of cr vi from aqueous matrices amid the tested biomaterials wood apple shell was biomass limonia acidissima was found to be highly efficient biosorbent for cr vi sorption in majority of biomass it was observed that biosorption of cr vi took place at acidic ph with optimum ph ranging from 2 0 to 5 0 loading capacity of was biomass 29 37 mg g was higher than that of conventional adsorbent activated charcoal 26 56 mg g which was used as control cr vi treated biomass was was characterized using instrumental techniques such as scanned electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive x ray edx confirmed the adsorption of cr vi boehm titration and ftir studies were conducted to ascertain the presence of functional groups responsible for cr vi sorption by was biomass the was biomass removed cr vi from industrial wastewater with an efficiency of 99 9 thus complying with the statutory limits considering the economical aspect the selected biomass can be viewed as a potential candidate for the elimination of toxic contaminant from wastewater keywords biosorption hexavalent chromium limonia acidissima loading capacity wood apple shell was biomass 1 introduction chromium is considered as a metal with two facades that is it is valuable and as well as hazardous not only to humans but also to plants animals and microorganisms the action of chromium metal depends on its oxidation state and concentration bhusari et al 2016 in aqueous matrices it usually exists in both hexavalent cr vi and trivalent cr iii form cr iii acts as micronutrient and is essential for functioning of vital organs in humans whereas cr vi is of great concern because of its toxic nature hu et al 2019 patil and itankar 2020 cr iii is relatively insoluble in aqueous medium whereas compounds of cr vi shows high solubility and thus mobility in ecosystem daoud et al 2016 mystrioti et al 2016 cr vi being water soluble and mobile in nature can penetrate the cell membrane and reduce to cr iii producing reactive hydroxyl radicals during the process which in turn produce oxidative stress in cell causing oxidative deterioration of biological macromolecules jaishankar et al 2014 stohs et al 2001 cr vi is a well known human carcinogen and mutagen international agency for research on cancer 1990 lytras et al 2017 leong and chang 2020 usepa 1998 and is 500 1000 times more toxic than cr iii atsdr 2000 dayan and paine 2001 kowalski 1994 itankar and patil 2014 zhang et al 2017 international agency for research on cancer 1990 had reported that there are ample evidences in human for the carcinogenic action of cr vi compounds established on the basis of joint result of epidemiological and cancer studies in experimental animals xie et al 2017 toxic cr vi finds its way in nature due to anthropogenic activities industries such as electroplating metallurgy leather tanning textile dyeing metal finishing welding of alloys steel ceramics manufacturing and several others emanate huge volumes of effluents containing cr vi gupta and babu 2009 ihsanullah al khaldi et al 2016 malkoc and nuhoglu 2007 due to negative environmental impact many industrially developed countries have been forced to set discharge limit to both cr iii and cr vi bhattacharya et al 2008 most surface water contains 1 to 10 μg l of cr vi while the guidelines prescribed by who is 0 05 mg l world health organization 1998 the total chromium concentration in drinking water has been reduced to 50 μg l or 50 ppb world health organization 1998 as against the earlier recommended levels of 100 μg l or 100 ppb usepa 1998 as per the ministry of environment forest and climate change moefcc govt of india the discharge limit set for effluent containing cr vi in surface inland waters is 0 1 mg l in order to satisfy the prescribed limits set by the various regulatory bodies it is necessary for industries to treat and eliminate cr vi from the effluent before it is released in the ecosystem or either use the treated wastewater for recycling reuse purpose different physical chemical techniques devised to remove cr vi from wastewater include chemical reduction followed by chemical precipitation fu and wang 2011 jawed et al 2020 ion exchange sahu et al 2009 electrochemical oxidation reduction lewinsky 2007 electrochemical treatment oztekin and yazicigil 2006 reverse osmosis wenten 2016 and solvent extraction el nadi 2017 among these the most commonly used is chemical reduction precipitation method however this process generates toxic sludge and requires license disposal in a developing country like india such chemical sludge s are disposed of in a specially designed engineered landfill called tsdf treatment storage disposal facility since such facilities being less in number transiting chemical sludge s from industrial location to tsdf facilities become highly energy intensive also the process of chemical reduction precipitation is not suitable for effluents containing relatively low concentration of cr vi other processes although efficient are beset with several problems such as high capital cost requirement of skilled manpower to operate the system energy intensive and thus prove to be uneconomical in view of this researchers are exploring biomass based processes to address this problem due to their several advantages biosorption is a physiochemical process that happens naturally in definite biomass which permits it to passively adhere and concentrate contaminants onto its cellular structure lian et al 2020 sengupta et al 2017 volesky 2003 the major advantages of biosorption over conventional treatment methods include low cost high efficiency reduction or no chemical and or biological sludge not subject to toxicity no requirement of supplementary nutrient renewal of biosorbent and probability of metal recovery sayago et al 2020 zong et al 2013 although biosorption of cr vi from aqueous solutions using variety of biomass have been studied by several researchers majority of these studies are centered on employing only one or two different type of biomass just by simple random selection rather than scientifically screening large number of low cost biomass which is amply available in a country like india and then selecting short listing the most efficient candidate i e biomass further selection of right efficient biosorbent candidate through comprehensive screening program is one of the essential steps in the development of sorption based process the authors in this paper focuses on the screening of diverse range of low cost waste biomass biomaterials for the sorption removal of cr vi from aqueous matrices and selection of the efficient biomaterial for actual process development 2 materials and methods 2 1 glassware chemicals reagents and analytical

c for 24 72 h and finally sieved to obtained desired particle size dairy waste sludge was collected from local diary farm after collection the material was ground and homogenized tea powder waste was subjected to simple acid wash before final drying to remove colour and odour to obtain homogenous particle size of 500 μm 0 5 mm the oven dried biomass was powdered using electric mixer and sieved to obtained desired particle size our literature survey showed that out of 40 biomass that were screened 5 of them were never employed by any researcher before for biosorption capacity towards cr vi removal and these were namely cardamom tamarind seeds cardamom tamarind pod cover ganoderma applanatum vigna unguiculata yardlong beans phaseolus coccineus runners rest of the biomass biomass were either used in their native state or carbonaceous form or used after treatment with acids and base or complexing agents 2 3 sorption experiments to assess all 40 biomass for their ability to remove cr vi from aqueous solution a batch equilibration system was implemented a set of 150 ml stoppered erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 ml of 50 mg l of cr vi solution was contacted with 1 g of biosorbent i e powdered biomass all the flasks were placed on a rotary shaker at 150 rpm for 60 min at 30 2 c the contents of the flasks were filtered using whatman filter paper no 2 and then the filtrate was analyzed for residual cr vi concentration by dpc method all the experiments were conducted in duplicates and reiterated twice to affirm the results appropriate positive and negative controls were used simultaneously alongside experiments in the form of activated charcoal ac and flask without biomass respectively the biosorption was deduced in terms of percentage and adsorption capacity using eq 1

phase of shortlisted biomass for cr vi was studied by contacting 1 g biosorbents powder with 50 ml cr vi solution of concentration 50 mg l at two different ph 3 0 4 0 and at two different particle size 250 and 500 μm until saturation was achieved 2 4 physicochemical properties of selected biomass wood apple shell was biomass shortlisted from earlier experiments was further studied for its physic chemical properties to determine oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of wasb boehm titration was carried out boehm 1994 üner et al 2019 in erlenmeyer flask 1 g of was biomass was contacted with 50 ml of the subsequent solutions of 0 1 n each and they were hydrochloric acid hcl sodium hydroxide naoh sodium carbonate na2co3 and sodium bicarbonate nahco3 the flasks were mounted on rotary shaker and agitated for 24 h at 100 rpm and then filtered 5 ml of filtrate was pipetted in a flask and to this 10 ml of standardized 0 05 n naoh was added the solution was then back titrated with 0 1 n hcl using phenolphthalein as an indicator to determine the basic functional groups similarly 5 ml aliquots were taken each of naoh na2co3 and nahco3 samples and were acidified with 10 ml standardized 0 05 n hcl solution the excess acid was back titrated with 0 1 n naoh the number of acidic sites present on was biomass surface was found under following supposition nahco3 neutralizes only carboxylic groups na2co3 neutralizes carboxylic and lactonic groups whereas naoh neutralizes carboxylic lactonic and phenolic groups the physico chemical properties of selected biomass were analyzed for specific surface area using sears method ebisike et al 2020 sears 1956 specific gravity apparent density bulk density webb 2001 was determined by using specific gravity bottle to determine total carbon percentage proximate analysis was conducted under which the moisture content volatile matter and ash content were determined ekpete and horsfall 2011 scanning electron microscopy sem was performed to adjudge the surface properties and possible adsorption behavior of was biomass towards cr vi ion sorption onto its surface ftir spectra of was biomass with and without cr vi loading was obtained by means of ftir spectrum jasco ftir 6100 with wave number in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 by the following standard procedure was biomass 0 5 g was mixed with 0 5 g of kbr and the mixture was crushed in mortar and pestle so as to obtain a homogenous mixture it was then introduced in a mould which was then subjected to ftir analysis background scan of the instrument was obtained without placing the pellet standard software provided with the instrument was used to obtain the data points further the data points were plotted using origin 8 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 waste biomass and cr vi removal efficiencies it is well known that certain types of natural waste biomass possess high metal binding sorption capacity at the same time they are metal selective the metal ions adsorption from aqueous solutions is entirely due to chemical functional groups existing on the surface of biomass dead and therefore metabolically inactive and by virtue of this it could be exploited for the application of biosorption process volesky 2003 with biosorption applications in mind it makes sense to screen diverse range of biomass that is accessible and available in large quantities based on the availability and cost efficiency biomass sources can be categorized as one which is obtained from water environment for examples unwanted plants like eicchornia sp and algae and the other as industrial waste which is found as by product on large scale for example saw dust sugarcane bagasse etc also there are multiple sources from where low cost biomass can be procured especially in agriculture rich country like india these include the vegetable waste waste flowers from temples and coconut husk etc so in order to find the right biosorbent candidate it was necessary to screen variety of biomass occurring in environment and determine their potential for further process development table 2 summarizes the results obtained for cr vi biosorption for all the 40 biomass tested the results obtained showed that maximum sorption in terms of percentage of 50 mg l of cr vi was found in the range as low as 1 39 to as high as 99 8 wood apple shell was biomass was found to be most efficient 99 8 while sugarcane bagasse showed the least sorption 1 39 apart from was other efficient biomass for cr vi sorption were coconut husk 89 34 acacia saw dust 74 and tectona grandis leaves 68 26 activated charcoal which was used as a reference material showed 98 1 of cr vi sorption it was found that the sorption percentage of activated charcoal was lower than was biomass there was no loss of cr vi in the control flasks without sorbent during the sorption time period this confirms the fact that biosorption is the only mechanism acting in the removal of cr vi from solutions for the present study all 40 biomass were tested for its biosorption capacity at ph 3 0 the selection of ph 3 0 for screening experiment was based on the literature review indicating maximum cr vi biosorption in acidic condition i e between 1 5 and 5 0 and dominant ph being 3 0 altun et al 2016 dehghani et al 2016 it was therefore thought worthwhile to select ph 3 0 for screening experiment on the basis of maximum cr vi uptake values biosorption obtained at ph 3 0 four biomass were shortlisted viz wood apple shell was coconut husk ch tectona grandis leaves and acacia saw dust for further experiments on loading capacity activated charcoal was taken as a reference material 3 2 cr vi loading capacity the cr vi loading capacity mg g bound per gram weight of the biosorbent powder was determined by contacting 1 g of biosorbent powder several times with fresh batches of 50 ml cr vi solution 50 mg l having ph 3 0 and 4 0 at two different particle size 250 and 500 until saturation was achieved each cycle of contact was operated for one hour duration the results on loading capacity of few selected biomass are depicted in table 3 it could be seen from the data in table 3 that with decrease in particle size and at low ph the sorption capacity of tested biomass increased at ph 3 was had the maximum loading capacity 29 37 mg g among the shortlisted biomass which was higher than the activated charcoal 26 56 mg g taken as positive control apart from was coconut husk showed reasonably good metal uptake 23 99 mg g under same experimental condition the metal loading capacity ability of the biomass could be taken equivalent to number of binding sites present on biomass several researchers have reported the adsorption capacity mg g of diverse range of biomaterials ahalya et al 2006 in general the reported loading capacity ranges from 0 2 mg g to 125 mg g masri and friedman 1974 sumathi et al 2005 surprisingly in few cases researchers have reported two or three different loading capacity values for same type of biomass kaya et al 2014 nameni et al 2008 in our studies the loading capacity of was biomass was found to be 29 37 mg g this value was higher when compared to most of the reported values if not all el nemr 2009 tang et al 2003 the observed higher loading capacity of was as compared to activated charcoal opens up novel likelihoods of developing an efficient biomass technology process for the removal and recovery of metal ions species from wastewaters based on the results obtained the present study was further focused on to was for the development of cr vi removal process details of the process development data for cr vi removal and recovery has not been given here as the focus of this paper was limited to screening of diverse waste biomass to identify efficient biomass candidate for cr vi removal and to elucidate sorption mechanism 3 3 physicochemical properties of sorbent the data in table 4 depicts the boehm s titration outcome for was it is clear from the results that the acidic sites are mainly due to the presence of carboxylic 0 08 meq g phenolic 0 25 meq g and lactonic groups 0 40 meq g while the total acidic groups were 0 73 meq g these results suggest that the amount of acidic groups were marginally higher than total basic groups several researchers have used boehm s titration to determine acidic and basic functional groups goertzen et al 2010 yunus et al 2020 however it has been reported that this method offers only semi quantitative analysis of the surface functionalities because it is known that chemical groups are far more complex than explained by boehm s titrations ekpete and horsfall 2011 in regard to the current study it could be deduced that acidic functional groups might have played a vital role in the biosorption of cr vi as chromium in solution exist in the form of chromate oxyanion form specific surface area of was biomass was also determined using sears method it was observed to be 399 63 m2 g which signifying the presence of more binding sites thus leading to more sorption this suggested that was biomass was a potential biosorbent for cr vi table 5 depicts the results of physicochemical parameters of was biomass specific gravity apparent density bulk density webb 2001 and some parameters of proximate analysis such as moisture content volatile matter and ash content was determined it was observed that the moisture and ash content of the was biomass was very less i e 3 6 and 9 62 respectively less amount of moisture content in was implies that drying will consume less time and energy which is very crucial from the economics view point of the process moreover the biomass powder can be easily prepared because of low moisture content 3 4 scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive x ray sem edx sem provides valuable information concerning structure orientation of materials external morphology texture chemical composition and crystalline structure kuang et al 2020 vernè et al 2005 to adjudge this morphological features of was sample was examined using high resolution sem edx jeol model jsm 6360 a the sample was coated with platinum for 30 90 s at 50 ma current in vacuum before obtaining the sem micrograph before sem edx analysis the biomass sample was contacted with cr vi solution multiple times until saturation point to ascertain biosorption of metal ion on the surface of biomass sem image of pre and post sorption of cr vi on was biomass was obtained at varying magnification to detect their surface texture and sorbent porosity figs 1 2 and 3 shows the sem image of was biomass before cr vi loading while fig 4 5 and 6 shows the sem image of was biomass after cr vi loading the figs 1 6 clearly revealed the alteration in the biomass morphology biomass without cr vi loading shows tubular cylindrical structure with significant number of micropores figs 1 3 whereas the biomass enriched with cr vi reveals the disappearance of micropores and slight irregularity in the structure it is also evident that the surface of the materials and their shape has transformed to shiny whitish structure after cr vi biosorption figs 4 6 the development of white film pockets on the surface of the was sorbent implies that the sorbent is loaded with cr vi ions aravind et al 2015 an edx spectrum helps to recognize specific element and their relative fraction atomic in the biomass the images obtained through edx shows y axis displaying the counts i e number of x rays received and processed by the detectors while the x axis displays the energy level of those counts figs 7 and 8 depicts sem edx analysis of was biomass before and after loading of cr vi respectively edx spectrum of cr vi loaded was clearly shows the presence of peak for cr vi which confirms the potential of was as good material for biosorption table 6 shows the quantitative result of edx images of was biomass before and after cr vi loading edx images and tabular data confirms the adhesion of cr vi on biomass surface 3 5 ftir study ir spectroscopy is a powerful analytical techniques for the identification of chemical constituents present on the surface of the biomaterial nurchi and villaescusa 2011 this technique provides valuable information on bonding interaction between sorbate metal and sorbent biomaterial michalak et al 2013 petrović et al 2016 fig 9 shows the ftir spectrum of was biomass before and after cr vi biosorption number of absorption peaks obtain reflects the complex nature of the biomass it could be seen that there was a noteworthy shift of absorption peaks suggesting the coordination between metal and the biomass the spectra of sorbents shows a broad band at 3448 cm 1 which corresponds to presence of oh stretching vibration on the sorbent surface blanes et al 2016 namasivayam and sureshkumar 2008 the shift of the band from 3448 cm 1 to 3391 cm 1 may be attributed to complexation of hydrogen bonded oh group with the cr vi ions the peak at 2909 cm 1 signifies the presence of ch oh stretch representing carboxyl group the change in intensity to lower frequency 2904 cm 1 attributes to interaction between cr vi and carboxyl functional group present on was abdullah et al 2017 the shift observed from 1734 cm 1 to higher frequency 1740 cm 1 signifies characteristic frequency of co stretching indicating the presence of aldehydes similarly further shifts noticed from 1656 5 cm 1 to 1659 7 cm 1 and 1592 cm 1 to 1594 cm 1 may be because of interaction of nitrogen from amino group with cr vi ions confirming the presence of amide group begonja et al 2012 it was also seen that ch rocking of alkanes was represented by the shift from 1330 cm 1 to 1371 cm 1 shift to a lower frequency was observed from 1255 cm 1 to 1243 cm 1 which can be due to cn stretching due to aliphatic amines interaction of cr vi with nitrogen from amino group may result into next shift noticed between 1161 cm 1 to 1159 54 cm 1 1089 50 cm 1 to 1076 47 cm 1 as reported by niu and volesky 2006 characteristic peak of dichromate are located between 800 and 950 cm 1 in the present study an absorption peak shifted from 900 cm 1 to 899 cm 1 indicating stretching frequencies of cro in cr2o7 2 group which confirms that cr vi ions were bound on the surface of was biomass the weak shift from 618 40 cm 1 to 609 cm 1 and 570 23 cm 1 to 563 34 cm 1 corresponds to the o c o scissoring vibration the above changes in the spectra may be ascribed to the interaction of cr vi with the amino nh hydroxyl oh and carboxyl cooh groups existing on the surface of the biomass these results evidently indicates the binding of cr vi to the biomass and agrees equally well with the boehm titration results table 7 summarizes all the peaks and bands representing the functional group present on the surface of was biomass pre and post loading with cr vi 3 6 experiment on electroplating industrial waste water after ascertaining the efficiency of was biomass for cr vi removal it was experimented with cr vi containing wastewater procured from electroplating industry located in pune india a batch mode biosorption experiment was performed in 150 ml erlenmeyer flask containing 25 ml of chromium laden effluent prior to the experiment the original effluent was diluted to attain 50 mg l concentration studies were carried out under optimized condition of ph 4 0 particle size 500 μm 35 c temperature contact time of 60 mins and biomass quantity of 1 g it was found that the was biomass removed the cr vi from industrial waste with an efficient of 99 9 thus complying with the statutory limits as per indian statutory norms of 0 1 mg l for discharge of effluent on inland surface waters it was also observed that was biomass was efficient in the removal of other metal contaminants in the industrial effluents such as copper iron and zinc data not shown the effluent once treated and free from cr vi could be used for diluting the original effluent thereby reducing the demand for fresh water thus the experimental results showed that was biomass was highly efficient and can be a prospective candidate for cr vi removal from dilute solutions and can help in environmental cleanup 4 conclusions india being an agricultural and hot tropical nation is bestowed with abundant waste biomass which is cheaply available and accessible there is a plenty scope for converting this waste biomass into energy generation and pollution control applications however only 3 of such biomass has been tapped in india so far yogesh and prakash 2015 considering that biomass inherently has got several surface charges functional groups they could be exploited for the removal of diverse range of contaminants from wastewaters thereby resulting into environmental cleanup in view of this the present study was therefore focused on screening of diverse range of biomass for the removal of cr vi from aqueous matrices investigations were carried out on 40 different biomass obtained from diverse sources the results showed that wood apple shell was biomass was found to be most efficient 99 8 for cr vi biosorption which was followed coconut husk 89 34 acacia saw dust 74 and tectona grandis leaves 68 26 activated charcoal which was used as a reference material showed 98 1 of cr vi sorption further the loading capacity experiment carried out on the four shortlisted biomass also revealed that was biomass was the most efficient biomass in removing cr vi from solutions interestingly in both the major experiments that is screening and loading capacity it was found that was biomass was more efficient than the conventional activated charcoal which was used as control this opens up novel likelihoods of developing an efficient biomass based technology process for the removal and recovery of metal ions species from wastewaters mechanism of cr vi biosorption was elucidated by subjecting the cr vi loaded was biomass to chemical method and instrumental analysis edx analysis confirmed the adhesion of cr vi on the surface of was biomass while sem analysis revealed the presence of micropores on natural was biomass surface and that these micropores helped in adsorption of metal on the surface of the biomass sem analysis confirmed the pre and post adsorption of cr vi on biomass ftir analysis showed that changes in the spectra may be ascribed to the interaction of cr vi with the amino nh hydroxyl oh and carboxyl cooh functional groups existing on the surface of was biomass these results evidently indicates the binding of cr vi to the biomass and agrees equally well with the boehm titration results investigations were also carried out on the removal of cr vi using was biomass from actual industrial wastewater obtained from electroplating unit it was observed that wasb removed the cr vi from industrial wastewater with an efficiency of 99 9 thus complying with the statutory limits as per indian statutory norms of 0 1 mg l for discharge of effluent on inland surface waters wasb was also efficient in the removal of other metal contaminants in the industrial effluents such as copper iron and zinc considering the economical aspect the selected biomass can be viewed as a potential candidate for the removal of toxic contaminant from the wastewater in this study the authors have screened 40 different types of waste biomass from the futuristic perspective the potential of other biomass available elsewhere can be explored and at the same time was biomass can be tested for the removal of other heavy metals present in the wastewaters heavy metals whether toxic or precious are known to be non renewable and finite resource and therefore it is important to remove and recover metals from industrial matrices to achieve sustainability the following are the supplementary data related to this article table s1 adsorption at equilibrium of various biomass for

1437,methods for interpreting tracer tests often rely on equations assuming a natural regional flow which is straight and uniform the main purpose of this project was to develop more realistic equations for the advective part of contaminant transport by including the flow lines distortion occurring in the vicinity of the injection well the complex potential of the flow during a tracer test was calculated by superimposing the complex potential of a natural straight and uniform flow distorted by the presence of a passive well and the complex potential of a radial flow corresponding to an isotropic injection alone the equations were developed for a horizontal plan and the calculated complex potential yielded a groundwater velocity field and after that a formula connecting the position of the advancing front of the tracer plume to the injection duration these new equations were then tested with numerical simulations a two dimensional aquifer plan was modeled and set in order to numerically solve particle tracking and travel time computation of the moving front within a reasonable calculation time this model provided a comparison of times needed to fully recover the tracer plume previously injected the one calculated with the new equations and the one calculated with former equations neglecting the impact of the well presence on the groundwater flow field the results showed that the new equations are significantly more precise in particular when the injection rate is sufficiently low compared to the natural regional flow rate with a relatively large well diameter and in the vicinity of the injection well three different plume shapes could be visualized numerically and those shapes depend on the value of a parameter which compares the velocity component caused by the injection in the well and the component caused by the natural regional flow graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords tracer test push pull test well straight uniform flow analytical solution 1 introduction 1 1 tracer tests a tracer test consists in the injection in a well of a tracer and in the observation of how it spreads into the aquifer the tracer can be reactive or not according to the parameters the performer of the test wants to estimate such as among others effective porosity longitudinal and transverse dispersivities regional water rate for non reactive tracers and delay or partition coefficients for reactive tracers preparation and interpretation of tracer tests lead to very complex problems indeed many parameters have to be controlled in a tracer test geometry flow rates concentration sampling frequency injection and pumping methods among others among which the three most difficult to estimate according to field 2003 are the tracer mass to inject the time of the beginning of sampling and the sampling frequency many researchers tried to develop equations for estimating the tracer mass to inject but in general it was proven that these equations are not precise enough for tracer tests käss 1998 field 2003 tested 33 equations for estimating the tracer mass to inject and the sampling frequency which were developed before his work and has compared them to the efficient hydrologic tracer test design ehtd that he developed field 2002a 2002b only ehtd is based on transport theory the other equations having been developed empirically results showed that ehtd is the most reliable tested method this method is now used by the united states environmental protection agency for estimating the tracer mass to inject and the sampling frequency for a tracer test u s epa 2003 many parameters are involved for designing a tracer test and the work presented in this article focus on effects generated by the water column in the well into which the tracer is injected tracer tests can be separated into four main categories a test in converging flow consists in the injection of tracer in a passive well and its recovery in an active pumping well by discrete sampling it is the situation examined by guides for protection perimeters for drinkable water capture in france switzerland quebec or the usa among others u s epa 2003 lallemand barrès and roux 1989 parriaux and bussard 2003 rasmussen et al 2006 for a test in diverging flow a tracer is injected in an active well at a known rate and it is recovered in one or several passive wells by discrete sampling a dipole tracer test uses an active well injecting a tracer at a known rate and another active well recovering it pumping the same rate as the injection well and where water is sampled discretely finally it is possible to perform a tracer test in an active well alone which injects a tracer at a known rate and then recovers it by pumping after an optional drift phase the basic solution of bear and jacobs 1965 for confined aquifers detailed in next section and its equivalent for unconfined aquifers solution of grubb 1993 are reference solutions for tracer tests in converging or diverging flow u s epa 2003 lallemand barrès and roux 1989 parriaux and bussard 2003 rasmussen et al 2006 other equations were developed to complete these basic solutions under different conditions chapuis 2011a chapuis and chesnaux 2006 todd 1980 simpson et al 2003 in these analytical solutions the well is supposed to be a vertical line it does not have a radius hence no volume for tracer tests in converging or diverging flow hundreds of liters per minute are pumped for whole days the water stored inside the well of the order of dozens of liters is therefore negligible before the pumped volume the basic solution of bear and jacobs 1965 is hence a good approximation for such a test on the other hand this solution is also used for dipole tests or push pull tests which use only one well but in those cases tests can be performed with injections of the order of one liter per minute during 20 to 60 min the volume stored inside the well is no longer negligible and dilution and transport phenomena may make the solution of bear and jacobs 1965 unreliable this article focuses on these cases with push pull tracer tests which are regularly performed to quantify several processes in bioremediation projects pitterle et al 2005 reusser et al 2002 wu et al 2006 or to assess a contaminant mass flux in groundwater wang et al 2013 goltz et al 2009 chapuis 2019a the interpretation of tracer tests breakthrough curves is a relatively young topic of research and existing methods are often questioned because of phenomena that are neglected while conceiving them paradis et al 2018 have complexified the equation of hall et al 1991 which estimates the effective porosity of an aquifer from the data of a push pull test by taking into account transport during the injection phase phenomenon neglected with the former method the results of this study showed that there were cases for which this approximation lead to important mistakes wang and zhan 2019 proposed a new analytical solution for interpreting tracer tests by considering the influence of storage in the well indeed at the beginning of the test the dilution of the tracer in the water already present in the well can lead to errors in the interpretation of breakthrough curves studies were made recently to estimate the best pumping rate or the best duration for the drift phase when performing a push pull test kuo et al 2018 kim et al 2019 indeed if the pumping rate is too low the injected tracer is not fully recovered and the position of the center of mass of the plume is then miscalculated the duration of the drift phase influences the shape of the breakthrough curve which can have zero one or two peaks brouyère et al 2008 developed a tracer test which does not need neither a pumping phase nor an observation well downstream of the injection well in order to have a breakthrough curve this method is called the finite volume point dilution method and consists in the measurement of the concentration of the tracer test in the water of the injection well while the injection is performed this method has the advantage of being able to interpret data during a transient phase which means when the groundwater velocity is varying during the test jamin and brouyère 2018 1 2 shape of a purely advective tracer plume in 1965 bear and jacobs 1965 developed a method to predict the shape of a tracer plume injected to an aquifer when the advective transport is the only one taken into account they consider that the injected water and the one already present in the aquifer can t mix together and they are looking for an equation describing the frontier between the liquids they consider that the aquifer is plan homogeneous and isotropic in hydraulic conductivity k in m s and in effective porosity n e the injection is punctual at the origin of the plan o x y with an injection rate per unit of aquifer thickness q i in m 3 s m and the regional water flow without any injection is straight and uniform with a darcy velocity q 0 in m s parallel to the x axis and the direction of x increasing with these notations the components of the velocity vector in a point x y of the aquifer are written 1 v x q 0 n e q i x 2 π x 2 y 2 n e 2 v y q i y 2 π x 2 y 2 n e this velocity field is then integrated in order to find the shape of the plume at time t in s after the beginning of the injection with the introduced non dimensional parameters x 2 π q 0 q i x y 2 π q 0 q i y and t 2 π q 0 2 n e q i t to lighten the equation the shape of the plume is described with 3 e x cos y x y sin y e t by making y 0 in this equation it is possible to deduce the equation describing the progress of the injection front which means at an instant t the position of the furthest injected particle from the injection point located on the x axis in the direction of the regional flow 4 t x ln 1 x all these equations remain valid for a pumping phase by replacing q i by the pumping rate per unit of aquifer thickness q p and x by x the pumping front then designates the initially at the beginning of the pumping furthest particle from the pumping point that arrived at the pumping point at the instant t this method is well recognized in hydrogeology in particular for establishing capture areas u s epa 2003 lallemand barrès and roux 1989 parriaux and bussard 2003 rasmussen et al 2006 ministère de l environnement et de la lutte contre les changements climatiques 2019 it is a method particularly reliable at a large scale which is the case for protection and capture areas and the following article is about errors that its use can produce at a small scale which means in the vicinity of the well 1 3 influence of the presence of the well on a tracer test eqs 1 to 4 assume that the natural flow without any injection or pumping is perfectly straight and uniform and that the injection or pumping comes from a single point however in reality the injection is made in an observation well or in a piezometer in a well designed screen head losses are very low and negligible compared to those occurring in the rest of the aquifer the velocity field is distorted in the vicinity of the well hence the flow is not perfectly straight and uniform many studies mean to show the influence of that distortion on the interpretation of tracer tests houben and hauschild 2011 made numerical simulations to visualize the distortion of the initially straight and uniform flow field in the vicinity of the well calculations on the reynolds number were made to compute the limit for which turbulence inside the well can be neglected the filter pack around a piezometer also has a non negligible influence on breakthrough curves of a push pull test li et al 2019 a filter pack with a higher hydraulic conductivity than the rest of the aquifer drifts the tracer away from the well more rapidly than if it was not there whereas a filter pack with a lower hydraulic conductivity keeps the tracer closer to the well this can change the shape of the breakthrough curve during the pumping phase indeed if the tracer stays close to the well the concentration of tracer in the well decreases along the pumping phase whereas if it has the time to get away from the well the concentration of tracer in the well first increases and then decreases during the pumping phase resulting in a breakthrough curve with a peak as a result some methods for interpreting breakthrough curves such as the one of leap and kaplan 1988 which does not take into account the distortion of the flow field by the well and its filter pack give wrong results or cannot be applied when the breakthrough curve does not have the right shape outside of the filter pack barns et al 2015 studied the influence of thin layers of soil with a different hydraulic conductivity from the aquifer due to heterogeneity indeed they are not detectable while performing a push pull test because preferential paths are used both during the injection phase and the pumping phase however those preferential paths have a strong influence on the shape of the plume if a spill occurs for instance hebig et al 2015 studied the influence of the chasing volume after the injection of a tracer in a well it is indeed possible to inject a volume of clear water right after the injection of the tracer in order to avoid mixing phenomena inside the well which can lead to a misinterpretation of the data when hydrogeochemical parameters of the aquifer are researched other mixing phenomena can occur because of temperature gradient in the vertical profile of the aquifer corcho alvarado et al 2009 several works studied the capture time of different wells in various situations zhan 1999b developed an analytical solution for the capture time of a horizontal well located at the middle or the bottom of a confined aquifer zhan and cao 2000 completed this work by adding a regional flow and by developing semi analytical solutions when the horizontal well is located anywhere in the confined aquifer double well systems were also studied and analytical solutions for the capture time of such systems were developed zhan 1999a more recently an analytical solution for the capture time of a contaminant line by a pumping well was developed by zhan and sun 2007 and another one for a partially penetrating well in a semi infinite aquifer was developed by xia et al 2020 in all of these works the well is always considered without any radius that means that in 3d the well is approximated by a line the regional flow field is distorted by the presence of the well during injection or pumping however this has not been studied analytically yet on the one hand analytical and numerical methods that do not take into account this distortion are in some cases a reasonable approximation and on the other hand experimental studies are made to find a correction factor to the results when this approximation generates an important error while interpreting data several components of a well can disrupt the flow field in the vicinity of the well the inside of the screen the screen and the filter pack this article presents a first analytical study by considering the inside of the screen only effects generated by the slots of the screen or by the filter pack are therefore neglected table 1 summarizes the assumptions made by the method of bear and jacobs 1965 those made in this article and what is encountered in reality new equations are hereafter calculated and then tested by numerical simulations and compared to eqs 1 to 4 the purpose of this article is to show that there are some cases for which eqs 1 to 4 are a poor approximation of reality and that it is possible to reduce the error generated by using new equations which is important as analytical solutions are in most cases used as a first and quick approach to a problem guyonnet and neville 2004 2 the new analytical solution the aquifer is considered infinite in the plan x y with a thickness b in m it is homogeneous and isotropic in hydraulic conductivity k in m s and in effective porosity n e without the well the regional flow is straight and uniform parallel to the x axis and in the direction of x increasing with a darcy velocity q 0 in m s the inside of the well is a cylinder centered at the origin of the plan with a radius a in m and an infinite hydraulic conductivity a scheme representing this model is shown in fig 1 2 1 velocity field from an adaptation of the solution for heat conduction and electrical conduction the complex potential of a straight and uniform flow passing through a cylinder of infinite hydraulic conductivity is written wheatcraft and winterberg 1985 5 f 1 z q 0 z a 2 z in this equation z x iy is the complex coordinate in the plan x y the complex potential of a radial flow around a source located at the origin injecting in the aquifer at a rate per unit thickness q i in m 3 s m is written 6 f 2 z q i 2 π ln z by principle of superposition which does not violate boundary conditions at the well perimeter the complex potential of a well with infinite hydraulic conductivity injecting in an aquifer with a regional straight and uniform flow is obtained by adding f 1 and f 2 7 f z q 0 z a 2 z q i 2 π ln z the real part of this complex potential represents the velocity potential ϕ and the imaginary part represents the current function ψ the velocity field in the aquifer can be computed with the partial derivatives of either the velocity potential or the current function using the velocity potential with the formulas v x 1 n e ϕ x 1 n e re f x and v y 1 n e ϕ y 1 n e re f y with n e the effective porosity of the aquifer v x the velocity component along the x axis and v y the velocity component along the y axis the velocity field is written 8 v x x y q 0 n e 1 a 2 x 2 y 2 x 2 y 2 2 q i x 2 π n e x 2 y 2 9 v y x y 2 q 0 a 2 n e xy x 2 y 2 2 q i y 2 π n e x 2 y 2 the first interesting element to notice is that when a 0 m eqs 8 and 9 are equal to eqs 1 and 2 respectively that is logical because a radius well equal to zero means an injection coming from a single point without any injection or pumping the darcy velocity inside the screen is 2q 0 everywhere ogilvi 1958 drost et al 1968 that means that at the interface between the screen and the aquifer there is a discontinuity in the x and y components of the darcy velocity which is consistent with the principle of refraction at the interface between two media with different hydraulic conductivities fig 2 shows the discontinuity in the the x component of the darcy velocity along different lines passing by the well center there is a marked change in v x at the 45 degrees direction after the refraction between the well inside and the aquifer the ratio between v x with a well and v x without a well is higher than one for directions with an angle smaller than 45 degrees and this ratio is smaller than one for directions with an angle greater than 45 degrees the following analysis is meant to deduce cases where eqs 1 and 2 are a poor approximation of eqs 8 and 9 the new equations have a term in a 2 added compared to the former equations that means that the new equations are more likely to differ when the well radius is large one can also notice that if q i 2 πa q 0 the term relative to the injection in the well is predominant in the velocity field therefore the other term is negligible and thus former and new equations are equivalent that s why the new equations are more likely to differ from the former ones with a high ratio 2πaq 0 q i finally in the new equations the term in a 2 becomes negligible compared to the other terms when x or y tend to infinity therefore the difference between the new equations and the old ones is more important in the vicinity of the well which is where the tracer stays when performing a push pull test according to fig 2 the well influence is limited to a radial distance of about 10 times the well radius a to summarize this analysis the former equations are a poor approximation of the new ones when the radius of the well is large the regional flow velocity is high compared to the injection velocity and in the vicinity of the well in other cases the former equations can be a reasonable approximation of the new ones 2 2 progression of the injection front in time an injected particle is considered here leaving the center of the well at the beginning of the injection defined by t 0 s and it is assumed that it will move along the x axis which is consistent with the fact that eq 9 ensures v y 0 m s when y 0 the time for this particle to reach the well wall at x a is written t a without any injection the flow inside of the well is parallel to the x axis with a darcy velocity of 2q 0 wheatcraft and winterberg 1985 as the injection is supposed at a point centered at the origin eq 4 can be used inside of the well to find 10 t a n e a 2 q 0 n e q i 8 π q 0 2 ln 1 4 π q 0 q i a outside of the well the velocity of the particle is computed by having y 0 in eq 8 11 v x x y 0 q 0 n e 1 a 2 x 2 q i 2 π n e x knowing that v x dx dt this equation can be integrated between t a and t t a after a redistribution of the terms this integration gives 12 x a a x a 2 q i 2 π q 0 u u 2 q i 2 π q 0 u a 2 d u q 0 n e t t a eq 12 is the general form of the equation governing the progress of the injection front it means that for a given time t t a this equation gives the position of the intersection of the tracer plume with the x axis the integral of the rational fraction that remains to be calculated takes three different forms according to the value of the discriminant of its denominator written and whose expression is 13 δ q i 2 π q 0 2 4 a 2 according to the value there are three ways of decomposing the rational fraction to be integrated in simple elements leading to three forms for the equation of the progress of the injection front it is interesting to notice that compares the well exit velocity by considering the injection alone and the velocity inside the well without any injection a positive means that the well exit velocity due to the injection exceeds the velocity inside the well at rest and a negative means the contrary the frontier case δ 0 m 2 is the case when the stagnation point v x v y 0 m s is located at the upstream extremity of the well a 0 for a positive the stagnation point is located outside of the well and for a negative it is located inside of the well 2 2 1 first case δ 0 in that case the polynomial at the denominator of the rational fraction to be integrated admits two real roots r 1 q i 4 π q 0 q i 4 π q 0 2 a 2 and r 2 q i 4 π q 0 q i 4 π q 0 2 a 2 to lighten the writing the parameters a a 2 q i 2 π q 0 r 1 r 1 r 2 and b a 2 q i 2 π q 0 r 2 r 2 r 1 are introduced and eq 12 can be written 14 t t a n e q 0 x a a ln x r 1 a r 1 b ln x r 2 a r 2 2 2 2 second case δ 0 in that case the polynomial at the denominator of the rational fraction to be integrated admits a double real root r 0 q i 4 π q 0 the writing are lightened by introducing the dimensionless parameters x 4 π q 0 q i x a 4 π q 0 q i a and t 4 π q 0 2 n e q i t and eq 12 can be written 15 t t a x a 2 ln x 1 a 1 1 a 1 1 x 1 2 2 3 third case δ 0 in that last case the polynomial at the denominator of the rational fraction to be integrated does not admit any real root parameters p q i 2 π q 0 and r a 2 q i 4 π q 0 2 are introduced to simplify the writing in the integral of eq 12 the change of variable u p 2 rv and a redistribution of terms leads to 16 a x a 2 q i 2 π q 0 u u 2 q i 2 π q 0 u a 2 d u p 2 1 r a p 2 1 r x p 2 2 v v 2 1 d v a 2 p 2 2 r 1 r a p 2 1 r x p 2 1 v 2 1 d v eq 12 can then be written 17 t t a n e q 0 x a p 2 ln x p 2 2 1 a p 2 2 1 p 2 2 a 2 r arctan r x a r 2 x p 2 a p 2 2 3 pumping phase the pumping front at an instant t is the intersection of the plume of water that has been pumped out of the aquifer with the x axis the pumping rate per unit of aquifer thickness is written q p in m 3 s m the time necessary for the pumping front to reach the abscissa x a is written t a as well as for the injection phase the flow in the well without any pumping is parallel to the x axis with a darcy velocity of 2q 0 and t a is computed with eq 10 by replacing q i by q p and a by a bear and jacobs 1965 during the pumping phase the velocity field is the same that the one described by eqs 8 and 9 by replacing q i by q p eq 12 giving the general form of the equation of the progress of the injection front is therefore changed as follows the integration being made here between the initial position x a of the particle arriving at the center of the well at an instant t and its arrival at the extremity of the well x a 18 a x a x a 2 q p 2 π q 0 v v 2 q p 2 π q 0 v a 2 d v q 0 n e t t a eq 18 is the same than eq 12 by replacing q i by q p x by x and a by a final eqs 14 15 and 17 also apply to the pumping phase by doing those same changes 3 validation of the new equations by numerical simulations the new equations were tested by being compared to eq 4 and to the results of numerical simulations the numerical codes that are used are seep w for seepage and ctran w for particle tracking from geostudio 2007 in its last version of 2015 these are 2d models and can be used with horizontal planes or vertical planes vertical section or axisymmetric problem these codes have been used a lot in the academic world and in the industrial world for many years chapuis et al 2001 have proven than seep w gives reliable results when used correctly for example the theis solution for an ideal pumping test in an ideal confined aquifer is verified numerically at less than 0 01 in the codes the user can define and use a special element with special properties to reproduce realistically the hydraulic behavior of pipes or reservoirs which facilitates the handling of complex boundary conditions linking the hydraulic head and its partial derivatives chapuis 2009 baptiste and chapuis 2015 for unconfined aquifers the code also gives the seepage face in the well screen chenaf and chapuis 2007 the code was used to verify several new analytical solutions the new solution for steady state seepage in sloping unconfined aquifers chapuis 2002 2011b was numerically verified another new solution was for horizontal or sloping semi confined aquifers chapuis and saucier 2013 another new solution was for tracer tests in stratified aquifers with a lognormal distribution of k values chapuis 2019b each numerical verification requires a long series of steps for seepage alone chapuis 2016 and then for tracer tests chapuis 2017 allam et al 2019 have also tested the performances of ctran w and showed that the code gives reliable results for advection dispersion and particle tracking it is important to notice that when simulations are run with the same hypothesis than the ones made for developing the new equations the new analytical velocity field fits the one calculated numerically with mean error lower than 0 1 in the aquifer see figs 3 and 4 comparing the ratio v x q 0 between the new solution and the numerical simulation along lines y 0 and y x respectively in particular the darcy velocity inside the well is exactly twice the regional darcy velocity at infinity when q i 0 m 3 s m fig 3a when the well is pumped at a rate q i the numerical model gives also very small errors for the darcy s velocity in the aquifer fig 3b c this is not the verification presented in this paper hereafter is presented how the former equations and the new ones are compared to numerical simulations that reflect more realistic injection or pumping conditions by adding an small injection or pumping pipe at the center of the well 3 1 description of the numerical model the numerical model is plan saturated and the aquifer is represented by a square centered at the origin of the plan x y with sides of 60 m the inside of the well is represented by a circle centered at the origin of the plan with a radius a 0 1 m at the center of the well an injection pipe is represented by a circle with a radius of 0 01 m the former equations and the new ones do not take into account the effects of the small injection pipe at the center of the well but the addition of the injection pipe allows the comparison of the former analytical solution and the new one with a simulation that is more realistic of how injection and pumping are performed in a well this numerical model is shown in fig 5 the inside of the injection pipe is shown in purple the inside of the well in blue and the aquifer in yellow the mesh used in this numerical model is made of triangular elements and their size is reduced as the origin of the axes is approached smallest elements are therefore located inside the injection pipe the aquifer has an effective porosity of 0 33 and a hydraulic conductivity which depends on the performed simulation indeed the gradient when x tends to infinity is fixed at a value of 0 005 and the regional darcy velocity q 0 is changed by modifying the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer for the simulations presented in this article the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer varies between 2 10 7 m s and 2 10 1 m s the inside of the well has an effective porosity of 1 and a hydraulic conductivity of 100 m s the hydraulic conductivity of the well can thereby be considered infinite compared to the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer this is correctly modeled as shown in figs 3 and 4 presented previously for the case where there is no small injection pipe finally the inside of the injection pipe has an effective porosity of 1 and a hydraulic conductivity of 200 m s this value is greater than the one of the inside of the well in order for the injected particles to pass rapidly from the injection pipe into the well during the injection phase and from the border of the injection pipe to its center during the pumping phase 3 2 performed simulations numerical simulations of push pull tests are performed in three steps the first step is the calculation of the initial stage when no injection or pumping is performed in the well it is a calculation in steady state describing how the regional straight and uniform flow is distorted by the presence of the well at rest the second step is the injection phase of the push pull test the calculation is made in transient state even if the steady state is reached quickly since the studied aquifer is saturated finally the third step is the pumping phase of the push pull test occurring right after the injection phase and also calculated in transient state for the second and third phases the injection and the pumping are made in a point located at the origin of the plan thus at the center of the well and the injection pipe the duration of the injection phase is calculated with eq 4 so that according to this equation the injection front reaches x 0 5 m 5a at the end of the injection during the pumping phase to ensure that all the previously injected particles are pumped back from the aquifer in a reasonable computation time the pumping rate q p is calculated so that the end of injection front x 0 5 m corresponds to 60 of the distance between the center of the well and the pumping stagnation point v x v y 0 m s still according to eq 4 this choice leads to q p 5 3 π q 0 the duration of the pumping phase is then chosen a bit higher than the one calculated with eq 4 so that the pumping front reaches x 0 5 m thereby it is ensured that all of the injected plume is pumped back at the end of the simulation the second and third phases of the simulation also have a module for particle tracking this module uses at each time step the velocity field previously calculated by the flow module in order to consequently compute particles movement at the initial stage tracked particles are located inside the injection pipe on the circle of radius 0 008 m and at the beginning of the pumping phase they are located at their positions recorded at the end of the injection several series of simulation were performed in order to vary both q 0 and q i thereby for each value of q i simulations with different values of δ for the injection are performed allowing to test the three solutions given by eqs 14 15 and 17 these equations are indeed compared to the results of numerical simulations and to the former method eq 4 parameters used for the performed simulations are listed in table 2 4 results 4 1 relative error on pumping time for each push pull test simulation the pumping time which means the time necessary for all the injected tracer plume to be pumped back from the aquifer during the pumping phase is calculated with eq 4 for the former method and with eqs 14 to 17 for the new method these two results are then compared to the one calculated by the numerical simulation regarding the numerical simulation the pumping time t p num is defined as the time from the beginning of the pumping taken by the last particle to enter the pumping pipe from the way t i is calculated in section 3 2 the end of injection front calculated with the former method is x i old 0 5 m the pumping time according to the old method is therefore calculated with eq 4 knowing that in pumping configuration the x axis is inverted 19 t p old 2 π q 0 q p x i old ln 1 2 π q 0 q p x i old for the new method the first step is to calculate δ i q i 2 π q 0 2 4 a 2 then depending on the value of δ i eqs 14 15 or 17 is used to calculate the end of injection front x i new the same process is used to calculate the pumping time remembering that the choice of q p as explained in section 3 2 leads to δ p q p 2 π q 0 2 4 a 2 0 the pumping time t p new is therefore calculated with eq 14 replacing x by x and a by a because it is the pumping phase 20 t p new t a n e q 0 x i new a a ln x i new r 1 a r 1 b ln x i new r 2 a r 2 the relative error on the pumping time of the old method compared to the numerical simulation is written err old num and the relative error on the pumping time of the new method compared to the numerical simulation is written err new num they are calculated with the following equations 21 err old num t p num t p old t p num err new num t p num t p new t p num fig 6 presents these relative errors versus q 0 q i for the simulations of push pull tests described in table 2 squares represent relative errors concerning the old method and triangles represent relative errors concerning the new method three different colors are used to distinguish the three different values of q i that are used fig 6 shows that the new method is in general more precise than the former one it also shows that the gain in precision is bigger for high values of q 0 q i for which the relative error between the numerical simulation and the analytical solution is divided by two when using the new method compared to the former one this result is consonant with the analysis of the new equations for the velocity field made in section 2 1 one could expect that the new closed form solution would produce relative errors that are always around 1 or less when compared to the numerical simulation it is important to remind at this point that the new equations do not take into account the injection pipe located at the center of the well however the presence of this injection pipe produces some singularities in the velocity field around it figs 7 and 8 show the equal values of darcy velocity in the x direction and in the y direction respectively inside the well for steady state without any injection or pumping singularities are clearly visible around the injection pipe in the 45 and 135 degrees directions for the darcy velocity in the y direction and in the 0 45 90 and 135 degrees directions for the darcy velocity in the x direction furthermore at angles 0 45 90 135 and 180 degrees from the center of the well the software generates at the periphery of the well some flattened triangular elements in the numerical mesh and some triangular elements with angles above 90 degrees as shown in fig 9 which leads to less precise calculation in those elements even so the simulations were able to validate the new closed form solution and to prove that it is more precise than the former one when compared to a numerical simulation of realistic field conditions 4 2 applicability range of eq 15 it is important to precise that for simulations 3 12 and 18 cf table 2 eq 15 was used for the calculation of the end of injection front even though δ i 0 for the injection phase in these cases indeed after having noted an error between t p new and t p num when using eq 17 it was noticed that δ i is certainly negative but close to zero another series of simulations is therefore performed in order to establish the applicability range of eq 15 the purpose of this series is to vary δ in negative values towards zero and for each simulation to verify which of eq 15 case δ 0 and 17 case δ 0 is closer to the result of the numerical simulation for this series only the injection phase is simulated and q i is fixed at 10 5 m 3 s m it is thus q 0 that is used to vary the injection time is still calculated in order for eq 4 to predict an end of injection front x i old 0 5 m parameters used for this new series of numerical simulations are listed in table 3 for this series of simulations it is the position of the end of injection front that is used as a point of comparison the end of injection fronts calculated by numerical simulation with eq 15 and with eq 17 are written respectively x i num x i δ 0 and x i δ 0 relative errors are calculated as follows for the end of injection front of eq 15 compared to the numerical simulation and of eq 17 compared to the numerical simulation 22 err δ 0 num x i num x i δ 0 x i num err δ 0 num x i num x i δ 0 x i num these relative errors are plotted in fig 10 versus q 0 q i the intersection point between the two curves corresponds to approximately δ 3 87 10 2 m 2 it means that for 0 δ 3 87 10 2 m 2 it is eq 15 that is more precise and for δ 3 87 10 2 m 2 it is eq 17 that is to apply thereby eq 15 is not a purely hypothetical case for which has to be strictly equal to zero but a case having a value range for for which it has to be applied fig 11 shows the progress of the injection front in time according to the numerical simulation the old method eq 4 and the new method eq 17 case δ 0 for the injection phase of simulation 3 cf table 2 this simulation is one of the cases for which δ is negative but close to zero fig 12 shows the same graph but with the use of eq 15 case δ 0 for the new method it is obvious that eq 15 from the case δ 0 is more relevant and even more precise than eq 4 from the old method 4 3 visualization of the three shapes of the plume advection dispersion simulations were performed with ctran w in order to visualize the three shapes of tracer plume corresponding to the three cases defined by the value of δ in that purpose flow computations of simulations 1 6 and 21 cf table 2 are used to make the calculations of the advection dispersion module the advection dispersion module is only used for the injection phase in order to observe the shape of the plume while tracer is injected in the initial state all the numerical model has a tracer concentration of 0 g l during the injection the inside of the injection pipe has a tracer concentration fixed at c 0 1 g l the upstream frontier of the model has a tracer concentration fixed at 0 g l and the downstream frontier of the model is defined as a free exit boundary in order to perform a simulation where advection prevails over dispersion a very low dispersivity is needed in order to prevent numerical oscillations and dispersion the following criterion on peclet number is recommended geo slope international ltd 2012 23 v δ x d 2 in this equation v represents the velocity δx is the size of the corresponding mesh element and d is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient d can be written d αv d with α the dispersivity and d the effective diffusion coefficient in this study d is chosen equal to zero and the projection of the peclet criterion on each x and y axis gives 24 α x δ x 2 α y δ x 2 here α x is the longitudinal dispersivity in the direction of the flow and α y is the transverse dispersivity in the direction orthogonal to that of the flow usually α x is about ten times higher than α y fetter et al 1999 numerical instabilities are more likely to happen at the injection source because that is where concentration gradients spatial and temporal are the strongest during the injection at the center of the well the smallest mesh elements measure δx 0 001 m the condition on peclet number is therefore α x 5 10 4 m and α y 5 10 4 m to comply with these conditions while keeping the smallest dispersivity coefficients possible outside of the well values of α x 0 01 m and α y 0 001 m are chosen in the well and in the injection pipe higher values are chosen because the objective is that the well becomes a uniform source of injection quickly after the beginning of the injection that s why values of α x 1 m and α y 0 1 m are chosen for the inside of the well and the injection pipe figs 13 14 and 15 show plume shapes for simulations 1 6 and 21 after the computation of the advection dispersion module these figures show that the case δ 0 is the limit between injections for which tracer gets out of the well through the point a 0 and injections for which no tracer gets out of the well through this point in other words when δ 0 m 2 the tracer gets out of the well by every point of the frontier of the well whereas when δ 0 m 2 the tracer only gets out of the well by a downstream fraction of the frontier of the well when δ 0 m 2 there is only one point through which the tracer does not get out of the well and it is the most upstream point of the frontier of the well as it is not possible to set a null value for dispersivities in ctran w and in all codes for contaminant migration in groundwater figs 13 14 and 15 are not to be compared with the analytical solution presented in this paper the parameters were set to make the advective part the more predominant possible in the transport process but without having any numerical oscillation or numerical dispersion yet those figures are a good visual support to highlight the role of δ upon the shape of the plume 5 discussion and recommendations a new analytical method was developed for predicting the velocity field and the progress of the tracer front of a tracer plume during its injection in a aquifer with a regional straight and uniform flow this new solution takes into account the distortion of the regional flow by the presence of the well in which the push pull test is performed whereas the solution of bear and jacobs 1965 ignores this distortion and becomes imprecise the analytical study of the new equations for the velocity field shows that the difference with the former equations is significant within a radial distance of 10a fig 2 and also when the radius a of the well is large and when the ratio 2πaq 0 q i is high which means when the regional darcy velocity of the aquifer is high compared to the injection rate the equation describing the progress of the injection front takes three different forms depending on the value of the parameter δ q i 2 π q 0 2 4 a 2 a positive δ means that the injection rate is high enough for the velocity vector to be oriented towards the outside of the well in every point of its frontier on the contrary a negative δ means that there is a portion of the frontier of the well for which the velocity vectors are oriented towards the inside of the well the limit case δ 0 means that only the most upstream point of the frontier of the well does not have a velocity vector oriented towards the outside of the well in that case this point is the stagnation point its velocity vector is null numerical simulations were then performed in order to model a realistic field condition with a small injection pipe which is ignored in the old and new analytical solutions the simulations compare the performance of the former solution of bear and jacobs 1965 and the new solution for the realistic field conditions a horizontal bidimensional model was set to perform simulations of flowing particle tracking and advection dispersion results of the simulations allowed the calculation of the time needed by the tracer plume to be fully pumped back after an injection phase the simulations show that the pumping time calculated with the new equation is closer to the results of the numerically simulated realistic field conditions than the one calculated with the former solution results also show that as deduced by the study of the new equations for the velocity field the gain in precision with the new solution is all the more significant as the ratio 2πaq 0 q i is high a series of simulations also established that there is a value range of for which eq 15 developed for the case δ 0 has to be applied indeed it is not a case purely theoretical for which has to be strictly equal to zero this equation has to be used when is negative and sufficiently close to zero advection dispersion simulations confirm that depending on the value of three different shapes of the tracer plume can be observed one with tracer getting out of the well only by its front one with tracer getting out of the well by every of its points and the limit case where the only point from which tracer does not get out of the well is the most upstream point of the well the numerical simulations that were performed represent a horizontal aquifer which is perfectly homogeneous and isotropic in hydraulic conductivity and in effective porosity future studies should indicate whether the proposed equations have the capacity to correctly predict or describe the results of field experiments it is indeed possible that the real aquifer heterogeneities disturb the flow in such a manner that the precision gained by the new 2d solution is negligible compared to the margin of error generated by those 3d heterogeneities studies in laboratories with micro push pull tests as the ones performed by knecht et al 2011 2014 are another possibility to test the applicability and the relevance of the gain in precision of the new equations in real cases studies the numerical simulations also assume that the well is perfect without any influence on the hydraulic conductivity field of the aquifer in reality the construction of a well can create cracks and a redistribution of grains in the aquifer in its vicinity increasing heterogeneities naturally present in the soil or in the rock this study offers the possibility to develop further equations for other types of wells in order to increase their precision by removing the assumption of a straight and uniform flow at rest in the presence of a well indeed the construction of a well usually implies the installation of a filter pack around the casing as the filter pack has a hydraulic conductivity different from the one of the aquifer the distortion of flow lines is enhanced it is also possible to consider the impact of the screen on flow lines by modeling it by a thin layer with a different hydraulic conductivity it also might be judicious to revise methods based upon the solution of bear and jacobs 1965 starting from the new equations especially under the conditions where they are significantly more precise in order to lower the margins of error when the influence of the well on flow lines disturbs the experimental results finally the study of this problem on a vertical section is necessary to understand vertical phenomenons occurring in the propagation of the tracer a 3d model could also permit the vertical propagation of the plume declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

1437,methods for interpreting tracer tests often rely on equations assuming a natural regional flow which is straight and uniform the main purpose of this project was to develop more realistic equations for the advective part of contaminant transport by including the flow lines distortion occurring in the vicinity of the injection well the complex potential of the flow during a tracer test was calculated by superimposing the complex potential of a natural straight and uniform flow distorted by the presence of a passive well and the complex potential of a radial flow corresponding to an isotropic injection alone the equations were developed for a horizontal plan and the calculated complex potential yielded a groundwater velocity field and after that a formula connecting the position of the advancing front of the tracer plume to the injection duration these new equations were then tested with numerical simulations a two dimensional aquifer plan was modeled and set in order to numerically solve particle tracking and travel time computation of the moving front within a reasonable calculation time this model provided a comparison of times needed to fully recover the tracer plume previously injected the one calculated with the new equations and the one calculated with former equations neglecting the impact of the well presence on the groundwater flow field the results showed that the new equations are significantly more precise in particular when the injection rate is sufficiently low compared to the natural regional flow rate with a relatively large well diameter and in the vicinity of the injection well three different plume shapes could be visualized numerically and those shapes depend on the value of a parameter which compares the velocity component caused by the injection in the well and the component caused by the natural regional flow graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords tracer test push pull test well straight uniform flow analytical solution 1 introduction 1 1 tracer tests a tracer test consists in the injection in a well of a tracer and in the observation of how it spreads into the aquifer the tracer can be reactive or not according to the parameters the performer of the test wants to estimate such as among others effective porosity longitudinal and transverse dispersivities regional water rate for non reactive tracers and delay or partition coefficients for reactive tracers preparation and interpretation of tracer tests lead to very complex problems indeed many parameters have to be controlled in a tracer test geometry flow rates concentration sampling frequency injection and pumping methods among others among which the three most difficult to estimate according to field 2003 are the tracer mass to inject the time of the beginning of sampling and the sampling frequency many researchers tried to develop equations for estimating the tracer mass to inject but in general it was proven that these equations are not precise enough for tracer tests käss 1998 field 2003 tested 33 equations for estimating the tracer mass to inject and the sampling frequency which were developed before his work and has compared them to the efficient hydrologic tracer test design ehtd that he developed field 2002a 2002b only ehtd is based on transport theory the other equations having been developed empirically results showed that ehtd is the most reliable tested method this method is now used by the united states environmental protection agency for estimating the tracer mass to inject and the sampling frequency for a tracer test u s epa 2003 many parameters are involved for designing a tracer test and the work presented in this article focus on effects generated by the water column in the well into which the tracer is injected tracer tests can be separated into four main categories a test in converging flow consists in the injection of tracer in a passive well and its recovery in an active pumping well by discrete sampling it is the situation examined by guides for protection perimeters for drinkable water capture in france switzerland quebec or the usa among others u s epa 2003 lallemand barrès and roux 1989 parriaux and bussard 2003 rasmussen et al 2006 for a test in diverging flow a tracer is injected in an active well at a known rate and it is recovered in one or several passive wells by discrete sampling a dipole tracer test uses an active well injecting a tracer at a known rate and another active well recovering it pumping the same rate as the injection well and where water is sampled discretely finally it is possible to perform a tracer test in an active well alone which injects a tracer at a known rate and then recovers it by pumping after an optional drift phase the basic solution of bear and jacobs 1965 for confined aquifers detailed in next section and its equivalent for unconfined aquifers solution of grubb 1993 are reference solutions for tracer tests in converging or diverging flow u s epa 2003 lallemand barrès and roux 1989 parriaux and bussard 2003 rasmussen et al 2006 other equations were developed to complete these basic solutions under different conditions chapuis 2011a chapuis and chesnaux 2006 todd 1980 simpson et al 2003 in these analytical solutions the well is supposed to be a vertical line it does not have a radius hence no volume for tracer tests in converging or diverging flow hundreds of liters per minute are pumped for whole days the water stored inside the well of the order of dozens of liters is therefore negligible before the pumped volume the basic solution of bear and jacobs 1965 is hence a good approximation for such a test on the other hand this solution is also used for dipole tests or push pull tests which use only one well but in those cases tests can be performed with injections of the order of one liter per minute during 20 to 60 min the volume stored inside the well is no longer negligible and dilution and transport phenomena may make the solution of bear and jacobs 1965 unreliable this article focuses on these cases with push pull tracer tests which are regularly performed to quantify several processes in bioremediation projects pitterle et al 2005 reusser et al 2002 wu et al 2006 or to assess a contaminant mass flux in groundwater wang et al 2013 goltz et al 2009 chapuis 2019a the interpretation of tracer tests breakthrough curves is a relatively young topic of research and existing methods are often questioned because of phenomena that are neglected while conceiving them paradis et al 2018 have complexified the equation of hall et al 1991 which estimates the effective porosity of an aquifer from the data of a push pull test by taking into account transport during the injection phase phenomenon neglected with the former method the results of this study showed that there were cases for which this approximation lead to important mistakes wang and zhan 2019 proposed a new analytical solution for interpreting tracer tests by considering the influence of storage in the well indeed at the beginning of the test the dilution of the tracer in the water already present in the well can lead to errors in the interpretation of breakthrough curves studies were made recently to estimate the best pumping rate or the best duration for the drift phase when performing a push pull test kuo et al 2018 kim et al 2019 indeed if the pumping rate is too low the injected tracer is not fully recovered and the position of the center of mass of the plume is then miscalculated the duration of the drift phase influences the shape of the breakthrough curve which can have zero one or two peaks brouyère et al 2008 developed a tracer test which does not need neither a pumping phase nor an observation well downstream of the injection well in order to have a breakthrough curve this method is called the finite volume point dilution method and consists in the measurement of the concentration of the tracer test in the water of the injection well while the injection is performed this method has the advantage of being able to interpret data during a transient phase which means when the groundwater velocity is varying during the test jamin and brouyère 2018 1 2 shape of a purely advective tracer plume in 1965 bear and jacobs 1965 developed a method to predict the shape of a tracer plume injected to an aquifer when the advective transport is the only one taken into account they consider that the injected water and the one already present in the aquifer can t mix together and they are looking for an equation describing the frontier between the liquids they consider that the aquifer is plan homogeneous and isotropic in hydraulic conductivity k in m s and in effective porosity n e the injection is punctual at the origin of the plan o x y with an injection rate per unit of aquifer thickness q i in m 3 s m and the regional water flow without any injection is straight and uniform with a darcy velocity q 0 in m s parallel to the x axis and the direction of x increasing with these notations the components of the velocity vector in a point x y of the aquifer are written 1 v x q 0 n e q i x 2 π x 2 y 2 n e 2 v y q i y 2 π x 2 y 2 n e this velocity field is then integrated in order to find the shape of the plume at time t in s after the beginning of the injection with the introduced non dimensional parameters x 2 π q 0 q i x y 2 π q 0 q i y and t 2 π q 0 2 n e q i t to lighten the equation the shape of the plume is described with 3 e x cos y x y sin y e t by making y 0 in this equation it is possible to deduce the equation describing the progress of the injection front which means at an instant t the position of the furthest injected particle from the injection point located on the x axis in the direction of the regional flow 4 t x ln 1 x all these equations remain valid for a pumping phase by replacing q i by the pumping rate per unit of aquifer thickness q p and x by x the pumping front then designates the initially at the beginning of the pumping furthest particle from the pumping point that arrived at the pumping point at the instant t this method is well recognized in hydrogeology in particular for establishing capture areas u s epa 2003 lallemand barrès and roux 1989 parriaux and bussard 2003 rasmussen et al 2006 ministère de l environnement et de la lutte contre les changements climatiques 2019 it is a method particularly reliable at a large scale which is the case for protection and capture areas and the following article is about errors that its use can produce at a small scale which means in the vicinity of the well 1 3 influence of the presence of the well on a tracer test eqs 1 to 4 assume that the natural flow without any injection or pumping is perfectly straight and uniform and that the injection or pumping comes from a single point however in reality the injection is made in an observation well or in a piezometer in a well designed screen head losses are very low and negligible compared to those occurring in the rest of the aquifer the velocity field is distorted in the vicinity of the well hence the flow is not perfectly straight and uniform many studies mean to show the influence of that distortion on the interpretation of tracer tests houben and hauschild 2011 made numerical simulations to visualize the distortion of the initially straight and uniform flow field in the vicinity of the well calculations on the reynolds number were made to compute the limit for which turbulence inside the well can be neglected the filter pack around a piezometer also has a non negligible influence on breakthrough curves of a push pull test li et al 2019 a filter pack with a higher hydraulic conductivity than the rest of the aquifer drifts the tracer away from the well more rapidly than if it was not there whereas a filter pack with a lower hydraulic conductivity keeps the tracer closer to the well this can change the shape of the breakthrough curve during the pumping phase indeed if the tracer stays close to the well the concentration of tracer in the well decreases along the pumping phase whereas if it has the time to get away from the well the concentration of tracer in the well first increases and then decreases during the pumping phase resulting in a breakthrough curve with a peak as a result some methods for interpreting breakthrough curves such as the one of leap and kaplan 1988 which does not take into account the distortion of the flow field by the well and its filter pack give wrong results or cannot be applied when the breakthrough curve does not have the right shape outside of the filter pack barns et al 2015 studied the influence of thin layers of soil with a different hydraulic conductivity from the aquifer due to heterogeneity indeed they are not detectable while performing a push pull test because preferential paths are used both during the injection phase and the pumping phase however those preferential paths have a strong influence on the shape of the plume if a spill occurs for instance hebig et al 2015 studied the influence of the chasing volume after the injection of a tracer in a well it is indeed possible to inject a volume of clear water right after the injection of the tracer in order to avoid mixing phenomena inside the well which can lead to a misinterpretation of the data when hydrogeochemical parameters of the aquifer are researched other mixing phenomena can occur because of temperature gradient in the vertical profile of the aquifer corcho alvarado et al 2009 several works studied the capture time of different wells in various situations zhan 1999b developed an analytical solution for the capture time of a horizontal well located at the middle or the bottom of a confined aquifer zhan and cao 2000 completed this work by adding a regional flow and by developing semi analytical solutions when the horizontal well is located anywhere in the confined aquifer double well systems were also studied and analytical solutions for the capture time of such systems were developed zhan 1999a more recently an analytical solution for the capture time of a contaminant line by a pumping well was developed by zhan and sun 2007 and another one for a partially penetrating well in a semi infinite aquifer was developed by xia et al 2020 in all of these works the well is always considered without any radius that means that in 3d the well is approximated by a line the regional flow field is distorted by the presence of the well during injection or pumping however this has not been studied analytically yet on the one hand analytical and numerical methods that do not take into account this distortion are in some cases a reasonable approximation and on the other hand experimental studies are made to find a correction factor to the results when this approximation generates an important error while interpreting data several components of a well can disrupt the flow field in the vicinity of the well the inside of the screen the screen and the filter pack this article presents a first analytical study by considering the inside of the screen only effects generated by the slots of the screen or by the filter pack are therefore neglected table 1 summarizes the assumptions made by the method of bear and jacobs 1965 those made in this article and what is encountered in reality new equations are hereafter calculated and then tested by numerical simulations and compared to eqs 1 to 4 the purpose of this article is to show that there are some cases for which eqs 1 to 4 are a poor approximation of reality and that it is possible to reduce the error generated by using new equations which is important as analytical solutions are in most cases used as a first and quick approach to a problem guyonnet and neville 2004 2 the new analytical solution the aquifer is considered infinite in the plan x y with a thickness b in m it is homogeneous and isotropic in hydraulic conductivity k in m s and in effective porosity n e without the well the regional flow is straight and uniform parallel to the x axis and in the direction of x increasing with a darcy velocity q 0 in m s the inside of the well is a cylinder centered at the origin of the plan with a radius a in m and an infinite hydraulic conductivity a scheme representing this model is shown in fig 1 2 1 velocity field from an adaptation of the solution for heat conduction and electrical conduction the complex potential of a straight and uniform flow passing through a cylinder of infinite hydraulic conductivity is written wheatcraft and winterberg 1985 5 f 1 z q 0 z a 2 z in this equation z x iy is the complex coordinate in the plan x y the complex potential of a radial flow around a source located at the origin injecting in the aquifer at a rate per unit thickness q i in m 3 s m is written 6 f 2 z q i 2 π ln z by principle of superposition which does not violate boundary conditions at the well perimeter the complex potential of a well with infinite hydraulic conductivity injecting in an aquifer with a regional straight and uniform flow is obtained by adding f 1 and f 2 7 f z q 0 z a 2 z q i 2 π ln z the real part of this complex potential represents the velocity potential ϕ and the imaginary part represents the current function ψ the velocity field in the aquifer can be computed with the partial derivatives of either the velocity potential or the current function using the velocity potential with the formulas v x 1 n e ϕ x 1 n e re f x and v y 1 n e ϕ y 1 n e re f y with n e the effective porosity of the aquifer v x the velocity component along the x axis and v y the velocity component along the y axis the velocity field is written 8 v x x y q 0 n e 1 a 2 x 2 y 2 x 2 y 2 2 q i x 2 π n e x 2 y 2 9 v y x y 2 q 0 a 2 n e xy x 2 y 2 2 q i y 2 π n e x 2 y 2 the first interesting element to notice is that when a 0 m eqs 8 and 9 are equal to eqs 1 and 2 respectively that is logical because a radius well equal to zero means an injection coming from a single point without any injection or pumping the darcy velocity inside the screen is 2q 0 everywhere ogilvi 1958 drost et al 1968 that means that at the interface between the screen and the aquifer there is a discontinuity in the x and y components of the darcy velocity which is consistent with the principle of refraction at the interface between two media with different hydraulic conductivities fig 2 shows the discontinuity in the the x component of the darcy velocity along different lines passing by the well center there is a marked change in v x at the 45 degrees direction after the refraction between the well inside and the aquifer the ratio between v x with a well and v x without a well is higher than one for directions with an angle smaller than 45 degrees and this ratio is smaller than one for directions with an angle greater than 45 degrees the following analysis is meant to deduce cases where eqs 1 and 2 are a poor approximation of eqs 8 and 9 the new equations have a term in a 2 added compared to the former equations that means that the new equations are more likely to differ when the well radius is large one can also notice that if q i 2 πa q 0 the term relative to the injection in the well is predominant in the velocity field therefore the other term is negligible and thus former and new equations are equivalent that s why the new equations are more likely to differ from the former ones with a high ratio 2πaq 0 q i finally in the new equations the term in a 2 becomes negligible compared to the other terms when x or y tend to infinity therefore the difference between the new equations and the old ones is more important in the vicinity of the well which is where the tracer stays when performing a push pull test according to fig 2 the well influence is limited to a radial distance of about 10 times the well radius a to summarize this analysis the former equations are a poor approximation of the new ones when the radius of the well is large the regional flow velocity is high compared to the injection velocity and in the vicinity of the well in other cases the former equations can be a reasonable approximation of the new ones 2 2 progression of the injection front in time an injected particle is considered here leaving the center of the well at the beginning of the injection defined by t 0 s and it is assumed that it will move along the x axis which is consistent with the fact that eq 9 ensures v y 0 m s when y 0 the time for this particle to reach the well wall at x a is written t a without any injection the flow inside of the well is parallel to the x axis with a darcy velocity of 2q 0 wheatcraft and winterberg 1985 as the injection is supposed at a point centered at the origin eq 4 can be used inside of the well to find 10 t a n e a 2 q 0 n e q i 8 π q 0 2 ln 1 4 π q 0 q i a outside of the well the velocity of the particle is computed by having y 0 in eq 8 11 v x x y 0 q 0 n e 1 a 2 x 2 q i 2 π n e x knowing that v x dx dt this equation can be integrated between t a and t t a after a redistribution of the terms this integration gives 12 x a a x a 2 q i 2 π q 0 u u 2 q i 2 π q 0 u a 2 d u q 0 n e t t a eq 12 is the general form of the equation governing the progress of the injection front it means that for a given time t t a this equation gives the position of the intersection of the tracer plume with the x axis the integral of the rational fraction that remains to be calculated takes three different forms according to the value of the discriminant of its denominator written and whose expression is 13 δ q i 2 π q 0 2 4 a 2 according to the value there are three ways of decomposing the rational fraction to be integrated in simple elements leading to three forms for the equation of the progress of the injection front it is interesting to notice that compares the well exit velocity by considering the injection alone and the velocity inside the well without any injection a positive means that the well exit velocity due to the injection exceeds the velocity inside the well at rest and a negative means the contrary the frontier case δ 0 m 2 is the case when the stagnation point v x v y 0 m s is located at the upstream extremity of the well a 0 for a positive the stagnation point is located outside of the well and for a negative it is located inside of the well 2 2 1 first case δ 0 in that case the polynomial at the denominator of the rational fraction to be integrated admits two real roots r 1 q i 4 π q 0 q i 4 π q 0 2 a 2 and r 2 q i 4 π q 0 q i 4 π q 0 2 a 2 to lighten the writing the parameters a a 2 q i 2 π q 0 r 1 r 1 r 2 and b a 2 q i 2 π q 0 r 2 r 2 r 1 are introduced and eq 12 can be written 14 t t a n e q 0 x a a ln x r 1 a r 1 b ln x r 2 a r 2 2 2 2 second case δ 0 in that case the polynomial at the denominator of the rational fraction to be integrated admits a double real root r 0 q i 4 π q 0 the writing are lightened by introducing the dimensionless parameters x 4 π q 0 q i x a 4 π q 0 q i a and t 4 π q 0 2 n e q i t and eq 12 can be written 15 t t a x a 2 ln x 1 a 1 1 a 1 1 x 1 2 2 3 third case δ 0 in that last case the polynomial at the denominator of the rational fraction to be integrated does not admit any real root parameters p q i 2 π q 0 and r a 2 q i 4 π q 0 2 are introduced to simplify the writing in the integral of eq 12 the change of variable u p 2 rv and a redistribution of terms leads to 16 a x a 2 q i 2 π q 0 u u 2 q i 2 π q 0 u a 2 d u p 2 1 r a p 2 1 r x p 2 2 v v 2 1 d v a 2 p 2 2 r 1 r a p 2 1 r x p 2 1 v 2 1 d v eq 12 can then be written 17 t t a n e q 0 x a p 2 ln x p 2 2 1 a p 2 2 1 p 2 2 a 2 r arctan r x a r 2 x p 2 a p 2 2 3 pumping phase the pumping front at an instant t is the intersection of the plume of water that has been pumped out of the aquifer with the x axis the pumping rate per unit of aquifer thickness is written q p in m 3 s m the time necessary for the pumping front to reach the abscissa x a is written t a as well as for the injection phase the flow in the well without any pumping is parallel to the x axis with a darcy velocity of 2q 0 and t a is computed with eq 10 by replacing q i by q p and a by a bear and jacobs 1965 during the pumping phase the velocity field is the same that the one described by eqs 8 and 9 by replacing q i by q p eq 12 giving the general form of the equation of the progress of the injection front is therefore changed as follows the integration being made here between the initial position x a of the particle arriving at the center of the well at an instant t and its arrival at the extremity of the well x a 18 a x a x a 2 q p 2 π q 0 v v 2 q p 2 π q 0 v a 2 d v q 0 n e t t a eq 18 is the same than eq 12 by replacing q i by q p x by x and a by a final eqs 14 15 and 17 also apply to the pumping phase by doing those same changes 3 validation of the new equations by numerical simulations the new equations were tested by being compared to eq 4 and to the results of numerical simulations the numerical codes that are used are seep w for seepage and ctran w for particle tracking from geostudio 2007 in its last version of 2015 these are 2d models and can be used with horizontal planes or vertical planes vertical section or axisymmetric problem these codes have been used a lot in the academic world and in the industrial world for many years chapuis et al 2001 have proven than seep w gives reliable results when used correctly for example the theis solution for an ideal pumping test in an ideal confined aquifer is verified numerically at less than 0 01 in the codes the user can define and use a special element with special properties to reproduce realistically the hydraulic behavior of pipes or reservoirs which facilitates the handling of complex boundary conditions linking the hydraulic head and its partial derivatives chapuis 2009 baptiste and chapuis 2015 for unconfined aquifers the code also gives the seepage face in the well screen chenaf and chapuis 2007 the code was used to verify several new analytical solutions the new solution for steady state seepage in sloping unconfined aquifers chapuis 2002 2011b was numerically verified another new solution was for horizontal or sloping semi confined aquifers chapuis and saucier 2013 another new solution was for tracer tests in stratified aquifers with a lognormal distribution of k values chapuis 2019b each numerical verification requires a long series of steps for seepage alone chapuis 2016 and then for tracer tests chapuis 2017 allam et al 2019 have also tested the performances of ctran w and showed that the code gives reliable results for advection dispersion and particle tracking it is important to notice that when simulations are run with the same hypothesis than the ones made for developing the new equations the new analytical velocity field fits the one calculated numerically with mean error lower than 0 1 in the aquifer see figs 3 and 4 comparing the ratio v x q 0 between the new solution and the numerical simulation along lines y 0 and y x respectively in particular the darcy velocity inside the well is exactly twice the regional darcy velocity at infinity when q i 0 m 3 s m fig 3a when the well is pumped at a rate q i the numerical model gives also very small errors for the darcy s velocity in the aquifer fig 3b c this is not the verification presented in this paper hereafter is presented how the former equations and the new ones are compared to numerical simulations that reflect more realistic injection or pumping conditions by adding an small injection or pumping pipe at the center of the well 3 1 description of the numerical model the numerical model is plan saturated and the aquifer is represented by a square centered at the origin of the plan x y with sides of 60 m the inside of the well is represented by a circle centered at the origin of the plan with a radius a 0 1 m at the center of the well an injection pipe is represented by a circle with a radius of 0 01 m the former equations and the new ones do not take into account the effects of the small injection pipe at the center of the well but the addition of the injection pipe allows the comparison of the former analytical solution and the new one with a simulation that is more realistic of how injection and pumping are performed in a well this numerical model is shown in fig 5 the inside of the injection pipe is shown in purple the inside of the well in blue and the aquifer in yellow the mesh used in this numerical model is made of triangular elements and their size is reduced as the origin of the axes is approached smallest elements are therefore located inside the injection pipe the aquifer has an effective porosity of 0 33 and a hydraulic conductivity which depends on the performed simulation indeed the gradient when x tends to infinity is fixed at a value of 0 005 and the regional darcy velocity q 0 is changed by modifying the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer for the simulations presented in this article the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer varies between 2 10 7 m s and 2 10 1 m s the inside of the well has an effective porosity of 1 and a hydraulic conductivity of 100 m s the hydraulic conductivity of the well can thereby be considered infinite compared to the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer this is correctly modeled as shown in figs 3 and 4 presented previously for the case where there is no small injection pipe finally the inside of the injection pipe has an effective porosity of 1 and a hydraulic conductivity of 200 m s this value is greater than the one of the inside of the well in order for the injected particles to pass rapidly from the injection pipe into the well during the injection phase and from the border of the injection pipe to its center during the pumping phase 3 2 performed simulations numerical simulations of push pull tests are performed in three steps the first step is the calculation of the initial stage when no injection or pumping is performed in the well it is a calculation in steady state describing how the regional straight and uniform flow is distorted by the presence of the well at rest the second step is the injection phase of the push pull test the calculation is made in transient state even if the steady state is reached quickly since the studied aquifer is saturated finally the third step is the pumping phase of the push pull test occurring right after the injection phase and also calculated in transient state for the second and third phases the injection and the pumping are made in a point located at the origin of the plan thus at the center of the well and the injection pipe the duration of the injection phase is calculated with eq 4 so that according to this equation the injection front reaches x 0 5 m 5a at the end of the injection during the pumping phase to ensure that all the previously injected particles are pumped back from the aquifer in a reasonable computation time the pumping rate q p is calculated so that the end of injection front x 0 5 m corresponds to 60 of the distance between the center of the well and the pumping stagnation point v x v y 0 m s still according to eq 4 this choice leads to q p 5 3 π q 0 the duration of the pumping phase is then chosen a bit higher than the one calculated with eq 4 so that the pumping front reaches x 0 5 m thereby it is ensured that all of the injected plume is pumped back at the end of the simulation the second and third phases of the simulation also have a module for particle tracking this module uses at each time step the velocity field previously calculated by the flow module in order to consequently compute particles movement at the initial stage tracked particles are located inside the injection pipe on the circle of radius 0 008 m and at the beginning of the pumping phase they are located at their positions recorded at the end of the injection several series of simulation were performed in order to vary both q 0 and q i thereby for each value of q i simulations with different values of δ for the injection are performed allowing to test the three solutions given by eqs 14 15 and 17 these equations are indeed compared to the results of numerical simulations and to the former method eq 4 parameters used for the performed simulations are listed in table 2 4 results 4 1 relative error on pumping time for each push pull test simulation the pumping time which means the time necessary for all the injected tracer plume to be pumped back from the aquifer during the pumping phase is calculated with eq 4 for the former method and with eqs 14 to 17 for the new method these two results are then compared to the one calculated by the numerical simulation regarding the numerical simulation the pumping time t p num is defined as the time from the beginning of the pumping taken by the last particle to enter the pumping pipe from the way t i is calculated in section 3 2 the end of injection front calculated with the former method is x i old 0 5 m the pumping time according to the old method is therefore calculated with eq 4 knowing that in pumping configuration the x axis is inverted 19 t p old 2 π q 0 q p x i old ln 1 2 π q 0 q p x i old for the new method the first step is to calculate δ i q i 2 π q 0 2 4 a 2 then depending on the value of δ i eqs 14 15 or 17 is used to calculate the end of injection front x i new the same process is used to calculate the pumping time remembering that the choice of q p as explained in section 3 2 leads to δ p q p 2 π q 0 2 4 a 2 0 the pumping time t p new is therefore calculated with eq 14 replacing x by x and a by a because it is the pumping phase 20 t p new t a n e q 0 x i new a a ln x i new r 1 a r 1 b ln x i new r 2 a r 2 the relative error on the pumping time of the old method compared to the numerical simulation is written err old num and the relative error on the pumping time of the new method compared to the numerical simulation is written err new num they are calculated with the following equations 21 err old num t p num t p old t p num err new num t p num t p new t p num fig 6 presents these relative errors versus q 0 q i for the simulations of push pull tests described in table 2 squares represent relative errors concerning the old method and triangles represent relative errors concerning the new method three different colors are used to distinguish the three different values of q i that are used fig 6 shows that the new method is in general more precise than the former one it also shows that the gain in precision is bigger for high values of q 0 q i for which the relative error between the numerical simulation and the analytical solution is divided by two when using the new method compared to the former one this result is consonant with the analysis of the new equations for the velocity field made in section 2 1 one could expect that the new closed form solution would produce relative errors that are always around 1 or less when compared to the numerical simulation it is important to remind at this point that the new equations do not take into account the injection pipe located at the center of the well however the presence of this injection pipe produces some singularities in the velocity field around it figs 7 and 8 show the equal values of darcy velocity in the x direction and in the y direction respectively inside the well for steady state without any injection or pumping singularities are clearly visible around the injection pipe in the 45 and 135 degrees directions for the darcy velocity in the y direction and in the 0 45 90 and 135 degrees directions for the darcy velocity in the x direction furthermore at angles 0 45 90 135 and 180 degrees from the center of the well the software generates at the periphery of the well some flattened triangular elements in the numerical mesh and some triangular elements with angles above 90 degrees as shown in fig 9 which leads to less precise calculation in those elements even so the simulations were able to validate the new closed form solution and to prove that it is more precise than the former one when compared to a numerical simulation of realistic field conditions 4 2 applicability range of eq 15 it is important to precise that for simulations 3 12 and 18 cf table 2 eq 15 was used for the calculation of the end of injection front even though δ i 0 for the injection phase in these cases indeed after having noted an error between t p new and t p num when using eq 17 it was noticed that δ i is certainly negative but close to zero another series of simulations is therefore performed in order to establish the applicability range of eq 15 the purpose of this series is to vary δ in negative values towards zero and for each simulation to verify which of eq 15 case δ 0 and 17 case δ 0 is closer to the result of the numerical simulation for this series only the injection phase is simulated and q i is fixed at 10 5 m 3 s m it is thus q 0 that is used to vary the injection time is still calculated in order for eq 4 to predict an end of injection front x i old 0 5 m parameters used for this new series of numerical simulations are listed in table 3 for this series of simulations it is the position of the end of injection front that is used as a point of comparison the end of injection fronts calculated by numerical simulation with eq 15 and with eq 17 are written respectively x i num x i δ 0 and x i δ 0 relative errors are calculated as follows for the end of injection front of eq 15 compared to the numerical simulation and of eq 17 compared to the numerical simulation 22 err δ 0 num x i num x i δ 0 x i num err δ 0 num x i num x i δ 0 x i num these relative errors are plotted in fig 10 versus q 0 q i the intersection point between the two curves corresponds to approximately δ 3 87 10 2 m 2 it means that for 0 δ 3 87 10 2 m 2 it is eq 15 that is more precise and for δ 3 87 10 2 m 2 it is eq 17 that is to apply thereby eq 15 is not a purely hypothetical case for which has to be strictly equal to zero but a case having a value range for for which it has to be applied fig 11 shows the progress of the injection front in time according to the numerical simulation the old method eq 4 and the new method eq 17 case δ 0 for the injection phase of simulation 3 cf table 2 this simulation is one of the cases for which δ is negative but close to zero fig 12 shows the same graph but with the use of eq 15 case δ 0 for the new method it is obvious that eq 15 from the case δ 0 is more relevant and even more precise than eq 4 from the old method 4 3 visualization of the three shapes of the plume advection dispersion simulations were performed with ctran w in order to visualize the three shapes of tracer plume corresponding to the three cases defined by the value of δ in that purpose flow computations of simulations 1 6 and 21 cf table 2 are used to make the calculations of the advection dispersion module the advection dispersion module is only used for the injection phase in order to observe the shape of the plume while tracer is injected in the initial state all the numerical model has a tracer concentration of 0 g l during the injection the inside of the injection pipe has a tracer concentration fixed at c 0 1 g l the upstream frontier of the model has a tracer concentration fixed at 0 g l and the downstream frontier of the model is defined as a free exit boundary in order to perform a simulation where advection prevails over dispersion a very low dispersivity is needed in order to prevent numerical oscillations and dispersion the following criterion on peclet number is recommended geo slope international ltd 2012 23 v δ x d 2 in this equation v represents the velocity δx is the size of the corresponding mesh element and d is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient d can be written d αv d with α the dispersivity and d the effective diffusion coefficient in this study d is chosen equal to zero and the projection of the peclet criterion on each x and y axis gives 24 α x δ x 2 α y δ x 2 here α x is the longitudinal dispersivity in the direction of the flow and α y is the transverse dispersivity in the direction orthogonal to that of the flow usually α x is about ten times higher than α y fetter et al 1999 numerical instabilities are more likely to happen at the injection source because that is where concentration gradients spatial and temporal are the strongest during the injection at the center of the well the smallest mesh elements measure δx 0 001 m the condition on peclet number is therefore α x 5 10 4 m and α y 5 10 4 m to comply with these conditions while keeping the smallest dispersivity coefficients possible outside of the well values of α x 0 01 m and α y 0 001 m are chosen in the well and in the injection pipe higher values are chosen because the objective is that the well becomes a uniform source of injection quickly after the beginning of the injection that s why values of α x 1 m and α y 0 1 m are chosen for the inside of the well and the injection pipe figs 13 14 and 15 show plume shapes for simulations 1 6 and 21 after the computation of the advection dispersion module these figures show that the case δ 0 is the limit between injections for which tracer gets out of the well through the point a 0 and injections for which no tracer gets out of the well through this point in other words when δ 0 m 2 the tracer gets out of the well by every point of the frontier of the well whereas when δ 0 m 2 the tracer only gets out of the well by a downstream fraction of the frontier of the well when δ 0 m 2 there is only one point through which the tracer does not get out of the well and it is the most upstream point of the frontier of the well as it is not possible to set a null value for dispersivities in ctran w and in all codes for contaminant migration in groundwater figs 13 14 and 15 are not to be compared with the analytical solution presented in this paper the parameters were set to make the advective part the more predominant possible in the transport process but without having any numerical oscillation or numerical dispersion yet those figures are a good visual support to highlight the role of δ upon the shape of the plume 5 discussion and recommendations a new analytical method was developed for predicting the velocity field and the progress of the tracer front of a tracer plume during its injection in a aquifer with a regional straight and uniform flow this new solution takes into account the distortion of the regional flow by the presence of the well in which the push pull test is performed whereas the solution of bear and jacobs 1965 ignores this distortion and becomes imprecise the analytical study of the new equations for the velocity field shows that the difference with the former equations is significant within a radial distance of 10a fig 2 and also when the radius a of the well is large and when the ratio 2πaq 0 q i is high which means when the regional darcy velocity of the aquifer is high compared to the injection rate the equation describing the progress of the injection front takes three different forms depending on the value of the parameter δ q i 2 π q 0 2 4 a 2 a positive δ means that the injection rate is high enough for the velocity vector to be oriented towards the outside of the well in every point of its frontier on the contrary a negative δ means that there is a portion of the frontier of the well for which the velocity vectors are oriented towards the inside of the well the limit case δ 0 means that only the most upstream point of the frontier of the well does not have a velocity vector oriented towards the outside of the well in that case this point is the stagnation point its velocity vector is null numerical simulations were then performed in order to model a realistic field condition with a small injection pipe which is ignored in the old and new analytical solutions the simulations compare the performance of the former solution of bear and jacobs 1965 and the new solution for the realistic field conditions a horizontal bidimensional model was set to perform simulations of flowing particle tracking and advection dispersion results of the simulations allowed the calculation of the time needed by the tracer plume to be fully pumped back after an injection phase the simulations show that the pumping time calculated with the new equation is closer to the results of the numerically simulated realistic field conditions than the one calculated with the former solution results also show that as deduced by the study of the new equations for the velocity field the gain in precision with the new solution is all the more significant as the ratio 2πaq 0 q i is high a series of simulations also established that there is a value range of for which eq 15 developed for the case δ 0 has to be applied indeed it is not a case purely theoretical for which has to be strictly equal to zero this equation has to be used when is negative and sufficiently close to zero advection dispersion simulations confirm that depending on the value of three different shapes of the tracer plume can be observed one with tracer getting out of the well only by its front one with tracer getting out of the well by every of its points and the limit case where the only point from which tracer does not get out of the well is the most upstream point of the well the numerical simulations that were performed represent a horizontal aquifer which is perfectly homogeneous and isotropic in hydraulic conductivity and in effective porosity future studies should indicate whether the proposed equations have the capacity to correctly predict or describe the results of field experiments it is indeed possible that the real aquifer heterogeneities disturb the flow in such a manner that the precision gained by the new 2d solution is negligible compared to the margin of error generated by those 3d heterogeneities studies in laboratories with micro push pull tests as the ones performed by knecht et al 2011 2014 are another possibility to test the applicability and the relevance of the gain in precision of the new equations in real cases studies the numerical simulations also assume that the well is perfect without any influence on the hydraulic conductivity field of the aquifer in reality the construction of a well can create cracks and a redistribution of grains in the aquifer in its vicinity increasing heterogeneities naturally present in the soil or in the rock this study offers the possibility to develop further equations for other types of wells in order to increase their precision by removing the assumption of a straight and uniform flow at rest in the presence of a well indeed the construction of a well usually implies the installation of a filter pack around the casing as the filter pack has a hydraulic conductivity different from the one of the aquifer the distortion of flow lines is enhanced it is also possible to consider the impact of the screen on flow lines by modeling it by a thin layer with a different hydraulic conductivity it also might be judicious to revise methods based upon the solution of bear and jacobs 1965 starting from the new equations especially under the conditions where they are significantly more precise in order to lower the margins of error when the influence of the well on flow lines disturbs the experimental results finally the study of this problem on a vertical section is necessary to understand vertical phenomenons occurring in the propagation of the tracer a 3d model could also permit the vertical propagation of the plume declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

1438,contaminated runoff stormwater from urban environments carries several contaminants to water bodies thereby affecting the health of living beings and ecological systems among all the contaminants heavy metals possess high toxicity and impact water quality the stormwater management through green infrastructures composed by adequate materials can provide an excellent solution simultaneously ensuring the appropriate hydraulic performance and contaminant removal rate the proposed research aims at the elimination of heavy metals i e ni cu zn cd and pb through column experiments by selecting four possible and novel treatments for urban stormwaters two lightweight aggregates arlita and filtralite were tested separately and in combination with caco3 the study determines the efficiency and lifetime of each treatment by varying the interaction time between the filter materials and contaminated water and the type of filter the observed removal mechanisms were closely related to the changes in ph due to the interactions between water and different materials the reductions in heavy metal concentrations depend on the type of heavy metal interaction time and type of filter material results indicate that the combined use of caco3 arlita and filtralite did not improve the removal rates of heavy metals however it decreased the efficiency of the decontamination process the significance of this study lies on the removal efficiency of arlita and filtralite as decontamination treatments both the tested lightweight aggregates led to a considerable decrease in the heavy metal concentrations in urban runoff stormwater although filtralite was particularly efficient after 4 weeks the treatments were still successfully reducing and stabilising 99 of the heavy metals in the contaminated stormwater these results confirm that the lifetime of the tested lightweight aggregates is adequate and emphasise as a novel application of these materials on their feasibility for the improvement of urban stormwater quality keywords arlita filtralite calcite column experiments water quality environmental pollution 1 introduction runoff is one of the main components of the water cycle in particular surface runoff is extremely important in urban areas because their characteristic impervious features contribute to an increase in the water runoff volumes and negatively affect

urban runoff stormwater using two lwas particularly classified as light expanded clay aggregate leca which include commercial trademarks such as arlita or filtralite these materials possess excellent hydraulic properties mlih et al 2020 thereby suggesting their suitability for filtration in real suds the contaminants to be studied i e ni cu zn cd and pb were selected based on the official european and spanish ranges of soil contaminants rd 1310 1990 1990 rd 865 2010 2010 rd 506 2013 2013and ue 2015 2099 2015 several column experiments were conducted under a wide range of flow conditions to evaluate the performance of the lwas under conditions similar to those of real exploitation in this study we paid special attention to the removal capacity and the potential of the lwas in removing specific contaminants and the stability of the decontamination process the employment of lwas to address the previous topics is not an extended practice consequently the novelty of this research aims at demonstrating the removal efficiency of the employed materials to decontaminate runoff stormwater we analysed the removal mechanisms in detail and evaluated the effects of ph changes derived from the interaction between the lwas and contaminated waters finally we added natural basic solids i e calcite aggregates and considered their effects on heavy metals removal 2 methods 2 1 filter materials two different expanded lightweight clay aggregates were selected to be employed as filter materials arlita leca xs a crushed aggregate with particle size of 1 3 mm and filtralite p with particle size of 0 5 4 mm manufacturing of these materials consists of burning clays at high temperatures 1150 c causing a melting process in which the clay becomes expanded arlita and filtralite have similar mineralogical compositions they include quartz plagioclase k feldspar and in a minor proportion olivine and hematite calcite is scarce and found only in filtralite table 1 shows the chemical composition of arlita and filtralite both aggregates present high intraparticle porosity 53 and 62 for arlita and filtralite respectively moreover the specific surface areas ssa of arlita and filtralite are 0 44 m2 g and 1 60 m2 g respectively these values are similar to those of other clay lwas albuquerque and labrincha 2008 and correspond to those of macroporous materials the interparticle porosities are high 50 and 43 for arlita and filtralite respectively and the characteristic particle sizes translate into exceptional hydraulic properties hydraulic conductivity 1 94 cm s and 1 15 cm s for arlita and filtralite respectively compared to those of other adsorbents limestone particles 99 caco3 with particle size 12 mm and bulk density 2700 kg m3 were also employed to manufacture different filters caco3 in the form of calcite is one of the most abundant natural bases and was tested to evaluate the neutralising strength of the lwas 2 2 aqueous solutions containing heavy metals column experiments were conducted by employing synthetic contaminated water with five heavy metals ni cu zn cd and pb the studied solutions contained simultaneously the five selected heavy metals ni 100 ppm zn 50 ppm pb 10 ppm cu 5 ppm and cd 30 ppm aqueous solutions were prepared using commercial chemical compounds znso4 cuso4 panreac applichem itw reagents pbcl2 emd millipore corporation nicl2 sigma aldrich and cdso4 alfa aesar the ph of the target solutions was measured with a crison 25 ph metre 0 01 accuracy following the une iso10390 2012 2012 standard the concentration of heavy metals in the aqueous solutions was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms using a thermo elemental vg pq excell device table 2 shows the range of concentrations of the different studied elements in real stormwater and the comparison with the initial concentrations in the present study concentrations of the heavy metals in the synthetic stormwater are higher than of a typical stormwater reddy 2013 reddy and kumar 2017 reddy et al 2014b wang et al 2017b wang et al 2019 the objective of the study was to evaluate the ability of the two lightweight aggregates to reduce the employed concentrations table 2 we assume the hypothesis that the removal rates obtained for those high concentrations would keep constant or higher when the initial concentration of heavy metals in the stormwater becomes lower aiming to compare the results obtained in the experiments with the permissible limits established by the spanish regulations table 2 also includes the average value of the allowable limits for direct water discharge to the environment 2 3 column experiments different column experiments were designed to evaluate the removal efficiency of arlita and filtralite fig 1 i static mode experiments were conducted to determine the long time interactions between the lwas and the contaminants the maximum amount of contaminant removed by the adsorbents was quantified and long periods of water accumulation in the collection systems were simulated although this is not a common situation in the collection systems these experiments were developed to obtain reference levels of variation in the concentration of contaminants ii dynamic mode experiments were conducted to evaluate the removal efficiency under stormwater flow conditions the short time interactions between the lwas and the contaminants were characterised and the removal activity of the lwas during a storm event were reproduced consequently these experiments reproduce the employment of arlita and filtralite as filter materials located in suds which may operate in storm events iii experiments using contaminated particles were conducted to evaluate the stability of the contamination removal process and quantify the concentration of heavy metals after washing the release of contaminants from the lwas in the presence of clean runoff stormwater was determined these were previously contaminated in static mode conditions after long time interactions between lwas and the contaminants results from this type of experiment establish if arlita and filtralite would release contaminants to water after removing heavy metal concentration in the first flush stormwater iv long term column experiments were conducted to estimate the lifetime of the lwas the removal efficiency of the materials through time was evaluated by performing continuous repetitions of the same procedure and mimicking successive storm events this type of experiments demonstrates that arlita and filtralite would decontaminate water after multiple uses of the material 2 3 1 column experiments static mode the first group of experiments was performed using columns with height of 45 cm and diameter of 9 cm filled with 1000 g of arlita or filtralite for each material three stages were developed 1 the columns were filled with synthetic water 2 the experiment was identically reproduced but using deionized water and 3 synthetic contaminated water with the same initial characteristics was used again each experiment lasted 16 days and the water was drained at the end of this period moreover each treatment required 1 2 l equivalent to 188 6 mm of water three replications of the same experiment were conducted for each material and stage the above stages were established to study the reversibility of the filtering materials in addition in the intermediate stage stage 2 the contaminated particles were washed without extracting them from the column in this case the particles were not dried aiming to test the stability of the removal between two consecutive rainfall events occurred within a short time interval overall the experiments evaluated the removal efficiency of the particles using water samples collected at fixed time intervals the sampling was daily at the beginning of the experiment but its frequency decreased towards the end between sample collections the synthetic runoff stormwater remained static in the column the heavy metals concentration in the aqueous solutions extracted from the columns was determined by icp ms additionally the ph value was measured before the icp ms analysis once the three stages of the column experiments were completed oven dried at 40 c solid samples of arlita and filtralite were analysed by icp ms after acid digestion mslabs canada and by using a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem zeiss merlin vp compact device to determine the heavy metals concentration in the solid particles 2 3 2 column experiments dynamic mode similar tests were developed in smaller columns height 25 cm diameter 5 cm performing three parallel replications for each material lwas 60 g and limestone particles 250 g were used to fill the different columns synthetic runoff stormwater 100 ml was employed to fill the column duration of each test was 10 min and through this interval water samples were collected at 0 1 2 3 5 5 7 and 10 min the tests consisted of two consecutive repetitions characterised by the use of synthetic contaminated water and of one final washing stage in which the same volume of deionized water was used in place of the contaminated water the heavy metals concentration of the water samples was determined by icp ms and the ph was measured before the icp ms analysis 2 3 3 column experiments with contaminated particles contaminated particles of arlita and filtralite 30 g obtained from the static mode test were introduced in columns with height 25 cm and diameter 5 cm three parallel repetitions were conducted using the columns containing contaminated arlita and filtralite these were filled with deionized water 36 ml to wash the materials the experiments lasted 90 min and water samples were collected with varying frequency every minute at the beginning of the experiment overall these experiments aimed to simulate the occurrence of rainfall after a long dry period the contaminated particles were oven dried before use deionized water remained in the column between the collection of samples the ph of the aqueous samples was measured before their icp ms analysis 2 3 4 column experiments lifetime testing once the removal efficiency of the tested materials was determined a last series of column experiments were conducted to evaluate the lifetime of the selected materials columns with height 34 cm and diameter 5 cm were employed for these experiments which included four different treatments treatment 1 containing 260 g of arlita treatment 2 containing 260 g of filtralite treatment 3 containing 130 g of arlita and 400 g of caco3 and treatment 4 containing 130 g of filtralite and 400 g of caco3 three replications were performed for each treatment the experiments lasted 4 weeks daily measurements were conducted for 22 days week 1 5 days week 2 5 days week 3 6 days and week 4 6 days each day 160 ml 82 mm of contaminated solution were poured in the columns and collected after letting them flow through the filter materials over a time interval of 30 s afterwards the columns were left under room air conditions until the next repetition which took place the following day the aqueous contaminated samples were tested before and after icp ms analysis and the ph was measured before analysing their chemical composition 3 results and discussion 3 1 column experiments static mode the column experiments developed in static mode demonstrated substantial changes in the concentration of contaminated particles in the solutions fig 2 shows the average values of the three replications obtained from the two repetitions in which synthetic contaminated water was used stages 1 and 3 between each repetition fig 2a f and g l respectively deionized water was employed to clean the filter materials stage 2 increases of the ph solution occurred simultaneously to decreases of the heavy metal concentration at the initial heavy metal concentration the synthetic solution had ph 4 this value is lower than stormwater ph which ranges from 6 to 7 sounthararajah et al 2017 after the second repetition in the case of both materials the ph values were higher than the initial values this was due to the residual water from the cleaning stage which remained in contact with the lwas a relatively fast rise in ph occurred after the interaction between the liquid solution and the solid particles of the filter materials after 24 h from the start of the experiment the ph more than doubled compared to its initial value except in the first repetition when using arlita fig 2c this fast increase in ph over 24 h paralleled a 60 reduction in all heavy metal contaminants the reduction in ni 66 9 and cd 77 2 observed in the first repetition after 24 h when using arlita figs 2a c was the lowest accomplished in all other cases the contaminants were reduced by 95 9 according to our results the final concentrations of ni cu zn cd and pb were 4 1 2 1 0 4 0 2 and 1 2 ppm respectively final concentrations would exceed the spanish permissible limits for direct water discharge into the environment for ni cu cd and pb table 2 the results of the second repetition and of both repetitions when arlita and filtralite were used respectively demonstrated that a time interval of 24 h was sufficient to achieve a ph 9 and consequently to reduce the initial concentration of heavy metals by 99 fig 2d l during the intermediate stage between the two repetitions the materials were washed using deionized water to study the reversibility of the lwas and quantify the heavy metals concentration in the washing flow the washing process took place in the columns after finishing the experiment with the contaminated water and without extracting the contaminated material almost no ni cu zn cd and pb were found in the collected washing water when one of the lwas was used the highest concentration 0 06 ppm was measured for ni when filtralite was used 3 2 column experiments dynamic mode the column tests developed in dynamic mode with a continuous flow fig 3 revealed that the materials behaved similarly to when they were tested in the static mode although the ph values were different due to the interaction time between the lwas and water in the static mode the ph stabilised to 10 in both cases after 5 days whereas in the continuous flow experiments the ph reached 7 after 10 min these results indicate that the lwas provided a fast response and had a considerable neutralising strength after the first measurement after 1 min the ph reached a nearly constant value the concentration of all the heavy metals contaminants in the released water decreased as the ph increased due to the interaction of the synthetic solution with the lwa particles fig 3 similar ph values were measured when using these materials nevertheless the use of filtralite was associated to the highest ph values and to the major reductions in the contaminants concentrations at the end of the experiments 10 min the average concentration of all the contaminants had decreased on average by 74 using the different filter materials i e arlita filtralite and caco3 fig 3a b c f g h k l m final concentration for cu was lower than 0 2 ppm in the experiments developed with arlita filtralite and caco3 in these experiments only cu final concentration accomplishes the permissible limit for discharge into the environment established by the spanish normative table 2 when the contaminated particles were washed with deionized water residual values 0 8 ppm were obtained from the arlita fig 3d and filtralite fig 3i experiments these values decreased with the increase of ph which reached 10 in the case of filtralite meanwhile minimal ph variations were observed in the caco3 experiment indicating unremarkable variations in the contaminants concentration at least in the washing phase fig 3n 3 3 column experiments with contaminated particles contaminated material from the column experiments developed in static mode was oven dried and employed to simulate the washing process the data shown in fig 4 confirmed the absence of heavy metals in the washing flow these experiments developed using arlita and filtralite fig 4a also demonstrated that the particle washing process did not contaminate the water flux once the metals were trapped by the filter the maximum concentration was measured for zn when using arlita 0 18 ppm this value would be within the limits of the permissible discharge limits stablished by spanish water regulations table 2 in the case of both materials all the contaminants showed the same trends their concentrations decreased over time since the interaction of the lwas with the solid particles increased the ph up to a final value 9 of the washing solution fig 4b c after 90 min from the start of the experiment the contaminants concentration in the washing water was 0 ppm nevertheless the concentration of zn was slightly higher than those of the other contaminants for both the arlita and filtralite experiments in the case where filtralite was used the last sample was collected 4 days after the beginning of the experiment the contaminants concentration in this sample were similar to those obtained from a sample collected 90 min after the beginning of the experiment the ph increased from 9 35 after 90 min to 9 72 after 4 days whereas the concentrations of ni cu zn and cd decreased from 0 003 to 0 001 ppm from 0 017 to 0 004 ppm from 0 019 to 0 001 ppm and from 0 002 to 0 001 ppm respectively these concentration values remained relatively stable for pb the maximum observed change amounted to 0 004 ppm fig 4 the absence of contaminants in the water samples after the washing process confirms that the decontamination of the studied materials was permanent and stable this was due to the ph changes related to the use of the filter materials 3 4 column experiments lifetime testing the results obtained from the lifetime testing experiment fig 5 confirmed that both materials had a long lifetime after 22 repetitions grouped in four ensembles representing 22 rainfall episodes and that involved the application of 1782 mm of water in total the maximum decrease in removal rate was identified for cd 34 6 in treatment 4 results demonstrated a higher removal efficiency for filtralite 91 6 99 6 97 5 90 8 and 99 5 for ni cu zn cd and pb respectively fig 4b compared to arlita 27 4 91 3 41 8 27 8 and 97 3 for ni cu zn cd and pb respectively fig 4a and a reduction of the heavy metal removal when caco3 was employed combined with the filter materials fig 5c d removal efficiencies for treatment 3 arlita with caco3 were 19 5 68 2 25 4 17 6 and 88 5 for ni cu zn cd and pb respectively while for treatment 4 filtralite with caco3 these values increased up to 88 2 99 6 96 0 79 6 and 99 2 for ni cu zn cd and pb respectively this last observation was confirmed by the results of the column experiments in dynamic mode and might be explained by a higher interparticle porosity and hence a lower interaction between the caco3 particles and the contaminated solution therefore the ph values and the removal rate in this case were lower compared to when the columns were filled exclusively with arlita and filtralite the removal performance was dependent on the ph after a high number of repetitions the ph decreased by 2 5 in the case of treatment 4 causing a decrease of the treatment efficiency the removal rate in the presence of arlita did not vary significantly during the experiments fig 5a c moreover the removal rates of cu and pb were significantly higher than those for ni zn and cd filtralite removed ni cu zn cd and pb properly although the best results were obtained for cu zn and pb fig 5b d in the case of filtralite treatment 2 final concentration of ni cu zn cd and pb in week 4 were 8 4 ppm 0 ppm 1 3 ppm 2 8 ppm and 0 ppm respectively consequently final concentrations for heavy metals after treatment 2 would be within spanish permissible limits for cu and pb considering direct water discharge into the environment table 2 spanish regulations do not specifically consider permissible limits for heavy metals in the case of direct discharge to soil e g as in infiltration trenches or ponds but include them within the permissible limits of direct discharge into the environment the lower removal efficiencies were achieved for ni and cd reddy et al 2014b performed similar experiments using the same contaminants but different materials calcite and zeolites which were not previously contaminated they concluded that maximum removal efficiencies were also accomplished for cu zn and pb 3 5 mechanisms of heavy metal removal the experiments described in the previous sections confirmed the efficiency of the studied materials in reducing the concentration of heavy metals in urban stormwater when considering a target rainfall of 82 mm distributed over 22 events the different tests suggested that a brief time 0 5 1 min of interaction between the filter particles and the contaminated stormwater was sufficient to ensure a significant reduction of the heavy metals concentration in runoff water figs 3 5 however the results varied in relation to the type of heavy metal the filter characteristics and the selected filter materials arlita or filtralite notably after some days of interaction between the particles and the contaminated stormwater the concentration of contaminants continued to be reduced considerably up to 95 9 fig 2 the best reduction in the heavy metal concentration was achieved by using the larger columns figs 2 5 due to the larger surface of interaction between the water and the particles in all the cases analysed the reduction in heavy metals concentration occurred simultaneously with an increase in ph figs 2 5 the element distribution map of the filter material obtained from the column experiments developed in static mode and analysed under fesem demonstrates the precipitation and co precipitation of all the heavy metals on the particles surface fig 6 the icp ms analysis of the lwas confirmed the presence of precipitated heavy metals on the surface of the studied particles table 3 supporting the results shown in fig 6 the heavy metal composition of the lwas confirmed that solid particles eliminated most of the heavy metals present in the contaminated solutions overall the results indicate that an increase in ph led to the precipitation of the contaminants on the surfaces of the arlita and filtralite particles although the heavy metals were detected on the original particles of arlita and filtralite table 3 a batch experiment employing particles and deionized water revealed that the cations were not labile but contained in the mineral structure therefore the concentration of the studied heavy metals in the deionized water after the experiment was equal to 0 the removal of heavy metals occurred by chemical precipitation as the ph increased faisal et al 2020 due to the precipitation and co precipitation of the insoluble phases i e carbonates oxides and hydroxides under basic conditions langmuir 1997 moreover the irregular surfaces of the arlita and filtralite particles contributed to the accumulation and retention of contaminants in the aggregates the precipitates occurred in a non equilibrium state and in amorphous forms because of their fast crystallisation fig 6 shows a substantial precipitation of heavy metals on the particles surface the increment in heavy metals concentration from the original to the contaminated particles corresponds exactly to the amount of heavy metals precipitated on the surface of the evaluated particles the heavy metals removal by the lwas might be also attributed to ion exchange reactions collison and grismer 2014 kasai et al 2019 nakarai et al 2019 naushad et al 2015b petrella et al 2017 zhu et al 1997 considering the mineralogical composition and the ssa of the studied lwas these materials might have undergone ion exchange reactions overall the contamination elimination might have been resulted from the combination of two effects i e chemical precipiation and ion exchange reactions in the particular case of arlita and filtralite however the chemical precipitation of solid phases should have been the major process determining the reduction of heavy metals as mentioned previously the washing flow derived from the washing experiments with contaminated material showed a scarce concentration of heavy metals fig 4 these results suggest that the employment of the proposed material in real urban systems would be advantageous and avoid the further migration of contaminants from the used filter material to non contaminated water this matter constitutes one of the advantages that the employment of lwas would provide to the runoff stormwater treatment although there are some limitations in the proposed treatments such as the necessity of developing experiments with higher water volumes and different initial conditions in the concentration of the different contaminants the improvement of urban stormwater quality has been clearly demonstrated the low concentration of contaminants in the washing flow might be explained by the sorbent cations on the surfaces of the lwas whose relative mobility might have allowed the occurrence of ion exchange reactions overall these results confirm that most of the contaminants were removed by chemical precipitation and that they remained stable in the aqueous solution under the tested alkaline conditions nevertheless the concentrations used in the present study are higher than the expected in real stormwater and further analysis should be addressed to study if the initial concentrations could affect the removal rates obtained in this study 4 conclusions the management of runoff stormwater in urban areas must consider the treatment of water quality emerging solutions contemplate the use of green infrastructures to address both flooding problems and pollution removal this study demonstrated the excellent hydraulic properties and performance in reducing the contamination of urban stormwater of arlita and filtralite even considering that in some of the experiments the studied materials cannot assure the reaching of the discharge limits from our results we can conclude that in dynamic experiments a brief time of interaction between the particles of arlita or filtralite and the aqueous solutions was sufficient to reduce the concentration of heavy metals by up to 74 using the different filter materials i e arlita filtralite and caco3 in addition arlita and filtralite presented a long lifetime and ensured a stable decontamination of the aqueous solutions over time filtralite demonstrated a higher removal efficiency 95 8 on average compared to arlita 57 1 on average which was associated to a highest ph increase caco3 additions combined with the use of lwas did not lead to an improvement of the heavy metals removal rates but rather hindered the decontamination process average removal rates of 92 5 and 43 85 for caco3 combined with filtralite and arlita the washing experiment of contaminated particles demonstrated the irreversibility of the decontamination process with maximum observed concentration of 0 18 ppm for zn with both lwas the specific design of the different experiments affected the removal rate highest removal efficiency is achieved with the static mode experiments due to longer interaction time between the contaminated water and the filter material declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this work was funded by the university of alicante project

1438,contaminated runoff stormwater from urban environments carries several contaminants to water bodies thereby affecting the health of living beings and ecological systems among all the contaminants heavy metals possess high toxicity and impact water quality the stormwater management through green infrastructures composed by adequate materials can provide an excellent solution simultaneously ensuring the appropriate hydraulic performance and contaminant removal rate the proposed research aims at the elimination of heavy metals i e ni cu zn cd and pb through column experiments by selecting four possible and novel treatments for urban stormwaters two lightweight aggregates arlita and filtralite were tested separately and in combination with caco3 the study determines the efficiency and lifetime of each treatment by varying the interaction time between the filter materials and contaminated water and the type of filter the observed removal mechanisms were closely related to the changes in ph due to the interactions between water and different materials the reductions in heavy metal concentrations depend on the type of heavy metal interaction time and type of filter material results indicate that the combined use of caco3 arlita and filtralite did not improve the removal rates of heavy metals however it decreased the efficiency of the decontamination process the significance of this study lies on the removal efficiency of arlita and filtralite as decontamination treatments both the tested lightweight aggregates led to a considerable decrease in the heavy metal concentrations in urban runoff stormwater although filtralite was particularly efficient after 4 weeks the treatments were still successfully reducing and stabilising 99 of the heavy metals in the contaminated stormwater these results confirm that the lifetime of the tested lightweight aggregates is adequate and emphasise as a novel application of these materials on their feasibility for the improvement of urban stormwater quality keywords arlita filtralite calcite column experiments water quality environmental pollution 1 introduction runoff is one of the main components of the water cycle in particular surface runoff is extremely important in urban areas because their characteristic impervious features contribute to an increase in the water runoff volumes and negatively affect the hydrologic cycle in such environments wang et al 2017a the deterioration of water quality resulting from uncontrolled urban runoff should be considered in fact contaminated stormwater is one of the main elements responsible for non point source water pollution pitt et al 1995 zgheib et al 2012 stormwater runoff contains high levels of anthropogenic contaminants including oils organic

evaluate the cd removal efficiency some of the abovementioned materials fail to meet the necessary hydraulic requirements for being employed as filter materials in urban hydraulic systems zeolites for instance are suitable for the creation of containment barriers due to their low permeability and adsorption capacity hong et al 2016 however their use as filter materials in drainage urban systems should be considered with much caution lightweight aggregates lwas are low density construction aggregates they have been employed in a wide range of water treatments such as turbidity removal

urban runoff stormwater using two lwas particularly classified as light expanded clay aggregate leca which include commercial trademarks such as arlita or filtralite these materials possess excellent hydraulic properties mlih et al 2020 thereby suggesting their suitability for filtration in real suds the contaminants to be studied i e ni cu zn cd and pb were selected based on the official european and spanish ranges of soil contaminants rd 1310 1990 1990 rd 865 2010 2010 rd 506 2013 2013and ue 2015 2099 2015 several column experiments were conducted under a wide range of flow conditions to evaluate the performance of the lwas under conditions similar to those of real exploitation in this study we paid special attention to the removal capacity and the potential of the lwas in removing specific contaminants and the stability of the decontamination process the employment of lwas to address the previous topics is not an extended practice consequently the novelty of this research aims at demonstrating the removal efficiency of the employed materials to decontaminate runoff stormwater we analysed the removal mechanisms in detail and evaluated the effects of ph changes derived from the interaction between the lwas and contaminated waters finally we added natural basic solids i e calcite aggregates and considered their effects on heavy metals removal 2 methods 2 1 filter materials two different expanded lightweight clay aggregates were selected to be employed as filter materials arlita leca xs a crushed aggregate with particle size of 1 3 mm and filtralite p with particle size of 0 5 4 mm manufacturing of these materials consists of burning clays at high temperatures 1150 c causing a melting process in which the clay becomes expanded arlita and filtralite have similar mineralogical compositions they include quartz plagioclase k feldspar and in a minor proportion olivine and hematite calcite is scarce and found only in filtralite table 1 shows the chemical composition of arlita and filtralite both aggregates present high intraparticle porosity 53 and 62 for arlita and filtralite respectively moreover the specific surface areas ssa of arlita and filtralite are 0 44 m2 g and 1 60 m2 g respectively these values are similar to those of other clay lwas albuquerque and labrincha 2008 and correspond to those of macroporous materials the interparticle porosities are high 50 and 43 for arlita and filtralite respectively and the characteristic particle sizes translate into exceptional hydraulic properties hydraulic conductivity 1 94 cm s and 1 15 cm s for arlita and filtralite respectively compared to those of other adsorbents limestone particles 99 caco3 with particle size 12 mm and bulk density 2700 kg m3 were also employed to manufacture different filters caco3 in the form of calcite is one of the most abundant natural bases and was tested to evaluate the neutralising strength of the lwas 2 2 aqueous solutions containing heavy metals column experiments were conducted by employing synthetic contaminated water with five heavy metals ni cu zn cd and pb the studied solutions contained simultaneously the five selected heavy metals ni 100 ppm zn 50 ppm pb 10 ppm cu 5 ppm and cd 30 ppm aqueous solutions were prepared using commercial chemical compounds znso4 cuso4 panreac applichem itw reagents pbcl2 emd millipore corporation nicl2 sigma aldrich and cdso4 alfa aesar the ph of the target solutions was measured with a crison 25 ph metre 0 01 accuracy following the une iso10390 2012 2012 standard the concentration of heavy metals in the aqueous solutions was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms using a thermo elemental vg pq excell device table 2 shows the range of concentrations of the different studied elements in real stormwater and the comparison with the initial concentrations in the present study concentrations of the heavy metals in the synthetic stormwater are higher than of a typical stormwater reddy 2013 reddy and kumar 2017 reddy et al 2014b wang et al 2017b wang et al 2019 the objective of the study was to evaluate the ability of the two lightweight aggregates to reduce the employed concentrations table 2 we assume the hypothesis that the removal rates obtained for those high concentrations would keep constant or higher when the initial concentration of heavy metals in the stormwater becomes lower aiming to compare the results obtained in the experiments with the permissible limits established by the spanish regulations table 2 also includes the average value of the allowable limits for direct water discharge to the environment 2 3 column experiments different column experiments were designed to evaluate the removal efficiency of arlita and filtralite fig 1 i static mode experiments were conducted to determine the long time interactions between the lwas and the contaminants the maximum amount of contaminant removed by the adsorbents was quantified and long periods of water accumulation in the collection systems were simulated although this is not a common situation in the collection systems these experiments were developed to obtain reference levels of variation in the concentration of contaminants ii dynamic mode experiments were conducted to evaluate the removal efficiency under stormwater flow conditions the short time interactions between the lwas and the contaminants were characterised and the removal activity of the lwas during a storm event were reproduced consequently these experiments reproduce the employment of arlita and filtralite as filter materials located in suds which may operate in storm events iii experiments using contaminated particles were conducted to evaluate the stability of the contamination removal process and quantify the concentration of heavy metals after washing the release of contaminants from the lwas in the presence of clean runoff stormwater was determined these were previously contaminated in static mode conditions after long time interactions between lwas and the contaminants results from this type of experiment establish if arlita and filtralite would release contaminants to water after removing heavy metal concentration in the first flush stormwater iv long term column experiments were conducted to estimate the lifetime of the lwas the removal efficiency of the materials through time was evaluated by performing continuous repetitions of the same procedure and mimicking successive storm events this type of experiments demonstrates that arlita and filtralite would decontaminate water after multiple uses of the material 2 3 1 column experiments static mode the first group of experiments was performed using columns with height of 45 cm and diameter of 9 cm filled with 1000 g of arlita or filtralite for each material three stages were developed 1 the columns were filled with synthetic water 2 the experiment was identically reproduced but using deionized water and 3 synthetic contaminated water with the same initial characteristics was used again each experiment lasted 16 days and the water was drained at the end of this period moreover each treatment required 1 2 l equivalent to 188 6 mm of water three replications of the same experiment were conducted for each material and stage the above stages were established to study the reversibility of the filtering materials in addition in the intermediate stage stage 2 the contaminated particles were washed without extracting them from the column in this case the particles were not dried aiming to test the stability of the removal between two consecutive rainfall events occurred within a short time interval overall the experiments evaluated the removal efficiency of the particles using water samples collected at fixed time intervals the sampling was daily at the beginning of the experiment but its frequency decreased towards the end between sample collections the synthetic runoff stormwater remained static in the column the heavy metals concentration in the aqueous solutions extracted from the columns was determined by icp ms additionally the ph value was measured before the icp ms analysis once the three stages of the column experiments were completed oven dried at 40 c solid samples of arlita and filtralite were analysed by icp ms after acid digestion mslabs canada and by using a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem zeiss merlin vp compact device to determine the heavy metals concentration in the solid particles 2 3 2 column experiments dynamic mode similar tests were developed in smaller columns height 25 cm diameter 5 cm performing three parallel replications for each material lwas 60 g and limestone particles 250 g were used to fill the different columns synthetic runoff stormwater 100 ml was employed to fill the column duration of each test was 10 min and through this interval water samples were collected at 0 1 2 3 5 5 7 and 10 min the tests consisted of two consecutive repetitions characterised by the use of synthetic contaminated water and of one final washing stage in which the same volume of deionized water was used in place of the contaminated water the heavy metals concentration of the water samples was determined by icp ms and the ph was measured before the icp ms analysis 2 3 3 column experiments with contaminated particles contaminated particles of arlita and filtralite 30 g obtained from the static mode test were introduced in columns with height 25 cm and diameter 5 cm three parallel repetitions were conducted using the columns containing contaminated arlita and filtralite these were filled with deionized water 36 ml to wash the materials the experiments lasted 90 min and water samples were collected with varying frequency every minute at the beginning of the experiment overall these experiments aimed to simulate the occurrence of rainfall after a long dry period the contaminated particles were oven dried before use deionized water remained in the column between the collection of samples the ph of the aqueous samples was measured before their icp ms analysis 2 3 4 column experiments lifetime testing once the removal efficiency of the tested materials was determined a last series of column experiments were conducted to evaluate the lifetime of the selected materials columns with height 34 cm and diameter 5 cm were employed for these experiments which included four different treatments treatment 1 containing 260 g of arlita treatment 2 containing 260 g of filtralite treatment 3 containing 130 g of arlita and 400 g of caco3 and treatment 4 containing 130 g of filtralite and 400 g of caco3 three replications were performed for each treatment the experiments lasted 4 weeks daily measurements were conducted for 22 days week 1 5 days week 2 5 days week 3 6 days and week 4 6 days each day 160 ml 82 mm of contaminated solution were poured in the columns and collected after letting them flow through the filter materials over a time interval of 30 s afterwards the columns were left under room air conditions until the next repetition which took place the following day the aqueous contaminated samples were tested before and after icp ms analysis and the ph was measured before analysing their chemical composition 3 results and discussion 3 1 column experiments static mode the column experiments developed in static mode demonstrated substantial changes in the concentration of contaminated particles in the solutions fig 2 shows the average values of the three replications obtained from the two repetitions in which synthetic contaminated water was used stages 1 and 3 between each repetition fig 2a f and g l respectively deionized water was employed to clean the filter materials stage 2 increases of the ph solution occurred simultaneously to decreases of the heavy metal concentration at the initial heavy metal concentration the synthetic solution had ph 4 this value is lower than stormwater ph which ranges from 6 to 7 sounthararajah et al 2017 after the second repetition in the case of both materials the ph values were higher than the initial values this was due to the residual water from the cleaning stage which remained in contact with the lwas a relatively fast rise in ph occurred after the interaction between the liquid solution and the solid particles of the filter materials after 24 h from the start of the experiment the ph more than doubled compared to its initial value except in the first repetition when using arlita fig 2c this fast increase in ph over 24 h paralleled a 60 reduction in all heavy metal contaminants the reduction in ni 66 9 and cd 77 2 observed in the first repetition after 24 h when using arlita figs 2a c was the lowest accomplished in all other cases the contaminants were reduced by 95 9 according to our results the final concentrations of ni cu zn cd and pb were 4 1 2 1 0 4 0 2 and 1 2 ppm respectively final concentrations would exceed the spanish permissible limits for direct water discharge into the environment for ni cu cd and pb table 2 the results of the second repetition and of both repetitions when arlita and filtralite were used respectively demonstrated that a time interval of 24 h was sufficient to achieve a ph 9 and consequently to reduce the initial concentration of heavy metals by 99 fig 2d l during the intermediate stage between the two repetitions the materials were washed using deionized water to study the reversibility of the lwas and quantify the heavy metals concentration in the washing flow the washing process took place in the columns after finishing the experiment with the contaminated water and without extracting the contaminated material almost no ni cu zn cd and pb were found in the collected washing water when one of the lwas was used the highest concentration 0 06 ppm was measured for ni when filtralite was used 3 2 column experiments dynamic mode the column tests developed in dynamic mode with a continuous flow fig 3 revealed that the materials behaved similarly to when they were tested in the static mode although the ph values were different due to the interaction time between the lwas and water in the static mode the ph stabilised to 10 in both cases after 5 days whereas in the continuous flow experiments the ph reached 7 after 10 min these results indicate that the lwas provided a fast response and had a considerable neutralising strength after the first measurement after 1 min the ph reached a nearly constant value the concentration of all the heavy metals contaminants in the released water decreased as the ph increased due to the interaction of the synthetic solution with the lwa particles fig 3 similar ph values were measured when using these materials nevertheless the use of filtralite was associated to the highest ph values and to the major reductions in the contaminants concentrations at the end of the experiments 10 min the average concentration of all the contaminants had decreased on average by 74 using the different filter materials i e arlita filtralite and caco3 fig 3a b c f g h k l m final concentration for cu was lower than 0 2 ppm in the experiments developed with arlita filtralite and caco3 in these experiments only cu final concentration accomplishes the permissible limit for discharge into the environment established by the spanish normative table 2 when the contaminated particles were washed with deionized water residual values 0 8 ppm were obtained from the arlita fig 3d and filtralite fig 3i experiments these values decreased with the increase of ph which reached 10 in the case of filtralite meanwhile minimal ph variations were observed in the caco3 experiment indicating unremarkable variations in the contaminants concentration at least in the washing phase fig 3n 3 3 column experiments with contaminated particles contaminated material from the column experiments developed in static mode was oven dried and employed to simulate the washing process the data shown in fig 4 confirmed the absence of heavy metals in the washing flow these experiments developed using arlita and filtralite fig 4a also demonstrated that the particle washing process did not contaminate the water flux once the metals were trapped by the filter the maximum concentration was measured for zn when using arlita 0 18 ppm this value would be within the limits of the permissible discharge limits stablished by spanish water regulations table 2 in the case of both materials all the contaminants showed the same trends their concentrations decreased over time since the interaction of the lwas with the solid particles increased the ph up to a final value 9 of the washing solution fig 4b c after 90 min from the start of the experiment the contaminants concentration in the washing water was 0 ppm nevertheless the concentration of zn was slightly higher than those of the other contaminants for both the arlita and filtralite experiments in the case where filtralite was used the last sample was collected 4 days after the beginning of the experiment the contaminants concentration in this sample were similar to those obtained from a sample collected 90 min after the beginning of the experiment the ph increased from 9 35 after 90 min to 9 72 after 4 days whereas the concentrations of ni cu zn and cd decreased from 0 003 to 0 001 ppm from 0 017 to 0 004 ppm from 0 019 to 0 001 ppm and from 0 002 to 0 001 ppm respectively these concentration values remained relatively stable for pb the maximum observed change amounted to 0 004 ppm fig 4 the absence of contaminants in the water samples after the washing process confirms that the decontamination of the studied materials was permanent and stable this was due to the ph changes related to the use of the filter materials 3 4 column experiments lifetime testing the results obtained from the lifetime testing experiment fig 5 confirmed that both materials had a long lifetime after 22 repetitions grouped in four ensembles representing 22 rainfall episodes and that involved the application of 1782 mm of water in total the maximum decrease in removal rate was identified for cd 34 6 in treatment 4 results demonstrated a higher removal efficiency for filtralite 91 6 99 6 97 5 90 8 and 99 5 for ni cu zn cd and pb respectively fig 4b compared to arlita 27 4 91 3 41 8 27 8 and 97 3 for ni cu zn cd and pb respectively fig 4a and a reduction of the heavy metal removal when caco3 was employed combined with the filter materials fig 5c d removal efficiencies for treatment 3 arlita with caco3 were 19 5 68 2 25 4 17 6 and 88 5 for ni cu zn cd and pb respectively while for treatment 4 filtralite with caco3 these values increased up to 88 2 99 6 96 0 79 6 and 99 2 for ni cu zn cd and pb respectively this last observation was confirmed by the results of the column experiments in dynamic mode and might be explained by a higher interparticle porosity and hence a lower interaction between the caco3 particles and the contaminated solution therefore the ph values and the removal rate in this case were lower compared to when the columns were filled exclusively with arlita and filtralite the removal performance was dependent on the ph after a high number of repetitions the ph decreased by 2 5 in the case of treatment 4 causing a decrease of the treatment efficiency the removal rate in the presence of arlita did not vary significantly during the experiments fig 5a c moreover the removal rates of cu and pb were significantly higher than those for ni zn and cd filtralite removed ni cu zn cd and pb properly although the best results were obtained for cu zn and pb fig 5b d in the case of filtralite treatment 2 final concentration of ni cu zn cd and pb in week 4 were 8 4 ppm 0 ppm 1 3 ppm 2 8 ppm and 0 ppm respectively consequently final concentrations for heavy metals after treatment 2 would be within spanish permissible limits for cu and pb considering direct water discharge into the environment table 2 spanish regulations do not specifically consider permissible limits for heavy metals in the case of direct discharge to soil e g as in infiltration trenches or ponds but include them within the permissible limits of direct discharge into the environment the lower removal efficiencies were achieved for ni and cd reddy et al 2014b performed similar experiments using the same contaminants but different materials calcite and zeolites which were not previously contaminated they concluded that maximum removal efficiencies were also accomplished for cu zn and pb 3 5 mechanisms of heavy metal removal the experiments described in the previous sections confirmed the efficiency of the studied materials in reducing the concentration of heavy metals in urban stormwater when considering a target rainfall of 82 mm distributed over 22 events the different tests suggested that a brief time 0 5 1 min of interaction between the filter particles and the contaminated stormwater was sufficient to ensure a significant reduction of the heavy metals concentration in runoff water figs 3 5 however the results varied in relation to the type of heavy metal the filter characteristics and the selected filter materials arlita or filtralite notably after some days of interaction between the particles and the contaminated stormwater the concentration of contaminants continued to be reduced considerably up to 95 9 fig 2 the best reduction in the heavy metal concentration was achieved by using the larger columns figs 2 5 due to the larger surface of interaction between the water and the particles in all the cases analysed the reduction in heavy metals concentration occurred simultaneously with an increase in ph figs 2 5 the element distribution map of the filter material obtained from the column experiments developed in static mode and analysed under fesem demonstrates the precipitation and co precipitation of all the heavy metals on the particles surface fig 6 the icp ms analysis of the lwas confirmed the presence of precipitated heavy metals on the surface of the studied particles table 3 supporting the results shown in fig 6 the heavy metal composition of the lwas confirmed that solid particles eliminated most of the heavy metals present in the contaminated solutions overall the results indicate that an increase in ph led to the precipitation of the contaminants on the surfaces of the arlita and filtralite particles although the heavy metals were detected on the original particles of arlita and filtralite table 3 a batch experiment employing particles and deionized water revealed that the cations were not labile but contained in the mineral structure therefore the concentration of the studied heavy metals in the deionized water after the experiment was equal to 0 the removal of heavy metals occurred by chemical precipitation as the ph increased faisal et al 2020 due to the precipitation and co precipitation of the insoluble phases i e carbonates oxides and hydroxides under basic conditions langmuir 1997 moreover the irregular surfaces of the arlita and filtralite particles contributed to the accumulation and retention of contaminants in the aggregates the precipitates occurred in a non equilibrium state and in amorphous forms because of their fast crystallisation fig 6 shows a substantial precipitation of heavy metals on the particles surface the increment in heavy metals concentration from the original to the contaminated particles corresponds exactly to the amount of heavy metals precipitated on the surface of the evaluated particles the heavy metals removal by the lwas might be also attributed to ion exchange reactions collison and grismer 2014 kasai et al 2019 nakarai et al 2019 naushad et al 2015b petrella et al 2017 zhu et al 1997 considering the mineralogical composition and the ssa of the studied lwas these materials might have undergone ion exchange reactions overall the contamination elimination might have been resulted from the combination of two effects i e chemical precipiation and ion exchange reactions in the particular case of arlita and filtralite however the chemical precipitation of solid phases should have been the major process determining the reduction of heavy metals as mentioned previously the washing flow derived from the washing experiments with contaminated material showed a scarce concentration of heavy metals fig 4 these results suggest that the employment of the proposed material in real urban systems would be advantageous and avoid the further migration of contaminants from the used filter material to non contaminated water this matter constitutes one of the advantages that the employment of lwas would provide to the runoff stormwater treatment although there are some limitations in the proposed treatments such as the necessity of developing experiments with higher water volumes and different initial conditions in the concentration of the different contaminants the improvement of urban stormwater quality has been clearly demonstrated the low concentration of contaminants in the washing flow might be explained by the sorbent cations on the surfaces of the lwas whose relative mobility might have allowed the occurrence of ion exchange reactions overall these results confirm that most of the contaminants were removed by chemical precipitation and that they remained stable in the aqueous solution under the tested alkaline conditions nevertheless the concentrations used in the present study are higher than the expected in real stormwater and further analysis should be addressed to study if the initial concentrations could affect the removal rates obtained in this study 4 conclusions the management of runoff stormwater in urban areas must consider the treatment of water quality emerging solutions contemplate the use of green infrastructures to address both flooding problems and pollution removal this study demonstrated the excellent hydraulic properties and performance in reducing the contamination of urban stormwater of arlita and filtralite even considering that in some of the experiments the studied materials cannot assure the reaching of the discharge limits from our results we can conclude that in dynamic experiments a brief time of interaction between the particles of arlita or filtralite and the aqueous solutions was sufficient to reduce the concentration of heavy metals by up to 74 using the different filter materials i e arlita filtralite and caco3 in addition arlita and filtralite presented a long lifetime and ensured a stable decontamination of the aqueous solutions over time filtralite demonstrated a higher removal efficiency 95 8 on average compared to arlita 57 1 on average which was associated to a highest ph increase caco3 additions combined with the use of lwas did not lead to an improvement of the heavy metals removal rates but rather hindered the decontamination process average removal rates of 92 5 and 43 85 for caco3 combined with filtralite and arlita the washing experiment of contaminated particles demonstrated the irreversibility of the decontamination process with maximum observed concentration of 0 18 ppm for zn with both lwas the specific design of the different experiments affected the removal rate highest removal efficiency is achieved with the static mode experiments due to longer interaction time between the contaminated water and the filter material declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this work was funded by the university of alicante project

1439,in situ chemical oxidation isco can remove pollutants efficiently however the most important key to successfully conducting isco on site is to place the oxidant in close contact with the contaminant therefore monitoring tools that provide for enhanced tracking of the injectate offer considerable benefit to guide subsequent isco injections in this study we applied the magnetometric resistivity mmr method to survey the distribution of an injected oxidant a pilot test was conducted on a 10 m 10 m site and the sodium persulfate injection involved four pulse injections from one injection well a magnetic field survey coupled with conventional monitoring was performed before the initial injection and after each pulse injection the results of this study showed that groundwater samples from six observation wells and seven direct push ec loggings did not provide sufficient data to quantify the distribution and flow behavior of the injected oxidant however the magnetic field survey visually showed the dynamic distribution of the injected oxidant and the flow pathways and flow behavior were assessed accordingly although the flow behavior of injected solution was changeable in the aquifer but the magnetic field survey combined with the monitoring of the well samples helped to explain the abnormal changes in the electrical conductivity of the observation wells and supports the use of the magnetic field survey technology as a method of monitoring isco injections keywords mmr magnetic survey current density electrical conductivity isco pilot test 1 introduction with increasing global industrialization groundwater contamination has become increasingly serious the organic contamination which endangers the environment and human health has been a concern for decades among the commonly used soil and groundwater remediation methods in situ chemical oxidation isco can solve the problem of deep soil and groundwater contamination while avoiding some problems e g secondary pollution gomes et al 2013 and is a rapid and effective method that can transform a wide spectrum of contaminants into harmless substances such as chloride ions carbon dioxide and water carey et al 1979 morillo et al 2007 wu et al 2011 sun et al 2014 or into more biodegradable products itrc 2005 krembs et al 2010 tsitonaki et al 2010 siegrist et al 2011 isco is a method of delivering chemical oxidants into the contaminated regions to decompose the pollutants although the chemical oxidants show strong oxidation to contaminants the most important key for successful isco operation on site is whether these oxidants can be delivered uniformly to the targeted contaminated zone or not many engineers usually assume that the injected oxidant solution spreads radially from the injection well krembs 2008 piscopo et al 2016 ross and adrian 1989 in fact the flow behavior of the injected solution is strongly dependent on the subsurface conditions and particularly on the spatial distribution of the hydraulic conductivity previous studies have shown that a zone with high hydraulic conductivity is usually the zone of the chemical oxidant distribution allen king et al 1998 cave et al 2007 to improve our understanding of how the oxidant solution migrates in the saturated zone and how to efficiently remediate contaminated zones it is necessary to carry out detailed monitoring of the distribution of the oxidant solution traditional groundwater sampling methods cannot provide sufficient data because of the limited number of monitoring wells on site moreover conducting a large number of sample analyses on site is expensive and time consuming numerical simulation methods cannot provide correct data because of the insufficient hydrogeological information obtained from the site in addition to the methods mentioned above surface geophysical technologies such as seismic ground penetrating radar gpr electrical resistivity technology ert and electromagnetic em surveys have been applied to soil sciences for a long time these technologies may provide information regarding anthropogenic pathways buried sources of contamination or preferential flow pathways the general principle of geophysical exploration is to non invasively collect data on the medium under investigation scollar et al 1990 these geophysical methods can provide more sufficient indirect data of oxidant distribution at a lower cost for an isco site among these surface geophysical technologies seismic surveys and gpr cannot be used to survey water soluble oxidants because of the lack of an effective reflective surface em surveys are used as a borehole logging or well monitoring tool ert is the most used technology among all these geophysical technologies because it is sensitive to variations in conductivity various laboratory studies have shown that the injection of permanganate and the oxidation of trichloroethylene tce increase the bulk conductivity which is then detectable through a resistivity measurement harte et al 2012 hort et al 2014 hort et al 2015 moreover field studies have shown evident changes in bulk resistivity around the oxidant injection point and thus ert could successfully monitor the flow pattern of the injected solution chambers et al 2010 halihan et al 2012 harte et al 2012 tildy et al 2017 chambers et al 2010 reported the observation of a preferential pathway during the injection process halihan et al 2012 reported that the injected solution did not follow the hydraulic gradient and flow to the monitoring wells because the act of injecting the solution altered the hydraulic gradient because of the complex changeable and unpredictable flow patterns usually observed during in situ chemical oxidant injection it is difficult to monitor the distribution of the oxidant using pre set monitoring wells therefore geophysical methods can play a significant role in investigating the injected oxidant distribution and movement over time however only a few articles have reported the application of geophysical methods to the estimation of the distribution of a chemical oxidant the most used technology ert usually presents the survey results as a two dimensional 2d image of a vertical slice through the area being surveyed although researchers can certainly present three dimensional 3d images by conducting multiple survey lines this would result in increased costs the magnetometric resistivity mmr method is a less well known method with mmr a low frequency electrical current frequency 1 khz is injected into the ground between two electrodes and the resulting magnetic field is measured a 2d image of the horizontal profile is generated according to the measured data distributed on the ground which could be used to mitigate the deficiencies of ert this method was initially proposed by jakosky 1933 and then refined by other researchers nabighian 1991a 1991b with the purpose of determining the electrical conductivity of the earth edwards 1974 because the mmr method is sensitive to the current that is concentrated within a conductive body it was usually used to explore mineral resources and abnormal structures identify preferential groundwater flow paths and detect reservoir leakages edwards howel 1976 jessop et al 2018 trevino edwards 1979 zou et al 2019 accordingly applying the mmr method in isco should be helpful in monitoring the oxidant flow pattern and evaluating the efficacy of isco in a fast effective and inexpensive way for the present research we performed a pilot study of chemical oxidant injection both a magnetic field survey and groundwater sampling were conducted to compare and verify the results of this geophysical technology the spatial and temporal spread of the injectate during the injection process was identified using geophysical time series surveys the aim of this study was to apply the mmr method to estimate the distribution of the injectate during chemical oxidant injection the main contribution of this study is to attain a rapid convenient and low cost technology that requires the application of an electrical current and the survey of its resulting magnetic field to facilitate monitoring during isco 2 theoretical background 2 1 conceptual model of magnetometric resistivity for a surface mmr set up electrodes are embedded in the ground and an electric current is injected through the vadose zone to the groundwater table a magnetic field sensor then measures each component of the magnetic field fig 1 the magnetic field is caused by currents that flow in the ground b g in the electrodes b a and b b and in the wire b 1 b 2 and b 3 without consideration of various noises the observed magnetic field b obs can be denoted by 1 b obs b 1 b 2 b 3 b a b b b g where b a is the magnetic field from electrode a b b is the magnetic field from electrode b and b 1 b 2 and b 3 are the magnetic fields from wire 1 wire 2 and wire 3 respectively for an observed point p the components of the magnetic field are shown in fig 2 the magnetic fields b a b b and b g are parallel to the ground and b 1 b 2 and b 3 are normal to the ground in this study we wanted to assess the distribution of the injectate in the aquifer and so the horizontal magnetic field is what we are concerned with the horizontal observed magnetic field b obs h can be denoted by 2 b ob s h b a b b b g 2 2 magnetic field on the ground surface generated by current flowing in an electrode suppose current electrodes a and b separated by distance l are embedded in flat earth that has uniform conductivity at the coordinates 0 l 2 0 and 0 l 2 0 respectively and that they are supplied with a stable current of strength i from a power supply through two horizontal wires the groundwater table is at depth d p is an observed point with coordinates x y 0 as shown in fig 3 the field generated by the current flow in the aquifer depends on the distribution of current in the aquifer edwards et al 1978 jessop et al 2018 the magnetic field generated by the current flow through the ground electrode to aquifer can be obtained from the biot savart law and is expressed as follows chen et al 2002 edwards 1974 3 b electrode x b a x b b x 0 d d b a l 2 y r a 0 d d b b l 2 y r b μ 0 i 4 π 0 d sin α r a 2 d s a l 2 y r a μ 0 i 4 π 0 d sin β r b 2 d s b l 2 y r b where b electrode x is the observed magnetic field in the x direction generated by the current flow in the two electrodes b a x is the magnetic field in the x direction generated by the current flow in electrode a b b x is the magnetic field in the x direction generated by the current flow in electrode b r a and r b are the distances from p to electrodes a and b respectively r a and r b are the distances from p to wire elements ds a and ds b respectively α is the angle between r a and d s a and β is the angle between r b and d s b 2 3 magnetic field on the ground surface generated by a current flowing in aquifer the current flowing in an aquifer is not like that in a wire because the entire the aquifer acts as a conductor and thus the current flow is dispersed in the aquifer in deriving the magnetic fields due to current flow in the ground edwards et al 1978 used a modified biot savart law for solenoidal current flow to express the magnetic field b r of point p r that is external to a volume v containing a distribution of current elements j r dv as follows 4 b r μ 4 π v j r r r dv everywhere within the earth for an electric current we may define an electric potential u r related to j r through the local conductivity σ r by 5 j r σ r u r using the vector identity mentioned earlier and observing that ϕ 0 we obtain the final expression 6 b r μ 4 π v u r σ r r r dv from eq 6 we find that the magnetic survey method is sensitive to the gradient of the electrical conductivity distribution if the injectate distribution is characterized by an evident change in the electrical conductivity with the surrounding material it will be detectable through the magnetic measurements 2 4 computing magnetic data for magnetic survey during oxidant injection in an electric field system if the groundwater quality of a zone is changed by an injected oxidant its electrical conductivity will change and in turn its current density will be altered we assume that the observed horizontal magnetic fields are b obs h and b obs h for the pre and post injection respectively 7 b obs h b a b b b g where b a and b b are the magnetic fields generated by the current flow in electrodes a and b respectively after the oxidant injection b g is a magnetic field generated by current flow in the aquifer after the oxidant injection the change in horizontal magnetic field is given as b obs h b obs h b obs h b a b b b g b a b b b g 8 b a b a b b b b b g b g when the injected current is controlled to be a constant the magnetic field from each electrode will also be constant b a b a b b b b b obs h can thus be expressed as 9 b obs h b g b g b g the change in the horizontal observed magnetic field b obs h would be the change in magnetic field generated by current flow in the aquifer b g according to eq 6 if the magnetic survey is conducted immediately under a controlled condition before and after the isco the variations in electric potential and survey depth would be minor the major reason for the change in the magnetic field b g should be the change in the electrical conductivity of the aquifer 3 methods and materials 3 1 site description the pilot injection study was conducted at a site measuring 10 m 10 m on uncontaminated private farmland located in the southern changhua county taiwan fig 4 the borehole logs showed that the main soil type was fine grained sand above the depth of 2 m fine grained sand and silt in the depth range of 2 6 m and silt in the depth range of 6 8 m soil cores were collected using direct push geoprobe model 6620dt the groundwater table was approximately 2 2 m below the ground surface during the pilot study the direct push electrical conductivity ec method was used before installing the observation wells to evaluate the possible flow direction of the injectate the direct push ec profiles of seven push locations m1 to m7 are shown in fig 5 it has been reported that the ec of unconsolidated materials is a function of the moisture content of the material and the conducting properties of the pore fluids and sediments schon 1996 the variation in groundwater chemistry is usually small inside an area and the ec is mainly controlled by the differences in sediment size and type keys 1990 therefore the ec associated with sedimentary materials should vary with particle size and mineral species the relationship between ec values and the particle size of a material was reported by schulmeister et al 2003 by comparing the direct push ec logs with various types of hydrogeological data the authors demonstrated that higher ec values generally reflect a fine grained material whereas lower values indicate coarser sediments according to the ec profiles shown in fig 5 and the ec values presented in table 1 the average electrical conductivity of m1 m4 in ascending order was as follows m3 m4 m1 m2 thus the resistance of the fluid flow from the injection well iw or m5 in ascending order was as follows m3 m4 m1 m2 direct push ec logging of m6 and m7 was conducted after the analysis of m1 m4 to further estimate the possible flow pathway of the injectate m6 showed coarser media and lower resistance than m7 in the depth range of 2 5 3 7 m on the basis of these results from ec logging the direction of m5 to m6 was set as the main possible flow direction of the injectate the directions of m5 to ow2 and m7 were set as the second and the third possible flow directions of the injectate respectively and the locations of the observation wells were set up accordingly 3 2 construction and installation of monitoring network one iw and six observation wells were installed in the field of the pilot study the iw was installed at 5 5 and ow1 ow2 ow3 ow4 ow5 and owb were installed at 5 4 7 5 5 2 1 5 5 0 and 5 10 respectively the related positions of these seven wells are shown in fig 4 the iw was drilled to 6 m and the well casings were constructed of 4 in i d schedule 40 pvc pipe and screened from approximately 1 5 m to 6 m the observation wells ow1 ow2 ow3 ow4 ow5 and owb were drilled to 6 m as well and were constructed of 1 in schedule 40 pvc casing and screened from 1 5 m to 6 m fig 4 also shows the locations of the two electrodes and the survey grid for the pilot injection study the stainless steel electrodes electrode 1 and electrode 2 with diameters of 0 6 cm and lengths of 15 cm were embedded in the ground an automatic watering device containing a 2 sodium chloride solution was installed next to the electrodes to help the electrodes maintain electrical contact with the soil mass and to lead the injected current downward to the groundwater after the environmental interference scanning the voltage and the frequency of the ac power source 6605 extech electronics co were set at 200 v and 447 hz respectively and the corresponding output electric current was initially around 0 2 a the number of magnetic field survey points was 121 and the spacing between the magnetic field survey points was 1 0 m the magnetic field sensor of the measurement system surveyed every grid point at the ground level 3 3 chemical oxidant solution preparation and injection procedure sodium persulfate na2s2o8 was selected to be the oxidant in this pilot study because of its increasing use for the isco of organic contaminants in groundwater the ec and oxidation reduction potential orp were tested in the laboratory before the injection procedure table 2 shows the ec and orp values of different concentrations of na2s2o8 and the ec data showed a better linear relationship in this study therefore we decided to use a 1 sodium persulfate solution as the injected chemical oxidant solution and we measured the ec values to monitor the delivery of the injectate the high pressure injection method was used in this pilot study it consisted of a high pressure jetting head a pressure tube a pressure control device a pump and two well packers the jetting head was fixed and limited at a depth of 3 2 3 7 m by the well packers and the injected solution entered the aquifer only in this interval the injection flow rate was approximately 37 l min under a controllable injection pressure of less than 0 86 kg cm2 instead of a continuous injection mode a pulse injection mode with four pulses p1 p2 p3 and p4 was used in this pilot test in all 4 m3 of the 1 sodium persulfate solution was injected into the aquifer in other words the injected volume was 1 m3 for each pulse the pilot test was conducted on september 26 2018 3 4 measurement system the groundwater ec values of the six observation wells were sampled and measured on site after each pulse injection by a portable conductivity meter wtw model cond 3210 wissenschaftlich technische werkstätten gmbh germany to monitor the delivery of s2o8 2 in each observation well a teflon bailer with a 0 5 in o d and 36 in length with double check valves was used to sample the groundwater of different depth intervals 2 0 3 0 m and 3 0 4 0 m from the observation wells the magnetic field survey was conducted on the 121 survey grid points of the test site fig 4 after each pulse injection the survey system was designed to measure the magnetic field strength generated by the ac electrical current of the set frequency flowing between the two electrodes hence this system included a three axis magnetic field sensor em 2 elisha technology co a data acquisition device ni 9230 national instruments and a tablet with the data calculation and analysis software ngst elisha technology co the magnetic field strength was detected and an analog signal was exported to the data acquisition device the analog signal was converted into a digital signal and transferred to the tablet to perform the analysis the internal noise of the magnetic field survey system used in this study was reported to be less than 0 0002 mg to avoid an overestimation in this pilot study it was necessary to statistically determine the detection limit and the confidence interval of the measurement system the method detection limit mdl is the minimum signal that can be measured and reported with 99 confidence that the analyte magnitude is greater than zero the mdl procedure has been criticized in the literature gibbons 1996 but it is the best available method for laboratory certification moreover the lower limit of quantitation loq is the level above which quantitative results may be obtained with a specified degree of confidence the loq is mathematically defined as being equal to 10 times the standard deviation of the results for a series of replicates used to determine a justifiable limit of detection ripp 1996 this study applied the mdl and loq procedures to estimate the results from the magnetic field survey system at the specified confidence level blank measurements were conducted before establishing the magnetic field on the test site table 3 shows the values and the statistical results of the 16 magnetic field measurements the mean was 0 00055 mg and the sample standard deviation was 0 00008 mg the mdl was calculated as follows 10 mdl sample standard deviation t n 1 1 a 0 99 here t n 1 1 a 0 99 is student s t value appropriate for the 99 confidence level the t value for the 16 replicates was 2 947 and the corresponding calculated mdl was 0 00024 mg the loq was also calculated and was 0 00080 mg the loq showed a greater and more reliable value than mdl and thus the loq was the lowest signal that could be determined with acceptable precision and accuracy under the stated conditions of the test therefore in this study we used a value of 0 0008 mg to be the lowest distinguishable value and the contour interval to present the differences in the magnetic field strength between pre injection and post injection 3 5 relationship between persulfate concentrations and mmr measurements in order to connect directly the persulfate concentrations and mmr measurements this study designed and conducted a series of small scale field tests on uncontaminated private farmland the topsoil of this site is composed of brown fine sand with a small amount of plant debris the stainless steel electrodes were embedded in the ground with a distance of 3 m and the input current was controlled at 0 2 a a one m ditch for persulfate solution infiltration with about 4 cm in diameter was set up in the middle and along the connection line of electrodes 20 l water with an electrical conductivity of 335 ms m was spread uniformly on the topsoil of a zone of 3 5 m 1 5 m the background mmr measurements were then performed on the measuring points of s01 to s20 the test was designed as shown in fig 6 after the background measurement the 0 2 sodium persulfate solution of 2 l was slowly filled in the ditch until the solution completely infiltrated the soil then the mmr measurements were performed again on the measuring points of s01 to s20 the changes of magnetic field intensity of the measuring points s01 to s20 after the sodium persulfate solution injection were noted as δm01 to δm20 the mean value of magnetic field change of the same row was calculated as below 11 l 1 average δm 01 δm 02 δm 03 δm 04 l 2 average δm 05 δm 06 δm 07 δm 08 l 3 average δm 09 δm 10 δm 11 δm 12 l 4 average δm 13 δm 14 δm 15 δm 16 l 5 average δm 17 δm 18 δm 19 δm 20 the values of l1 l2 l3 l4 and l5 of the field test of 0 2 sodium persulfate solution were shown in fig 7 besides the field tests of 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 of sodium persulfate solutions were conducted respectively on the different zones of this farmland their corresponding values of l1 l2 l3 l4 and l5 were also shown in fig 7 fig 7 shows the relationship between mmr measurements and the persulfate concentrations at different measuring locations the sodium persulfate solution which filled in the ditch was located at l3 also on the connection line of the two electrodes therefore the magnetic field intensity increases more obviously at l3 when the persulfate concentration is higher they are 0 0060 mg 0 0078 mg 0 0152 mg and 0 0172 mg for the persulfate concentrations of 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 respectively this result indicated that the higher persulfate concentration causes higher magnetic field intensity this was because the higher persulfate concentration offers a lower resistance pathway for the current and increases the current density at that area also some mmr measurements at the locations of l1 and l5 presented a negative value which also indicates that some electric current lines around l1 and l5 move out and reduce their current density and the generated magnetic field according to the results of the test mentioned above the higher concentration of persulfate in soil the greater the mmr measurement will be due to the electrical property of electrical conductivity 3 6 pilot test procedure this pilot test combined the traditional well monitoring method and the magnetic survey technology to estimate the distribution of the injectate during the oxidant injection the procedure for the pilot test included the following direct push ec logging injection and observation well installation magnetic field survey and ec measurement for the background four pulse injections and four magnetic field surveys and ec measurements p1 p2 p3 and p4 the detailed step content date and time of the pilot test are shown in fig 8 the time required for operating one pulse injection was approximately 30 40 min a complete round of both the groundwater ec measurement and the magnetic field survey took approximately 40 min in this pilot test 3 7 analysis of probably interference in the magnetic survey 3 7 1 temperature by conducting laboratory experiments on 30 samples of saline and alkaline soils campbell et al 1949 reported that electrical conductivity increases with temperature they also indicated that the conductivity increased by 2 02 per c in the range of 15 35 c bai et al 2013 conducted a laboratory test of compacted lateritic soil and presented an exponential relationship between electrical conductivity and temperature their findings revealed that the electrical conductivity increased gradually according to their soil samples and test device and electrical conductivity increased by approximately 24 when the temperature rose from 20 c to 30 c chemical oxidation reactions are exothermic and can raise the temperature of aquifer material and groundwater particularly when the oxidant concentration is high and reaction is fast mecozzi et al 2006 for safety reasons a controlled process with low concentrations of oxidant low temperature and restricted flow was generally performed in a contaminated site itrc 2005 moreover the oxidation reaction between injected oxidant and organic contaminant raised the temperature of the local aquifer and then increased the electrical conductivity of the corresponding zone this phenomenon will increase the increment of the measured ec and enhance the sensitivity of the magnetic survey this pilot test was conducted at an uncontaminated site but there might be some organic matter in the soil of the test site and would react with persulfate however fang et al 2018 studied the decomposition rates of persulfate by using soil with different amounts of organic matter the half life t1 2 of persulfate 5 g l decomposition in the soil with low organic matter is around 49 9 2 2 days to 77 5 1 2 days in this pilot test the depth of persulfate distribution is below 2 2 m where are usually a zone of lower soil organic matter and the total duration of the pilot test was less than 6 h therefore the reaction between persulfate and organic matter in this test should be very limited the groundwater temperature increased by the oxidization reaction should be very limited too moreover the temperature increased by the heating effect of an electric current can be estimated by joule s first law the groundwater temperature increment of the zone between two electrodes is less than 0 001 c under this pilot test condition hence the temperature rise effect in the magnetic survey could be neglected during the pilot injection test 3 7 2 electromagnetic properties when the excitation frequency approaches the orientational polarization of free water the effective conductivity begins increasing due to polarization losses the effect is most pronounced in low conductivity electrolytes and is imperceptible when conduction losses prevail with respect to polarization losses in high conductivity electrolytes the electromagnetic properties described above confirm that the effective conductivity remains constant at low frequencies klein santamarina 2003 revil 2013 the frequency of both the current and the resulting magnetic field used in this pilot test was less than 500 hz and the concentration of injected sodium persulfate solution was high 1 and therefore the influence of polarization losses can be neglected in this study furthermore electrical conductivity is a measure of charge mobility in response to an applied electric field it depends on both the bulk conductivity associated with conduction in the pore network and surface conduction in the electrical double layer coating the surface of the grains revil 2013 the conductivity in particles is primarily based on electron movement rather than ionic movement as in electrolytes their mobility is restricted by the electrical potential wells associated with surface charges on the minerals and hence mineral particles have very low conductivity relative to the conductivity of electrolytes surface conduction makes a noticeable contribution to the global conductivity of mixtures with low ionic concentration fluids while this contribution is negligible if the fluid has high ionic concentration klein santamarina 2003 lyklema 2001 such as the sodium persulfate solution used in this pilot study 3 7 3 chemical reaction it has been reported that the chemical reaction between the oxidant and the contaminant might produce some ions within the reaction zone and therefore the chemical oxidation reactions generally result in an increase in the electrical conductivity of the injected solution hort et al 2015 mao et al 2015 asserted that when the concentration of injected oxidant solution is much higher than that of the contaminant in the aquifer the fluid conductivity within the plume could likely be approximated based on the original conductivity of the injected oxidant solution our pilot injection study was conducted at an uncontaminated site and the interference of chemical reaction did not exist the changes observed in electrical conductivity over time can therefore be assumed to be caused entirely by the movement of the oxidant plume which has a significantly higher conductivity than that of background groundwater 4 results and discussions 4 1 change in groundwater ec of observation wells during the pilot test the observation wells were sampled and the ec of the groundwater was analyzed after each pulse injection the ec data of different depths and injection rounds for all of the observation wells are listed in table 4 the respective average values and the differences from the background values are shown in table 4 because the ec values of raw groundwater varied from 447 to 554 ms m if the δec of groundwater sample was less than 107 ms m it was regarded as raw groundwater without the injected oxidant except for the data of ow2 table 4 shows that the ec values at different depths of the same observation well were very close ow1 showed an increase of approximately 200 ms m after the first pulse injection and it maintained this value throughout the injection procedure this result revealed that just a small amount of sodium persulfate solution flowed to near ow1 over the duration of the first pulse injection although ow1 was close to the iw only 1 m the injectate hardly flowed to this area ow2 showed a maximum increase at the depth of 2 3 m after the second pulse injection and the corresponding ec value was 3290 ms m however it was only 706 ms m at the depth of 3 4 m it is interesting that the jetting head was fixed and limited to a depth of 3 2 3 7 m by the well packers and the groundwater table was 2 2 m below the ground surface the ec data revealed that the injectate flowed upward to the groundwater table moreover the ec value of ow1 nearest to the iw was 687 ms m only during the same injection round this result revealed that the injectate did not spread radially in this injection test it seemed that preferential flow formed from iw to ow2 and only at a depth of 2 3 m after the 3 and 4 m3 oxidant injections the ec values of ow2 at different depths were similar approximately 550 ms m this result indicated that the preferential flow from iw to ow2 formed during the second pulse injection and disappeared after the second pulse injection the δec values of ow2 were 82 ms m and 66 ms m after the 3 and 4 m3 oxidant injections respectively the δec value of ow4 increased slightly to 57 ms m after the 4 m3 oxidant injection but this change was not significant and it could be regarded as raw groundwater without the injected oxidant hence the result of ow4 indicated that the injectate did not flow to ow4 the ec values of ow3 ow5 and owb did not obviously change revealing that the injectate did not flow to these three observation wells either fig 9 presents the contour images plotted according to the δec of the six observation wells in table 4 the figure shows the increases in the ec values of different rounds of pulse injection between pre injection and post injection only the contour lines that were positive and greater than 100 ms m are presented fig 9 a shows that the injectate distributed around the iw after the first pulse injection only ow1 was included in this area the δec values of ow2 and ow3 were each less than 100 ms m an obvious change shown in fig 9 b was that ow2 presented a high ec value after the 2 m3 oxidant injection and only ow1 and ow2 were included in this higher ec area interestingly the high ec value for ow2 disappeared suddenly after the 3 m3 oxidant injection as shown in fig 9 c the distribution area of the injectate decreased significantly but it extended slightly toward ow4 and ow2 than that of in fig 9 a fig 9 d shows that the distribution of the injectate changed very slightly after the 4 m3 oxidant injection the injectate was only distributed at around ow1 and the iw by assessing table 4 and fig 9 the ec values measured from the observation wells showed some unreasonable and unexpected results the drastic change in the ec value of the ow2 well and the minor change in the other five wells cannot describe the flow behavior around the iw a maximum ec value was not observed at the depth at which the jetting head was fixed which indicated that the radial flow behavior did not occur during this pilot test moreover figs 9 a 9 c and 9 d show that both the distribution areas and ec increments of the plumes were small in the entire test site these results also cannot describe the mass balance of the injectate in this pilot test however they might imply that the injectate was distributed completely outside the areas of the six observation wells these results might also imply that non steady flow behavior and some preferential flow occurred during the injection procedure it also revealed the difficulty in describing the flow behavior and distribution of the injectate according to the data obtained from these six observation wells in other words these results revealed that the groundwater monitoring in these six observation wells could not offer the real distribution or flow behavior of the injectate in this pilot study 4 2 comparison of direct push ec logging with groundwater sample analysis in this pilot study seven direct push ec loggings were first obtained within a 10 m 10 m area and used to evaluate the possible hydrogeological conditions of the test site as shown in fig 10 higher ec values generally reflect a fine grained material brown zone in fig 10 whereas lower values indicate coarser sediments blue zone in fig 10 schulmeister et al 2003 the observation wells were installed mainly along the low ec area coarse grained area of this test site however the distribution of ec values of the groundwater samples as shown in fig 9 presented considerably different results from the direct push ec loggings the expected flow pattern from the iw toward ow5 was not observed in this pilot study and only an insignificant change in ec value was observed at ow1 the sampling data of ow3 and ow5 did not present any distinguishable changes during the oxidant injection test however a high ec value was observed at ow2 and this observation well was located at a so called fine grained area this result indicated that the data from seven direct push ec loggings in this study could not be used to predict the possible distribution of injectate or we can say that the seven direct push ec loggings did not provide sufficient data to quantify the possible distribution and flow behavior of the injectate the reason might be because of the complicated heterogeneous media in this test site therefore the heterogeneity in the aquifer caused some unexpected results in the flow behavior during the oxidant injection 4 3 relative differences in magnetic field strength between pre and post injection under the output voltage of 200 v the output electric current was 0 205 a during the pre injection background survey because of the continuous injection of the high ec solution in this test the ec of the aquifer between the two electrodes increased gradually altering the output current values under the fixed output voltage 200 v the current increased from 0 205 a to 0 210 a during the first pulse injection from 0 210 a to 0 213 a during the second pulse injection from 0 213 a to 0 216 a during the third pulse injection and from 0 216 a to 0 217 a during the fourth pulse injection eq 9 shows that a change in the horizontal observed magnetic field b obs h would indicate a change in the magnetic field generated by current flow in the aquifer b g when the current is controlled at a constant value moreover eq 3 and eq 4 show that the magnetic field strength generated by the current flow in the electrodes or the aquifer is proportional to the electric current intensity or current density to compare and estimate the survey results of the different injection rounds at the same electric current level the values of the magnetic field strength were modified first according to the current amplification ratio fig 11 shows the increments of the magnetic field strength δb between pre injection and post injection of every injection round following the definition for the lowest distinguishable signal mentioned above we used a value of 0 0008 mg as the lowest distinguishable value and the contour interval as shown in fig 11 fig 11 a shows an image of injectate distribution after the 1 m3 oxidant injection there were three main zones with increasing magnetic field strength the first was near the coordinate 2 4 the second one was at ow2 and the third was next to the second one and distributed between 7 7 and 6 9 the plume at ow2 showed a greater increase in magnetic field strength but the increment was only approximately 0 002 mg fig 11 a also reveals that the injectate did not flow from the iw radially instead of flowing to the nearest observation well ow1 the injectate flowed to some farther areas such as the three plumes shown in fig 11 a there might have been some unobvious preferential pathways that led the injectate from iw to these three plumes according to the results shown in fig 11 a after the 2 m3 oxidant injection five main plumes exhibited increasing magnetic field strength as shown in fig 11 b the first one was distributed near ow4 and at 1 3 the second was at 2 1 the third was at 0 9 the fourth was at 0 9 and the fifth was distributed from 6 2 to 6 10 among these five plumes the most notable plume was the fifth which was evidently a result of the continuous accumulation and expansion of the plume around ow2 by comparing with fig 11 a the locations with greater increments in magnetic field were at 7 5 and 6 9 and their corresponding increments were 0 0028 mg and 0 0032 mg this result revealed that the injectate continued to flow to this area during the second pulse injection the plumes at 0 9 and 2 10 also showed evident increases in magnetic field strength with maximum values of 0 0027 mg and 0 0028 mg respectively this result indicated that some injectate flowed to and accumulated at these areas the two plumes did not exist after the first pulse injection and thus there might have been some unobvious preferential pathways that led the injectate from the iw to these two areas the plumes at 1 4 and 2 1 did not show significant increases in magnetic field their increments were only 0 0013 mg fig 11 c shows a significant change after the 3 m3 oxidant injection the plumes at 0 9 and 2 10 clearly expanded in these areas with maximum increments of 0 0032 mg and 0 0033 mg respectively these results reveal that the injectate flowed continuously to and accumulated in these areas during the third pulse injection however fig 11 c does not show any pathway that may have led the injectate from the iw to these areas an interesting phenomenon occurred after the 3 m3 oxidant injection the long banded plume at ow2 in fig 11 b was torn into three pieces the big one was located at 6 8 with a maximum increment of 0 0041 mg and the other two were located at 9 3 and 7 2 respectively with maximum increments of 0 0033 mg and 0 0010 mg respectively the results reveal that this plume was atrophic during the third pulse injection and they might imply that the preferential pathway from the iw to this area was terminated fig 11 c also shows four plumes at 0 3 0 5 2 1 and 3 4 the plumes at 3 4 and 0 5 indicate significant increases in magnetic field with increments of 0 0032 mg and 0 0024 mg respectively the other two plumes are small in area and their increments are only 0 0012 mg even so this result also reveals that there were some flow pathways in this area to move the plumes and change the distribution of the injectate after the 4 m3 oxidant injection a great plume formed between ow3 and ow4 but its maximum increment was only 0 0018 mg as shown in fig 11 d this result revealed that the injectate flowed from the iw and was then distributed in this area the most significant change occurred after the fourth pulse injection two plumes located at 9 3 and 7 2 expanded during the fourth pulse injection with maximum increments of 0 0024 mg and 0 0015 mg respectively the increase in magnetic field was very obviously in the zone of the y 5 half plate which might imply that the injected oxidant flowed mainly to this zone during this pulse injection however fig 11 d shows an atrophic and split result in these plumes in the zone of the y 5 half plate the plume at 9 0 was atrophic and split into two plumes one at 9 0 with a maximum increment of 0 0028 mg and the other at 2 10 with a maximum increment of 0 0049 mg although their areas decreased the magnetic increment at 2 10 increased from 0 0033 mg to 0 0049 mg fig 11 c shows that the plume at 6 8 moved slightly to 6 9 and split into two plumes the plume located at 6 9 had a maximum magnetic increment of 0 0036 mg and the other one located at 6 6 had a maximum magnetic increment of 0 0024 mg this atrophic and split phenomenon might indicate that the flow pathways from the iw to these plumes were probably terminated during the fourth pulse injection 4 4 comparison of magnetic field survey with groundwater sample analysis to further study the relationship between the results of the magnetic field survey and the ec measurements of the groundwater the ec increments δec of the six observation wells at the four pulse injection stages and their corresponding magnetic increments δb are listed in table 5 the δb values of ow3 ow4 ow5 and owb were less than 0 0008 mg indicating that the injectate did not distribute at these four observation wells during the entire pilot injection test the ec measurement of the groundwater samples validated this result as the δec values of ow3 ow4 ow5 and owb were less than 107 ms m the change in the magnetic field strength of ow2 was very significant its magnetic increment increased to 0 0024 mg after the 1 m3 oxidant injection and to 0 0030 mg after the 2 m3 oxidant injection however it decreased suddenly to less than 0 0008 mg after the 3 and 4 m3 oxidant injections identically the ec measurements of ow2 showed a significant change too its ec value did not show a distinguishable change after the 1 m3 oxidant injection but it increased quickly to 1520 ms m after the 2 m3 oxidant injection then the ec increment decreased suddenly to less than 107 ms m after the 3 and 4 m3 oxidant injections except for the data measured during the first pulse injection both the ec measurement and magnetic survey at ow2 presented a same change trend the reason for the difference after the first pulse injection might have been because the injected oxidant flowed near ow2 but did not reach it and therefore the magnetic senor sensed the signal but the ec measurement did not show a distinguishable change image of magnetic surveys with a slightly inflated outline have been reported chen et al 2002 dentith mudge 2014 li oldenburg 1996 tsai et al 2020 the magnetic field increment obtained from a magnetic survey is the sum of the horizontal magnetic components generated by the current flow in the aquifer hence not only the magnetic signal directly below this sensor but also surrounding signals enter this sensor illustrated as sensor 1 in fig 12 also a sensor outside but near a zone with high current density also receives some magnetic signals from this high current density zone illustrated as sensor 2 in fig 12 this phenomenon of the magnetic survey would cause the results of ow2 in the first pulse injection during the pilot injection test the increase in the magnetic field strength of ow1 was less than the lowest distinguishable signal of 0 0008 mg and thus it could be regarded as no oxidant distribution however the ec measurements of the groundwater samples showed different results table 5 shows that the ec increments of the groundwater samples remained at about 200 ms m after oxidant injection by comparing these results with the ec value of the injected oxidant it was revealed that only a small amount of oxidant flowed to ow1 and was diluted by groundwater during the first pulse injection the oxidant then remained in the void around ow1 throughout the pilot test although different results are shown between the magnetic survey and groundwater ec measurement in table 5 the increases in groundwater ec were approximately 200 ms m and their increments were not high the sensitivity of the magnetic survey was estimated by both the magnetic increment and the groundwater ec increment during the pilot test according to table 5 the maximum values were 0 0030 mg and 1520 ms m respectively at ow2 after the second pulse injection which indicates that the sensitivity of the magnetic survey was 405 3 ms m per 0 0008 mg thus the magnetic survey would obtain an effective δb value when δec was greater than 405 3 ms m this result could explain why the small amount of injected oxidant could be detected by ec meter but not by the magnetic survey in summary we compared the results of both the magnetic survey and the groundwater ec measurement using 24 sets of data during the pilot study in addition to the influences of the physical characteristics and sensitivity of the magnetic survey the magnetic survey showed the same trend as the groundwater ec measurement the ec monitoring results in the six observation wells thus roughly validated the results of the magnetic survey in this pilot test 4 5 the possible distribution and flow behavior during the pilot test 4 5 1 assessment from ec data of the six observation wells in this study we installed six observation wells according to probable flow pathway as shown in fig 10 obtained from the evaluation of hydrogeology ow3 ow4 ow5 and owb showed no effective change in the ec value of the groundwater sample ow1 showed a slight change after the oxidant injection and it maintained this increment throughout the injection test only ow2 showed ec values of 3290 ms m and 706 ms m at depths of 2 3 m and 3 4 m respectively after the 2 m3 oxidant injection and the ec value returned to the normal local groundwater quality after the 3 m3 oxidant injection because the ec value of the injected oxidant solution was 6370 ms m and the injected depth was limited to a depth of 3 2 3 7 m by packers the ec data of the observation wells showed that the injected oxidant flowed upward to the groundwater surface and toward ow2 during the first 2 m3 oxidant injection however the injectate could not be detected by the six observation wells after the next 2 m3 oxidant injection according to data obtained from these six observation wells we could neither describe the distribution of the injected oxidant nor present clearly the variation of the flow behavior during the injection test because there were only six observation wells on this test site of 100 m2 the information obtained was incomplete for investigating the distribution and flow behavior of the injected oxidant during isco particularly because of the heterogeneity in aquifers an irregular or dispersed distribution of the injectate has been observed in some real sites during isco cave et al 2007 tildy et al 2017 to enhance the monitoring resolution and offer sufficient and useful data it will be necessary to install many more observation wells in an isco site if the traditional monitoring method is used 4 5 2 assessment from magnetic field data of the 121 survey grid points the distribution image of the injected oxidant was plotted according to the magnetic data of the 121 survey grid points within the test site the possible flowlines were plotted according to plume shape and the relative locations of the plumes to the iw the results are shown in fig 13 the figure also shows the main and minor flowlines according to the increments of the magnetic amount of plumes these increments are shown in fig 14 in this study the magnetic amount was the result of the integral of the magnetic increment and the area of the plume according to fig 14 plume 1 shows a much greater increment in total magnetic amount after the first and second pulse injections and so the flowline from the iw to plume 1 should be the main flowline the other flowlines are labeled as minor flowlines because their corresponding plumes showed smaller increases in the total magnetic amount plume 2 shows a greater increment in magnetic amount after the third pulse injection so its corresponding flowline was labeled as a main flowline finally after the fourth pulse injection plume 3 and plume 4 both showed a greater increment in magnetic field and thus they too were labeled as main flowlines fig 13 shows that the injected oxidant did not flow in a radial form and that the preferential flow pathways were generated from the iw these preferential pathways might not have been significant enough to be detected by the magnetic sensor under the resolution of 1 m 1 m however they became the main pathways allowing the injected oxidant to flow from the iw to some zones with higher permeability and to accumulate in these zones forming the plumes shown in figs 11 and 13 fig 13 also shows that these plumes and flowlines changed dynamically with injection volume in addition to the fact that the heterogeneity in the aquifer might change the flowlines of the injectate it has been reported that a pulsed injection could also change the flowlines of the injectate heron et al 2002 johnson et al 1997 rutherford johnson 1996 although this phenomenon was observed and discussed in the field of gas water interface the flow channels of the injectate may collapse when the injector is turned off and the pressure is decreased this phenomenon would cause new flowlines to form during the next pulse injection accordingly the change in flowlines would influence the change in the volume of the plumes fig 13 shows the increase and decrease of the injectate plumes at different injection stages the limited ec data of six observation wells showed trends of flow behavior similar to those shown in fig 13 and validated part of the change in flow behavior obtained from magnetic data however the results of the magnetic survey can show the distribution of injected oxidant in detail such that the flowlines and flow behavior can be estimated to further evaluate the reasonableness of these magnetic data the total area and total magnetic amount of the plumes after each pulse injection were estimated and the results are shown in fig 15 the total area of the plumes increased linearly r2 0 9533 with increasing injection volume of oxidant the areas of the oxidant plumes estimated according to the magnetic survey showed good linear correlation with the injection volume because the magnetic increment of each grid point was not uniform in an injectate plume it should be related to the concentration of oxidant by combining both the magnetic increment and the area of the plume the total magnetic amount showed better linear correlation r2 0 9731 with the injection volume therefore fig 15 shows that the plumes of the injected oxidant estimated by the magnetic survey could also conform to the concept of mass balance by comparing the plumes with the injection volume of oxidant 4 6 the second pilot test low pressure injection method 4 6 1 methods and materials to present a more solid result in addition to the pilot test of the high pressure injection method mentioned above one week before that another pilot test of low pressure injection was conducted in the low pressure injection test the solution was gravity fed into the iw with a hydraulic head of approximately 1 8 m of the 1 sodium persulfate solution the injection location was at a depth of 3 5 m the injection flow rate was approximately 29 l min under this operation during the time interval of the two pilot tests the groundwater outside but near the test site was pumped out and injected into the iw to flush away the injected sodium persulfate the procedure of the low pressure injection test which combined the traditional well monitoring method and the magnetic survey technology was the same as that of the high pressure injection test before the injection procedure and after each pulse injection both the groundwater ec values of the six observation wells and the magnetic field intensities of 121 survey grid points were measured respectively the voltage and the frequency of the ac power source were set at 200 v and 447 hz respectively as that of using in the high pressure injection test according to the loq estimation we used a value of 0 0008 mg to be the lowest detectable value to present differences in magnetic field strength between pre and post injection too 4 6 2 test results the figures and tables of the second pilot test are detailed in supporting information si fig s1 shows the increments of the magnetic field strength δb between pre injection and post injection of every injection round table s1 presents the ec values of the groundwater samples for the six ows during the low pressure injection test the comparison of the increments of groundwater ec and magnetic field at various ows and injection stages are shown in table s2 to further evaluate the reasonableness of these magnetic data the total area and total magnetic amount of the plumes after each pulse injection were estimated too and the results are shown in fig s2 these results also show a good correlation between the measurements of both mmr and electrical conductivity of groundwater moreover the plumes of the injected oxidant estimated by the magnetic survey could also conform to the concept of mass balance by comparing the plumes with the injection volume of the oxidant 4 7 limitation of magnetic field survey technology 4 7 1 influence of physical characteristics of magnetic field magnetic field survey technology was successfully applied to this pilot injection test by way of the magnetic field survey conducted before and after the oxidant injection the interference caused by both the soil type and the heterogeneity of the aquifer were removed completely and showed the change in groundwater quality only because this technology is based on the current flow pattern in an aquifer it obtains the current density or distribution in the aquifer by measuring the corresponding distribution of the magnetic field hence the physical characteristics of a magnetic survey should be understood when the magnetic data are used to estimate the injectate distribution and its possible flowlines there were two magnetic phenomena observed in this study the first one was that the predicted zone obtained by magnetic survey was slightly greater than the true zone therefore when the injected oxidant flowed near ow2 without touching it an increased magnetic signal was received at the ow2 survey point during our pilot test the second phenomenon was that the magnetic survey was not sensitive to the electrolyte concentration as mentioned above the sensitivity of the magnetic survey was estimated by the measured data in this pilot test and it was found to be 405 3 ms m per 0 0008 mg this value revealed that the magnetic survey obtained an effective value in δb when the δec was greater than 405 3 ms m this is the reason why the ec increments of about 200 ms m in ow1 were not detected by the magnetic field survey because of the low sensitivity of the magnetic survey the ec value of the injected oxidant is an important key to successfully applying this magnetic survey technology in estimating the distribution of the injected oxidant the ec value of the injected oxidant should be several times greater than that of the groundwater of the site in this study the ec values of the injected oxidant and groundwater were 6370 ms m and 489 ms m respectively they were a ratio of about 13 1 4 7 2 limitation from the survey depth the limitation of the magnetic field survey technology in terms of depth also is a matter of concern when applying this technology the flow field of electric current is generated at the depth of interest and the magnetic field intensity on the ground is measured according to eq 4 and fig 3 the detected value of the resulting magnetic field is related to both the electric current and the depth of the current flowline because this study suggests using the loq of the measurement system as an acceptable resolution in the magnetic monitoring of isco the suitable current intensity and flowline depth should be taken into consideration when the monitoring work of the magnetic survey is designed a weak magnetic signal will result in poor sensitivity and resolution during the isco according to the biot savart law for current flow fig 16 shows the relationship between the electric current the corresponding theoretical depth and the magnetic intensity when the observation point p is on the line connecting the two electrodes accordingly if the magnetic monitoring is conducted at an isco site with a greater injection depth in order to obtain sufficient sensitivity for the magnetic survey a higher current intensity should be injected into the aquifer 5 conclusions in this study we referenced the mmr method and used the applied electric current flow pattern and the generated magnetic field to estimate the injectate distribution of isco the pilot test was conducted to observe the flow behaviors and distributions of the injectate in an aquifer during oxidant injection except for the hydrogeological investigation by direct push ec logging both the magnetic field survey and the groundwater measurement of electrical conductivity were conducted on a test site measuring 10 m 10 m in the traditional method observation wells were installed according to the degree of difficulty of injectate transportation which was evaluated using the seven direct push ec logging data however the ec data of the observation wells could neither depict clearly the distribution of the injected oxidant nor explain the flow behavior of injectate the possible reason was that the six observation wells within a site of 100 m2 presented a poor resolution in image drawing so the insufficient data made it difficult to quantify the distribution and flow of the injected sodium persulfate not to mention the reasons for the abnormal changes in the ec of the observation wells the magnetic survey method with 121 survey grid points resulted in images of plumes with effective magnetic increments these zones of magnetic increase should be related to the increase in ec although the physical properties of magnetic survey slightly affected the accuracy of the survey results for the true area the result of the magnetic survey presented an approximate distribution of injected oxidant the corresponding magnetic data at the six observation wells presented the same trend as the ec data of the groundwater moreover the total magnetic amounts of the plumes in each injection stage showed a good linear relationship with the injected volume according to the results in this pilot test the magnetic survey showed the distribution of injected oxidant for different injection stages as well as the possible preferential pathways and the flow behavior the flow behavior of the injected oxidant was changeable in the aquifer the injected oxidant flowed upward first to the groundwater surface then flowed preferentially to and accumulated around zones with higher permeability the preferential pathways that flowed from the iw were not detected during this test these preferential pathways might not have been significant enough to be detected by the magnetic sensor under the resolution of 1 m 1 m also it was probably because of heterogeneity of the aquifer or the disturbance of pulse injection that the preferential pathways changed with changing injected volume thus altering the area and volume of the plumes in summary this study successfully applied the mmr method for monitoring the distribution of injected oxidant during isco although the extra drilling and sampling could not be conducted during the injection stages due to a continuous process in this pilot test the magnetic data were validated well by the groundwater samples of six observation wells and the mass balance of the total magnetic amount of plumes however the magnetic distribution was related to the distribution of the electric current density further the current flow line or current density was affected not only by the distribution of conductivity but also by the geometry of the oxidant plumes the irregularly shaped distribution or plume such as the ring shape of oxidant in the aquifer generally causes an incorrect evaluation result of concentration distribution moreover as mentioned previously temperature chemical reaction and electromagnetic properties will probably be the reasons for causing a variation in the electrical conductivity of a local aquifer therefore the magnetic data cannot be used to quantitatively evaluate the concentration of oxidant solution in an aquifer declaration of competing interest the authors

1439,in situ chemical oxidation isco can remove pollutants efficiently however the most important key to successfully conducting isco on site is to place the oxidant in close contact with the contaminant therefore monitoring tools that provide for enhanced tracking of the injectate offer considerable benefit to guide subsequent isco injections in this study we applied the magnetometric resistivity mmr method to survey the distribution of an injected oxidant a pilot test was conducted on a 10 m 10 m site and the sodium persulfate injection involved four pulse injections from one injection well a magnetic field survey coupled with conventional monitoring was performed before the initial injection and after each pulse injection the results of this study showed that groundwater samples from six observation wells and seven direct push ec loggings did not provide sufficient data to quantify the distribution and flow behavior of the injected oxidant however the magnetic field survey visually showed the dynamic distribution of the injected oxidant and the flow pathways and flow behavior were assessed accordingly although the flow behavior of injected solution was changeable in the aquifer but the magnetic field survey combined with the monitoring of the well samples helped to explain the abnormal changes in the electrical conductivity of the observation wells and supports the use of the magnetic field survey technology as a method of monitoring isco injections keywords mmr magnetic survey current density electrical conductivity isco pilot test 1 introduction with increasing global industrialization groundwater contamination has become increasingly serious the organic contamination which endangers the environment and human health has been a concern for decades among the commonly used soil and groundwater remediation methods in situ chemical oxidation isco can solve the problem of deep soil and groundwater contamination while avoiding some problems e g secondary pollution gomes et al 2013 and is a rapid and effective method that can transform a wide spectrum of contaminants into harmless substances such as chloride ions carbon dioxide and water carey et al 1979 morillo et al 2007 wu et al 2011 sun et al 2014 or into more biodegradable products itrc 2005 krembs et al 2010 tsitonaki et al 2010 siegrist et al 2011 isco is a method of delivering chemical oxidants into the contaminated regions to decompose the pollutants although the chemical oxidants show strong oxidation to contaminants the most important key for successful isco operation on site is whether these oxidants can be delivered uniformly to the targeted contaminated zone or not many engineers usually assume that the injected oxidant solution spreads radially from the injection well krembs 2008 piscopo et al 2016 ross and adrian 1989 in fact the flow behavior of the injected solution is strongly dependent on the subsurface conditions and particularly on the spatial distribution of the hydraulic conductivity previous studies have shown that a zone with high hydraulic conductivity is usually the zone of the chemical oxidant distribution allen king et al 1998 cave et al 2007 to improve our understanding of how the oxidant solution migrates in the saturated zone and how to efficiently remediate contaminated zones it is necessary to carry out detailed monitoring of the distribution of the oxidant solution traditional groundwater sampling methods cannot provide sufficient data because of the limited number of monitoring wells on site moreover conducting a large number of sample analyses on site is expensive and time consuming numerical simulation methods cannot provide correct data because of the insufficient hydrogeological information obtained from the site in addition to the methods mentioned above surface geophysical technologies such as seismic ground penetrating radar gpr electrical resistivity technology ert and electromagnetic em surveys have been applied to soil sciences for a long time these technologies may provide information regarding anthropogenic pathways buried sources of contamination or preferential flow pathways the general principle of geophysical exploration is to non invasively collect data on the medium under investigation scollar et al 1990 these geophysical methods can provide more sufficient indirect data of oxidant distribution at a lower cost for an isco site among these surface geophysical technologies seismic surveys and gpr cannot be used to survey water soluble oxidants because of the lack of an effective reflective surface em surveys are used as a borehole logging or well monitoring tool ert is the most used technology among all these geophysical technologies because it is sensitive to variations in conductivity various laboratory studies have shown that the injection of permanganate and the oxidation of trichloroethylene tce increase the bulk conductivity which is then detectable through a resistivity measurement harte et al 2012 hort et al 2014 hort et al 2015 moreover field studies have shown evident changes in bulk resistivity around the oxidant injection point and thus ert could successfully monitor the flow pattern of the injected solution chambers et al 2010 halihan et al 2012 harte et al 2012 tildy et al 2017 chambers et al 2010 reported the observation of a preferential pathway during the injection process halihan et al 2012 reported that the injected solution did not follow the hydraulic gradient and flow to the monitoring wells because the act of injecting the solution altered the hydraulic gradient because of the complex changeable and unpredictable flow patterns usually observed during in situ chemical oxidant injection it is difficult to monitor the distribution of the oxidant using pre set monitoring wells therefore geophysical methods can play a significant role in investigating the injected oxidant distribution and movement over time however only a few articles have reported the application of geophysical methods to the estimation of the distribution of a chemical oxidant the most used technology ert usually presents the survey results as a two dimensional 2d image of a vertical slice through the area being surveyed although researchers can certainly present three dimensional 3d images by conducting multiple survey lines this would result in increased costs the magnetometric resistivity mmr method is a less well known method with mmr a low frequency electrical current frequency 1 khz is injected into the ground between two electrodes and the resulting magnetic field is measured a 2d image of the horizontal profile is generated according to the measured data distributed on the ground which could be used to mitigate the deficiencies of ert this method was initially proposed by jakosky 1933 and then refined by other researchers nabighian 1991a 1991b with the purpose of determining the electrical conductivity of the earth edwards 1974 because the mmr method is sensitive to the current that is concentrated within a conductive body it was usually used to explore mineral resources and abnormal structures identify preferential groundwater flow paths and detect reservoir leakages edwards howel 1976 jessop et al 2018 trevino edwards 1979 zou et al 2019 accordingly applying the mmr method in isco should be helpful in monitoring the oxidant flow pattern and evaluating the efficacy of isco in a fast effective and inexpensive way for the present research we performed a pilot study of chemical oxidant injection both a magnetic field survey and groundwater sampling were conducted to compare and verify the results of this geophysical technology the spatial and temporal spread of the injectate during the injection process was identified using geophysical time series surveys the aim of this study was to apply the mmr method to estimate the distribution of the injectate during chemical oxidant injection the main contribution of this study is to attain a rapid convenient and low cost technology that requires the application of an electrical current and the survey of its resulting magnetic field to facilitate monitoring during isco 2 theoretical background 2 1 conceptual model of magnetometric resistivity for a surface mmr set up electrodes are embedded in the ground and an electric current is injected through the vadose zone to the groundwater table a magnetic field sensor then measures each component of the magnetic field fig 1 the magnetic field is caused by currents that flow in the ground b g in the electrodes b a and b b and in the wire b 1 b 2 and b 3 without consideration of various noises the observed magnetic field b obs can be denoted by 1 b obs b 1 b 2 b 3 b a b b b g where b a is the magnetic field from electrode a b b is the magnetic field from electrode b and b 1 b 2 and b 3 are the magnetic fields from wire 1 wire 2 and wire 3 respectively for an observed point p the components of the magnetic field are shown in fig 2 the magnetic fields b a b b and b g are parallel to the ground and b 1 b 2 and b 3 are normal to the ground in this study we wanted to assess the distribution of the injectate in the aquifer and so the horizontal magnetic field is what we are concerned with the horizontal observed magnetic field b obs h can be denoted by 2 b ob s h b a b b b g 2 2 magnetic field on the ground surface generated by current flowing in an electrode suppose current electrodes a and b separated by distance l are embedded in flat earth that has uniform conductivity at the coordinates 0 l 2 0 and 0 l 2 0 respectively and that they are supplied with a stable current of strength i from a power supply through two horizontal wires the groundwater table is at depth d p is an observed point with coordinates x y 0 as shown in fig 3 the field generated by the current flow in the aquifer depends on the distribution of current in the aquifer edwards et al 1978 jessop et al 2018 the magnetic field generated by the current flow through the ground electrode to aquifer can be obtained from the biot savart law and is expressed as follows chen et al 2002 edwards 1974 3 b electrode x b a x b b x 0 d d b a l 2 y r a 0 d d b b l 2 y r b μ 0 i 4 π 0 d sin α r a 2 d s a l 2 y r a μ 0 i 4 π 0 d sin β r b 2 d s b l 2 y r b where b electrode x is the observed magnetic field in the x direction generated by the current flow in the two electrodes b a x is the magnetic field in the x direction generated by the current flow in electrode a b b x is the magnetic field in the x direction generated by the current flow in electrode b r a and r b are the distances from p to electrodes a and b respectively r a and r b are the distances from p to wire elements ds a and ds b respectively α is the angle between r a and d s a and β is the angle between r b and d s b 2 3 magnetic field on the ground surface generated by a current flowing in aquifer the current flowing in an aquifer is not like that in a wire because the entire the aquifer acts as a conductor and thus the current flow is dispersed in the aquifer in deriving the magnetic fields due to current flow in the ground edwards et al 1978 used a modified biot savart law for solenoidal current flow to express the magnetic field b r of point p r that is external to a volume v containing a distribution of current elements j r dv as follows 4 b r μ 4 π v j r r r dv everywhere within the earth for an electric current we may define an electric potential u r related to j r through the local conductivity σ r by 5 j r σ r u r using the vector identity mentioned earlier and observing that ϕ 0 we obtain the final expression 6 b r μ 4 π v u r σ r r r dv from eq 6 we find that the magnetic survey method is sensitive to the gradient of the electrical conductivity distribution if the injectate distribution is characterized by an evident change in the electrical conductivity with the surrounding material it will be detectable through the magnetic measurements 2 4 computing magnetic data for magnetic survey during oxidant injection in an electric field system if the groundwater quality of a zone is changed by an injected oxidant its electrical conductivity will change and in turn its current density will be altered we assume that the observed horizontal magnetic fields are b obs h and b obs h for the pre and post injection respectively 7 b obs h b a b b b g where b a and b b are the magnetic fields generated by the current flow in electrodes a and b respectively after the oxidant injection b g is a magnetic field generated by current flow in the aquifer after the oxidant injection the change in horizontal magnetic field is given as b obs h b obs h b obs h b a b b b g b a b b b g 8 b a b a b b b b b g b g when the injected current is controlled to be a constant the magnetic field from each electrode will also be constant b a b a b b b b b obs h can thus be expressed as 9 b obs h b g b g b g the change in the horizontal observed magnetic field b obs h would be the change in magnetic field generated by current flow in the aquifer b g according to eq 6 if the magnetic survey is conducted immediately under a controlled condition before and after the isco the variations in electric potential and survey depth would be minor the major reason for the change in the magnetic field b g should be the change in the electrical conductivity of the aquifer 3 methods and materials 3 1 site description the pilot injection study was conducted at a site measuring 10 m 10 m on uncontaminated private farmland located in the southern changhua county taiwan fig 4 the borehole logs showed that the main soil type was fine grained sand above the depth of 2 m fine grained sand and silt in the depth range of 2 6 m and silt in the depth range of 6 8 m soil cores were collected using direct push geoprobe model 6620dt the groundwater table was approximately 2 2 m below the ground surface during the pilot study the direct push electrical conductivity ec method was used before installing the observation wells to evaluate the possible flow direction of the injectate the direct push ec profiles of seven push locations m1 to m7 are shown in fig 5 it has been reported that the ec of unconsolidated materials is a function of the moisture content of the material and the conducting properties of the pore fluids and sediments schon 1996 the variation in groundwater chemistry is usually small inside an area and the ec is mainly controlled by the differences in sediment size and type keys 1990 therefore the ec associated with sedimentary materials should vary with particle size and mineral species the relationship between ec values and the particle size of a material was reported by schulmeister et al 2003 by comparing the direct push ec logs with various types of hydrogeological data the authors demonstrated that higher ec values generally reflect a fine grained material whereas lower values indicate coarser sediments according to the ec profiles shown in fig 5 and the ec values presented in table 1 the average electrical conductivity of m1 m4 in ascending order was as follows m3 m4 m1 m2 thus the resistance of the fluid flow from the injection well iw or m5 in ascending order was as follows m3 m4 m1 m2 direct push ec logging of m6 and m7 was conducted after the analysis of m1 m4 to further estimate the possible flow pathway of the injectate m6 showed coarser media and lower resistance than m7 in the depth range of 2 5 3 7 m on the basis of these results from ec logging the direction of m5 to m6 was set as the main possible flow direction of the injectate the directions of m5 to ow2 and m7 were set as the second and the third possible flow directions of the injectate respectively and the locations of the observation wells were set up accordingly 3 2 construction and installation of monitoring network one iw and six observation wells were installed in the field of the pilot study the iw was installed at 5 5 and ow1 ow2 ow3 ow4 ow5 and owb were installed at 5 4 7 5 5 2 1 5 5 0 and 5 10 respectively the related positions of these seven wells are shown in fig 4 the iw was drilled to 6 m and the well casings were constructed of 4 in i d schedule 40 pvc pipe and screened from approximately 1 5 m to 6 m the observation wells ow1 ow2 ow3 ow4 ow5 and owb were drilled to 6 m as well and were constructed of 1 in schedule 40 pvc casing and screened from 1 5 m to 6 m fig 4 also shows the locations of the two electrodes and the survey grid for the pilot injection study the stainless steel electrodes electrode 1 and electrode 2 with diameters of 0 6 cm and lengths of 15 cm were embedded in the ground an automatic watering device containing a 2 sodium chloride solution was installed next to the electrodes to help the electrodes maintain electrical contact with the soil mass and to lead the injected current downward to the groundwater after the environmental interference scanning the voltage and the frequency of the ac power source 6605 extech electronics co were set at 200 v and 447 hz respectively and the corresponding output electric current was initially around 0 2 a the number of magnetic field survey points was 121 and the spacing between the magnetic field survey points was 1 0 m the magnetic field sensor of the measurement system surveyed every grid point at the ground level 3 3 chemical oxidant solution preparation and injection procedure sodium persulfate na2s2o8 was selected to be the oxidant in this pilot study because of its increasing use for the isco of organic contaminants in groundwater the ec and oxidation reduction potential orp were tested in the laboratory before the injection procedure table 2 shows the ec and orp values of different concentrations of na2s2o8 and the ec data showed a better linear relationship in this study therefore we decided to use a 1 sodium persulfate solution as the injected chemical oxidant solution and we measured the ec values to monitor the delivery of the injectate the high pressure injection method was used in this pilot study it consisted of a high pressure jetting head a pressure tube a pressure control device a pump and two well packers the jetting head was fixed and limited at a depth of 3 2 3 7 m by the well packers and the injected solution entered the aquifer only in this interval the injection flow rate was approximately 37 l min under a controllable injection pressure of less than 0 86 kg cm2 instead of a continuous injection mode a pulse injection mode with four pulses p1 p2 p3 and p4 was used in this pilot test in all 4 m3 of the 1 sodium persulfate solution was injected into the aquifer in other words the injected volume was 1 m3 for each pulse the pilot test was conducted on september 26 2018 3 4 measurement system the groundwater ec values of the six observation wells were sampled and measured on site after each pulse injection by a portable conductivity meter wtw model cond 3210 wissenschaftlich technische werkstätten gmbh germany to monitor the delivery of s2o8 2 in each observation well a teflon bailer with a 0 5 in o d and 36 in length with double check valves was used to sample the groundwater of different depth intervals 2 0 3 0 m and 3 0 4 0 m from the observation wells the magnetic field survey was conducted on the 121 survey grid points of the test site fig 4 after each pulse injection the survey system was designed to measure the magnetic field strength generated by the ac electrical current of the set frequency flowing between the two electrodes hence this system included a three axis magnetic field sensor em 2 elisha technology co a data acquisition device ni 9230 national instruments and a tablet with the data calculation and analysis software ngst elisha technology co the magnetic field strength was detected and an analog signal was exported to the data acquisition device the analog signal was converted into a digital signal and transferred to the tablet to perform the analysis the internal noise of the magnetic field survey system used in this study was reported to be less than 0 0002 mg to avoid an overestimation in this pilot study it was necessary to statistically determine the detection limit and the confidence interval of the measurement system the method detection limit mdl is the minimum signal that can be measured and reported with 99 confidence that the analyte magnitude is greater than zero the mdl procedure has been criticized in the literature gibbons 1996 but it is the best available method for laboratory certification moreover the lower limit of quantitation loq is the level above which quantitative results may be obtained with a specified degree of confidence the loq is mathematically defined as being equal to 10 times the standard deviation of the results for a series of replicates used to determine a justifiable limit of detection ripp 1996 this study applied the mdl and loq procedures to estimate the results from the magnetic field survey system at the specified confidence level blank measurements were conducted before establishing the magnetic field on the test site table 3 shows the values and the statistical results of the 16 magnetic field measurements the mean was 0 00055 mg and the sample standard deviation was 0 00008 mg the mdl was calculated as follows 10 mdl sample standard deviation t n 1 1 a 0 99 here t n 1 1 a 0 99 is student s t value appropriate for the 99 confidence level the t value for the 16 replicates was 2 947 and the corresponding calculated mdl was 0 00024 mg the loq was also calculated and was 0 00080 mg the loq showed a greater and more reliable value than mdl and thus the loq was the lowest signal that could be determined with acceptable precision and accuracy under the stated conditions of the test therefore in this study we used a value of 0 0008 mg to be the lowest distinguishable value and the contour interval to present the differences in the magnetic field strength between pre injection and post injection 3 5 relationship between persulfate concentrations and mmr measurements in order to connect directly the persulfate concentrations and mmr measurements this study designed and conducted a series of small scale field tests on uncontaminated private farmland the topsoil of this site is composed of brown fine sand with a small amount of plant debris the stainless steel electrodes were embedded in the ground with a distance of 3 m and the input current was controlled at 0 2 a a one m ditch for persulfate solution infiltration with about 4 cm in diameter was set up in the middle and along the connection line of electrodes 20 l water with an electrical conductivity of 335 ms m was spread uniformly on the topsoil of a zone of 3 5 m 1 5 m the background mmr measurements were then performed on the measuring points of s01 to s20 the test was designed as shown in fig 6 after the background measurement the 0 2 sodium persulfate solution of 2 l was slowly filled in the ditch until the solution completely infiltrated the soil then the mmr measurements were performed again on the measuring points of s01 to s20 the changes of magnetic field intensity of the measuring points s01 to s20 after the sodium persulfate solution injection were noted as δm01 to δm20 the mean value of magnetic field change of the same row was calculated as below 11 l 1 average δm 01 δm 02 δm 03 δm 04 l 2 average δm 05 δm 06 δm 07 δm 08 l 3 average δm 09 δm 10 δm 11 δm 12 l 4 average δm 13 δm 14 δm 15 δm 16 l 5 average δm 17 δm 18 δm 19 δm 20 the values of l1 l2 l3 l4 and l5 of the field test of 0 2 sodium persulfate solution were shown in fig 7 besides the field tests of 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 of sodium persulfate solutions were conducted respectively on the different zones of this farmland their corresponding values of l1 l2 l3 l4 and l5 were also shown in fig 7 fig 7 shows the relationship between mmr measurements and the persulfate concentrations at different measuring locations the sodium persulfate solution which filled in the ditch was located at l3 also on the connection line of the two electrodes therefore the magnetic field intensity increases more obviously at l3 when the persulfate concentration is higher they are 0 0060 mg 0 0078 mg 0 0152 mg and 0 0172 mg for the persulfate concentrations of 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 respectively this result indicated that the higher persulfate concentration causes higher magnetic field intensity this was because the higher persulfate concentration offers a lower resistance pathway for the current and increases the current density at that area also some mmr measurements at the locations of l1 and l5 presented a negative value which also indicates that some electric current lines around l1 and l5 move out and reduce their current density and the generated magnetic field according to the results of the test mentioned above the higher concentration of persulfate in soil the greater the mmr measurement will be due to the electrical property of electrical conductivity 3 6 pilot test procedure this pilot test combined the traditional well monitoring method and the magnetic survey technology to estimate the distribution of the injectate during the oxidant injection the procedure for the pilot test included the following direct push ec logging injection and observation well installation magnetic field survey and ec measurement for the background four pulse injections and four magnetic field surveys and ec measurements p1 p2 p3 and p4 the detailed step content date and time of the pilot test are shown in fig 8 the time required for operating one pulse injection was approximately 30 40 min a complete round of both the groundwater ec measurement and the magnetic field survey took approximately 40 min in this pilot test 3 7 analysis of probably interference in the magnetic survey 3 7 1 temperature by conducting laboratory experiments on 30 samples of saline and alkaline soils campbell et al 1949 reported that electrical conductivity increases with temperature they also indicated that the conductivity increased by 2 02 per c in the range of 15 35 c bai et al 2013 conducted a laboratory test of compacted lateritic soil and presented an exponential relationship between electrical conductivity and temperature their findings revealed that the electrical conductivity increased gradually according to their soil samples and test device and electrical conductivity increased by approximately 24 when the temperature rose from 20 c to 30 c chemical oxidation reactions are exothermic and can raise the temperature of aquifer material and groundwater particularly when the oxidant concentration is high and reaction is fast mecozzi et al 2006 for safety reasons a controlled process with low concentrations of oxidant low temperature and restricted flow was generally performed in a contaminated site itrc 2005 moreover the oxidation reaction between injected oxidant and organic contaminant raised the temperature of the local aquifer and then increased the electrical conductivity of the corresponding zone this phenomenon will increase the increment of the measured ec and enhance the sensitivity of the magnetic survey this pilot test was conducted at an uncontaminated site but there might be some organic matter in the soil of the test site and would react with persulfate however fang et al 2018 studied the decomposition rates of persulfate by using soil with different amounts of organic matter the half life t1 2 of persulfate 5 g l decomposition in the soil with low organic matter is around 49 9 2 2 days to 77 5 1 2 days in this pilot test the depth of persulfate distribution is below 2 2 m where are usually a zone of lower soil organic matter and the total duration of the pilot test was less than 6 h therefore the reaction between persulfate and organic matter in this test should be very limited the groundwater temperature increased by the oxidization reaction should be very limited too moreover the temperature increased by the heating effect of an electric current can be estimated by joule s first law the groundwater temperature increment of the zone between two electrodes is less than 0 001 c under this pilot test condition hence the temperature rise effect in the magnetic survey could be neglected during the pilot injection test 3 7 2 electromagnetic properties when the excitation frequency approaches the orientational polarization of free water the effective conductivity begins increasing due to polarization losses the effect is most pronounced in low conductivity electrolytes and is imperceptible when conduction losses prevail with respect to polarization losses in high conductivity electrolytes the electromagnetic properties described above confirm that the effective conductivity remains constant at low frequencies klein santamarina 2003 revil 2013 the frequency of both the current and the resulting magnetic field used in this pilot test was less than 500 hz and the concentration of injected sodium persulfate solution was high 1 and therefore the influence of polarization losses can be neglected in this study furthermore electrical conductivity is a measure of charge mobility in response to an applied electric field it depends on both the bulk conductivity associated with conduction in the pore network and surface conduction in the electrical double layer coating the surface of the grains revil 2013 the conductivity in particles is primarily based on electron movement rather than ionic movement as in electrolytes their mobility is restricted by the electrical potential wells associated with surface charges on the minerals and hence mineral particles have very low conductivity relative to the conductivity of electrolytes surface conduction makes a noticeable contribution to the global conductivity of mixtures with low ionic concentration fluids while this contribution is negligible if the fluid has high ionic concentration klein santamarina 2003 lyklema 2001 such as the sodium persulfate solution used in this pilot study 3 7 3 chemical reaction it has been reported that the chemical reaction between the oxidant and the contaminant might produce some ions within the reaction zone and therefore the chemical oxidation reactions generally result in an increase in the electrical conductivity of the injected solution hort et al 2015 mao et al 2015 asserted that when the concentration of injected oxidant solution is much higher than that of the contaminant in the aquifer the fluid conductivity within the plume could likely be approximated based on the original conductivity of the injected oxidant solution our pilot injection study was conducted at an uncontaminated site and the interference of chemical reaction did not exist the changes observed in electrical conductivity over time can therefore be assumed to be caused entirely by the movement of the oxidant plume which has a significantly higher conductivity than that of background groundwater 4 results and discussions 4 1 change in groundwater ec of observation wells during the pilot test the observation wells were sampled and the ec of the groundwater was analyzed after each pulse injection the ec data of different depths and injection rounds for all of the observation wells are listed in table 4 the respective average values and the differences from the background values are shown in table 4 because the ec values of raw groundwater varied from 447 to 554 ms m if the δec of groundwater sample was less than 107 ms m it was regarded as raw groundwater without the injected oxidant except for the data of ow2 table 4 shows that the ec values at different depths of the same observation well were very close ow1 showed an increase of approximately 200 ms m after the first pulse injection and it maintained this value throughout the injection procedure this result revealed that just a small amount of sodium persulfate solution flowed to near ow1 over the duration of the first pulse injection although ow1 was close to the iw only 1 m the injectate hardly flowed to this area ow2 showed a maximum increase at the depth of 2 3 m after the second pulse injection and the corresponding ec value was 3290 ms m however it was only 706 ms m at the depth of 3 4 m it is interesting that the jetting head was fixed and limited to a depth of 3 2 3 7 m by the well packers and the groundwater table was 2 2 m below the ground surface the ec data revealed that the injectate flowed upward to the groundwater table moreover the ec value of ow1 nearest to the iw was 687 ms m only during the same injection round this result revealed that the injectate did not spread radially in this injection test it seemed that preferential flow formed from iw to ow2 and only at a depth of 2 3 m after the 3 and 4 m3 oxidant injections the ec values of ow2 at different depths were similar approximately 550 ms m this result indicated that the preferential flow from iw to ow2 formed during the second pulse injection and disappeared after the second pulse injection the δec values of ow2 were 82 ms m and 66 ms m after the 3 and 4 m3 oxidant injections respectively the δec value of ow4 increased slightly to 57 ms m after the 4 m3 oxidant injection but this change was not significant and it could be regarded as raw groundwater without the injected oxidant hence the result of ow4 indicated that the injectate did not flow to ow4 the ec values of ow3 ow5 and owb did not obviously change revealing that the injectate did not flow to these three observation wells either fig 9 presents the contour images plotted according to the δec of the six observation wells in table 4 the figure shows the increases in the ec values of different rounds of pulse injection between pre injection and post injection only the contour lines that were positive and greater than 100 ms m are presented fig 9 a shows that the injectate distributed around the iw after the first pulse injection only ow1 was included in this area the δec values of ow2 and ow3 were each less than 100 ms m an obvious change shown in fig 9 b was that ow2 presented a high ec value after the 2 m3 oxidant injection and only ow1 and ow2 were included in this higher ec area interestingly the high ec value for ow2 disappeared suddenly after the 3 m3 oxidant injection as shown in fig 9 c the distribution area of the injectate decreased significantly but it extended slightly toward ow4 and ow2 than that of in fig 9 a fig 9 d shows that the distribution of the injectate changed very slightly after the 4 m3 oxidant injection the injectate was only distributed at around ow1 and the iw by assessing table 4 and fig 9 the ec values measured from the observation wells showed some unreasonable and unexpected results the drastic change in the ec value of the ow2 well and the minor change in the other five wells cannot describe the flow behavior around the iw a maximum ec value was not observed at the depth at which the jetting head was fixed which indicated that the radial flow behavior did not occur during this pilot test moreover figs 9 a 9 c and 9 d show that both the distribution areas and ec increments of the plumes were small in the entire test site these results also cannot describe the mass balance of the injectate in this pilot test however they might imply that the injectate was distributed completely outside the areas of the six observation wells these results might also imply that non steady flow behavior and some preferential flow occurred during the injection procedure it also revealed the difficulty in describing the flow behavior and distribution of the injectate according to the data obtained from these six observation wells in other words these results revealed that the groundwater monitoring in these six observation wells could not offer the real distribution or flow behavior of the injectate in this pilot study 4 2 comparison of direct push ec logging with groundwater sample analysis in this pilot study seven direct push ec loggings were first obtained within a 10 m 10 m area and used to evaluate the possible hydrogeological conditions of the test site as shown in fig 10 higher ec values generally reflect a fine grained material brown zone in fig 10 whereas lower values indicate coarser sediments blue zone in fig 10 schulmeister et al 2003 the observation wells were installed mainly along the low ec area coarse grained area of this test site however the distribution of ec values of the groundwater samples as shown in fig 9 presented considerably different results from the direct push ec loggings the expected flow pattern from the iw toward ow5 was not observed in this pilot study and only an insignificant change in ec value was observed at ow1 the sampling data of ow3 and ow5 did not present any distinguishable changes during the oxidant injection test however a high ec value was observed at ow2 and this observation well was located at a so called fine grained area this result indicated that the data from seven direct push ec loggings in this study could not be used to predict the possible distribution of injectate or we can say that the seven direct push ec loggings did not provide sufficient data to quantify the possible distribution and flow behavior of the injectate the reason might be because of the complicated heterogeneous media in this test site therefore the heterogeneity in the aquifer caused some unexpected results in the flow behavior during the oxidant injection 4 3 relative differences in magnetic field strength between pre and post injection under the output voltage of 200 v the output electric current was 0 205 a during the pre injection background survey because of the continuous injection of the high ec solution in this test the ec of the aquifer between the two electrodes increased gradually altering the output current values under the fixed output voltage 200 v the current increased from 0 205 a to 0 210 a during the first pulse injection from 0 210 a to 0 213 a during the second pulse injection from 0 213 a to 0 216 a during the third pulse injection and from 0 216 a to 0 217 a during the fourth pulse injection eq 9 shows that a change in the horizontal observed magnetic field b obs h would indicate a change in the magnetic field generated by current flow in the aquifer b g when the current is controlled at a constant value moreover eq 3 and eq 4 show that the magnetic field strength generated by the current flow in the electrodes or the aquifer is proportional to the electric current intensity or current density to compare and estimate the survey results of the different injection rounds at the same electric current level the values of the magnetic field strength were modified first according to the current amplification ratio fig 11 shows the increments of the magnetic field strength δb between pre injection and post injection of every injection round following the definition for the lowest distinguishable signal mentioned above we used a value of 0 0008 mg as the lowest distinguishable value and the contour interval as shown in fig 11 fig 11 a shows an image of injectate distribution after the 1 m3 oxidant injection there were three main zones with increasing magnetic field strength the first was near the coordinate 2 4 the second one was at ow2 and the third was next to the second one and distributed between 7 7 and 6 9 the plume at ow2 showed a greater increase in magnetic field strength but the increment was only approximately 0 002 mg fig 11 a also reveals that the injectate did not flow from the iw radially instead of flowing to the nearest observation well ow1 the injectate flowed to some farther areas such as the three plumes shown in fig 11 a there might have been some unobvious preferential pathways that led the injectate from iw to these three plumes according to the results shown in fig 11 a after the 2 m3 oxidant injection five main plumes exhibited increasing magnetic field strength as shown in fig 11 b the first one was distributed near ow4 and at 1 3 the second was at 2 1 the third was at 0 9 the fourth was at 0 9 and the fifth was distributed from 6 2 to 6 10 among these five plumes the most notable plume was the fifth which was evidently a result of the continuous accumulation and expansion of the plume around ow2 by comparing with fig 11 a the locations with greater increments in magnetic field were at 7 5 and 6 9 and their corresponding increments were 0 0028 mg and 0 0032 mg this result revealed that the injectate continued to flow to this area during the second pulse injection the plumes at 0 9 and 2 10 also showed evident increases in magnetic field strength with maximum values of 0 0027 mg and 0 0028 mg respectively this result indicated that some injectate flowed to and accumulated at these areas the two plumes did not exist after the first pulse injection and thus there might have been some unobvious preferential pathways that led the injectate from the iw to these two areas the plumes at 1 4 and 2 1 did not show significant increases in magnetic field their increments were only 0 0013 mg fig 11 c shows a significant change after the 3 m3 oxidant injection the plumes at 0 9 and 2 10 clearly expanded in these areas with maximum increments of 0 0032 mg and 0 0033 mg respectively these results reveal that the injectate flowed continuously to and accumulated in these areas during the third pulse injection however fig 11 c does not show any pathway that may have led the injectate from the iw to these areas an interesting phenomenon occurred after the 3 m3 oxidant injection the long banded plume at ow2 in fig 11 b was torn into three pieces the big one was located at 6 8 with a maximum increment of 0 0041 mg and the other two were located at 9 3 and 7 2 respectively with maximum increments of 0 0033 mg and 0 0010 mg respectively the results reveal that this plume was atrophic during the third pulse injection and they might imply that the preferential pathway from the iw to this area was terminated fig 11 c also shows four plumes at 0 3 0 5 2 1 and 3 4 the plumes at 3 4 and 0 5 indicate significant increases in magnetic field with increments of 0 0032 mg and 0 0024 mg respectively the other two plumes are small in area and their increments are only 0 0012 mg even so this result also reveals that there were some flow pathways in this area to move the plumes and change the distribution of the injectate after the 4 m3 oxidant injection a great plume formed between ow3 and ow4 but its maximum increment was only 0 0018 mg as shown in fig 11 d this result revealed that the injectate flowed from the iw and was then distributed in this area the most significant change occurred after the fourth pulse injection two plumes located at 9 3 and 7 2 expanded during the fourth pulse injection with maximum increments of 0 0024 mg and 0 0015 mg respectively the increase in magnetic field was very obviously in the zone of the y 5 half plate which might imply that the injected oxidant flowed mainly to this zone during this pulse injection however fig 11 d shows an atrophic and split result in these plumes in the zone of the y 5 half plate the plume at 9 0 was atrophic and split into two plumes one at 9 0 with a maximum increment of 0 0028 mg and the other at 2 10 with a maximum increment of 0 0049 mg although their areas decreased the magnetic increment at 2 10 increased from 0 0033 mg to 0 0049 mg fig 11 c shows that the plume at 6 8 moved slightly to 6 9 and split into two plumes the plume located at 6 9 had a maximum magnetic increment of 0 0036 mg and the other one located at 6 6 had a maximum magnetic increment of 0 0024 mg this atrophic and split phenomenon might indicate that the flow pathways from the iw to these plumes were probably terminated during the fourth pulse injection 4 4 comparison of magnetic field survey with groundwater sample analysis to further study the relationship between the results of the magnetic field survey and the ec measurements of the groundwater the ec increments δec of the six observation wells at the four pulse injection stages and their corresponding magnetic increments δb are listed in table 5 the δb values of ow3 ow4 ow5 and owb were less than 0 0008 mg indicating that the injectate did not distribute at these four observation wells during the entire pilot injection test the ec measurement of the groundwater samples validated this result as the δec values of ow3 ow4 ow5 and owb were less than 107 ms m the change in the magnetic field strength of ow2 was very significant its magnetic increment increased to 0 0024 mg after the 1 m3 oxidant injection and to 0 0030 mg after the 2 m3 oxidant injection however it decreased suddenly to less than 0 0008 mg after the 3 and 4 m3 oxidant injections identically the ec measurements of ow2 showed a significant change too its ec value did not show a distinguishable change after the 1 m3 oxidant injection but it increased quickly to 1520 ms m after the 2 m3 oxidant injection then the ec increment decreased suddenly to less than 107 ms m after the 3 and 4 m3 oxidant injections except for the data measured during the first pulse injection both the ec measurement and magnetic survey at ow2 presented a same change trend the reason for the difference after the first pulse injection might have been because the injected oxidant flowed near ow2 but did not reach it and therefore the magnetic senor sensed the signal but the ec measurement did not show a distinguishable change image of magnetic surveys with a slightly inflated outline have been reported chen et al 2002 dentith mudge 2014 li oldenburg 1996 tsai et al 2020 the magnetic field increment obtained from a magnetic survey is the sum of the horizontal magnetic components generated by the current flow in the aquifer hence not only the magnetic signal directly below this sensor but also surrounding signals enter this sensor illustrated as sensor 1 in fig 12 also a sensor outside but near a zone with high current density also receives some magnetic signals from this high current density zone illustrated as sensor 2 in fig 12 this phenomenon of the magnetic survey would cause the results of ow2 in the first pulse injection during the pilot injection test the increase in the magnetic field strength of ow1 was less than the lowest distinguishable signal of 0 0008 mg and thus it could be regarded as no oxidant distribution however the ec measurements of the groundwater samples showed different results table 5 shows that the ec increments of the groundwater samples remained at about 200 ms m after oxidant injection by comparing these results with the ec value of the injected oxidant it was revealed that only a small amount of oxidant flowed to ow1 and was diluted by groundwater during the first pulse injection the oxidant then remained in the void around ow1 throughout the pilot test although different results are shown between the magnetic survey and groundwater ec measurement in table 5 the increases in groundwater ec were approximately 200 ms m and their increments were not high the sensitivity of the magnetic survey was estimated by both the magnetic increment and the groundwater ec increment during the pilot test according to table 5 the maximum values were 0 0030 mg and 1520 ms m respectively at ow2 after the second pulse injection which indicates that the sensitivity of the magnetic survey was 405 3 ms m per 0 0008 mg thus the magnetic survey would obtain an effective δb value when δec was greater than 405 3 ms m this result could explain why the small amount of injected oxidant could be detected by ec meter but not by the magnetic survey in summary we compared the results of both the magnetic survey and the groundwater ec measurement using 24 sets of data during the pilot study in addition to the influences of the physical characteristics and sensitivity of the magnetic survey the magnetic survey showed the same trend as the groundwater ec measurement the ec monitoring results in the six observation wells thus roughly validated the results of the magnetic survey in this pilot test 4 5 the possible distribution and flow behavior during the pilot test 4 5 1 assessment from ec data of the six observation wells in this study we installed six observation wells according to probable flow pathway as shown in fig 10 obtained from the evaluation of hydrogeology ow3 ow4 ow5 and owb showed no effective change in the ec value of the groundwater sample ow1 showed a slight change after the oxidant injection and it maintained this increment throughout the injection test only ow2 showed ec values of 3290 ms m and 706 ms m at depths of 2 3 m and 3 4 m respectively after the 2 m3 oxidant injection and the ec value returned to the normal local groundwater quality after the 3 m3 oxidant injection because the ec value of the injected oxidant solution was 6370 ms m and the injected depth was limited to a depth of 3 2 3 7 m by packers the ec data of the observation wells showed that the injected oxidant flowed upward to the groundwater surface and toward ow2 during the first 2 m3 oxidant injection however the injectate could not be detected by the six observation wells after the next 2 m3 oxidant injection according to data obtained from these six observation wells we could neither describe the distribution of the injected oxidant nor present clearly the variation of the flow behavior during the injection test because there were only six observation wells on this test site of 100 m2 the information obtained was incomplete for investigating the distribution and flow behavior of the injected oxidant during isco particularly because of the heterogeneity in aquifers an irregular or dispersed distribution of the injectate has been observed in some real sites during isco cave et al 2007 tildy et al 2017 to enhance the monitoring resolution and offer sufficient and useful data it will be necessary to install many more observation wells in an isco site if the traditional monitoring method is used 4 5 2 assessment from magnetic field data of the 121 survey grid points the distribution image of the injected oxidant was plotted according to the magnetic data of the 121 survey grid points within the test site the possible flowlines were plotted according to plume shape and the relative locations of the plumes to the iw the results are shown in fig 13 the figure also shows the main and minor flowlines according to the increments of the magnetic amount of plumes these increments are shown in fig 14 in this study the magnetic amount was the result of the integral of the magnetic increment and the area of the plume according to fig 14 plume 1 shows a much greater increment in total magnetic amount after the first and second pulse injections and so the flowline from the iw to plume 1 should be the main flowline the other flowlines are labeled as minor flowlines because their corresponding plumes showed smaller increases in the total magnetic amount plume 2 shows a greater increment in magnetic amount after the third pulse injection so its corresponding flowline was labeled as a main flowline finally after the fourth pulse injection plume 3 and plume 4 both showed a greater increment in magnetic field and thus they too were labeled as main flowlines fig 13 shows that the injected oxidant did not flow in a radial form and that the preferential flow pathways were generated from the iw these preferential pathways might not have been significant enough to be detected by the magnetic sensor under the resolution of 1 m 1 m however they became the main pathways allowing the injected oxidant to flow from the iw to some zones with higher permeability and to accumulate in these zones forming the plumes shown in figs 11 and 13 fig 13 also shows that these plumes and flowlines changed dynamically with injection volume in addition to the fact that the heterogeneity in the aquifer might change the flowlines of the injectate it has been reported that a pulsed injection could also change the flowlines of the injectate heron et al 2002 johnson et al 1997 rutherford johnson 1996 although this phenomenon was observed and discussed in the field of gas water interface the flow channels of the injectate may collapse when the injector is turned off and the pressure is decreased this phenomenon would cause new flowlines to form during the next pulse injection accordingly the change in flowlines would influence the change in the volume of the plumes fig 13 shows the increase and decrease of the injectate plumes at different injection stages the limited ec data of six observation wells showed trends of flow behavior similar to those shown in fig 13 and validated part of the change in flow behavior obtained from magnetic data however the results of the magnetic survey can show the distribution of injected oxidant in detail such that the flowlines and flow behavior can be estimated to further evaluate the reasonableness of these magnetic data the total area and total magnetic amount of the plumes after each pulse injection were estimated and the results are shown in fig 15 the total area of the plumes increased linearly r2 0 9533 with increasing injection volume of oxidant the areas of the oxidant plumes estimated according to the magnetic survey showed good linear correlation with the injection volume because the magnetic increment of each grid point was not uniform in an injectate plume it should be related to the concentration of oxidant by combining both the magnetic increment and the area of the plume the total magnetic amount showed better linear correlation r2 0 9731 with the injection volume therefore fig 15 shows that the plumes of the injected oxidant estimated by the magnetic survey could also conform to the concept of mass balance by comparing the plumes with the injection volume of oxidant 4 6 the second pilot test low pressure injection method 4 6 1 methods and materials to present a more solid result in addition to the pilot test of the high pressure injection method mentioned above one week before that another pilot test of low pressure injection was conducted in the low pressure injection test the solution was gravity fed into the iw with a hydraulic head of approximately 1 8 m of the 1 sodium persulfate solution the injection location was at a depth of 3 5 m the injection flow rate was approximately 29 l min under this operation during the time interval of the two pilot tests the groundwater outside but near the test site was pumped out and injected into the iw to flush away the injected sodium persulfate the procedure of the low pressure injection test which combined the traditional well monitoring method and the magnetic survey technology was the same as that of the high pressure injection test before the injection procedure and after each pulse injection both the groundwater ec values of the six observation wells and the magnetic field intensities of 121 survey grid points were measured respectively the voltage and the frequency of the ac power source were set at 200 v and 447 hz respectively as that of using in the high pressure injection test according to the loq estimation we used a value of 0 0008 mg to be the lowest detectable value to present differences in magnetic field strength between pre and post injection too 4 6 2 test results the figures and tables of the second pilot test are detailed in supporting information si fig s1 shows the increments of the magnetic field strength δb between pre injection and post injection of every injection round table s1 presents the ec values of the groundwater samples for the six ows during the low pressure injection test the comparison of the increments of groundwater ec and magnetic field at various ows and injection stages are shown in table s2 to further evaluate the reasonableness of these magnetic data the total area and total magnetic amount of the plumes after each pulse injection were estimated too and the results are shown in fig s2 these results also show a good correlation between the measurements of both mmr and electrical conductivity of groundwater moreover the plumes of the injected oxidant estimated by the magnetic survey could also conform to the concept of mass balance by comparing the plumes with the injection volume of the oxidant 4 7 limitation of magnetic field survey technology 4 7 1 influence of physical characteristics of magnetic field magnetic field survey technology was successfully applied to this pilot injection test by way of the magnetic field survey conducted before and after the oxidant injection the interference caused by both the soil type and the heterogeneity of the aquifer were removed completely and showed the change in groundwater quality only because this technology is based on the current flow pattern in an aquifer it obtains the current density or distribution in the aquifer by measuring the corresponding distribution of the magnetic field hence the physical characteristics of a magnetic survey should be understood when the magnetic data are used to estimate the injectate distribution and its possible flowlines there were two magnetic phenomena observed in this study the first one was that the predicted zone obtained by magnetic survey was slightly greater than the true zone therefore when the injected oxidant flowed near ow2 without touching it an increased magnetic signal was received at the ow2 survey point during our pilot test the second phenomenon was that the magnetic survey was not sensitive to the electrolyte concentration as mentioned above the sensitivity of the magnetic survey was estimated by the measured data in this pilot test and it was found to be 405 3 ms m per 0 0008 mg this value revealed that the magnetic survey obtained an effective value in δb when the δec was greater than 405 3 ms m this is the reason why the ec increments of about 200 ms m in ow1 were not detected by the magnetic field survey because of the low sensitivity of the magnetic survey the ec value of the injected oxidant is an important key to successfully applying this magnetic survey technology in estimating the distribution of the injected oxidant the ec value of the injected oxidant should be several times greater than that of the groundwater of the site in this study the ec values of the injected oxidant and groundwater were 6370 ms m and 489 ms m respectively they were a ratio of about 13 1 4 7 2 limitation from the survey depth the limitation of the magnetic field survey technology in terms of depth also is a matter of concern when applying this technology the flow field of electric current is generated at the depth of interest and the magnetic field intensity on the ground is measured according to eq 4 and fig 3 the detected value of the resulting magnetic field is related to both the electric current and the depth of the current flowline because this study suggests using the loq of the measurement system as an acceptable resolution in the magnetic monitoring of isco the suitable current intensity and flowline depth should be taken into consideration when the monitoring work of the magnetic survey is designed a weak magnetic signal will result in poor sensitivity and resolution during the isco according to the biot savart law for current flow fig 16 shows the relationship between the electric current the corresponding theoretical depth and the magnetic intensity when the observation point p is on the line connecting the two electrodes accordingly if the magnetic monitoring is conducted at an isco site with a greater injection depth in order to obtain sufficient sensitivity for the magnetic survey a higher current intensity should be injected into the aquifer 5 conclusions in this study we referenced the mmr method and used the applied electric current flow pattern and the generated magnetic field to estimate the injectate distribution of isco the pilot test was conducted to observe the flow behaviors and distributions of the injectate in an aquifer during oxidant injection except for the hydrogeological investigation by direct push ec logging both the magnetic field survey and the groundwater measurement of electrical conductivity were conducted on a test site measuring 10 m 10 m in the traditional method observation wells were installed according to the degree of difficulty of injectate transportation which was evaluated using the seven direct push ec logging data however the ec data of the observation wells could neither depict clearly the distribution of the injected oxidant nor explain the flow behavior of injectate the possible reason was that the six observation wells within a site of 100 m2 presented a poor resolution in image drawing so the insufficient data made it difficult to quantify the distribution and flow of the injected sodium persulfate not to mention the reasons for the abnormal changes in the ec of the observation wells the magnetic survey method with 121 survey grid points resulted in images of plumes with effective magnetic increments these zones of magnetic increase should be related to the increase in ec although the physical properties of magnetic survey slightly affected the accuracy of the survey results for the true area the result of the magnetic survey presented an approximate distribution of injected oxidant the corresponding magnetic data at the six observation wells presented the same trend as the ec data of the groundwater moreover the total magnetic amounts of the plumes in each injection stage showed a good linear relationship with the injected volume according to the results in this pilot test the magnetic survey showed the distribution of injected oxidant for different injection stages as well as the possible preferential pathways and the flow behavior the flow behavior of the injected oxidant was changeable in the aquifer the injected oxidant flowed upward first to the groundwater surface then flowed preferentially to and accumulated around zones with higher permeability the preferential pathways that flowed from the iw were not detected during this test these preferential pathways might not have been significant enough to be detected by the magnetic sensor under the resolution of 1 m 1 m also it was probably because of heterogeneity of the aquifer or the disturbance of pulse injection that the preferential pathways changed with changing injected volume thus altering the area and volume of the plumes in summary this study successfully applied the mmr method for monitoring the distribution of injected oxidant during isco although the extra drilling and sampling could not be conducted during the injection stages due to a continuous process in this pilot test the magnetic data were validated well by the groundwater samples of six observation wells and the mass balance of the total magnetic amount of plumes however the magnetic distribution was related to the distribution of the electric current density further the current flow line or current density was affected not only by the distribution of conductivity but also by the geometry of the oxidant plumes the irregularly shaped distribution or plume such as the ring shape of oxidant in the aquifer generally causes an incorrect evaluation result of concentration distribution moreover as mentioned previously temperature chemical reaction and electromagnetic properties will probably be the reasons for causing a variation in the electrical conductivity of a local aquifer therefore the magnetic data cannot be used to quantitatively evaluate the concentration of oxidant solution in an aquifer declaration of competing interest the authors
