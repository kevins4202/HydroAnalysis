21420,the research on resistance and wake of an underwater submarine in density stratified fluid is very necessary to study the hydrodynamic performances of an underwater submarine navigating in density stratified fluid a cfd model is established based on rans equations combined with the realizable k ε turbulence and euler multiphase flow models meanwhile the vof method is used for capturing the interface at first the established cfd model is validated by comparing with experimental results thereafter the resistance and flow field of a full scale suboff model in density stratified and uniform fluids with different forward speeds submerged positions and fluid densities are investigated the results show that the forward speed and submerged depth significantly affect the hydrodynamic performances of the submarine however the density of the lower layer and the distance of submarine above the internal surface both have little effect the influence of the density stratification on the resistance increases as the forward speed becomes faster and the position becomes closer to the free surface the pattern of the internal wave when submarine navigates under the internal interface is obviously different from that when submarine navigates above the internal interface in general the pattern of the internal wave changes more slowly than that of the free surface keywords submarine density stratified fluid internal wave resistance suboff hydrodynamic 1 introduction when an underwater submarine navigates below the surface of a uniform fluid the kelvin waves will be generated at free surface especially when the submarine approaches to the free surface owing to the difference of temperature and density the stratification in seawater happens where the internal waves are excited at the density stratification interface induced by the volume and turbulent wake effect xu 1999 when a submarine navigates in caused by the small density gradient of seawater and the small corresponded restoring force the internal wave period and amplitudes both have large values meanwhile the existence of internal waves affects the rapidity and maneuverability of the navigational body constantin 2011 besides the internal wave gradually expands with the increase of the forward speed of the submarine causing the submarine to suffer greater resistance in the stratified fluid this phenomenon is also called dead water that is the internal wave increasing resistance problem it was firstly studied by ekman 1904 tulin and zilman 1993 considered a two layer fluid model as a finite depth based on the potential flow theory motygin and kuznetsov 1997 derived an explicit formula for the wave resistance grue 2015 numerically studied the fream navigation process using a strongly nonlinear method and found a similar force trend law as reported in ekman 1904 gou et al 2017 experimentally studied the resistance characteristics of the box structure dragged in a stratified fluid mercier et al 2011 revisited the experimental studies performed by ekman on dead water and studied the internal wave phenomenon in three layer and a linearly stratified fluid duchene 2011 nonlinearly analyzed the dead water problem based on the assumption that the internal wave wavelength is greater than the spacing of density stratification to generate internal waves by moving objects in a stratified fluid a large number of studies have been conducted using theoretical experimental and numerical methods hudimac 1961 keller and munk 1970 hanazaki 1994 rottman et al 2014 esmaeilpour et al 2016 he et al 2019 milder 1974 used the fourier transform method to obtain the internal waves and the distribution of the wave amplitude tuck 1993 proposed a point source internal wave model considering the influence of free surface deformation robey 1997 employed the stationary moving sources model from milder 1974 to set the effect of wake as a cylinder and gave the determination method of its moving speed length and diameter chomaz et al 1993 studied the near field wake of the sphere in a stratified fluid zhao et al 2009 experimentally studied the internal wave excited by the movement of a slender body in a three layer fluid song et al 2011 established a time domain numerical model to compute the action of internal solitary wave on marine structures and structure motion responses gou et al 2012 simulated wave diffraction problem in a two layer fluid of finite depth using a time domain numerical model based on the higher order boundary element method yeung and nguyen 1999 discussed the effects of surface wave modes and internal wave modes generated by moving submarines on the wave of free surface and internal surface by solving the green function chang et al 2006 simulated the internal and surface wave generated by submarine navigating in a two layer fluid with different velocities broutman and rottman 2004 proposed a method to describe the linear internal wave field generated by an oscillating source lin and pao 1979 and bonneton et al 1993 conducted extensive experimental studies on the characteristics of the submarine wakes in density stratified fluids it can be seen that most of the research on the submarine in stratified fluid focused on the internal wave patterns caused by the motion however the studies on the effects of internal wave on the submarine resistance are scarce in the present paper the resistance and wake characteristics of a submarine navigating in a density stratified fluid are systematically studied a cfd model is established based on star ccm using the rans equations with realizable k ε turbulence model the euler multiphase flow model is used to layer the computational domain coupled with the interface capturing method vof and the pressure velocity coupling scheme simple the following part of the paper is divided into five parts the numerical results is validated with the experimental results in the first part the effect of the submarines forward speed on resistance and wave making characteristics in both stratified and uniform fluids are studied in the second part the hydrodynamic characteristics of submarine navigation at different positions which include the distances from the free surface and from the internal surface as well as the fluid layer submarine navigates in are investigated in the third part the influence of density of the lower layer on the navigation performance of the submarine is further studied in the fourth part finally in the fifth part the conclusions drawn from the results of this study are presented 2 numerical method and model 2 1 governing equations considering that the main concern of engineering application is the time average value of each turbulent element the research method is established based on the rans equation ferziger et al 1997 decomposing the instantaneous values of velocity and pressure into time averaged and pulsation parts the governing equation of an incompressible newtonian fluid based on reynolds average n s is expressed as 1 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i x j ν u i x j u j x i u i u j x j f i 2 u i x i 0 where u i represents the average speed u i is the pulsation speed u i u j is the reynolds stress term x denotes the direction of the coordinate axis f represents the strength of the mass force ν represents the kinematic viscosity of the fluid ρ is the density of the fluid t represents the time eqs 1 and 2 are the momentum and continuity equations respectively both of which are time averaged forms referred to as rans 2 2 turbulence model to make eq 1 be a closed form equation a turbulence model is used here the realizable k ε model is employed due to its high numerical stability and accuracy for the pressure gradient solution the dissipation rate and the turbulent energy transport equation are written as follows 3 ρ d ε d t x j μ μ t σ ε ε x j ρ c 1 s ε ρ c 2 ε 2 k v ε c 1 ε ε k

the dissipation rate η s k j ε is a symbol σ k and σ ε are the turbulent prandtl number of the kinetic energy k and the dissipation rate ε respectively c 1 ε 1 44 c 2 1 9 σ k 1 0 and σ ε 1 2 are default constants in the software 2 3 plane wave theory similar to the ship in the free surface the submarine navigating in a two layer fluid also generates waves in the free surface thus the plane wave theory is also available for the analysis of underwater submarine the wave energy in a closed region with a width of b and a length of 2 λ can be described as follows 5 e b ρ g a 2 b λ 6 r w 1 4 ρ g a 2 b 1 16 ρ g h 2 b where ρ is the water density g is the gravity acceleration a is the wave amplitude h is the wave height r w is the wave making resistance it can be found that the wave making resistance is proportional to the width of the wave region and the square of wave height thus the wave making resistance will be largely increased as the wave height increases the ship wave has bow and stern wave systems and the transverse waves in the two systems meet and superimpose after the stern which is called wave making interaction the distance between the first crest of both bow and stern transverse waves is called the length of the wave making expressed as ml the interaction of the bow and stern transverse waves is determined by ml and the wavelength λ here l is the length of the ship and m is a coefficient which is related to the ship type and froude number based on the theory of plane wave the wave making resistance coefficient c w can be approximated as 7 c w r w 1 2 ρ v 2 s c d cos 2 π m l λ v g l 4 where v is the forward speed of the ship s is the wet surface area l is the length of the submarine c and d are the constants 3 numerical model validation 3 1 computational model setting the computational domain is shown in fig 1 its length width and height are 18 l 5 l and 2 l respectively to prevent the numerical reflux a long leeside region of the computational domain is applied with the pressure outlet and speed inlet boundary conditions as the structure and the problem are symmetrical here only half of the computational model and domain are used to save the cpu time and the boundary condition of the side wall is velocity inlet for simulating a two layer density stratified fluid a euler multiphase flow model in star ccm is used for the three phases of the air water and salt the initial volume fraction of each fluid phase is given by a user defined field function udf the velocity is given at the inlet while the pressure is given as a function of density and depth the trim mesh is employed to perform the mesh encryption on the surface of the submarine with large curvature changes free surface density interface and etc for accurately capturing the flow field characteristics of the submarine when navigating in a stratified fluid the grid positioning point is used near the submarine grid on the free surface and the grid quality is improved by controlling the parameters of the prism layer and the growth rate on the object surface the total number of the grids is about 4 million as shown in fig 1 it takes about 48 h to run a case on a pc with cpu frequency of 3 4 ghz i7 6700 3 2 convergence study a full scale suboff submarine model is employed for simulating the real situation and its principle dimensions are shown in table 1 the convergence study is carried out first the upper fluid is freshwater with its density ρ 1 997 561 kg m3 and its height h 1 26 m while the lower fluid is a salty water with its density ρ 2 1024 kg m3 and its height h 2 90 m as shown in fig 2 the suboff model is located at position 1 with d 1 0 16 l and d 2 0 1 l and moves horizontally with a forward speed of fr 0 5 the grid convergence is studied by changing the basic size the basic sizes of meshes a b c and d are 2 7 m 2 3 m 2 1 m and 1 9 m respectively with the time step of 0 01 s the total resistance r t and friction resistance r f of the submarine during navigation based on different meshes are given in table 2 the errors in table 2 refer to the differences in the numerical results between the studied mesh and the finest mesh d which can be defined as follows 8 e r r o r i r i r d r d i a b c d it can be observed from table 2 that as the mesh size decreases the number of mesh gradually increases meanwhile the error of resistance has a decreasing tendency the total and frictional resistances using mesh d are almost the same with that from mesh c furthermore we also conducted verification of convergence at low fr 0 3 and high fr 0 7 speeds with a time step of 0 01 s the errors of total and frictional resistances between meshes c and d with low speed are 0 618 and 0 251 respectively and the errors of total and frictional resistances between meshes c and d with high speed are 1 068 and 0 381 respectively for the balance of the numerical accuracy and efficiency here mesh c is employed in the following calculations based on mesh c a convergence study for four different time steps of 0 045 s 0 02 s 0 01 s and 0 005 s is further conducted from table 3 it can be found that when the time step is reduced from 0 01 s to 0 005 s the errors of the total resistance and friction resistance are 0 284 and 0 021 respectively indicating that the further reduction of the time step from 0 01 s to 0 005 s has a very slight effect on the numerical results therefore time c is used for the subsequent studies through a large number of numerical tests time c is also proved to be applicable to other forward speeds of the present study then we have studied the effect of the width of the calculation domain on the numerical results the forward speed is fr 0 7 while the width is 2 l 3 l 4 l 5 l 6 l 10 l respectively table 4 shows the errors of total and frictional resistances compared with the biggest width 10 l it can be seen from table 4 that when the width of the calculation domain reaches 5 l the change of the total and frictional resistances are small by continuing to increase the calculation domain even to 10 l therefore it is considered feasible to use 5 l for the width of the calculation domain 3 3 numerical validation an experiment of a box dragging in a two layer fluid carried out by gou et al 2017 is used to validate the present numerical model as shown in fig 3 the water depth is 0 6 m the widths of the numerical flume is set the same with that in the experimental flume the freshwater is in the upper layer with its density ρ 1 997 kg m3 and depth h 1 0 3 m the lower layer is the salty water with its density ρ 2 1024 kg m3 and depth h 2 0 3 m the box type model is a pontoon with its size of 60 cm 45 cm 35 cm and its draft is 0 2 m the dragging speeds are selected as 0 06 0 08 0 10 0 12 0 14 0 16 0 18 0 2 and 0 24 m s respectively fig 4 provides the present numerical results of the resistance of the box in both stratified and uniform fluids when compared with the experimental results it can be seen from fig 4 that the numerical results agree very well with the experimental results showing that the present numerical model can evaluate the hydrodynamic performance of the submarine navigating in a density stratified fluid precisely 4 numerical results and discussion 4 1 influence of submarine forward speed at the first the influence of the forward speed on the hydrodynamic performances of the submarine in both stratified and uniform fluids are studied when the submarine is located at position 1 with d 1 0 16 l and d 2 0 1 l and the density of the fluid in the uniform fluid is 997 561 kg m3 fig 5 shows the resistance with different forward speeds since the frictional resistances in the uniform fluid and the stratified fluid is almost the same the results of frictional resistance in the uniform fluid are not plotted in fig 5 from fig 5 a as forward speed increases the total and frictional resistances both increase however the increase of total resistance is larger than that of frictional resistance the main contribution to the increase in total resistance is the residual resistance whose main component is the wave making resistance the waves include the free and internal surface waves and the energy required for the wave generation is expressed in the form of wave making resistance on the submarine it also leads to that the resistance in a stratified fluid is greater than that in a uniform fluid from the curve of the difference of r t in fig 5 a it can be seen that the difference of the total resistance r t gradually decreases before fr reaches 0 5 and then gradually increases the overall change is small the change rate of the resistance in the low speed region is relatively slower than that in the high speed region causing the total resistance on the submarine increases as the forward speed increases it can be seen from fig 5 b that for both stratified and uniform fluids as the forward speed increases the coefficients of wave making resistance shows an increasing trend first and then a decrease trend the coefficient of wave making resistance reaches the maximum value when fr 0 5 caused by the cosine term in eq 7 which is changed from 1 to 1 with the interference of the bow and stern wave of the submarine the curve has a peak also indicating that there is an unfavorable interference between the transverse waves of the bow and stern of the submarine near fr 0 5 for a further analysis figs 6 and 7 show the distribution of waves on the free and internal surfaces at a low speed fr 0 3 a medium speed fr 0 5 and a high speed fr 0 7 respectively it can be observed from fig 6 that as the forward speed increases the distribution range of the waves on the free surface becomes larger and the wavelength increases continuously during the whole region in fig 7 the internal wave pattern has a small v shape as the forward speed increases the range of internal wave becomes larger and its wavelength gets longer the rise of wave making resistance with high forward speed is induced by the expanding of the free surface and internal waves besides we can see that the amplitude of the wave generated by the submarine at fr 0 5 in both free surface and internal surface are higher than that of other forward speed cases the waves in the bow and stern of the submarine are adversely interfered both in the free surface and the internal wave surface this is also the reason why the coefficient of wave making resistance in fig 5 peaks at fr 0 5 fig 8 shows the wave profiles in both free and internal surfaces at y 0 with fr 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 respectively the two dotted vertical lines represent the position of the submarine in the longitudinal direction and the abscissa of x denotes the computational domain size in the travel direction of the submarine length direction from fig 8 the wave profiles at the free and internal surfaces intuitively change it can be found that they exhibit different shapes that is the wavefronts in the free and internal surfaces for each speed should be a crest and a trough respectively in addition combining with fig 7 we can see that as the forward speed increases the wavelength of free surface and internal surface waves both increase in which the increase of the free surface waves are more obvious the internal wavelength is greater than that in the free surface wave it is caused by the difference of the density between the water and salt layers is much smaller than that between the water and gas layers owing to the tiny difference of the density between water and salt layers even a small disturbance can excite a large internal wave amplitude as the restoring force is weak the period and wavelength of the internal wave are long furthermore the internal wavelength responds slowly with the changes of the forward speed fig 9 depicts the velocity field of the free and internal surfaces at fr 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 respectively it can be seen that the velocity fields at the two interfaces both exhibit a v shape however the velocity at the free surface is higher than that in the internal surface as the forward speed of the submarine increases the velocity of waves also increases compared with the free surface the change of the wave velocity on the internal wave surface is slower this phenomenon is similar to the change of the wave profile shown in fig 8 further indicating that the internal wave is not sensitive to the forward speed of the submarine 4 2 influence of submerged position the position of the submarine is another key factor to its hydrodynamic performance the influence of the position on the hydrodynamic performances of the submarine for different forward speeds is studied 4 2 1 effect of the distance from the free surface the submarine is located at position 1 with d 2 0 1 l and fr 0 5 the submerged depths are varied with d 1 0 08 l 0 12 l 0 16 l 0 2 l and 0 24 l respectively fig 10 gives the comparison of the resistances with different submerged depths it can be seen from fig 10 that the resistances decrease continuously as the submerged depth increases the coefficients of wave making resistance have the same trend with the resistance similar to the effect analyzed of forward speed in section 3 1 the change of the frictional resistance has little effect on the total resistance indicating that the total resistance is dominated by wave making resistance the change of the resistance in a density stratified fluid is similar to that in a uniform fluid due to the presence of the internal waves the submarine needs some additional energy for generating the internal waves therefore the resistance and coefficient in a stratified fluid is higher than the corresponding parameter in a uniform fluid the difference of r t between a stratified fluid and a uniform fluid decreases gradually with the increased depth as the submerged depth increases in other words the submarine gets far away from the free surface the difference of r t first decreases and then tends to be stable and the change rate of the resistance in the low depth region is fast compared with it in the high depth region that is the effect of density stratified becomes weaker when the submerged depth increases when the submerged depth has a big value the wave making resistance no longer dominates and owing to the constant values of the forward speed of the submarine and the density of the fluid the frictional resistance is also almost unchanging therefore the total resistance of the submarine varies a little when the location it navigates in is changed from a stratified fluid to a uniform fluid figs 11 and 12 show the distribution of wave elevations in free and internal surfaces it can be seen that as the submerged depth increases the elevations in free and internal surfaces both decrease further leading to the reduction of the wave making resistance the waveform in the internal surface is a narrow v type tail continuously extends toward the back of the submarine as the submerged depth increases besides we can see that although the distance between the submarine and the internal surface remains unchanged as the submerged depth of the submarine increases the depth of the internal surface gradually increases this shows that in addition to the relative position with the submarine the position of the internal surface itself is also an important factor affecting the wave on it that is the deeper the internal surface the smaller the amplitude of the internal wave is fig 13 shows the wave profiles in the free surface and internal surface at y 0 with different submerged depths where abscissa is the length of the calculation domain and the ordinate is the wave elevations the two dotted lines represent the position of the submarine in the longitudinal direction it can be seen from fig 13 that as the submerged depth increases the wave elevations on the free and internal wave surfaces decrease resulting in the reduction of the resistance the variation of the wave elevation on the internal surface is relatively slight due to the constant distance between the centre of the submarine and the interface of water salt further causing little change of the wave pattern on the internal surface unlike to the wave profiles with different forward speeds in fig 8 the change of the submerged depth has less effect on the wavelength fig 14 provides the velocity field in two interfaces at different submerged depths of d 1 l 0 08 0 16 and 0 24 respectively it can be seen in fig 14 that the velocity patterns on the free and internal surfaces both have v shapes as the submerged depth increases the overall speed decreases furthermore the speed at the free surface is higher than that in the internal surface 4 2 2 effect of the distance from the interface of water salt the hydrodynamic characteristics of the submarine have been studied by changing the distance between the submarine centre and the interface of water salt the submarine is located at position 1 with d 1 0 16 l and fr 0 5 by varying d 2 l 0 08 0 1 0 12 0 15 and 0 2 fig 15 shows the resistances and coefficients of wave making resistance it can be seen from fig 15 that the total resistance has a slightly decrease tendency which amplitude is extremely small by contrast the frictional resistance is almost unchanged as d 2 increases the coefficients of wave making resistance decrease the distance from the interface of water salt d 2 has little effect on the resistance compared with the main factors of the forward speed and submerged depth d 1 it can be seen from figs 16 and 17 that as the distance of d 2 increase the patterns and elevations of waves on the free surface have little change while the wave elevations on the internal wave are slightly decreased further there is little change on the wavelength of these two waves being consistent with the changes in the coefficients of wave making resistance illustrated in fig 15 b caused by the weakening of the wave on the internal surface the overall coefficients of wave making resistance of the submarine are reduced fig 18 depicts the wave profiles in the free and internal surfaces at y 0 with different distances from the interface of water salt it can be seen that as the distance of d 2 becomes larger the wave pattern and the wavelength at the free surface have little change whereas the wave elevation on internal wave surface continuously decreases which is consistent with the discussion in figs 16 and 17 combined with the analysis in 3 2 1 it can be concluded that larger waves and higher resistances occurs when the submarine approaches the interfaces fig 19 shows the distribution of velocity when d 2 l is 0 08 0 12 and 0 2 respectively as the distance from the interface of water salt increases the velocity on the free surface has little change comparatively there is a slight decrease in the velocity on the internal surface in general the distance d 2 only affects the velocity on the internal surface slightly however it has little effect on the total resistance of the submarine 4 2 3 effect of the relative positions of the submarine with interface of water salt for investigating the uncertain of layer where submarine navigates during the actual voyage the hydrodynamic performances of the submarine at positions 1 and 2 with different forward speeds are studied the submarine is located at position 1 upper layer with d 1 0 16 l d 2 0 1 l and d 3 0 1 l while the submarine is located at position 2 lower layer the forward speeds are selected as fr 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 and 0 8 respectively from fig 20 as forward speed increases the resistances of the submarine at two positions both have increasing trends and the coefficients of wave making resistance increases first and then decreases the difference of the resistances between the two positions is mainly induced by the vertical depth as the position is changed from position 1 to position 2 the forward speed corresponding to the coefficient peaks of the wave making resistance increases meanwhile the ratio of the frictional resistance to the total resistance increasing continually figs 21 and 22 show the distribution of the waves in the free surface and internal surface at positions 1 and 2 when fr 0 3 0 5 and 0 8 respectively it can be seen from fig 21 that for the same forward speed the wave intensity at the free surface is weakened from position 1 to position 2 and the wave intensity tends to increase as forward speed increases at a certain position in general the difference in the waveform of the free surface in different layers can be negligible as can be seen from fig 22 the waveform of the internal wave for the two different positions are apparently different when the submarine is fully submerged in the lower layer i e at position 2 there are two large crests in both bow and tail of the entire waveform while the other crests between them are lower and we can see that as the forward speed increases the distance between the two crests continues to increase the studying of the special waveform is of great significance for the selection of submarine evasive strategies fig 23 shows the wave profiles in the free and internal surfaces in different layers at y 0 it can be seen that the effect of the layer where the submarine navigates in on the free surface wave is small however there is a large impact on the internal waveform when the submarine navigates in position 2 there are two crests in the internal waveform and a large trough appears after the first crest while there are two troughs in the internal waveform when then submarine navigates in position 1 in summary the difference in the position of the submarine mainly affects the internal waveform fig 24 shows the distribution of the velocity field at fr 0 5 it can be seen that the velocity on both free and internal surfaces decreases from position 1 to position 2 the magnitude of the velocity in the free surface is greater than that in the internal surface 4 3 effect of the density of the stratified fluid the effect of stratified fluid density is studied by changing the density of lower layer fluid with the density of upper layer fluid being constant the submarine is located at position 1 when d 1 0 16 l d 2 0 1 l and fr 0 5 the density of upper layer fluid ρ 1 has a constant value of 997 561 kg m3 however the density of lower layer fluid ρ 2 has 6 different values of 1010 kg m3 1024 kg m3 1050 kg m3 1080 kg m3 1130 kg m3 and 1300 kg m3 respectively fig 25 provides the effect of density on the resistance as the density of the lower layer fluid increases the friction resistance has little change and the coefficients of wave making resistance slightly increase causing the residual resistance to increase further leading to a slightly increase in total resistance figs 26 and 27 show the distribution of waves on free and internal surfaces when submarine navigates with ρ 2 1010 kg m3 1080 kg m3 and 1300 kg m3 respectively it can be seen that the density has little effect on the free surface wave while the wave elevations on internal surface increase gradually as the density of lower layer fluid increases concluding that the increase in total resistance is mainly caused by the internal surface wave fig 28 is the wave profiles in the free and internal surfaces at y 0 with different densities as the density increases the waveform of both free and internal surfaces almost remain stable by contrast the wave elevation on the internal surface has a slightly increasing trend fig 29 shows the distribution of the velocity field in the free surface and internal surface it can be concluded that the change of the density has little effect on the hydrodynamic performances of the submarine being consistent with the previous analysis 5 conclusion for evaluating the hydrodynamic performance of submarine in density stratified fluid a cfd model is established using the rans equation the present model is validated by the comparison of the numerical results with the corresponding experimental results the resistance and wave distributions of a full scale submarine navigating in both stratified and uniform fluids with different forward speeds submerged positions and fluid densities are systematically studied based on these results the following conclusion is drawn 1 forward speed has a significant effect on the resistance the coefficient of wave making resistance reaches its maximum near fr 0 5 owing to the unfavorable wave interference in both stratified and uniform fluids when the submarine navigates in position 1 the wave making resistance dominates the total resistance at high speed and the resistance of the submarine increases caused by the existence of density stratification furthermore as forward speed increases the increase of the resistance becomes more and more apparent 2 when submarine approaches the interfaces the large waves will be generated causing large resistance as the submerged depth increases the resistance and coefficients of wave making resistance decrease meanwhile the influence of density stratification on the resistance is gradually weakened the distance between the submarine centre and free surface affects the hydrodynamic performance significantly by contrast the distance from the internal surface only has a slight effect on the waveform of the internal surface and in addition to the relative position with the submarine the depth of the internal surface itself is also an important factor affecting the waveform on it 3 when the layer submarine navigates in is changed from position 1 to position 2 the speed corresponding to the peak of coefficients of wave making resistance increases and the ratio of friction resistance to total resistance gradually increases the relative positions of the submarine and the interfaces of water salt has little effect on the free surface wave however it has a great effect on the waveform of internal surface when the submarine navigates in the upper layer the wavefronts on free and internal surfaces are a crest and a trough respectively further there exist two large crests at bow and tail of the whole waveform of the internal wave when the submarine is completely submerged in the lower layer 4 the change of velocity field is consistent with the change of wave in the two interfaces the magnitude of the velocity at the free surface is higher than that in the internal surface besides the effect of the density on the hydrodynamic performances of submarine is slight 5 the waves on the internal surface response to various parameters is slower than that in the free surface due to the tiny difference of density between upper and lower layers from the above analysis it can be concluded that the present numerical model has a good precision which can be used for the simulation of the resistance and wake characteristics of a submarine navigating in a stratified fluid further it also has some reference values for the selection of the submarine navigation

resistance increases as the forward speed becomes faster and the position becomes closer to the free surface the pattern of the internal wave when submarine navigates under the internal interface is obviously different from that when submarine navigates above the internal interface in general the pattern of the internal wave changes more slowly than that of the free surface keywords submarine density stratified fluid internal wave resistance suboff hydrodynamic 1 introduction when an underwater submarine navigates below the surface of a uniform fluid the kelvin waves will be generated at free surface especially when the submarine approaches to the free surface owing to the difference of temperature and density the stratification in seawater happens where the internal waves are excited at the density stratification interface induced by the volume and turbulent wake effect xu 1999 when a submarine navigates in caused by the small density gradient of seawater and the small corresponded restoring force the internal wave period and amplitudes both have large values meanwhile the existence of internal waves affects the rapidity and maneuverability of the navigational body constantin 2011 besides the internal wave gradually expands with the increase of the forward speed of the submarine causing the submarine to suffer greater resistance in the stratified fluid this phenomenon is also called dead water that is the internal wave increasing resistance problem it was firstly studied by ekman 1904 tulin and zilman 1993 considered a two layer fluid model as a finite depth based on the potential flow theory motygin and kuznetsov 1997 derived an explicit formula for the wave resistance grue 2015 numerically studied the fream navigation process using a strongly nonlinear method and found a similar force trend law as reported in ekman 1904 gou et al 2017 experimentally studied the resistance characteristics of the box structure dragged in a stratified fluid mercier et al 2011 revisited the experimental studies performed by ekman on dead water and studied the internal wave phenomenon in three layer and a linearly stratified fluid duchene 2011 nonlinearly analyzed the dead water problem based on the assumption that the internal wave wavelength is greater than the spacing of density stratification to generate internal waves by moving objects in a stratified fluid a large number of studies have been conducted using theoretical experimental and numerical methods hudimac 1961 keller and munk 1970 hanazaki 1994 rottman et al 2014 esmaeilpour et al 2016 he et al 2019 milder 1974 used the fourier transform method to obtain the internal waves and the distribution of the wave amplitude tuck 1993 proposed a point source internal wave model

movement of a slender body in a three layer fluid song et al 2011 established a time domain numerical model to compute the action of internal solitary wave on marine structures and structure motion responses gou et al 2012 simulated wave diffraction problem in a two layer fluid of finite depth using a time domain numerical model based on the higher order boundary element method yeung and nguyen 1999 discussed the effects of surface wave modes and internal wave modes generated by moving submarines on the wave of free surface and internal surface by solving the green function chang et al 2006 simulated the internal and surface wave generated by submarine navigating in a two layer fluid with different velocities broutman and rottman 2004 proposed a method to describe the linear internal wave field generated by an oscillating source lin and pao 1979 and bonneton et al 1993 conducted extensive experimental studies on the characteristics of the submarine wakes in density stratified fluids it can be seen that most of the research on the submarine in stratified fluid focused on the internal wave patterns caused by the motion however the studies on the effects of internal wave on the submarine resistance are scarce in the present paper the resistance and wake characteristics of a submarine navigating in a density stratified fluid are systematically studied a cfd model is established based on star ccm using the rans equations with realizable k ε turbulence model the euler multiphase flow model is used to layer the computational domain coupled with the interface capturing method vof and the pressure velocity coupling scheme simple the following part of the paper is divided into five parts the numerical results is validated with the experimental results in the first part the effect of the submarines forward speed on resistance and wave making characteristics in both stratified and uniform fluids are studied in the second part the hydrodynamic characteristics of submarine navigation at different positions which include the distances from the free surface and from the internal surface as well as the fluid layer submarine navigates in are investigated in the third part the influence of density of the lower layer on the navigation performance of the submarine is further studied in the fourth part finally in the fifth part the conclusions drawn from the results of this study are presented 2 numerical method and model 2 1 governing equations considering that the main concern of engineering application is the time average value of each turbulent element the research method is established based on the rans equation ferziger et al 1997 decomposing the instantaneous values of velocity and pressure into time averaged and pulsation parts the governing equation of an incompressible newtonian fluid based on reynolds average n s is expressed as 1 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i x j ν u i x j u j x i u i u j x j f i 2 u i x i 0 where u i represents the average speed u i is the pulsation speed u i u j is the reynolds stress term x denotes the direction of the coordinate axis f represents the strength of the mass force ν represents the kinematic viscosity of the fluid ρ is the density of the fluid t represents the time eqs 1 and 2 are the momentum and continuity equations respectively both of which are time averaged forms referred to as rans 2 2 turbulence model to make eq 1 be a closed form equation a turbulence model is used here the realizable k ε model is employed due to its high numerical stability and accuracy for the pressure gradient solution the dissipation rate and the turbulent energy transport equation are written as follows 3 ρ d ε d t x j μ μ t σ ε ε x j ρ c 1 s ε ρ c 2 ε 2 k v ε c 1 ε ε k

the dissipation rate η s k j ε is a symbol σ k and σ ε are the turbulent prandtl number of the kinetic energy k and the dissipation rate ε respectively c 1 ε 1 44 c 2 1 9 σ k 1 0 and σ ε 1 2 are default constants in the software 2 3 plane wave theory similar to the ship in the free surface the submarine navigating in a two layer fluid also generates waves in the free surface thus the plane wave theory is also available for the analysis of underwater submarine the wave energy in a closed region with a width of b and a length of 2 λ can be described as follows 5 e b ρ g a 2 b λ 6 r w 1 4 ρ g a 2 b 1 16 ρ g h 2 b where ρ is the water density g is the gravity acceleration a is the wave amplitude h is the wave height r w is the wave making resistance it can be found that the wave making resistance is proportional to the width of the wave region and the square of wave height thus the wave making resistance will be largely increased as the wave height increases the ship wave has bow and stern wave systems and the transverse waves in the two systems meet and superimpose after the stern which is called wave making interaction the distance between the first crest of both bow and stern transverse waves is called the length of the wave making expressed as ml the interaction of the bow and stern transverse waves is determined by ml and the wavelength λ here l is the length of the ship and m is a coefficient which is related to the ship type and froude number based on the theory of plane wave the wave making resistance coefficient c w can be approximated as 7 c w r w 1 2 ρ v 2 s c d cos 2 π m l λ v g l 4 where v is the forward speed of the ship s is the wet surface area l is the length of the submarine c and d are the constants 3 numerical model validation 3 1 computational model setting the computational domain is shown in fig 1 its length width and height are 18 l 5 l and 2 l respectively to prevent the numerical reflux a long leeside region of the computational domain is applied with the pressure outlet and speed inlet boundary conditions as the structure and the problem are symmetrical here only half of the computational model and domain are used to save the cpu time and the boundary condition of the side wall is velocity inlet for simulating a two layer density stratified fluid a euler multiphase flow model in star ccm is used for the three phases of the air water and salt the initial volume fraction of each fluid phase is given by a user defined field function udf the velocity is given at the inlet while the pressure is given as a function of density and depth the trim mesh is employed to perform the mesh encryption on the surface of the submarine with large curvature changes free surface density interface and etc for accurately capturing the flow field characteristics of the submarine when navigating in a stratified fluid the grid positioning point is used near the submarine grid on the free surface and the grid quality is improved by controlling the parameters of the prism layer and the growth rate on the object surface the total number of the grids is about 4 million as shown in fig 1 it takes about 48 h to run a case on a pc with cpu frequency of 3 4 ghz i7 6700 3 2 convergence study a full scale suboff submarine model is employed for simulating the real situation and its principle dimensions are shown in table 1 the convergence study is carried out first the upper fluid is freshwater with its density ρ 1 997 561 kg m3 and its height h 1 26 m while the lower fluid is a salty water with its density ρ 2 1024 kg m3 and its height h 2 90 m as shown in fig 2 the suboff model is located at position 1 with d 1 0 16 l and d 2 0 1 l and moves horizontally with a forward speed of fr 0 5 the grid convergence is studied by changing the basic size the basic sizes of meshes a b c and d are 2 7 m 2 3 m 2 1 m and 1 9 m respectively with the time step of 0 01 s the total resistance r t and friction resistance r f of the submarine during navigation based on different meshes are given in table 2 the errors in table 2 refer to the differences in the numerical results between the studied mesh and the finest mesh d which can be defined as follows 8 e r r o r i r i r d r d i a b c d it can be observed from table 2 that as the mesh size decreases the number of mesh gradually increases meanwhile the error of resistance has a decreasing tendency the total and frictional resistances using mesh d are almost the same with that from mesh c furthermore we also conducted verification of convergence at low fr 0 3 and high fr 0 7 speeds with a time step of 0 01 s the errors of total and frictional resistances between meshes c and d with low speed are 0 618 and 0 251 respectively and the errors of total and frictional resistances between meshes c and d with high speed are 1 068 and 0 381 respectively for the balance of the numerical accuracy and efficiency here mesh c is employed in the following calculations based on mesh c a convergence study for four different time steps of 0 045 s 0 02 s 0 01 s and 0 005 s is further conducted from table 3 it can be found that when the time step is reduced from 0 01 s to 0 005 s the errors of the total resistance and friction resistance are 0 284 and 0 021 respectively indicating that the further reduction of the time step from 0 01 s to 0 005 s has a very slight effect on the numerical results therefore time c is used for the subsequent studies through a large number of numerical tests time c is also proved to be applicable to other forward speeds of the present study then we have studied the effect of the width of the calculation domain on the numerical results the forward speed is fr 0 7 while the width is 2 l 3 l 4 l 5 l 6 l 10 l respectively table 4 shows the errors of total and frictional resistances compared with the biggest width 10 l it can be seen from table 4 that when the width of the calculation domain reaches 5 l the change of the total and frictional resistances are small by continuing to increase the calculation domain even to 10 l therefore it is considered feasible to use 5 l for the width of the calculation domain 3 3 numerical validation an experiment of a box dragging in a two layer fluid carried out by gou et al 2017 is used to validate the present numerical model as shown in fig 3 the water depth is 0 6 m the widths of the numerical flume is set the same with that in the experimental flume the freshwater is in the upper layer with its density ρ 1 997 kg m3 and depth h 1 0 3 m the lower layer is the salty water with its density ρ 2 1024 kg m3 and depth h 2 0 3 m the box type model is a pontoon with its size of 60 cm 45 cm 35 cm and its draft is 0 2 m the dragging speeds are selected as 0 06 0 08 0 10 0 12 0 14 0 16 0 18 0 2 and 0 24 m s respectively fig 4 provides the present numerical results of the resistance of the box in both stratified and uniform fluids when compared with the experimental results it can be seen from fig 4 that the numerical results agree very well with the experimental results showing that the present numerical model can evaluate the hydrodynamic performance of the submarine navigating in a density stratified fluid precisely 4 numerical results and discussion 4 1 influence of submarine forward speed at the first the influence of the forward speed on the hydrodynamic performances of the submarine in both stratified and uniform fluids are studied when the submarine is located at position 1 with d 1 0 16 l and d 2 0 1 l and the density of the fluid in the uniform fluid is 997 561 kg m3 fig 5 shows the resistance with different forward speeds since the frictional resistances in the uniform fluid and the stratified fluid is almost the same the results of frictional resistance in the uniform fluid are not plotted in fig 5 from fig 5 a as forward speed increases the total and frictional resistances both increase however the increase of total resistance is larger than that of frictional resistance the main contribution to the increase in total resistance is the residual resistance whose main component is the wave making resistance the waves include the free and internal surface waves and the energy required for the wave generation is expressed in the form of wave making resistance on the submarine it also leads to that the resistance in a stratified fluid is greater than that in a uniform fluid from the curve of the difference of r t in fig 5 a it can be seen that the difference of the total resistance r t gradually decreases before fr reaches 0 5 and then gradually increases the overall change is small the change rate of the resistance in the low speed region is relatively slower than that in the high speed region causing the total resistance on the submarine increases as the forward speed increases it can be seen from fig 5 b that for both stratified and uniform fluids as the forward speed increases the coefficients of wave making resistance shows an increasing trend first and then a decrease trend the coefficient of wave making resistance reaches the maximum value when fr 0 5 caused by the cosine term in eq 7 which is changed from 1 to 1 with the interference of the bow and stern wave of the submarine the curve has a peak also indicating that there is an unfavorable interference between the transverse waves of the bow and stern of the submarine near fr 0 5 for a further analysis figs 6 and 7 show the distribution of waves on the free and internal surfaces at a low speed fr 0 3 a medium speed fr 0 5 and a high speed fr 0 7 respectively it can be observed from fig 6 that as the forward speed increases the distribution range of the waves on the free surface becomes larger and the wavelength increases continuously during the whole region in fig 7 the internal wave pattern has a small v shape as the forward speed increases the range of internal wave becomes larger and its wavelength gets longer the rise of wave making resistance with high forward speed is induced by the expanding of the free surface and internal waves besides we can see that the amplitude of the wave generated by the submarine at fr 0 5 in both free surface and internal surface are higher than that of other forward speed cases the waves in the bow and stern of the submarine are adversely interfered both in the free surface and the internal wave surface this is also the reason why the coefficient of wave making resistance in fig 5 peaks at fr 0 5 fig 8 shows the wave profiles in both free and internal surfaces at y 0 with fr 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 respectively the two dotted vertical lines represent the position of the submarine in the longitudinal direction and the abscissa of x denotes the computational domain size in the travel direction of the submarine length direction from fig 8 the wave profiles at the free and internal surfaces intuitively change it can be found that they exhibit different shapes that is the wavefronts in the free and internal surfaces for each speed should be a crest and a trough respectively in addition combining with fig 7 we can see that as the forward speed increases the wavelength of free surface and internal surface waves both increase in which the increase of the free surface waves are more obvious the internal wavelength is greater than that in the free surface wave it is caused by the difference of the density between the water and salt layers is much smaller than that between the water and gas layers owing to the tiny difference of the density between water and salt layers even a small disturbance can excite a large internal wave amplitude as the restoring force is weak the period and wavelength of the internal wave are long furthermore the internal wavelength responds slowly with the changes of the forward speed fig 9 depicts the velocity field of the free and internal surfaces at fr 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 respectively it can be seen that the velocity fields at the two interfaces both exhibit a v shape however the velocity at the free surface is higher than that in the internal surface as the forward speed of the submarine increases the velocity of waves also increases compared with the free surface the change of the wave velocity on the internal wave surface is slower this phenomenon is similar to the change of the wave profile shown in fig 8 further indicating that the internal wave is not sensitive to the forward speed of the submarine 4 2 influence of submerged position the position of the submarine is another key factor to its hydrodynamic performance the influence of the position on the hydrodynamic performances of the submarine for different forward speeds is studied 4 2 1 effect of the distance from the free surface the submarine is located at position 1 with d 2 0 1 l and fr 0 5 the submerged depths are varied with d 1 0 08 l 0 12 l 0 16 l 0 2 l and 0 24 l respectively fig 10 gives the comparison of the resistances with different submerged depths it can be seen from fig 10 that the resistances decrease continuously as the submerged depth increases the coefficients of wave making resistance have the same trend with the resistance similar to the effect analyzed of forward speed in section 3 1 the change of the frictional resistance has little effect on the total resistance indicating that the total resistance is dominated by wave making resistance the change of the resistance in a density stratified fluid is similar to that in a uniform fluid due to the presence of the internal waves the submarine needs some additional energy for generating the internal waves therefore the resistance and coefficient in a stratified fluid is higher than the corresponding parameter in a uniform fluid the difference of r t between a stratified fluid and a uniform fluid decreases gradually with the increased depth as the submerged depth increases in other words the submarine gets far away from the free surface the difference of r t first decreases and then tends to be stable and the change rate of the resistance in the low depth region is fast compared with it in the high depth region that is the effect of density stratified becomes weaker when the submerged depth increases when the submerged depth has a big value the wave making resistance no longer dominates and owing to the constant values of the forward speed of the submarine and the density of the fluid the frictional resistance is also almost unchanging therefore the total resistance of the submarine varies a little when the location it navigates in is changed from a stratified fluid to a uniform fluid figs 11 and 12 show the distribution of wave elevations in free and internal surfaces it can be seen that as the submerged depth increases the elevations in free and internal surfaces both decrease further leading to the reduction of the wave making resistance the waveform in the internal surface is a narrow v type tail continuously extends toward the back of the submarine as the submerged depth increases besides we can see that although the distance between the submarine and the internal surface remains unchanged as the submerged depth of the submarine increases the depth of the internal surface gradually increases this shows that in addition to the relative position with the submarine the position of the internal surface itself is also an important factor affecting the wave on it that is the deeper the internal surface the smaller the amplitude of the internal wave is fig 13 shows the wave profiles in the free surface and internal surface at y 0 with different submerged depths where abscissa is the length of the calculation domain and the ordinate is the wave elevations the two dotted lines represent the position of the submarine in the longitudinal direction it can be seen from fig 13 that as the submerged depth increases the wave elevations on the free and internal wave surfaces decrease resulting in the reduction of the resistance the variation of the wave elevation on the internal surface is relatively slight due to the constant distance between the centre of the submarine and the interface of water salt further causing little change of the wave pattern on the internal surface unlike to the wave profiles with different forward speeds in fig 8 the change of the submerged depth has less effect on the wavelength fig 14 provides the velocity field in two interfaces at different submerged depths of d 1 l 0 08 0 16 and 0 24 respectively it can be seen in fig 14 that the velocity patterns on the free and internal surfaces both have v shapes as the submerged depth increases the overall speed decreases furthermore the speed at the free surface is higher than that in the internal surface 4 2 2 effect of the distance from the interface of water salt the hydrodynamic characteristics of the submarine have been studied by changing the distance between the submarine centre and the interface of water salt the submarine is located at position 1 with d 1 0 16 l and fr 0 5 by varying d 2 l 0 08 0 1 0 12 0 15 and 0 2 fig 15 shows the resistances and coefficients of wave making resistance it can be seen from fig 15 that the total resistance has a slightly decrease tendency which amplitude is extremely small by contrast the frictional resistance is almost unchanged as d 2 increases the coefficients of wave making resistance decrease the distance from the interface of water salt d 2 has little effect on the resistance compared with the main factors of the forward speed and submerged depth d 1 it can be seen from figs 16 and 17 that as the distance of d 2 increase the patterns and elevations of waves on the free surface have little change while the wave elevations on the internal wave are slightly decreased further there is little change on the wavelength of these two waves being consistent with the changes in the coefficients of wave making resistance illustrated in fig 15 b caused by the weakening of the wave on the internal surface the overall coefficients of wave making resistance of the submarine are reduced fig 18 depicts the wave profiles in the free and internal surfaces at y 0 with different distances from the interface of water salt it can be seen that as the distance of d 2 becomes larger the wave pattern and the wavelength at the free surface have little change whereas the wave elevation on internal wave surface continuously decreases which is consistent with the discussion in figs 16 and 17 combined with the analysis in 3 2 1 it can be concluded that larger waves and higher resistances occurs when the submarine approaches the interfaces fig 19 shows the distribution of velocity when d 2 l is 0 08 0 12 and 0 2 respectively as the distance from the interface of water salt increases the velocity on the free surface has little change comparatively there is a slight decrease in the velocity on the internal surface in general the distance d 2 only affects the velocity on the internal surface slightly however it has little effect on the total resistance of the submarine 4 2 3 effect of the relative positions of the submarine with interface of water salt for investigating the uncertain of layer where submarine navigates during the actual voyage the hydrodynamic performances of the submarine at positions 1 and 2 with different forward speeds are studied the submarine is located at position 1 upper layer with d 1 0 16 l d 2 0 1 l and d 3 0 1 l while the submarine is located at position 2 lower layer the forward speeds are selected as fr 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 and 0 8 respectively from fig 20 as forward speed increases the resistances of the submarine at two positions both have increasing trends and the coefficients of wave making resistance increases first and then decreases the difference of the resistances between the two positions is mainly induced by the vertical depth as the position is changed from position 1 to position 2 the forward speed corresponding to the coefficient peaks of the wave making resistance increases meanwhile the ratio of the frictional resistance to the total resistance increasing continually figs 21 and 22 show the distribution of the waves in the free surface and internal surface at positions 1 and 2 when fr 0 3 0 5 and 0 8 respectively it can be seen from fig 21 that for the same forward speed the wave intensity at the free surface is weakened from position 1 to position 2 and the wave intensity tends to increase as forward speed increases at a certain position in general the difference in the waveform of the free surface in different layers can be negligible as can be seen from fig 22 the waveform of the internal wave for the two different positions are apparently different when the submarine is fully submerged in the lower layer i e at position 2 there are two large crests in both bow and tail of the entire waveform while the other crests between them are lower and we can see that as the forward speed increases the distance between the two crests continues to increase the studying of the special waveform is of great significance for the selection of submarine evasive strategies fig 23 shows the wave profiles in the free and internal surfaces in different layers at y 0 it can be seen that the effect of the layer where the submarine navigates in on the free surface wave is small however there is a large impact on the internal waveform when the submarine navigates in position 2 there are two crests in the internal waveform and a large trough appears after the first crest while there are two troughs in the internal waveform when then submarine navigates in position 1 in summary the difference in the position of the submarine mainly affects the internal waveform fig 24 shows the distribution of the velocity field at fr 0 5 it can be seen that the velocity on both free and internal surfaces decreases from position 1 to position 2 the magnitude of the velocity in the free surface is greater than that in the internal surface 4 3 effect of the density of the stratified fluid the effect of stratified fluid density is studied by changing the density of lower layer fluid with the density of upper layer fluid being constant the submarine is located at position 1 when d 1 0 16 l d 2 0 1 l and fr 0 5 the density of upper layer fluid ρ 1 has a constant value of 997 561 kg m3 however the density of lower layer fluid ρ 2 has 6 different values of 1010 kg m3 1024 kg m3 1050 kg m3 1080 kg m3 1130 kg m3 and 1300 kg m3 respectively fig 25 provides the effect of density on the resistance as the density of the lower layer fluid increases the friction resistance has little change and the coefficients of wave making resistance slightly increase causing the residual resistance to increase further leading to a slightly increase in total resistance figs 26 and 27 show the distribution of waves on free and internal surfaces when submarine navigates with ρ 2 1010 kg m3 1080 kg m3 and 1300 kg m3 respectively it can be seen that the density has little effect on the free surface wave while the wave elevations on internal surface increase gradually as the density of lower layer fluid increases concluding that the increase in total resistance is mainly caused by the internal surface wave fig 28 is the wave profiles in the free and internal surfaces at y 0 with different densities as the density increases the waveform of both free and internal surfaces almost remain stable by contrast the wave elevation on the internal surface has a slightly increasing trend fig 29 shows the distribution of the velocity field in the free surface and internal surface it can be concluded that the change of the density has little effect on the hydrodynamic performances of the submarine being consistent with the previous analysis 5 conclusion for evaluating the hydrodynamic performance of submarine in density stratified fluid a cfd model is established using the rans equation the present model is validated by the comparison of the numerical results with the corresponding experimental results the resistance and wave distributions of a full scale submarine navigating in both stratified and uniform fluids with different forward speeds submerged positions and fluid densities are systematically studied based on these results the following conclusion is drawn 1 forward speed has a significant effect on the resistance the coefficient of wave making resistance reaches its maximum near fr 0 5 owing to the unfavorable wave interference in both stratified and uniform fluids when the submarine navigates in position 1 the wave making resistance dominates the total resistance at high speed and the resistance of the submarine increases caused by the existence of density stratification furthermore as forward speed increases the increase of the resistance becomes more and more apparent 2 when submarine approaches the interfaces the large waves will be generated causing large resistance as the submerged depth increases the resistance and coefficients of wave making resistance decrease meanwhile the influence of density stratification on the resistance is gradually weakened the distance between the submarine centre and free surface affects the hydrodynamic performance significantly by contrast the distance from the internal surface only has a slight effect on the waveform of the internal surface and in addition to the relative position with the submarine the depth of the internal surface itself is also an important factor affecting the waveform on it 3 when the layer submarine navigates in is changed from position 1 to position 2 the speed corresponding to the peak of coefficients of wave making resistance increases and the ratio of friction resistance to total resistance gradually increases the relative positions of the submarine and the interfaces of water salt has little effect on the free surface wave however it has a great effect on the waveform of internal surface when the submarine navigates in the upper layer the wavefronts on free and internal surfaces are a crest and a trough respectively further there exist two large crests at bow and tail of the whole waveform of the internal wave when the submarine is completely submerged in the lower layer 4 the change of velocity field is consistent with the change of wave in the two interfaces the magnitude of the velocity at the free surface is higher than that in the internal surface besides the effect of the density on the hydrodynamic performances of submarine is slight 5 the waves on the internal surface response to various parameters is slower than that in the free surface due to the tiny difference of density between upper and lower layers from the above analysis it can be concluded that the present numerical model has a good precision which can be used for the simulation of the resistance and wake characteristics of a submarine navigating in a stratified fluid further it also has some reference values for the selection of the submarine navigation

21421,the fishing platform is expected to be a sustainable method for offshore aquaculture which can avoid fish escapes by using tanks in harsher sea state and meanwhile make use of natural water in this paper the flow characteristics residence time velocity uniformity in a force rolling aquaculture tank are numerically investigated and analyzed by statistical methods through our simulations we find that water inlet and drainage play a limited role in accelerating water velocity magnitude when being compared with the effect of the roll roll accelerates the velocity magnitude of water in the tank and shortens the circulation time for cases with different rolling angles the magnitude of water velocity in the tank is very sensitive to the rolling angle and increases with it for cases with different rolling periods velocity magnitude decreases as rolling periods increase moreover if the rolling period exceeds a threshold such as 10 s in this paper the velocity increment is tiny the residence time of water in the tank seems insensitive to both rolling angle and period for all simulations there is a low velocity region along the rolling axis in the middle of the fishing tank the water inlet slightly affects the volume of this low velocity zone keywords aquaculture tank forced roll residence time velocity uniformity statistical analysis 1 introduction the aquaculture industry is expanding to the open sea where water quality and spacious space favor large scaled aquaculture the key problems with expanding are the safety assessment of farming equipments and the water environment for fish living the net cage system has been paid much more attention in the past decades however the cage has to endure the harsher sea states which may lead to fish escape and facility failure as an alternative the closed fish cage has advantages on better fish welfare and water quality control due to the independent space from surrounding environment olsen 2020 recently a few aquaculture platforms are under construction for the offshore industry in china however the ship borne mariculture system is a newly sprouted thing which indicates the lack of basic knowledge and application experiences there is no answer for sloshing influence on the water interior of the fish tank hence the research on flow characteristics of the fish tank in an aquaculture vessel is crucial for the design and operation of such a large aquaculture platform for aquaculture cage many works have been done to study the hydrodynamic loads usually a cage with nets is moored with sinkers on the lower end of the net while the upper end is fixed on a floating circular ring a drawback of such a cage structure is that the shape of the net is easily affected by environmental factors such as waves currents and winds et al according to the experiments and field survey in 28 and 11 the reduction of the water volume surrounded by nets can reach 20 30 of that of calm water so a cage system with rigid supporting structures was designed fredriksson et al 2008 jurado et al 2018 however water can flow through net holes which bring new problems such as unexpected water quality fish escape and food leakage thus the water surrounded by the net of cages should be baffled from its surrounding environment 27 studied the hydrodynamic loads under external excitation it was manifested that the interior water may suffer from sloshing or swirling waves under different environmental waves which threaten the safety of a closed fish culture system there are many prototype structures with a closed water volume such as the storage tank of oil the water tank above a skyscraper and the vessels for oil and qualified gases many studies are relevant to the safety of containers instead of the water environment inside due to different application background however in the aquaculture engineering lives inside are more sensitive to the velocity uniformity which is affected by the pumping flux and shape of the closed system initially the land based aquaculture industry employs rectangular oca et al 2004 oca and masaló 2007 or circular round masaló et al 2008 oca and masalo 2013 masaló and oca 2016 containers to culture fishes such as zebra bass salmon and shrimp for land aquaculture engineering the rectangular circulating tank was firstly adopted due to manufacturing reasons burrows and chenoweth 1970 found that a rectangular tank is suitable for fish growth due to hydraulic and biological reasons experiments were conducted on a rectangular tank to study the flow velocity and the influence factors for example results in oca and masaló 2007 indicated that the ratio of tank length to width affects the occupation of the low velocity region if it is larger than 1 91 while if it is smaller than 1 43 the effect is unnoticeable meanwhile by employing a rectangular tank with a ratio of length to the width being 3 13 studied the effect of the inlet diameter and the bottom outlet discharge rate on the magnitude and the uniformity of water velocity in the tank provided a constant inlet flux the inlet diameter greatly affects the distribution of water velocity but the bottom outflow does not later 14 15 conducted two dimensional and three dimensional numerical simulations respectively and numerical results agreed with their experimental data experimental and numerical results reveal that the interior water circulates around the vertically central axis the velocity magnitude decreases from the region near the wall to the region near the central axis for a circular fishing tank such as oca and masalo 2013 masaló and oca 2016 velocity magnitude and profile along tank radius were analyzed theoretically and measured experimentally with the influence of fish living in the velocity profiles in their studies are quite different from those in 13 due to a vertical supporting cylinder above the exit on the tank bottom 1 also studied the rotating flow in a steady circular tank numerically with the rng k ε turbulent model they found that the thickness of the boundary layer is proportional to the diameter of the cylinder tank the influence of swimming fishes on velocity magnitude was studied by masaló et al 2008 by measuring the velocity with acoustic doppler velocimetry adv devices they concluded that swimming fish decreases water velocity magnitude reduces water exchanging efficiency oca and masaló 2007 masaló and oca 2016 besides 5 numerically investigated different inlet configurations to optimize the flow pattern inside a floating cylindrical tank gorle et al 2019 studied the effect of inlet nozzles angle on the velocity field in an octagonal tank the inlets are distributed from the bottom to the water surface with equal distance their results show that the inflow with a radial component improves the mixing and flow uniformity as indicated above the velocity magnitude and the uniformity are influenced by the shape of a tank the inlet flux and direction however for marine based aquaculture system the effect of sloshing on the interior water under the excitation of waves is more important researches in maritime engineering help designers to mitigate sloshing and slamming by dividing tanks with small free surface area or adding baffles to dissipate liquid kinetic energy however for aquaculture systems space should be guaranteed and no baffle is recommended besides the interior water should flow either being driven by pumping flux or motions of a closed system instead of keeping steady even though the ship borne aquaculture system faces insufficient basic knowledge and application experiences such a platform gets increasing attention by the ministry of natural resources of the people s republic of china mnrprc 2019 therefore this paper will focus on the flow field in a closed tank with a free water surface in different rolling states the water exchanging efficiency and velocity distribution are analyzed numerically with the solver flow3d which has successfully been applied for slamming and sloshing phenomena in lng containers kim 2001 lee et al 2005 2007 and fuel container of aerospace craft li et al 2011 fries et al 2012 konopka et al 2016 the statistical method is used to evaluate the flow characteristics in the rolling tank this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the geometric information of the aquaculture vessel and the tank deployment numerical models and validations are described in section 3 in section 4 the numerical setup are introduced and grid convergence are made a series of numerical simulations are conducted and results are analyzed in section 5 statistical methods are firstly introduced in this paper as far as we know to analyze the probability density of velocity magnitude and its cumulative density deformation of water surface and velocity variation are shown in a rolling period in section 6 conclusions are summarized based on the numerical simulations 2 description of the aquaculture vessel the length over all and that between the two perpendiculars of the fishing vessel are 249 8 m and 241 0 m respectively the molded breadth and depth are 45 0 and 18 5 m with the designed draft being 12 0 m as illustrated by fig 1 tanks are deployed symmetrically from bow to stern except the one on the bow part the distance between the longitudinal section in the central plane of the vessel and the nearest wall of the tank is symmetrically 1 0 m the present study used a full size octagonal tank in an aquaculture vessel with a dimension of 22 2 m long 19 5 m wide 20 25 m deep the tank contracts from 15 75 m to the top of the tank to alleviate sloshing the filling water depth is 14 50 m and the elevation of water depth is 16 50 m considering the length l 19 5 m as the typical geometry parameter the first order natural period estimated by eq 13 is about 3 60 s a three dimensional view of the tank is shown in fig 2 the inlets are set at the lateral wall to generate rotating flow which is the same as that of land based aquaculture the diameter of the inlet pipe is 0 4 m there are three pipes in line that are composed of the inlet on each wall water is pumped into the tank through the inlets near the water surface and drained through the bottom outlet from the tank bottom to the center of inlets the vertical length is 12 00 m and the center of inlets is 2 50 m beneath the steady water surface 3 numerical model generally numerical models are developed based on a body fitted mesh which requires a complicated transformation of the governing equations however in the cartesian coordinate system the expression of governing equations is quite simple and straightforward in the present study the three dimensional incompressible flow is described by the continuity equation and the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations with the rng k ε turbulent model all equations in flow3d are formulated with area and volume porosity functions which is called f a v o r t m for fractional area volume obstacle representation method hirt and sicilian 1985 3 1 governing equations for incompressible flow in cartesian coordinates the

boundary layer region turbulent values at such kind of rigid boundary are deduced from the wall function the logarithmic law approximation 10 u u 1 κ l n ρ u d μ 5 0 where κ is the von karman constant d is the vertical distance from the wall surface to the adjacent cell filled with fluid u is the local shear velocity and is calculated iteratively for the wall surface with a mass source u is modified by being added an extra term equal to the effective normal inlet speed of the source then the turbulence kinematic energy and its dissipation rate are calculated explicitly 3 3 fluid interface and residence time the volume of fluid vof advection options are used to control how the fluid fraction is moved through the mesh by defining a function f x y z t to configure the fluid as shown in 7 the volume fraction of the main phase satisfies the equation 11 f t 1 v f f a x u x f a y v y f a z w z f s o r where the term f s o r corresponds to the mass source r s o r in eq 1 and is the time rate of change of the volume fraction of the main phase for a single fluid f represents the volume fraction occupied by the fluid sometimes it is helpful to know how long the fluid particles move through the computational domain for this purpose the residence time s is defined it can be calculated from 12 s t u s x v s y w s z 1 the unit of s is time the initial value of s for any fluid particle entering the computational domain is zero they decrease when fluid entering the computational domain from an inlet boundary or a source 3 4 model validation the validation of the numerical models described above is performed for the flow in a rolling tank by comparing it with the experimental data in 18 the rolling amplitude is 5 both the length l and width w of the rolling tank are 1 0 m and the filling depths d are 0 30 m and 0 45 m according to the linear sloshing theory the first order natural angular frequency ω 0 of a bare tank under a particular filling level can be described by 13 ω 0 2 g π l tanh π d l four rolling frequencies are studied ω ω 0 0 35 0 65 0 80 and 1 10 the rolling center is placed at the bottom center of the tank three pressure sensors are set on the wall of the tank and the vertical distance of these sensors from the tank bottom is 0 20 m one sensor is on the left tank wall the others are on the front side with identical horizontal distance 0 25 m from the rolling axis the sampling frequency of these pressure sensors is 100 hz a comparison between our numerical results and the experimental data is shown in fig 4 despite a few discrepancies especially for cases with the external frequency exceeding the first order natural frequency our numerical results agree well with those experimental data this indicates the numerical solver is effective in solving the sloshing problems 4 numerical setup in flow3d the computational domain covers 11 1 11 1 m along the x axis bow stern 1 0 20 5 m along the y axis port starboard and 2 0 22 25 m along the z axis bottom hatch as shown in fig 5 even with a mesh size of d x 0 20 m the geometry of the tank wall and water interface can be well reconstructed using f a v o r t m method the mesh cells occupied by the tank cavity are filled with water and the fluid fraction is unity gray part of panel b and blue part of panel c the mesh cells occupied by the tank wall are empty white part of panel b and panel c gray part of panel a and panel d and the fluid fraction is void the unity of the rest cells which are not filled with water is the fluid solid interface and the no slip boundary condition is imposed the shape and direction of the mass momentum source can be arbitrary and in this paper the geometric shape of sources are circles with the normal directions parallel with coordinate axes constant flow rates are imposed on four sources surface and a sink surface as illustrated in figs 2 and 5 when the draft of the aquaculture vessel is 14 00 m the height of the transverse meta center is 21 44 m above the keel in the coordinate system of this computational domain the coordinate is 0 0 21 44 in the numerical model the inlet and exit of water are realized via mass momentum source and sink and the total flux of water entering a tank is 4500 m 3 h four sources and one sink i e r s o r in eqs 1 and 2 with circular surfaces are added at the exact locations of the pipe entrance and exit the water drain keeps balance with the entry for numerical simulations rolling angles are assumed to be 5 7 10 and 12 when rolling period keeps constant as 10 s moreover for simulations with the rolling angle being 7 the rolling periods are 5 s 7 s 10 s and 12 s the rolling motion is achieved in the numerical solver in a non inertial reference frame the renormalized group k ε turbulent model is used and the grid size is uniform for all simulations the time step is adaptive under the cfl condition being 0 45 for pressure and viscous stress solver options the implicit and the explicit solver are employed respectively the second order monotonicity preserving scheme is used for the advection terms in the momentum equations which is very useful for swirling flows with a free surface the free surface is simulated using the single phase vof model mesh sensitivity studies are conducted for a case with the rolling period being 10 s and angle being 7 the resolution of mesh cells is uniform and the size of meshes are 0 10 m 0 20 m and 0 40 m with the cell number of the densest mesh 8 78 million three different sets of meshes are used to calculate this case for 500 s fig 6 shows the velocity magnitude recorded at 0 4 25 10 m after about 450 s the water velocity magnitude reaches a periodic state between 490 s and 500 s the velocity peaks are 0 885 m s 0 847 m s and 0 753 m s for different mesh resolutions the kinetic energy of water e 0 5 ρ u i 2 in the tank at 500 s are 2 54 1 0 6 j 2 43 1 0 6 j and 2 10 1 0 6 j by assuming the results of mesh resolution 0 10 m as the standard one the accuracy of the velocity and kinetic energy for mesh size 0 20 m are 95 7 and 95 7 respectively while for mesh size 0 40 m the accuracy of the velocity and the kinetic energy are 85 1 and 82 7 therefore the cell size 0 20 m is chosen for the following studies after balancing accuracy and efficiency 5 results and discussion detailed flow fields can be investigated according to the temporal spatial distribution of velocities along different sections distribution such as velocity magnitude can be obtained this is more meaningful to assess whether the water environment is suitable to fish or not in addition the statistics of long time water quality is another issue for an aqua cultural vessel probability analysis is employed to evaluate water quality 5 1 effect of inlet fig 7 presents the quite different velocity magnitude distribution along y axis for different simulations with inlet roll and the combination in detail the total water in an aquaculture tank must be recycled to make water quality suitable for fish thus water inlets and outlets driven by water pumps are essential for tank under rolling excitation with and without inlets velocity magnitude distributions along a slice section are shown in fig 8 for the simulation with only inlets water velocity magnitude increases from the vertical central region to the region near the tank wall water circulation driven by four inlets causes this phenomenon besides the velocity magnitude is also comparatively large near the bottom where there is a sink under the driving of inlets the maximum water velocity of water in the tank is about 0 2 m s for the simulation only with roll the velocity distribution is different from that in the pure inlets simulation sine the tank rolls in y o z plane there is a region where water velocity is small and this region is perpendicular to the rolling plane at the instant when the tank is on an even keel state a comparatively large velocity magnitude is distributed near the tank wall and the sink the maximum velocity induced by the roll is about 0 8 m s for simulations with both inlets and roll the distribution of velocity is similar to that in the simulation with the only roll as illustrated in fig 8 besides the velocity magnitude the residence time of water is also a key parameter for aquaculture production the distribution of the residence time in fig 9 strongly correlates with the distribution of velocity magnitude that is the larger the velocity magnitude the smaller the residence time the flow characteristics can be illustrated by the distribution of velocity magnitude and residence time at a special instant to some extent as shown in figs 8 and 9 the statistical analysis of the velocity and residence time provides another efficient way to evaluate the flow condition in an aquaculture tank directly fig 10 shows the probability density and the cumulative probability density for velocity magnitude and residence time of water in the tank after 4000 s as shown in fig 10 a the cumulative probability density of velocity keeps almost identical the v 90 and v 99 subscript indicates the cumulative probability density of the water in the steady tank are 0 12 m s and 0 19 m s respectively statistical results of water residence time are shown in fig 10 b the cumulative probability density of water residence time is almost 1 when the cumulative residence time exceeds 4000 s the t 90 and t 99 are 3712 s and 4044 s respectively and t 99 is close to the draining time water volume is 5610 m 3 water flux is 4500 m 3 h the draining time is about 4500 s the mechanical energy of water in the tank consists of the kinetic part and the gravitational potential part and they transform mutually during the rolling process in one rolling period the variation of water velocity is shown in fig 11 tank rolls clockwise around x axis from the starboard side to even keel state and then to the port side from 0 75 t to 0 00 t and then to 0 25 t t is the rolling period during this time segment water velocity firstly increases and then decreases due to the transformation between the kinetic energy and the gravitational potential energy from 0 25 t to 0 75 t tank rolls anticlockwise from the port side to the starboard side although rolling is eccentric there still is a zone along the rolling axis where velocity is low in the middle of the tank and this zone emerges and disappears periodically which can be more easily noticed in fig 12 this implies that the inlet flow is relatively weak when being compared with the flows induced by the rolling motion moreover velocity near the port wall the starboard wall the bottom exit and the free surface is usually large streamlines as shown in fig 13 of water circulate around the zone where velocity magnitude is small the direction of streamlines is inverted from 0 00 t to 0 50 t although water inlet into the tank drives the water rotating clockwise around the z axis there is no obvious flow pattern rotating along the z axis in fig 13 moreover apart from the low velocity region in the middle of the tank the low velocity also exists near the conjunction of the vertical walls and the bottom which has an influence on the waste collection 5 2 effect of rolling angle the effect of rolling angle on the velocity magnitude and residence time is illustrated for θ 5 7 10 and 12 the rolling period is 10 s for all numerical simulations fig 14 shows the statistical results of velocity and residence time as seen in fig 14 a the characteristic velocities by statistical analysis are obviously dependent on the rolling angle the increase of the rolling angle results in the probability of a larger velocity in the tank fig 15 a illustrates the nearly linear increase of velocities as rolling angles increase by contrast the water residence time is not sensitive to the rolling angle shown in fig 14 b the residence time t 90 decrease slightly and the median residence time t m e d i a n seldom vary as shown in fig 15 b table 1 shows the characteristic velocity and time under different rolling angles the velocity v 90 increase from 0 44 m s to 1 20 m s and the median velocity v m e d i a n increase from 0 28 m s to 0 76 m s the residence time t 90 just decreases slightly from 3878 s to 3477 s and the median residence time t m e d i a n are approximate 2750 s in fig 16 distributions of velocity magnitude along a slice section for simulations with different rolling angles are shown 0 00 t and 0 50 t are two seconds when the tank is even keel but roll to the opposite direction 0 25 t and 0 75 t are two seconds when the tank rolls to the far port and far starboard position for simulations when the rolling angle exceeds 10 the region with a large velocity magnitude should be cautious during aquaculture production 5 3 effect of rolling period the effect of the rolling period on the velocity magnitude and residence time is illustrated for t 5 7 10 and 12 s the rolling angle is 7 for all simulations fig 17 shows the statistical results of the velocity and residence time for simulations with different rolling periods both of them are sensitive to the rolling period in fig 17 a the increase of the rolling period results in the probability of a smaller velocity in the tank the velocity v 90 and the median velocity v m e d i a n decrease dramatically as the rolling period increases as shown in fig 18 a however as shown in figs 17 b 18 b the residence time decreases specially as shown in table 2 when the rolling angle is 7 the v 90 decrease from 2 37 m s to 0 55 m s with the increasing of rolling periods from 5 s to 12 s and the v m e d i a n also decrease from 1 42 m s to 0 34 m s the residence time t 90 increase from 2876 s to 3788 s the values of t m e d i a n almost does not vary with rolling periods attention should be paid to cases for the rolling period 5 s the density distribution of velocity and residence time deviates from the others due to violent breaking of water surface in fig 19 for simulations whose rolling angle being 7 decreasing the rolling period increases the water velocity especially the water near the free surface when the rolling period being 7 s the water surface breaks at 0 50 t due to high rolling frequency for simulations the rolling period being 10 s flow pattern becomes gradually violent as the rolling angle increases during real aquaculture production rolling angle and period can be controlled by adjusting the level of water in the ballast tank if we assume that the optimum velocity varies between 0 5 m s to 1 0 m s then the simulations 10 s 7 10 s 10 and 12 s 7 are preferable arrangements of the rolling angle and period and measures can be taken to reduce the water volume in the tank where velocity is small usually the rolling period is determined by external environmental factors e g wave period wind and sailing factors e g speed course the rolling angle is affected mainly by the wave slope based on the previous analysis we find water quality is affected by the rolling motion of the fishing tank the effect of the rolling period is stronger than that of the rolling angle as shown in figs 15 and 18 thus for the operation of such aquaculture platform it is critical to choose an appropriate fishing field where the wave and wind are mild the sailing speed and course can be used to change the rolling angle and period 6 conclusion flow characteristics in a prototype aquaculture fishing tank were numerically investigated under typical sea conditions for the water quality analysis statistical analysis of velocity magnitude distribution and residence time provides a direct way to assess the water environment both water inlets and tank rolls affect the flow characteristics of water in the tank the effect of rolls is stronger than that of water inlets for a fixed rolling period rolling angles significantly increase water velocity as the angles increase while the residence time does not sensitive to rolling angles according to our simulations for a fixed rolling angle the water velocity magnitude decreases and the residence time increases as the rolling period increases it is confirmed that there is a low velocity region parallel to the rolling axis in the middle of the tank near the vertical wall boundaries and the bottom velocity is large further optimizations can be conducted to enhance the uniformity of water velocity according to the numerical results of the three dimensional velocity field credit

21421,the fishing platform is expected to be a sustainable method for offshore aquaculture which can avoid fish escapes by using tanks in harsher sea state and meanwhile make use of natural water in this paper the flow characteristics residence time velocity uniformity in a force rolling aquaculture tank are numerically investigated and analyzed by statistical methods through our simulations we find that water inlet and drainage play a limited role in accelerating water velocity magnitude when being compared with the effect of the roll roll accelerates the velocity magnitude of water in the tank and shortens the circulation time for cases with different rolling angles the magnitude of water velocity in the tank is very sensitive to the rolling angle and increases with it for cases with different rolling periods velocity magnitude decreases as rolling periods increase moreover if the rolling period exceeds a threshold such as 10 s in this paper the velocity increment is tiny the residence time of water in the tank seems insensitive to both rolling angle and period for all simulations there is a low velocity region along the rolling axis in the middle of the fishing tank the water inlet slightly affects the volume of this low velocity zone keywords aquaculture tank forced roll residence time velocity uniformity statistical analysis 1 introduction the aquaculture industry is expanding to the open sea where water quality and spacious space favor large scaled aquaculture the key problems with expanding are the safety assessment of farming equipments and the water environment for fish living the net cage system has been paid much more attention in the past decades however the cage has to endure the harsher sea states which may lead to fish escape and facility failure as an alternative the closed fish cage has advantages on better fish welfare and water quality control due to the independent space from surrounding environment olsen 2020 recently a few aquaculture platforms are under construction for the offshore industry in china however the ship borne mariculture system is a newly sprouted thing which indicates the lack of basic knowledge and application experiences there is no answer for sloshing influence on the water interior of the fish tank hence the research on flow characteristics of the fish tank in an aquaculture vessel is crucial for the design and operation of such a large aquaculture platform for aquaculture cage many works have been done to study the hydrodynamic loads usually a cage with nets is moored with sinkers on the lower end of the net while the upper end is fixed on a floating circular ring a drawback of such a cage structure is that the shape of the net is easily affected by environmental factors such as waves currents and winds et al according to the experiments and field survey in 28 and 11 the reduction of the water volume surrounded by nets can reach 20 30 of that of calm water so a cage system with rigid supporting structures was designed fredriksson et al 2008 jurado et al 2018 however water can flow through net holes which bring new problems such as unexpected water quality fish escape and food leakage thus the water surrounded by the net of cages should be baffled from its surrounding environment 27 studied the hydrodynamic loads under external excitation it was manifested that the interior water may suffer from sloshing or swirling waves under different environmental waves which threaten the safety of a closed fish culture system there are many prototype structures with a closed water volume such as the storage tank of oil the water tank above a skyscraper and the vessels for oil and qualified gases many studies are relevant to the safety of containers instead of the water environment inside due to different application background however in the aquaculture engineering lives inside are more sensitive to the velocity uniformity which is affected by the pumping flux and shape of the closed system initially the land based aquaculture industry employs rectangular oca et al 2004 oca and masaló 2007 or circular round masaló et al 2008 oca and masalo 2013 masaló and oca 2016 containers to culture fishes such as zebra bass salmon and shrimp for land aquaculture engineering the rectangular circulating tank was firstly adopted due to manufacturing reasons burrows and chenoweth 1970 found that a rectangular tank is suitable for fish growth due to hydraulic and biological reasons experiments were conducted on a rectangular tank to study the flow velocity and the influence factors for example results in oca and masaló 2007 indicated that the ratio of tank length to width affects the occupation of the low velocity region if it is larger than 1 91 while if it is smaller than 1 43 the effect is unnoticeable meanwhile by employing a rectangular tank with a ratio of length to the width being 3 13 studied the effect of the inlet diameter and the bottom outlet discharge rate on the magnitude and the uniformity of water velocity in the tank provided a constant inlet flux the inlet diameter greatly affects the distribution of water velocity but the bottom outflow does not later 14 15 conducted two dimensional and three dimensional numerical simulations respectively and numerical results agreed with their experimental data experimental and numerical results reveal that the interior water circulates around the vertically central axis the velocity magnitude decreases from the region near the wall to the region near the central axis for a circular fishing tank such as oca and masalo 2013 masaló and oca 2016 velocity magnitude and profile along tank radius were analyzed theoretically and measured experimentally with the influence of fish living in the velocity profiles in their studies are quite different from those in 13 due to a vertical supporting cylinder above the exit on the tank bottom 1 also studied the rotating flow in a steady circular tank numerically with the rng k ε turbulent model they found that the thickness of the boundary layer is proportional to the diameter of the cylinder tank the influence of swimming fishes on velocity magnitude was studied by masaló et al 2008 by measuring the velocity with acoustic doppler velocimetry adv devices they concluded that swimming fish decreases water velocity magnitude reduces water exchanging efficiency oca and masaló 2007 masaló and oca 2016 besides 5 numerically investigated different inlet configurations to optimize the flow pattern inside a floating cylindrical tank gorle et al 2019 studied the effect of inlet nozzles angle on the velocity field in an octagonal tank the inlets are distributed from the bottom to the water surface with equal distance their results show that the inflow with a radial component improves the mixing and flow uniformity as indicated above the velocity magnitude and the uniformity are influenced by the shape of a tank the inlet flux and direction however for marine based aquaculture system the effect of sloshing on the interior water under the excitation of waves is more important researches in maritime engineering help designers to mitigate sloshing and slamming by dividing tanks with small free surface area or adding baffles to dissipate liquid kinetic energy however for aquaculture systems space should be guaranteed and no baffle is recommended besides the interior water should flow either being driven by pumping flux or motions of a closed system instead of keeping steady even though the ship borne aquaculture system faces insufficient basic knowledge and application experiences such a platform gets increasing attention by the ministry of natural resources of the people s republic of china mnrprc 2019 therefore this paper will focus on the flow field in a closed tank with a free water surface in different rolling states the water exchanging efficiency and velocity distribution are analyzed numerically with the solver flow3d which has successfully been applied for slamming and sloshing phenomena in lng containers kim 2001 lee et al 2005 2007 and fuel container of aerospace craft li et al 2011 fries et al 2012 konopka et al 2016 the statistical method is used to evaluate the flow characteristics in the rolling tank this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the geometric information of the aquaculture vessel and the tank deployment numerical models and validations are described in section 3 in section 4 the numerical setup are introduced and grid convergence are made a series of numerical simulations are conducted and results are analyzed in section 5 statistical methods are firstly introduced in this paper as far as we know to analyze the probability density of velocity magnitude and its cumulative density deformation of water surface and velocity variation are shown in a rolling period in section 6 conclusions are summarized based on the numerical simulations 2 description of the aquaculture vessel the length over all and that between the two perpendiculars of the fishing vessel are 249 8 m and 241 0 m respectively the molded breadth and depth are 45 0 and 18 5 m with the designed draft being 12 0 m as illustrated by fig 1 tanks are deployed symmetrically from bow to stern except the one on the bow part the distance between the longitudinal section in

19 5 m as the typical geometry parameter the first order natural period estimated by eq 13 is about 3 60 s a three dimensional view of the tank is shown in fig 2 the inlets are set at the lateral wall to generate rotating flow which is the same as that of land based aquaculture the diameter of the inlet pipe is 0 4 m there are three pipes in line that are composed of the inlet on each wall water is pumped into the tank through the inlets near the water surface and drained through the bottom outlet from the tank bottom to the center of inlets the vertical length is 12 00 m and the center of inlets is 2 50 m beneath the steady water surface 3 numerical model generally numerical models are developed based on a body fitted mesh which requires a complicated transformation of the governing equations however in the cartesian coordinate system the expression of governing equations is quite simple and straightforward in the present study the three dimensional incompressible flow is described by the continuity equation and the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations with the rng k ε turbulent model all equations in flow3d are formulated with area and volume porosity

energy and dissipation rate can be specified directly however at rigid no slip boundaries special considerations are necessary due to the insufficient grid resolution to resolve details of a laminar boundary layer region turbulent values at such kind of rigid boundary are deduced from the wall function the logarithmic law approximation 10 u u 1 κ l n ρ u d μ 5 0 where κ is the von karman constant d is the vertical distance from the wall surface to the adjacent cell filled with fluid u is the local shear velocity and is calculated iteratively for the wall surface with a mass source u is modified by being added an extra term equal to the effective normal inlet speed of the source then the turbulence kinematic energy and its dissipation rate are calculated explicitly 3 3 fluid interface and residence time the volume of fluid vof advection options are used to control how the fluid fraction is moved through the mesh by defining a function f x y z t to configure the fluid as shown in 7 the volume fraction of the main phase satisfies the equation 11 f t 1 v f f a x u x f a y v y f a z w z f s o r where the term f s o r corresponds to the mass source r s o r in eq 1 and is the time rate of change of the volume fraction of the main phase for a single fluid f represents the volume fraction occupied by the fluid sometimes it is helpful to know how long the fluid particles move through the computational domain for this purpose the residence time s is defined it can be calculated from 12 s t u s x v s y w s z 1 the unit of s is time the initial value of s for any fluid particle entering the computational domain is zero they decrease when fluid entering the computational domain from an inlet boundary or a source 3 4 model validation the validation of the numerical models described above is performed for the flow in a rolling tank by comparing it with the experimental data in 18 the rolling amplitude is 5 both the length l and width w of the rolling tank are 1 0 m and the filling depths d are 0 30 m and 0 45 m according to the linear sloshing theory the first order natural angular frequency ω 0 of a bare tank under a particular filling level can be described by 13 ω 0 2 g π l tanh π d l four rolling frequencies are studied ω ω 0 0 35 0 65 0 80 and 1 10 the rolling center is placed at the bottom center of the tank three pressure sensors are set on the wall of the tank and the vertical distance of these sensors from the tank bottom is 0 20 m one sensor is on the left tank wall the others are on the front side with identical horizontal distance 0 25 m from the rolling axis the sampling frequency of these pressure sensors is 100 hz a comparison between our numerical results and the experimental data is shown in fig 4 despite a few discrepancies especially for cases with the external frequency exceeding the first order natural frequency our numerical results agree well with those experimental data this indicates the numerical solver is effective in solving the sloshing problems 4 numerical setup in flow3d the computational domain covers 11 1 11 1 m along the x axis bow stern 1 0 20 5 m along the y axis port starboard and 2 0 22 25 m along the z axis bottom hatch as shown in fig 5 even with a mesh size of d x 0 20 m the geometry of the tank wall and water interface can be well reconstructed using f a v o r t m method the mesh cells occupied by the tank cavity are filled with water and the fluid fraction is unity gray part of panel b and blue part of panel c the mesh cells occupied by the tank wall are empty white part of panel b and panel c gray part of panel a and panel d and the fluid fraction is void the unity of the rest cells which are not filled with water is the fluid solid interface and the no slip boundary condition is imposed the shape and direction of the mass momentum source can be arbitrary and in this paper the geometric shape of sources are circles with the normal directions parallel with coordinate axes constant flow rates are imposed on four sources surface and a sink surface as illustrated in figs 2 and 5 when the draft of the aquaculture vessel is 14 00 m the height of the transverse meta center is 21 44 m above the keel in the coordinate system of this computational domain the coordinate is 0 0 21 44 in the numerical model the inlet and exit of water are realized via mass momentum source and sink and the total flux of water entering a tank is 4500 m 3 h four sources and one sink i e r s o r in eqs 1 and 2 with circular surfaces are added at the exact locations of the pipe entrance and exit the water drain keeps balance with the entry for numerical simulations rolling angles are assumed to be 5 7 10 and 12 when rolling period keeps constant as 10 s moreover for simulations with the rolling angle being 7 the rolling periods are 5 s 7 s 10 s and 12 s the rolling motion is achieved in the numerical solver in a non inertial reference frame the renormalized group k ε turbulent model is used and the grid size is uniform for all simulations the time step is adaptive under the cfl condition being 0 45 for pressure and viscous stress solver options the implicit and the explicit solver are employed respectively the second order monotonicity preserving scheme is used for the advection terms in the momentum equations which is very useful for swirling flows with a free surface the free surface is simulated using the single phase vof model mesh sensitivity studies are conducted for a case with the rolling period being 10 s and angle being 7 the resolution of mesh cells is uniform and the size of meshes are 0 10 m 0 20 m and 0 40 m with the cell number of the densest mesh 8 78 million three different sets of meshes are used to calculate this case for 500 s fig 6 shows the velocity magnitude recorded at 0 4 25 10 m after about 450 s the water velocity magnitude reaches a periodic state between 490 s and 500 s the velocity peaks are 0 885 m s 0 847 m s and 0 753 m s for different mesh resolutions the kinetic energy of water e 0 5 ρ u i 2 in the tank at 500 s are 2 54 1 0 6 j 2 43 1 0 6 j and 2 10 1 0 6 j by assuming the results of mesh resolution 0 10 m as the standard one the accuracy of the velocity and kinetic energy for mesh size 0 20 m are 95 7 and 95 7 respectively while for mesh size 0 40 m the accuracy of the velocity and the kinetic energy are 85 1 and 82 7 therefore the cell size 0 20 m is chosen for the following studies after balancing accuracy and efficiency 5 results and discussion detailed flow fields can be investigated according to the temporal spatial distribution of velocities along different sections distribution such as velocity magnitude can be obtained this is more meaningful to assess whether the water environment is suitable to fish or not in addition the statistics of long time water quality is another issue for an aqua cultural vessel probability analysis is employed to evaluate water quality 5 1 effect of inlet fig 7 presents the quite different velocity magnitude distribution along y axis for different simulations with inlet roll and the combination in detail the total water in an aquaculture tank must be recycled to make water quality suitable for fish thus water inlets and outlets driven by water pumps are essential for tank under rolling excitation with and without inlets velocity magnitude distributions along a slice section are shown in fig 8 for the simulation with only inlets water velocity magnitude increases from the vertical central region to the region near the tank wall water circulation driven by four inlets causes this phenomenon besides the velocity magnitude is also comparatively large near the bottom where there is a sink under the driving of inlets the maximum water velocity of water in the tank is about 0 2 m s for the simulation only with roll the velocity distribution is different from that in the pure inlets simulation sine the tank rolls in y o z plane there is a region where water velocity is small and this region is perpendicular to the rolling plane at the instant when the tank is on an even keel state a comparatively large velocity magnitude is distributed near the tank wall and the sink the maximum velocity induced by the roll is about 0 8 m s for simulations with both inlets and roll the distribution of velocity is similar to that in the simulation with the only roll as illustrated in fig 8 besides the velocity magnitude the residence time of water is also a key parameter for aquaculture production the distribution of the residence time in fig 9 strongly correlates with the distribution of velocity magnitude that is the larger the velocity magnitude the smaller the residence time the flow characteristics can be illustrated by the distribution of velocity magnitude and residence time at a special instant to some extent as shown in figs 8 and 9 the statistical analysis of the velocity and residence time provides another efficient way to evaluate the flow condition in an aquaculture tank directly fig 10 shows the probability density and the cumulative probability density for velocity magnitude and residence time of water in the tank after 4000 s as shown in fig 10 a the cumulative probability density of velocity keeps almost identical the v 90 and v 99 subscript indicates the cumulative probability density of the water in the steady tank are 0 12 m s and 0 19 m s respectively statistical results of water residence time are shown in fig 10 b the cumulative probability density of water residence time is almost 1 when the cumulative residence time exceeds 4000 s the t 90 and t 99 are 3712 s and 4044 s respectively and t 99 is close to the draining time water volume is 5610 m 3 water flux is 4500 m 3 h the draining time is about 4500 s the mechanical energy of water in the tank consists of the kinetic part and the gravitational potential part and they transform mutually during the rolling process in one rolling period the variation of water velocity is shown in fig 11 tank rolls clockwise around x axis from the starboard side to even keel state and then to the port side from 0 75 t to 0 00 t and then to 0 25 t t is the rolling period during this time segment water velocity firstly increases and then decreases due to the transformation between the kinetic energy and the gravitational potential energy from 0 25 t to 0 75 t tank rolls anticlockwise from the port side to the starboard side although rolling is eccentric there still is a zone along the rolling axis where velocity is low in the middle of the tank and this zone emerges and disappears periodically which can be more easily noticed in fig 12 this implies that the inlet flow is relatively weak when being compared with the flows induced by the rolling motion moreover velocity near the port wall the starboard wall the bottom exit and the free surface is usually large streamlines as shown in fig 13 of water circulate around the zone where velocity magnitude is small the direction of streamlines is inverted from 0 00 t to 0 50 t although water inlet into the tank drives the water rotating clockwise around the z axis there is no obvious flow pattern rotating along the z axis in fig 13 moreover apart from the low velocity region in the middle of the tank the low velocity also exists near the conjunction of the vertical walls and the bottom which has an influence on the waste collection 5 2 effect of rolling angle the effect of rolling angle on the velocity magnitude and residence time is illustrated for θ 5 7 10 and 12 the rolling period is 10 s for all numerical simulations fig 14 shows the statistical results of velocity and residence time as seen in fig 14 a the characteristic velocities by statistical analysis are obviously dependent on the rolling angle the increase of the rolling angle results in the probability of a larger velocity in the tank fig 15 a illustrates the nearly linear increase of velocities as rolling angles increase by contrast the water residence time is not sensitive to the rolling angle shown in fig 14 b the residence time t 90 decrease slightly and the median residence time t m e d i a n seldom vary as shown in fig 15 b table 1 shows the characteristic velocity and time under different rolling angles the velocity v 90 increase from 0 44 m s to 1 20 m s and the median velocity v m e d i a n increase from 0 28 m s to 0 76 m s the residence time t 90 just decreases slightly from 3878 s to 3477 s and the median residence time t m e d i a n are approximate 2750 s in fig 16 distributions of velocity magnitude along a slice section for simulations with different rolling angles are shown 0 00 t and 0 50 t are two seconds when the tank is even keel but roll to the opposite direction 0 25 t and 0 75 t are two seconds when the tank rolls to the far port and far starboard position for simulations when the rolling angle exceeds 10 the region with a large velocity magnitude should be cautious during aquaculture production 5 3 effect of rolling period the effect of the rolling period on the velocity magnitude and residence time is illustrated for t 5 7 10 and 12 s the rolling angle is 7 for all simulations fig 17 shows the statistical results of the velocity and residence time for simulations with different rolling periods both of them are sensitive to the rolling period in fig 17 a the increase of the rolling period results in the probability of a smaller velocity in the tank the velocity v 90 and the median velocity v m e d i a n decrease dramatically as the rolling period increases as shown in fig 18 a however as shown in figs 17 b 18 b the residence time decreases specially as shown in table 2 when the rolling angle is 7 the v 90 decrease from 2 37 m s to 0 55 m s with the increasing of rolling periods from 5 s to 12 s and the v m e d i a n also decrease from 1 42 m s to 0 34 m s the residence time t 90 increase from 2876 s to 3788 s the values of t m e d i a n almost does not vary with rolling periods attention should be paid to cases for the rolling period 5 s the density distribution of velocity and residence time deviates from the others due to violent breaking of water surface in fig 19 for simulations whose rolling angle being 7 decreasing the rolling period increases the water velocity especially the water near the free surface when the rolling period being 7 s the water surface breaks at 0 50 t due to high rolling frequency for simulations the rolling period being 10 s flow pattern becomes gradually violent as the rolling angle increases during real aquaculture production rolling angle and period can be controlled by adjusting the level of water in the ballast tank if we assume that the optimum velocity varies between 0 5 m s to 1 0 m s then the simulations 10 s 7 10 s 10 and 12 s 7 are preferable arrangements of the rolling angle and period and measures can be taken to reduce the water volume in the tank where velocity is small usually the rolling period is determined by external environmental factors e g wave period wind and sailing factors e g speed course the rolling angle is affected mainly by the wave slope based on the previous analysis we find water quality is affected by the rolling motion of the fishing tank the effect of the rolling period is stronger than that of the rolling angle as shown in figs 15 and 18 thus for the operation of such aquaculture platform it is critical to choose an appropriate fishing field where the wave and wind are mild the sailing speed and course can be used to change the rolling angle and period 6 conclusion flow characteristics in a prototype aquaculture fishing tank were numerically investigated under typical sea conditions for the water quality analysis statistical analysis of velocity magnitude distribution and residence time provides a direct way to assess the water environment both water inlets and tank rolls affect the flow characteristics of water in the tank the effect of rolls is stronger than that of water inlets for a fixed rolling period rolling angles significantly increase water velocity as the angles increase while the residence time does not sensitive to rolling angles according to our simulations for a fixed rolling angle the water velocity magnitude decreases and the residence time increases as the rolling period increases it is confirmed that there is a low velocity region parallel to the rolling axis in the middle of the tank near the vertical wall boundaries and the bottom velocity is large further optimizations can be conducted to enhance the uniformity of water velocity according to the numerical results of the three dimensional velocity field credit

21422,this paper proposes an analytical solution for the dynamic analysis of laterally loaded single piles in sandy soils that considers the effects of sliding and debonding on the pile soil interface these effects have received little attention in earlier studies and usually lead to an overestimate of the dynamic impedances of piles and soil in this paper the pile soil interface is decomposed into three components the bonding sliding and debonding components and the spread of the bonding and sliding areas is associated with the inertial friction angle of the soil around the pile the effects of sliding and debonding of the pile soil interface are investigated by using the radiant stress theory and the convolution method of fourier coefficients the displacement fields and attenuation functions of the soil are then derived by the potential functions the dynamic impedances of the pile top are calculated by the adomian decomposition method the results are presented by contours in both the horizontal and vertical planes and the present solution is validated through comparisons against a finite element simulation and other analytical solutions the influences of related parameters including the load frequency effective inertial friction angle of the soil modulus ratio between the pile and soil and pile slenderness ratio have also been studied in this paper keywords radiant stress sliding debonding displacement field attenuation function dynamic impedance 1 introduction in offshore engineering the design of foundations is an important early stage monopile foundations high platform pile group foundations and jacket foundations are the basic types of foundations that are commonly used among them monopile foundations have strong adaptability to geological and load conditions and have the advantages of a simple structure and convenient design and construction therefore monopile foundations have been widely used in engineering the structures and foundations used for offshore engineering are often subjected to large horizontal forces and bending moments for the monopile foundation the vertical dynamic load bearing capacity easily meets the design requirements lateral dynamic impedances of the pile top become a key factor in the design of foundations however they are often weakened by the influences of sliding and debonding on the interface between the pile and surrounding soil the looseness of the surrounding soil under a long term cyclic load tends to exacerbate these effects approaches used in evaluating this effect include finite element fe and boundary element be formulations the beam on nonlinear winkler foundation method bnwf and the continuum approach fe and be methods are satisfactory and adaptive with high accuracy but have disadvantages of being computationally intensive and time consuming giannakos et al 2012 huang and binshafique 2012 mamoon and banerjee 1992 sarkar and maheshwari 2012 trochanis et al 1991a the bnwf approach is an improvement of the beam on winkler foundation method bwfm and it solves the pile soil interaction by simulating the soil as continuous and independent nonlinear winkler springs the bnwf method has remained the most extensively applied with simple and convenient characteristics empirical expressions for the dynamic response of the pile and the soil under horizontal motion have been proposed by boulanger et al 1999 ashour et al 1998 gerolymos and gazetas 2005 allotey and el naggar 2008 allotey and el naggar 2008 klar 2008 heidari et al 2014 heidari et al 2014 and anoyatis and lemnitzer 2017 further studies of a monopile foundation in sand were provided in hokmabadi et al 2012 xu et al 2013 and kim et al 2015 to assess the influence of local separation of the pile and the soil boulanger et al 1999 introduced a nonlinear closure spring in parallel with a nonlinear drag spring to consist of the gap component allotey and el naggar 2008 and heidari et al 2014 attached no tension springs to both sides of the pile and introduced the assumption of a p y curve to model the effect of gapping however the main drawback of the bnwf method is the difficulty of parameter estimation and determination meanwhile the reliability and accuracy of the approach are deeply dependent on the value of the parameters the continuum approach is stricter and commonly plays a crucial role in providing theoretical references for the bwfm and bnwf nevertheless it has attracted less attention due to its computational complicacy and intricacy the most well known model is from the approach developed by baranov 1967 and revised by novak and nogami 1977 novak and nogami 1977 introduced the potential function to decouple the motion equation and the impedance functions were obtained by the variable separation method on the basis of the work by novak and nogami 1977 shang et al 2007 considered liquid movement and porous seepage continuity the inertia of the fluid motion and the compression of the surrounding soil were taken into account by yu et al 2014 additional information for the layered soil was provided by chau and yang 2005 shadlou and bhattacharya 2014 and more recently by liu et al 2015 the basic model is based on the assumption that the pile soil interface is a continuous surface hence the displacement of the surrounding soil is equal to that of the pile on the pile soil interface it has shown that neglecting the sliding and debonding on the interface overestimated the tension of soil behind the pile in the basic model to address the limitation of the assumption this paper seeks to propose a solution on the basis of the work by he 1990 and han et al 2015 which considered the pile soil interface as a discontinuity among those studies the interface is divided into two parts the bonding area and debonding area with the same arc angle and satisfies the boundary conditions of the displacement or stress a similar assumption is adopted by kong et al 2004 however there is currently no literature to study the spread of the bonding area for different types of soil in addition under real situations partial sliding is likely to occur on the side of the interface mamoon and banerjee 1992 contrary to earlier studies where the fan angle of bonding spread on the interface is assumed to be equal to π an analytical solution dividing the pile soil interface into three parts bonding sliding and debonding areas is proposed in this paper based on the studies of heidari et al 2014 and xu et al 2013 this calculation relates the spread of the bonding and sliding area to the effective internal friction angle the shear stress in the sliding area is considered by using the convolution of fourier coefficients of the normal stress and sign function the theory of radiant stress is introduced to solve the mixed boundary problem on the pile soil interface the displacement field and dynamic impedances of the surrounding soil are obtained from the soil reaction to the lateral motion of the pile the dynamic impedances of the pile are then deduced with the adomian decomposition method the scope of this paper can be decomposed into multiple components i to derive an improved solution considering the effects of sliding and debonding on the pile soil interface ii to validate the present solution on the dynamic analysis of laterally loaded single piles in sandy soils and iii to explain the effects of the main factors 2 analysis model to better understand the behavior of the dynamic interaction for the laterally loaded pile and the surrounding soil the pile soil dynamic interaction model is shown in fig 1 here a solid pile of length l and diameter d is embedded in a homogeneous semi infinite space with sandy soil the deflection of the pile u p z t u p z e i ω t is caused by the horizontal load q t q 0 e i ω t and bending moment m t m 0 e i ω t here z is the buried depth t is the time variable ω is the circular frequency of the vibration source and i is the imaginary unit fig 1 b depicts a slice of the pile soil interface along the depth direction where u r u r r θ z t and u θ u θ r θ z t are the radial and tangential vibration displacements of the surrounding soil σ r σ r r θ z t is the normal stress along r and τ r θ τ r θ r θ z t is the shear stress along θ and perpendicular to r in the soil respectively variable θ is assumed as the arc angle between the normal direction of the pile soil interface and the direction of the pile movement in the local coordinate system shown in fig 1 b the displacements and stresses of the surrounding soil under harmonic vibration are described via eqs 1a and 1b 1a u r r θ z t u r r θ z e i ω t u θ r θ z t u θ r θ z e i ω t 1b σ r r θ z t σ r r θ z e i ω t τ r θ r θ z t τ r θ r θ z e i ω t to ensure the bounded response at infinite radial distances in the local coordinate system above there are boundary conditions at infinity in the horizontal direction 2 lim r u r r θ z 0 lim r u θ r θ z 0 3 properties of the pile soil interface as shown in fig 2 the pile soil interface can be decomposed into three components the frontal bonding area the side sliding area and the debonding area behind the pile during vibration the spread of these components is considered to be a fixed value associated with the effective internal friction angle φ in the soil their properties are associated with the stress level on the pile soil interface ashour et al 1998 for arc angle θ φ φ with the consideration of the dominance of the normal reaction in the soil resistance front of the pile the surrounding soil is considered as bonded with the pile and the radial and tangential displacements are as follows 3 u r r θ z r d 2 u p z cos θ u θ r θ z r d 2 u p z sin θ along the sides of the pile the shear stress plays a major role in the soil reaction for sand the shear stress depends on the normal stress and the effective internal friction angle zhang et al 2005 different types of relationships can be viewed in various studies lin et al 2015 prasad and chari 1999 wong and teh 1995 zhang et al 2005 following the guidelines by zhang et al 2005 and wong and teh 1995 for θ φ π 2 π 2 φ of the pile soil interface where sliding occurs the shear stress and the radial displacement are as follows 4 τ r θ r θ z r d 2 sgn θ tan μ σ r r θ z r d 2 u r r θ z r d 2 u p z cos θ where μ is the friction coefficient between the pile and the soil which depends on the pile type and the effective internal friction angle of the surrounding soil based on the proposed values by kulhawy 1991 and zhang et al 2005 μ tan 0 8 φ has been assigned in this paper it is important to note that in the present solution the friction angle φ is solely adopted to measure the characteristics of pile soil interface for the back of the pile the stresses are likely to be zero or nearly zero prasad and chari 1999 and partial separation between the pile and the soil is possible in this area thus the pile soil interaction is considered as debonding on the back of the pile the stresses in the debonding area can be expressed as follows 5 σ r r θ z r d 2 0 τ r θ r θ z r d 2 0 4 formulation 4 1 governing equations the adverse effect of neglecting the fluid inertia is shown in the work by yu et al 2014 it is noted that it is necessary to consider the fluid inertia in the study of high permeability soil following yu the fluid inertia terms are considered in the governing motion equations as shown below 6a g 2 u r λ g e r g r 2 2 u θ θ u r ρ u r ρ f w r 6b g 2 u θ λ g 1 r e r g r 2 u θ 2 u r θ ρ u θ ρ f w θ where w r and w θ are the radial and tangential displacements of the pore water relative to the surrounding soil ρ and ρ f are the density of the soil and pore water λ and g are the lame constants with λ 2 g ν s 1 2 ν s and ν s is the poisson s ratio of the soil 2 2 r 2 1 r r 1 r 2 2 θ 2 is the laplacian operator for the sandy soil around the pile with high permeability the excess pore water pressure epwp can be assumed to be zero thus both the soil and the pore water are assumed to be incompressible shang et al 2007 the fluid motion equation for the pore water is shown below 7a 1 k d w r ρ f u r ρ f n w r 0 7b 1 k d w θ ρ f u θ ρ f n w θ 0 the seepage continuum equation is as follows 8 e ε 0 where k d and n are the dynamic

ignored and the simplified theory of the euler bernoulli beam has adequate precision hu et al 2004 according to the solution to the euler bernoulli beam the deflection of the pile is solved by using the adomian decomposition method adm lai et al 2008 based on the euler bernoulli simplification theory the motion equation for the deflection of the pile is 35 e p i p 4 z 4 u p z t ρ p a p 2 t 2 u p

solution a comparative analysis is performed to verify the reliability of the present solution several analytical solutions are also used for comparison including the solution proposed by han et al 2015 which divided the pile soil interface into two parts the bonding area and debonding area and the solution proposed by novak and nogami 1977 which assumed the interface acted as a continuity the three dimensional finite element software abaqus is also employed in this study the field of the displacement amplitude and its attenuation functions which have an important significance for the study of pile groups wang et al 2014 are used to compare the influencing zones around the piles with different methods attenuation functions of the radiation damping model proposed by makris and gazetas 1992 are also employed in the comparison upon comparison of the fe simulation and the analytical solutions above the present solution will be used in a follow up paper to analyze the dynamic response of the laterally loaded pile and the surrounding soil 5 1 calculation model the numerical model of the fe simulation is presented in fig 3 the model includes two parts the laterally loaded pile and the surrounding soil to ensure the bounded response at a large radial and depth distance from the center of the pile top the radius of the soil is 10 times the diameter of the pile the depth of the soil is 1 33 times the length of the pile and both the horizontal and bottom boundaries have infinite elements both the pile and the soil are idealized as linear elastic materials trochanis et al 1991b to simulate the process of contact sliding and separation of the pile soil interface a hard contact and penalty algorithm is used to establish the interaction relationship between the laterally loaded pile and the surrounding soil achmus et al 2019 jung et al 2015 the penalty friction coefficient between the pile and the soil is taken as μ tan 0 8 φ kulhawy 1991 both the pile top and tip were free to rotate and translate during vibration the center of the pile top is set as a reference point the reference point is correlated with the top of the pile by using the coupling constraint built in abaqus so that the horizontal load amplitude q 0 10 3 kn with a circular frequency of ω 124 5 rad s is ultimately transmitted to the pile the material properties are presented in table 1 and the same parameters as the fe simulation are adopted for the analytical solutions including the present solution for sand karthigeyan et al 2006 shows that when the deflection of the pile is small the vertical load has very little influence on the lateral response of the pile therefore in this study only a horizontal load is applied while the influence of the vertical load is ignored the nonlinearities because of the soil property and the separation between the pile and the soil known as geometrical nonlinearity have been analyzed in numerical solutions proposed by trochanis et al 1991a and more recently by sarkar and maheshwari 2012 as it mentioned that the nonlinearity of soil property affects the dynamic response of the pile evidently and further reduces the pile impedances on the basis of considering the geometrical nonlinearity the displacement distribution of the soil around the pile is also affected especially on the side of pile this can attribute to the fact that the soil in sliding area is more prone to enters the plastic deformation than the bonding area however the main purpose of the present solution is to study the effect of geometrical nonlinearity theoretically thereby both the pile and the soil are assumed as elastic material in this paper 5 2 results and discussion 5 2 1 displacement field contours of the fields of the horizontal displacement amplitude are shown in figs 4 and 5 the contours are located in the ground surface and the vertical plane at θ 0 of the surrounding soil the size of the influence zone around the pile can be observed from the contour lines it can be observed in figs 4 and 5 that the displacement fields calculated by using the present solution agree more with those generated by the fe simulation than those of the other analytical solutions as shown in fig 4 a b and c the displacement distribution of the soil around the pile under horizontal vibration is concentrated at the front of the pile by contrast the displacement in fig 4 d is relatively small and is more uniformly distributed it is shown that debonding on the back of the pile redistributes the displacement field to a large extent the effect of sliding can be observed by comparing fig 4 b and c under consideration of the sliding on the side of the pile the displacement of the soil decreases with increasing angle θ moreover the displacement tends to decrease more significantly as the angle θ increases fig 5 shows the influence zone in the vertical plane at θ 0 under a certain depth of approximately z 2 5 d the displacement field of the present solution has good agreement with those generated by the finite element simulation as the depth decreases to a value less than z 2 5 d the influence zones generated by all the analytical solutions are relatively large the plane strain model of the soil has an effect on this phenomenon 5 2 2 attenuation functions according to the radiation damping model developed by makris and gazetas 1992 the attenuation function α h r θ is used to describe the displacement field around the vibrating pile the attenuation functions α h r 0 and α h r 90 are affected by the compression and the shear waves that emanate from the pile respectively thus the approximations of α h r 0 and α h r 90 can be expressed as 41a α h r 0 2 r d 1 2 exp ω β s i r d 2 v l a 41b α h r 90 2 r d 1 2 exp ω β s i r d 2 v s where v s g ρ is the velocity of the shear wave and v l a 3 4 v s π 1 ν s is the lysmer s analog velocity dobry and gazetas 1988 β s is the radiation damping of the soil and is adopted as zero in this paper in fig 6 the attenuation function α h r θ calculated by the above methods is compared with those available from makris and gazetas 1992 as shown in fig 6 a agreement between the present solution and the method proposed by gazetas is quite good for the attenuation function in the motion direction θ 0 on the side of the pile the values of the attenuation function in the side direction θ 90 of the previous analytical solutions are obviously overestimated because they do not take into account the behavior of sliding on the pile soil interface this trend is more pronounced near the pile and the deviation is stronger with decreasing radial coordinate r the maximum deviation can be observed on the pile soil interface where the attenuation function α h r 90 calculated by the present solution is approximately 56 of those in previous studies 5 2 3 dynamic impedances the effects of the dimensionless frequency a 0 on the dynamic impedances of the pile top and surrounding soil are investigated in fig 7 the dimensionless frequency a 0 which is presented by novak and nogami 1977 as a 0 ω d 2 v s is used in the previous analytical solutions as shown in fig 7 a neglecting the effects of sliding and debonding on the pile soil interface overestimates the dynamic impedances of the soil in earlier studies the deviation increases as the frequency increases as shown in fig 7 b c and d the dynamic impedances of the pile top are also overestimated in earlier studies as the frequency increases the deviation of the dynamic stiffnesses of the pile top increases and the deviation of the dynamic damping decreases this implies that the effects of sliding and debonding on the phase of the pile movement decrease with increasing frequency and those effects on the displacement amplitude of the pile movement increase 6 analysis of the influencing factors 6 1 dimensionless frequencies contours of the field of the horizontal displacement amplitude located in the ground surface with different dimensionless frequencies are shown in fig 8 the attenuation functions of the displacement field are shown in fig 10 it is shown that as the frequency increases the influence zone of the surrounding soil in the ground surface generally shrinks but diffuses to the side of the pile at a high frequency it is also interesting to note that in the motion direction θ 0 as the frequency increases the near field r 2 d displacement continues to decrease and tends to stabilize at a high frequency the relationship is the opposite in the side direction θ 90 the displacement of the far field r 2 d decreases and stabilizes at a high frequency with increasing frequency this implies that the influence of debonding is dominant at low frequencies and that the effect of sliding is increasingly prominent as the frequency increases contours of the field of the horizontal displacement amplitude located in the vertical plane at θ 0 with different dimensionless frequencies are shown in fig 9 it can be observed that the energy of the pile increases with the frequency increase in addition under a high vibration frequency the main movement of the pile is translation parallel to the load direction which commonly leads to an increase in the influence depth the relationship of the dimensionless frequencies to the dynamic impedances of the pile top under several stiffness ratios between the pile and the soil is investigated in fig 11 as shown in fig 11 the dynamic impedances of the pile top decrease with increasing stiffness ratio and the variations in the dynamic impedances with the dimensionless frequency are uniform under various modulus ratios it is important to note that unlike other impedances of the pile top the rocking impedances remain constant at a high frequency this implies that under a high frequency horizontal movement is more prone to occur on the top of the laterally loaded pile 6 2 effective internal friction angle contours of the field of the horizontal displacement amplitude located in the ground surface with different effective internal friction angles φ of the surrounding soil are shown in fig 12 attenuation functions of the displacement field are shown in fig 14 as shown in fig 12 the effect of the friction angle on the displacement field is mainly concentrated in a small area near the pile displacement in the sides of the pile decreases with increasing friction angle and increases in the front of the pile it can also be observed in fig 14 that as the friction angle increases from 30 to 44 the attenuation functions increase from 0 to 6 95 in the motion direction and decrease from 15 69 to 7 30 in the side direction moreover the displacements in the far field r 2 d are approximately identical under different friction angles contours of the field of the horizontal displacement amplitude located in the vertical plane at θ 0 with different friction angles of the surrounding soil are shown in fig 13 it can be observed that the influence depth decreases with increasing friction angle the relationship of the dimensionless frequency to the dynamic impedances under different effective internal friction angles φ is shown in fig 15 as the friction angle increases the dynamic impedances of the pile top commonly increase and the deviation of the dynamic stiffnesses increases however the deviation in the dynamic damping decreases as the friction angle increases a significant difference can be observed at a high frequency in fig 15 c and d the rocking and horizontal rocking dynamic damping decrease with increasing friction angle 6 3 slenderness ratio the influence of the slenderness ratio l d on the dynamic impedances of the pile top is investigated in fig 16 under the condition that the tip is free as the slenderness ratio increases the dynamic impedances of the pile top gradually increase when the slenderness ratio is l d 10 the dynamic impedances will fluctuate with increasing aspect ratio the fluctuation range is much larger in the vertical direction with a lower soil shear modulus e e s 3000 than that with a higher soil shear modulus this indicates that the shear stiffness of the soil plays a negative role on the influence depth as shown in fig 16 a and b the horizontal impedances of the pile top tend to stabilize under the slenderness ratio l d 10 much larger ranges of the influence depth can be observed in the rocking and horizontal rocking impedances especially for a low shear modulus e e s 3000 thus when the laterally loaded pile is located in loose sand to avoid the rocking of the pile the length of the pile needs to be appropriately increased under the condition of a fixed tip as the slenderness ratio increases a weakened phenomenon of the dynamic stiffness of the pile top is observed in fig 16 in contrast the dynamic damping increases with increasing slenderness ratio it is shown that the deflection of the pile is limited by the fixity of the pile tip beyond that the energy dissipation in the pile movement is also weakened in addition the influence depth is not affected by the boundary conditions of the pile tip 7 conclusion an analytical solution is developed for the dynamic response of laterally loaded single piles in sandy soils contrary to the previous analytical solutions the variety of the effective internal friction angle of soil is considered in the present solution the effect of sliding on the side of the pile is also taken into account it is also important to note that the present solution is compatible for sandy soil not cohesive soil such as clay on the one hand the shear stress on the pile soil interface is influenced by the cohesion of the soil on the other hand the dynamic response in highly compressible soil could be significantly affected by the excess pore water pressure epwp the main findings of this study can be summarized as follows a compared to the previous analytical solutions the present solution generally performs with better proximity to the deflection of the pile top in the fe simulation significant discrepancies from the present solution to previous analytical solutions can be observed in the displacement field attenuation functions and dynamic impedances conclusively neglecting the effects of sliding and debonding the dynamic response of the laterally loaded pile and the surrounding soil are overestimated in earlier studies b compared to the fe simulation the present solution is simple and efficient and the error induced by the size and category of the mesh is avoided in addition the decay of the response at infinite radial distances is smoother than the infinite element or viscoelastic boundaries in the fe simulation c it is found that for the analysis of the dynamic response of the laterally loaded pile and the surrounding soil the stiffness ratio between the pile and the soil is the main factor the exciting frequency and the slenderness ratio also play an important role in the high frequency and short length of the pile compared with other factors the influence of the effective internal friction angle of the surrounding soil is relatively small but still considerable as shown in this paper the dynamic analysis of laterally loaded single piles in sandy soils generated by the present solution is improved and the displacement fields and attenuation functions of the surrounding soil are conveniently applied to the analysis of pile groups it is emphasized however the present solution is limited by the linearity of the pile and the soil which often significantly affect the dynamic responses of the pile and the soil therefore the present solution must be modified before applied to nonlinear case moreover the present solution may be extended to solve the nonlinearity of soil property involving viscoelasticity nonlinear elastic and elastoplasticity by introducing the approximate assumptions and iteration approaches such as equivalent linearization

21422,this paper proposes an analytical solution for the dynamic analysis of laterally loaded single piles in sandy soils that considers the effects of sliding and debonding on the pile soil interface these effects have received little attention in earlier studies and usually lead to an overestimate of the dynamic impedances of piles and soil in this paper the pile soil interface is decomposed into three components the bonding sliding and debonding components and the spread of the bonding and sliding areas is associated with the inertial friction angle of the soil around the pile the effects of sliding and debonding of the pile soil interface are investigated by using the radiant stress theory and the convolution method of fourier coefficients the displacement fields and attenuation functions of the soil are then derived by the potential functions the dynamic impedances of the pile top are calculated by the adomian decomposition method the results are presented by contours in both the horizontal and vertical planes and the present solution is validated through comparisons against a finite element simulation and other analytical solutions the influences of related parameters including the load frequency effective inertial friction angle of the soil modulus ratio between the pile and soil and pile slenderness ratio have also been studied in this paper keywords radiant stress sliding debonding displacement field attenuation function dynamic impedance 1 introduction in offshore engineering the design of foundations is an important early stage monopile foundations high platform pile group foundations and jacket foundations are the basic types of foundations that are commonly used among them monopile foundations have strong adaptability to geological and load conditions and have the advantages of a simple structure and convenient design and construction therefore monopile foundations have been widely used in engineering the structures and foundations used for offshore engineering are often subjected to large horizontal forces and bending moments for the monopile foundation the vertical dynamic load bearing capacity easily meets the design requirements lateral dynamic impedances of the pile top become a key factor in the design of foundations however they are often weakened by the influences of sliding and debonding on the interface between the pile and surrounding soil the looseness of the surrounding soil under a long term cyclic load tends to exacerbate these effects approaches used in evaluating this effect include finite element fe and boundary element be formulations the beam on nonlinear winkler foundation method bnwf and the continuum approach fe and be methods are satisfactory and adaptive with high accuracy but have disadvantages of being computationally intensive and time consuming giannakos et al 2012 huang and binshafique 2012 mamoon and banerjee 1992 sarkar and maheshwari 2012 trochanis et al 1991a the bnwf approach is an improvement of the beam on winkler foundation method bwfm and it solves the pile soil interaction by simulating the soil as continuous and independent nonlinear winkler springs the bnwf method has remained the most extensively applied with simple and convenient characteristics empirical expressions for the dynamic response of the pile and the soil under horizontal motion have been proposed by boulanger et al 1999 ashour et al 1998 gerolymos and gazetas 2005 allotey and el naggar 2008 allotey and el naggar 2008 klar 2008 heidari et al 2014 heidari et al 2014 and anoyatis and lemnitzer 2017 further studies of a monopile foundation in sand were provided in hokmabadi et al 2012 xu et al 2013 and kim et al 2015 to assess the influence of local separation of the pile and the soil boulanger et al 1999 introduced a nonlinear closure spring in parallel with a nonlinear drag spring to consist of the gap component allotey and el naggar 2008 and heidari et al 2014 attached no tension springs to both sides of the pile and introduced the assumption of a p y curve to model the effect of gapping however the main drawback of the bnwf method is the difficulty of parameter estimation and determination meanwhile the reliability and accuracy of the approach are deeply dependent on the value of the parameters the continuum approach is stricter and commonly plays a crucial role in providing theoretical references for the bwfm and bnwf nevertheless it has attracted less attention due to its computational complicacy and intricacy the most well known model is from the approach developed by baranov 1967 and revised by novak and nogami 1977 novak and nogami 1977 introduced the potential function to decouple the motion equation and the impedance functions were obtained by the variable separation method on the basis of the work by novak and nogami 1977 shang et al 2007 considered liquid movement and porous seepage continuity the inertia of the fluid motion and the compression of the surrounding soil were taken into account by yu et al 2014 additional information for the layered soil was provided by chau and yang 2005 shadlou and bhattacharya 2014 and more recently by liu et al 2015 the basic model is based on the assumption that the pile soil interface is a continuous surface hence the displacement of the surrounding soil is equal to that of the pile on the pile soil interface it has shown that neglecting the sliding and debonding on the interface overestimated the tension of soil behind the pile in the basic model to address the limitation of the assumption this paper seeks to propose a solution on the basis of the work by he 1990 and han et al 2015 which considered the pile soil interface as a discontinuity among those studies the interface is divided into two parts the bonding area and debonding area with the same arc angle and satisfies the boundary conditions of the displacement or stress a similar assumption is adopted by kong et al 2004 however there is currently no literature to study the spread of the bonding area for different types of soil in addition under real situations partial sliding is likely to occur on the side of the interface mamoon and banerjee 1992 contrary to earlier studies where the fan angle of bonding spread on the interface is assumed to be equal to π an analytical solution dividing the pile soil interface into three parts bonding sliding and debonding areas is proposed in this paper based on the studies of heidari et al 2014 and xu et al 2013 this calculation relates the spread of the bonding and sliding area to the effective internal friction angle the shear stress in the sliding area is considered by using the convolution of fourier coefficients of the normal stress and sign function the theory of radiant stress is introduced to solve the mixed boundary problem on the pile soil interface the displacement field and dynamic impedances of the surrounding soil are obtained from the soil reaction to the lateral motion of the pile the dynamic impedances of the pile are then deduced with the adomian decomposition method the scope of this paper can be decomposed into multiple components i to derive an improved solution considering the effects of sliding and debonding on the pile soil interface ii to validate the present solution on the dynamic analysis of laterally loaded single piles in sandy soils and iii to explain the effects of the main factors 2 analysis model to better understand the behavior of the dynamic interaction for the laterally loaded pile and the surrounding soil the pile soil dynamic interaction model is shown in fig 1 here a solid pile of length l and diameter d is embedded in a homogeneous semi infinite space with sandy soil the deflection of the pile u p z t u p z e i ω t is caused by the horizontal load q t q 0 e i ω t and bending moment m t m 0 e i ω t here z is the buried depth t is the time variable ω is the circular frequency of the vibration source and i is the imaginary unit fig 1 b depicts a slice of the pile soil interface along the depth direction where u r u r r θ z t and u θ u θ r θ z t are the radial and tangential vibration displacements of the surrounding soil σ r σ r r θ z t is the normal stress along r and τ r θ τ r θ r θ z t is the shear stress along θ and perpendicular to r in the soil respectively variable θ is assumed as the arc angle between the normal direction of the pile soil interface and the direction of the pile movement in the local coordinate system shown in fig 1 b the displacements and stresses of the surrounding soil under harmonic vibration are described via eqs 1a and 1b 1a u r r θ z t u r r θ z e i ω t u θ r θ z t u θ r θ z e i ω t 1b σ r r θ z t σ r r θ z e i ω t τ r θ r θ z t τ r θ r θ z e i ω t to ensure the bounded response at infinite radial distances in the local coordinate system above there are boundary conditions at infinity in the horizontal direction 2 lim r u r r θ z 0 lim r u θ r θ z 0 3 properties of the pile soil interface as shown in fig 2 the pile soil interface can be decomposed into three components the frontal bonding area the side sliding area and the debonding area behind the pile during vibration the spread of these components is considered to be a fixed value associated with the effective internal friction angle φ in the soil their properties are associated with the stress level on the pile soil interface ashour et al 1998 for arc angle θ φ φ with the consideration of the dominance of the normal reaction in the soil resistance front of the pile the surrounding soil is considered as bonded with the pile and the radial and tangential displacements are as follows 3 u r r θ z r d 2 u p z cos θ u θ r θ z r d 2 u p z sin θ along the sides of the pile the shear stress plays a major role in the soil reaction for sand the shear stress depends on the normal stress and the effective internal friction angle zhang et al 2005 different types of relationships can be viewed in various studies lin et al 2015 prasad and chari 1999 wong and teh 1995 zhang et al 2005 following the guidelines by zhang et al 2005 and wong and teh 1995 for θ φ π 2 π 2 φ of the pile soil interface where sliding occurs the shear stress and the radial displacement are as follows 4 τ r θ r θ z r d 2 sgn θ tan μ σ r r θ z r d 2 u r r θ z r d 2 u p z cos θ where μ is the friction coefficient between the pile and the soil which depends on the pile type and the effective internal friction angle of the surrounding soil based on the proposed values by kulhawy 1991 and zhang et al 2005 μ tan 0 8 φ has been assigned in this paper it is important to note that in the present solution the friction angle φ is solely adopted to measure the characteristics of pile soil interface for the back of the pile the stresses are likely to be zero or nearly zero prasad and chari 1999 and partial separation between the pile and the soil is possible in this area thus the pile soil interaction is considered as debonding on the back of the pile the stresses in the debonding area can be expressed as follows 5 σ r r θ z r d 2 0 τ r θ r θ z r d 2 0 4 formulation 4 1 governing equations the adverse effect of neglecting the fluid inertia is shown in the work by yu et al 2014 it is noted that it is necessary to consider the

are shown in appendix c 4 3 calculation of the dynamic impedances of the pile top previous studies have shown that shear deformation and rotary inertia have little effect on pile deflection and can be ignored and the simplified theory of the euler bernoulli beam has adequate precision hu et al 2004 according to the solution to the euler bernoulli beam the deflection of the pile is solved by using the adomian decomposition method adm lai et al 2008 based on the euler bernoulli simplification theory the motion equation for the deflection of the pile is 35 e p i p 4 z 4 u p z t ρ p a p 2 t 2 u p

solution a comparative analysis is performed to verify the reliability of the present solution several analytical solutions are also used for comparison including the solution proposed by han et al 2015 which divided the pile soil interface into two parts the bonding area and debonding area and the solution proposed by novak and nogami 1977 which assumed the interface acted as a continuity the three dimensional finite element software abaqus is also employed in this study the field of the displacement amplitude and its attenuation functions which have an important significance for the study of pile groups wang et al 2014 are used to compare the influencing zones around the piles with different methods attenuation functions of the radiation damping model proposed by makris and gazetas 1992 are also employed in the comparison upon comparison of the fe simulation and the analytical solutions above the present solution will be used in a follow up paper to analyze the dynamic response of the laterally loaded pile and the surrounding soil 5 1 calculation model the numerical model of the fe simulation is presented in fig 3 the model includes two parts the laterally loaded pile and the surrounding soil to ensure the bounded response at a large radial and depth distance from the center of the pile top the radius of the soil is 10 times the diameter of the pile the depth of the soil is 1 33 times the length of the pile and both the horizontal and bottom boundaries have infinite elements both the pile and the soil are idealized as linear elastic materials trochanis et al 1991b to simulate the process of contact sliding and separation of the pile soil interface a hard contact and penalty algorithm is used to establish the interaction relationship between the laterally loaded pile and the surrounding soil achmus et al 2019 jung et al 2015 the penalty friction coefficient between the pile and the soil is taken as μ tan 0 8 φ kulhawy 1991 both the pile top and tip were free to rotate and translate during vibration the center of the pile top is set as a reference point the reference point is correlated with the top of the pile by using the coupling constraint built in abaqus so that the horizontal load amplitude q 0 10 3 kn with a circular frequency of ω 124 5 rad s is ultimately transmitted to the pile the material properties are presented in table 1 and the same parameters as the fe simulation are adopted for the analytical solutions including the present solution for sand karthigeyan et al 2006 shows that when the deflection of the pile is small the vertical load has very little influence on the lateral response of the pile therefore in this study only a horizontal load is applied while the influence of the vertical load is ignored the nonlinearities because of the soil property and the separation between the pile and the soil known as geometrical nonlinearity have been analyzed in numerical solutions proposed by trochanis et al 1991a and more recently by sarkar and maheshwari 2012 as it mentioned that the nonlinearity of soil property affects the dynamic response of the pile evidently and further reduces the pile impedances on the basis of considering the geometrical nonlinearity the displacement distribution of the soil around the pile is also affected especially on the side of pile this can attribute to the fact that the soil in sliding area is more prone to enters the plastic deformation than the bonding area however the main purpose of the present solution is to study the effect of geometrical nonlinearity theoretically thereby both the pile and the soil are assumed as elastic material in this paper 5 2 results and discussion 5 2 1 displacement field contours of the fields of the horizontal displacement amplitude are shown in figs 4 and 5 the contours are located in the ground surface and the vertical plane at θ 0 of the surrounding soil the size of the influence zone around the pile can be observed from the contour lines it can be observed in figs 4 and 5 that the displacement fields calculated by using the present solution agree more with those generated by the fe simulation than those of the other analytical solutions as shown in fig 4 a b and c the displacement distribution of the soil around the pile under horizontal vibration is concentrated at the front of the pile by contrast the displacement in fig 4 d is relatively small and is more uniformly distributed it is shown that debonding on the back of the pile redistributes the displacement field to a large extent the effect of sliding can be observed by comparing fig 4 b and c under consideration of the sliding on the side of the pile the displacement of the soil decreases with increasing angle θ moreover the displacement tends to decrease more significantly as the angle θ increases fig 5 shows the influence zone in the vertical plane at θ 0 under a certain depth of approximately z 2 5 d the displacement field of the present solution has good agreement with those generated by the finite element simulation as the depth decreases to a value less than z 2 5 d the influence zones generated by all the analytical solutions are relatively large the plane strain model of the soil has an effect on this phenomenon 5 2 2 attenuation functions according to the radiation damping model developed by makris and gazetas 1992 the attenuation function α h r θ is used to describe the displacement field around the vibrating pile the attenuation functions α h r 0 and α h r 90 are affected by the compression and the shear waves that emanate from the pile respectively thus the approximations of α h r 0 and α h r 90 can be expressed as 41a α h r 0 2 r d 1 2 exp ω β s i r d 2 v l a 41b α h r 90 2 r d 1 2 exp ω β s i r d 2 v s where v s g ρ is the velocity of the shear wave and v l a 3 4 v s π 1 ν s is the lysmer s analog velocity dobry and gazetas 1988 β s is the radiation damping of the soil and is adopted as zero in this paper in fig 6 the attenuation function α h r θ calculated by the above methods is compared with those available from makris and gazetas 1992 as shown in fig 6 a agreement between the present solution and the method proposed by gazetas is quite good for the attenuation function in the motion direction θ 0 on the side of the pile the values of the attenuation function in the side direction θ 90 of the previous analytical solutions are obviously overestimated because they do not take into account the behavior of sliding on the pile soil interface this trend is more pronounced near the pile and the deviation is stronger with decreasing radial coordinate r the maximum deviation can be observed on the pile soil interface where the attenuation function α h r 90 calculated by the present solution is approximately 56 of those in previous studies 5 2 3 dynamic impedances the effects of the dimensionless frequency a 0 on the dynamic impedances of the pile top and surrounding soil are investigated in fig 7 the dimensionless frequency a 0 which is presented by novak and nogami 1977 as a 0 ω d 2 v s is used in the previous analytical solutions as shown in fig 7 a neglecting the effects of sliding and debonding on the pile soil interface overestimates the dynamic impedances of the soil in earlier studies the deviation increases as the frequency increases as shown in fig 7 b c and d the dynamic impedances of the pile top are also overestimated in earlier studies as the frequency increases the deviation of the dynamic stiffnesses of the pile top increases and the deviation of the dynamic damping decreases this implies that the effects of sliding and debonding on the phase of the pile movement decrease with increasing frequency and those effects on the displacement amplitude of the pile movement increase 6 analysis of the influencing factors 6 1 dimensionless frequencies contours of the field of the horizontal displacement amplitude located in the ground surface with different dimensionless frequencies are shown in fig 8 the attenuation functions of the displacement field are shown in fig 10 it is shown that as the frequency increases the influence zone of the surrounding soil in the ground surface generally shrinks but diffuses to the side of the pile at a high frequency it is also interesting to note that in the motion direction θ 0 as the frequency increases the near field r 2 d displacement continues to decrease and tends to stabilize at a high frequency the relationship is the opposite in the side direction θ 90 the displacement of the far field r 2 d decreases and stabilizes at a high frequency with increasing frequency this implies that the influence of debonding is dominant at low frequencies and that the effect of sliding is increasingly prominent as the frequency increases contours of the field of the horizontal displacement amplitude located in the vertical plane at θ 0 with different dimensionless frequencies are shown in fig 9 it can be observed that the energy of the pile increases with the frequency increase in addition under a high vibration frequency the main movement of the pile is translation parallel to the load direction which commonly leads to an increase in the influence depth the relationship of the dimensionless frequencies to the dynamic impedances of the pile top under several stiffness ratios between the pile and the soil is investigated in fig 11 as shown in fig 11 the dynamic impedances of the pile top decrease with increasing stiffness ratio and the variations in the dynamic impedances with the dimensionless frequency are uniform under various modulus ratios it is important to note that unlike other impedances of the pile top the rocking impedances remain constant at a high frequency this implies that under a high frequency horizontal movement is more prone to occur on the top of the laterally loaded pile 6 2 effective internal friction angle contours of the field of the horizontal displacement amplitude located in the ground surface with different effective internal friction angles φ of the surrounding soil are shown in fig 12 attenuation functions of the displacement field are shown in fig 14 as shown in fig 12 the effect of the friction angle on the displacement field is mainly concentrated in a small area near the pile displacement in the sides of the pile decreases with increasing friction angle and increases in the front of the pile it can also be observed in fig 14 that as the friction angle increases from 30 to 44 the attenuation functions increase from 0 to 6 95 in the motion direction and decrease from 15 69 to 7 30 in the side direction moreover the displacements in the far field r 2 d are approximately identical under different friction angles contours of the field of the horizontal displacement amplitude located in the vertical plane at θ 0 with different friction angles of the surrounding soil are shown in fig 13 it can be observed that the influence depth decreases with increasing friction angle the relationship of the dimensionless frequency to the dynamic impedances under different effective internal friction angles φ is shown in fig 15 as the friction angle increases the dynamic impedances of the pile top commonly increase and the deviation of the dynamic stiffnesses increases however the deviation in the dynamic damping decreases as the friction angle increases a significant difference can be observed at a high frequency in fig 15 c and d the rocking and horizontal rocking dynamic damping decrease with increasing friction angle 6 3 slenderness ratio the influence of the slenderness ratio l d on the dynamic impedances of the pile top is investigated in fig 16 under the condition that the tip is free as the slenderness ratio increases the dynamic impedances of the pile top gradually increase when the slenderness ratio is l d 10 the dynamic impedances will fluctuate with increasing aspect ratio the fluctuation range is much larger in the vertical direction with a lower soil shear modulus e e s 3000 than that with a higher soil shear modulus this indicates that the shear stiffness of the soil plays a negative role on the influence depth as shown in fig 16 a and b the horizontal impedances of the pile top tend to stabilize under the slenderness ratio l d 10 much larger ranges of the influence depth can be observed in the rocking and horizontal rocking impedances especially for a low shear modulus e e s 3000 thus when the laterally loaded pile is located in loose sand to avoid the rocking of the pile the length of the pile needs to be appropriately increased under the condition of a fixed tip as the slenderness ratio increases a weakened phenomenon of the dynamic stiffness of the pile top is observed in fig 16 in contrast the dynamic damping increases with increasing slenderness ratio it is shown that the deflection of the pile is limited by the fixity of the pile tip beyond that the energy dissipation in the pile movement is also weakened in addition the influence depth is not affected by the boundary conditions of the pile tip 7 conclusion an analytical solution is developed for the dynamic response of laterally loaded single piles in sandy soils contrary to the previous analytical solutions the variety of the effective internal friction angle of soil is considered in the present solution the effect of sliding on the side of the pile is also taken into account it is also important to note that the present solution is compatible for sandy soil not cohesive soil such as clay on the one hand the shear stress on the pile soil interface is influenced by the cohesion of the soil on the other hand the dynamic response in highly compressible soil could be significantly affected by the excess pore water pressure epwp the main findings of this study can be summarized as follows a compared to the previous analytical solutions the present solution generally performs with better proximity to the deflection of the pile top in the fe simulation significant discrepancies from the present solution to previous analytical solutions can be observed in the displacement field attenuation functions and dynamic impedances conclusively neglecting the effects of sliding and debonding the dynamic response of the laterally loaded pile and the surrounding soil are overestimated in earlier studies b compared to the fe simulation the present solution is simple and efficient and the error induced by the size and category of the mesh is avoided in addition the decay of the response at infinite radial distances is smoother than the infinite element or viscoelastic boundaries in the fe simulation c it is found that for the analysis of the dynamic response of the laterally loaded pile and the surrounding soil the stiffness ratio between the pile and the soil is the main factor the exciting frequency and the slenderness ratio also play an important role in the high frequency and short length of the pile compared with other factors the influence of the effective internal friction angle of the surrounding soil is relatively small but still considerable as shown in this paper the dynamic analysis of laterally loaded single piles in sandy soils generated by the present solution is improved and the displacement fields and attenuation functions of the surrounding soil are conveniently applied to the analysis of pile groups it is emphasized however the present solution is limited by the linearity of the pile and the soil which often significantly affect the dynamic responses of the pile and the soil therefore the present solution must be modified before applied to nonlinear case moreover the present solution may be extended to solve the nonlinearity of soil property involving viscoelasticity nonlinear elastic and elastoplasticity by introducing the approximate assumptions and iteration approaches such as equivalent linearization

21423,the paper presents an approach for time domain simulation of structure responses along with hydromechanic and structure inertia loads and motions responses for high speed planing craft in waves hydromechanic loads and motion responses are calculated with a non linear time domain strip method a pressure shape function is introduced which enables formulation of detailed slamming pressure distributions sequences from the section forces in the strip method simulations structure responses are calculated quasi dynamically by applying the momentary distributed pressure loads on a global finite element representation of the hull structure with use of inertia relief from the time series output extreme responses are determined by means of short term statistics promising results are demonstrated in applications on a high speed planing craft where extreme values of simulated structure responses are compared with responses to uniform design pressures from classification rules and measured responses from full scale trials the approach is concluded to be a useful tool for further research which has potential to form the basis for establishment of a computationally efficient simulation based design methodology a corresponding experimental modelling approach is presented in a parallel paper keywords high speed planing craft slamming structure responses motion responses time domain simulation 1 introduction high speed planing craft structures are normally designed based on semi empirical methods developed in the 1970s such as savitsky and brown 1976 and allen and jones 1978 as implemented in scantling codes such as dnvgl 2015 and iso 2019 the transient non uniform stochastic slamming pressures that are ruling the structure design of such craft are in these methods modelled as static and uniform hereby standard handbook type formulas can be used to calculate deflection and stresses in the beams and plates constituting the hull structure this approach is good in that it is well established straight forward and requires limited efforts since high speed planning craft are dynamically supported their functionality fuel consumption and related cost and environmental impact are strongly related to their mass and large benefits can be achieved by reducing the structure mass e g stenius et al 2011 garme et al 2014 optimizing the structure mass and creating good balance between performance environmental footprint and safety by careful and well informed consideration of the installed power the crew passenger and systems conditions and tolerances and the structure load carrying capacity however requires a level of detail and accuracy in the load and response predictions that the prevailing semi empirical design approach does not provide the prevailing semi empirical methods further embodies substantial uncertainties as demonstrated and discussed for example in koelbel 1995 rosén et al 2007 grimsley et al 2010 mccue 2012 bowles and soja 2014 razola et al 2014a razola et al 2016 rosén et al 2017 an obvious potential for improvement would be to use direct calculation methods due to the high speed the high level of non linearity the transient nature of the loads and responses and the stochastic nature of the waves and responses the situation of a high speed planing craft in waves is however very challenging to model numerically as well as experimentally in its full complexity the slamming problem involves hydroelastic interaction between the fluid and structure substantial efforts have been made in recent years on modelling

while details such as the local structure loads due to slamming are not presented in the public reports different options for modelling structure responses for high speed planing craft in waves could be categorized as schematically illustrated in fig 1 the prevailing semi empirical modelling approach is at the lower end of the accuracy and computational effort scales hydroelastic modelling approaches could provide very detailed representation of the involved physics but require computational efforts that are completely unfeasible for design purposes in between there could be various hybrid approaches that relies on more simplistic descriptions of the fluid structure coupling and combines more or less advanced hydromechanic modelling approaches with finite element modelling of the hull structure except from the semi empirical approach none of these approaches are however very well explored and direct calculation approaches feasible for designing high speed planing craft with respect to slamming are still waiting to get established this paper presents an approach for time domain simulation of structure responses for high speed planing craft in waves that has been developed with careful consideration of the trade off between accuracy and computational effort to make it feasible for design purposes the approach is demonstrated through application on a particular high speed planing craft evaluated in comparison to the prevailing semi empirical modelling approaches and full scale trials and crucial modelling assumptions are highlighted and discussed a parallel study presented in begovic et al 2020 explores the prospect of corresponding experimental modelling of the local structure responses 2 modelling approach the time domain simulation approach presented is outlined in fig 2 input is defined in terms of craft geometry mass mass moment of inertia structure layout scantlings speed and sea state properties output is given either as time series or as statistical measures of craft motions accelerations hydromechanic loads and structure responses the different analysis steps are described in the following sub sections 2 1 hydromechanic simulations hydromechanic loads and craft motions are simulated using the non linear time domain strip method presented and verified in garme and rosén 2003 and garme 2005 some of the key assumptions in this method are that the fluid is considered ideal and that there is no hydroelastic interaction between the fluid and the structure so that the hull can be modelled as rigid following in the tradition of zarnick 1978 1979 the modelling technique is a generalization of the planing immersing section analogy where the 3 dimensional problem of a planing craft in waves is modelled as a series of 2 dimensional impact problems planing and slamming forces are accounted for in terms of the rate of change of the added mass sectional added masses are calculated based on potential theory using a 2d panel method which enables modelling of section geometry complexities such as chine flats 3d effects by the transom are accounted for as described in garme 2005 a pre calculation technique is applied where the sectional added masses are pre calculated and stored for a number of draughts then during the simulation the momentary added masses and rate of change of added masses are calculated by interpolation between the pre calculated draughts this pre calculation technique significantly reduces the computational effort the draught resolution is determined based on a convergence check of the vertical section forces the longitudinal and temporal resolutions are determined based on convergence checks of the craft s running attitude in calm water and responses in waves simulations are performed at constant speed in regular or irregular waves formulated in terms of a linear wave potential function simulations in irregular waves are performed using a monte carlo scheme where the velocity potential is formulated as a superposition of regular components with random phases and with amplitudes derived from an appropriate wave spectrum results are acquired in terms of time series of rigid body motions velocities and accelerations section draughts and hydromechanic section forces in its present state the method is limited to the vertical plane degrees of freedom i e heave and pitch in long crested head seas in the strip calculations the hydromechanic loads are modelled in terms of section forces to enable detailed structure mechanic simulations a detailed description of the momentary hydromechanic pressure distribution is however needed by assuming that the major part of the hydromechanic load is related to planing and slamming and by introducing a non dimensional pressure distribution shape function c p x y t the pressure distribution on the hull bottom is formulated by scaling the shape function with the simulated section forces 1 p x y t k x t c p x y t where t is time x is the longitudinal space coordinate y is the transversal coordinate with y 0 in the craft centre line k x t is a scale factor that is calculated as 2 k x t f x t 2 0 b x t c p x y t d y where the section forces f and the wet section half beams b are determined from the strip calculations the pressure scaling technique eq 1 and 2 allows for application of arbitrary pressure shape functions here a simple shape function is formulated based on wagner 1932 where the pressure distribution on a wedge with a deadrise β impacting a water surface with a constant impact velocity v is formulated as 3 p y t 1 2 ρ v 2 π tan β b t b t 2 y 2 y 0 b t where ρ is the water density in its simplest form the wagner theory implies incorrect modelling of the boundary conditions at y b t resulting in p y t as y b t the maximum pressure in the vicinity of y b t is however according to wagner 1932 limited by 4 p max 1 2 ρ v 2 π 2 4 tan 2 β by combining and non dimensionalizing eq 3 and 4 a pressure distribution shape function for deep v hull sections is here formulated as 5 c p x y t min b x t b x t 2 y 2 π 4 tan β x y b x t b x 2 y 0 b x t c p x y t 0 y b x t where β x y is the local deadrise and b x is the local chine beam in fig 3 examples of the shape function eq 5 are given for different constant deadrise sections craft geometries such as chine flats where the angle is zero results in the shape function eq 5 breaking down further at small dead rise angles less than β x y 3 the impact is expected to be cushioned by entrapped air to handle these two effects the shape function is supplemented with 6 c p x y t π 4 tan 3 b x t b x 2 y 0 b x t β x y 3 for a wedge of finite beam b the pressure distribution eq 3 is representative only for b x t b 2 when the complete beam is wetted the flow separates at y b 2 and the pressure distribution looses its peaked character becomes more uniform and adjusts to atmospheric pressure at the separation point to account for this effect the pressure shape function is supplemented further with 7 c p x y t 1 b x t b x 2 y 0 b x 2 2 2 structure mechanic simulations for the structure mechanic simulations it is assumed that there is no hydroelastic interaction between the fluid and the structure and that the structure responses can be considered as quasi static and linear the simulations can hereby be performed by applying the simulated hydromechanic pressure distribution sequences eq 1 quasi statically on a finite element representation of the hull structure by using a global model and defining the boundary conditions by the use of inertia relief which implies that applied loads are counterbalanced by inertia forces induced by an acceleration field false constraints are avoided and structural inertia effects are included the solution can hereby be considered to be quasi dynamic the hydromechanic pressure could be applied time step by time step in the finite element model however the computational effort can be significantly reduced by instead applying a pre calculation technique similar as in the hydromechanic simulations the pre calculations are performed by formulating a constant pressure load case p e for each of the hull bottom elements i e e 1 n e where n e is the total number of hull bottom elements for each single element load case the fe equation system is solved and the resulting responses ξ n e e g stresses strains or nodal displacements for a selected number of nodes of interest i e n 1 n n where n n is the total number of selected nodes are stored in a data base this pre calculation is performed once and for all nodes for the structure in question then during simulation in any speed and sea state the simulated pressure distribution eq 1 is discretized in accordance with the finite element mesh and the resulting pressure loads p e t for each of the individual hull bottom elements are multiplied with the pre calculated responses to give the structural response time series in the selected nodes as 8 ξ n t ξ n e p e p e t 2 3 post processing in the following section the application of the here presented simulation approach will be demonstrated and evaluated for a high speed planing craft in irregular waves results will be presented in terms of peak value statistics where the response peak values are identification by using the method presented in zselescky and mckee 1989 vertical acceleration in the craft centre of gravity will be presented in terms of the statistical average of the highest 1 10th of the peak values 9 m 1 10 1 n s i m 10 i 9 10 n s i m n s i m χ i where χ ι i 1 n sim is the sorted population of peak values from a particular simulation and n sim is the total number of peaks the structure responses will be presented in terms of statistical extreme values which are determined by fitting the simulated peak values to analytical distribution functions and extrapolating to appropriate extreme levels slamming related vertical acceleration and pressure peak processes for high speed planing craft can be assumed to follow a two parameter weibull distribution 10 f χ 1 e χ a c where a and c are scale and shape parameters e g kaplan 1991 wang and moan 2004 razola et al 2016 begovic et al 2016 by taking logs of eq 10 twice 11 ln ln 1 f c ln χ c ln a and expressing the simulated short term cumulative distribution as 12 f χ i i 1 2 n s i m the coefficients a and c can be determined by least square approximation as shown in kaplan 1991 and garme and rosén 2003 high speed craft response peak values are distributed differently on different levels typically approximately rayleigh distributed c 2 on the lower levels corresponding to linear wave loads and exponentially distributed c 1 on the higher levels corresponding to non linear slamming loads since it is the slamming loads that are of interest the coefficients a and c are determined for the tail of the distribution in this paper the weibull fitting is performed on the highest 5 of the response peak values if not stated otherwise an example of such fitting is given in fig 4 according to ochi 1973 the extreme value χ n α among n peak values that is exceeded with a certain small probability α is related to the corresponding short term peak distribution f χ n α as 13 f χ n α 1 α n by combining eq 10 and 13 and using the weibull coefficients derived from the fitting extreme values can be calculated as 14 χ n α a ln n α 1 c the structure responses will be presented in terms of the extreme value with 1 probability of exceedance during 3 h operation i e eq 14 with α 0 01 and 15 n t n s i m t s i m where t sim is the simulation time n sim is the number of peak values during t sim and t 3 h 10 800 s this is the design measure stipulated for direct calculations by dnvgl 2019 3 application evaluation the capabilities of the simulation approach are here demonstrated and evaluated by application on the high speed planing craft storebro 90e which for example has been in service for the swedish navy coast guard and marine police the craft general arrangement and structure layout are shown in fig 5 it is about 10 m long has a displacement of 6 5 tonnes and a maximum speed of 40 knots the hull has deep v sections and wide chine flats the structure is a sandwich construction with carbon fibre vinyl ester laminates and foam core the internal structure consists of transverse bulkheads at 3 10 6 53 and 8 80 m measured from the transom marked with full lines in the structure layout a couple of floors and one longitudinal girder on each side marked with dashed lines the shaded panel in fig 5 is the particular focus in this study as indicated in fig 5 this panel is 2 27 m long and tapered its beam is 0 68 m and the local deadrise is 25 deg at the aft end and 0 3 m and 35 deg respectively at the forward end simulations are performed at 35 knots in various realizations of the ittc 78 wave spectrum for each condition the simulation time is chosen to give at least 1000 wave encounters fig 6 gives an example of simulated vertical acceleration in the craft centre of gravity at 35 knots in an irregular sea state with 1 m significant wave height and 3 5 s zero crossing period as seen the method captures the transient nature of planing craft in waves with very large craft motion indicated by periods of 1 g acceleration when the craft is completely out of the water fig 7 summarize the statistical average of the highest 1 10th of vertical acceleration peak values from 15 simulations at 35 knots in different sea states as seen the highest accelerations are reached for a wave mean period of 3 5 s the craft was designed with a design acceleration corresponding to 4 4 g as seen in fig 7 4 4 g is reached when the craft operates at 35 knots in 0 75 m wave height and 3 5 s wave period for the structure modelling the fea package ansys is used the sandwich panels are modelled using shell91 which is a shell element with equivalent properties defined by multiple layers with sandwich logic where the core is assumed to carry the transverse shear and the laminates are assumed to carry the in plane forces and bending moments the intersections between sides and decks which are built as single skin are modelled with shell93 the beams and girder webs are modelled with shell91 and the beam flanges are modelled using link8 boundary conditions are modelled using inertia relief hereby avoiding false boundary constraint forces and including structural inertia effects only structure members that are contributing to the hull strength are modelled other components are however included as masses where the masses of some of the major components such as the engine are well defined in both magnitude and location whereas masses and locations of other components such as insulation and furniture are approximated in total summing up to the 6 5 tones craft displacement fig 8 gives examples of simulated deformations at two successive time instants during a wave encounter together with the corresponding pressure distributions and vertical accelerations at cg the simulated pressure is here applied directly on the fe model the rest of the presented results are however calculated using the pre calculation approach according to eq 8 fig 9 gives examples of time series of simulated inner laminate strains in the transversal direction at four different transversal positions at x 7 267 m in the studied panel during one particular wave encounter for this particular wave encounter it can be seen that the largest strains occur towards the upper panel edge y 0 88 1 01 as seen the considered positions in the inner laminate are here mainly loaded in tension the compression seen for t 122 625 s is a result of the loading and deformation of the panel on the other side of the girder which is loaded before the studied panel fig 10 gives examples of simulated transversal strains in the inner laminate and core shear along a section at x 7 267 m at one particular instant during one particular wave encounter as seen the largest laminate strains here occur by the keel line y 0 whereas the largest core shear occur by the keel line y 0 and by the longitudinal girder y 0 49 detailed validation of the simulation approach will be needed and the parallel study presented in begovic et al 2020 explores the prospect of creating a model experiment setup that could enable such validation in the future the experimental modelling however involves equally large challenges as the numerical modelling and further development is needed before even attempting to go through with detailed quantitative validation in the present paper the evaluation of the simulation approach is therefore limited to qualitative comparison between simulations design limits and full scale trials fig 11 summarizes laminate strain and core shear along the transversal section at x 7 267 m in the studied panel both derived from the simulations marked with o and by using uniform design pressure according to dnvgl 2015 marked with x and the simulations have been performed at 35 knots in a sea state with 0 75 m significant wave height and 3 5 s mean zero crossing period which as mentioned in connection with fig 7 should be in parity with the design condition for the craft the simulations are presented in terms of extreme values 1 probability of being exceeded during 3 h as observed in fig 9 the studied points are subjected to compression negative as well as tension positive during one impact cycle fig 11 therefore presents the simulations in terms of both compression negative extreme values lower curves and tension positive extreme values upper curves as seen the largest simulated laminate compressive strain 0 1 is found at the lower edge of the panel at the girder at y 0 49 m whereas the largest simulated laminate tensile strain 0 13 is found close to the mid span of the panel at y 0 88 m the largest core shear is found at the panel edges with the maximum absolute value 1 75 found at the upper panel edge by the chine the craft was designed using a maximum allowable strain in the laminates of 0 2 in compression and 0 42 in tension and a maximum allowable core shear strain of 1 4 comparing with the results in fig 11 it can be noted that the simulated laminate strains are far below the allowable the low utilization of the laminates can be explained by the laminates thicknesses having been ruled not by slamming but to account for rough shore landings the largest simulated core shear 1 75 absolute value exceeds the allowable core shear 1 4 that was ruling the design it should however be noticed that the production related local variations in geometry core and laminate thicknesses etc in the built up chine areas are not modelled in detail by the here used shell elements values marked with in fig 11 are responses resulting from a uniform pressure 39 kpa applied between the girder and the hull side in the finite element representation of the studied structure whereas values marked with x corresponds to a uniform pressure 45 kpa applied between the girder and chine flat and 105 kpa applied on the chine flat these pressures have been derived according to dnvgl 2015 with a design acceleration of 4 4 g corresponding to the statistical average of the highest 1 10th of peak values as seen the maximum compressive strain and shear strain resulting from these rule loads are in parity with the corresponding maximum simulated strains simulations have also been performed at 35 knots in a significant wave height of 0 50 m and a wave zero crossing mean period of 2 5 s this corresponds to conditions in which full scale trials have been performed where laminate strain and core shear were measured in several positions garme and rosén 2003 fig 12 shows extreme values of laminate strains and core shear along the transversal section x 7 267 m in the studied panel both derived from the simulations marked with o and from the trials marked with x the comparison between the simulations and the measurements of course involves large uncertainties to begin with the full scale experimental set up was not made specifically for simulation evaluation purposes but for evaluating the hull structure design the positions of the transducers and the thickness of the laminates involves uncertainties further as observed in rosén 2005 the shear gauge at y 0 62 is probably malfunctioning yet another large uncertainty is in the observation and representation of the waves where the sea state at the trials was determined through an approach where the vessel was used as a wave buoy at zero speed and then represented in the simulations by a two parameter ittc78 spectra through a monte carlo scheme still clear qualitative agreement can be observed with good correlation between simulated and measured laminate strains at y 1 01 and acceptable correlation in the mid span of the panel whereas the correlation is rather poor at y 0 62 the maximum simulated shear is close to the maximum measured shear but in a slightly different position 4 discussion the presented results are encouraging showing that the method predicts vertical accelerations and structure responses in consistency with responses measured in full scale design limits for the studied craft and the prevailing semi empirical design methods a simulation comprising 1000 wave encounters can be performed in just a few minutes on a standard pc making the approach feasible for design purposes where very extensive simulations are needed for capturing the craft operational profile and limiting states the computational efficiency is however relying on a number of rather drastic assumptions and idealizations some of these assumptions and idealizations and some other modelling issues will here be discussed in more detail 4 1 fluid structure interaction key assumptions in the presented modelling approach are that there is no hydroelastic interaction between the fluid and the structure and that the structure responses can be considered quasi static hereby the hydromechanic problem can be solved for a rigid hull and the derived pressure distribution at each time step can be applied quasi statically in the structure model this significantly reduces the computational efforts compared to if a fully coupled solution would have been used globally these assumptions are certainly valid for small high performance planning craft with very stiff structure as the one studied in this paper regarding local structure such as hull bottom panels faltinsen 1999 states that local hydroelastic effects only need to be considered for deadrise angles less than 10 deg which is much lower than for the craft studied here according to bereznitski 2001 hydroelastic effects can be considered limited if the loading frequency is smaller than half the dry natural frequency of the considered structure component typical dry panel frequencies for 90e are in the order of 200 hz determined by modal analysis in ansys whereas typical load frequencies at 35 knots in a sea state with a significant wave height of 0 75 m and a wave mean period of 3 5 s are around 30 hz determined from the simulations the non hydroelastic assumption is hence confirmed also in relation to bereznitski s criteria stenius et al 2011 formulates a similar measure for characterizing hydroelastic effects taking into account inertia related as well as kinematic hydroelastic effects also the stenius criterion confirms the non hydroelastic assumption for the craft studied here for application of the presented simulation approach on other craft particularly on larger craft with more flexible panels the non hydroelastic assumption must be evaluated further for example by following the procedures in stenius et al 2011 the non linear strip method has been thoroughly evaluated and simulated motions and loads have shown to compare well with model experiments as well as full scale trials garme and rosén 2003 garme 2005 it has also been successfully applied in design projects and various research studies e g garme et al 2014 razola et al 2014a razola et al 2016 a key feature in the approach presented here is the detailed modelling of the slamming pressure distribution by introducing a pressure shape function scaled with the hydrodynamic section forces from the strip calculations in this paper a simple pressure shape function derived based on wagner 1932 theory with some adjustments to account for chine flats and chine separation has been used detailed evaluation of this pressure modelling technique and alternative pressure shape functions is performed in razola et al 2014b as mentioned a first step towards quantitative validation of the simulated structure responses is taken in the parallel study presented in begovic et al 2020 4 2 post processing the simulation results have in this paper been presented in terms of short term peak value statistics in the present study the peak identification method presented in zseleczky and mckee 1989 has been used this method relies on a user specified threshold which defines the magnitude required for a peak to be considered as a peak in the present paper a threshold of 150 of the considered signals standard deviation has been used fig 13 is a brief investigation of the sensitivity in the choice of threshold where the threshold is formulated in terms of multiples of the signal standard deviation as seen the different thresholds results in significantly different numbers of identified peaks and the number of identified peaks also varies between the different positions in the panel for the same threshold however as seen the corresponding extreme values are remarkably stable as described extreme values are calculated by fitting a weibull distribution to the highest 5 of the simulated peak distributions fig 14 is a brief investigation of the sensitivity in this fitting where fitting of the highest 4 6 and 8 of peak values are compared as seen the weibull parameters and the corresponding extreme values are rather stable another issue is how long simulation times and how many peak values that are required for convergence of the statistical measures according to savitsky and koelbel 1993 a test record on planing craft should contain at least 75 wave encounters in order to obtain statistically acceptable samples whereas according to ittc recommended procedures and guidelines 2017 the minimum number of encounters to be tested is 50 testing more than 100 is standard and more than 200 is considered excellent practice fig 15 is a brief investigation of the convergence of simulated acceleration quantile averages the results indicate that 75 wave encounters is all too little and that rather 250 peak values are required for convergence of the average of the highest 1 10th of peak values and even more for the average of the highest 1 100th similarly the extreme values of the structural responses are found to require up to 500 peak values for convergence as mentioned simulation times resulting in at least 1000 wave encounters are used in the present study various issues related to peak value identification and statistical analysis of high speed planing craft responses are thoroughly explored in razola et al 2016 5 conclusions an approach for time domain simulation of structure responses for high speed planing craft in waves is presented and demonstrated on a particular high speed planing craft the following conclusions are made the presented approach captures the characteristic phenomena for planing craft in waves such as the nonlinear hydrodynamics the large craft motions and transient accelerations the peaked propagating pressure distribution and the related structure responses including inertia effects hereby the approach enables analysis of loads and responses related to slamming with significantly higher resolution than what is possible with the prevailing semi empirical design methods the relatively simplistic non linear strip method and the pre calculation of sectional added masses and structure responses makes the approach highly computationally efficient if effectively implemented real time simulations should be achievable this enables long simulations times feasible for statistical analysis in design applications the approaches for short term statistical analysis applied in the paper are found to be consistent calculated extreme response values show consistent agreement with measured responses from full scale trials and responses to uniform design pressures from classification rules the here performed comparison is however limited and involves uncertainties and more thorough validation is needed the presented approach is an important step towards establishing a direct calculation approach for structure design of high speed planing craft the approach has also been found useful in research for example in evaluation and further development of the prevailing semi empirical design methods future work should for example consider investigation of appropriate levels of detail in the finite element structure calculations evaluation of the range of applicability of made assumptions and systematic experimental validation high speed planing craft in waves is however equally challenging to model experimentally as numerically a first step towards enabling more thorough experimental validation of the here presented

21423,the paper presents an approach for time domain simulation of structure responses along with hydromechanic and structure inertia loads and motions responses for high speed planing craft in waves hydromechanic loads and motion responses are calculated with a non linear time domain strip method a pressure shape function is introduced which enables formulation of detailed slamming pressure distributions sequences from the section forces in the strip method simulations structure responses are calculated quasi dynamically by applying the momentary distributed pressure loads on a global finite element representation of the hull structure with use of inertia relief from the time series output extreme responses are determined by means of short term statistics promising results are demonstrated in applications on a high speed planing craft where extreme values of simulated structure responses are compared with responses to uniform design pressures from classification rules and measured responses from full scale trials the approach is concluded to be a useful tool for further research which has potential to form the basis for establishment of a computationally efficient simulation based design methodology a corresponding experimental modelling approach is presented in a parallel paper keywords high speed planing craft slamming structure responses motion responses time domain simulation 1 introduction high speed planing craft structures are normally designed based on semi empirical methods developed in the 1970s such as savitsky and brown 1976 and allen and jones 1978 as implemented in scantling codes such as dnvgl 2015 and iso 2019 the transient non uniform stochastic slamming pressures that are ruling the structure design of such craft are in these methods modelled as static and uniform hereby standard handbook type formulas can be used to calculate deflection and stresses in the beams and plates constituting the hull structure this approach is good in that it is well established straight forward and requires limited efforts since high speed planning craft are dynamically supported their functionality fuel consumption and related cost and environmental impact are strongly related to their mass and large benefits can be achieved by reducing the structure mass e g stenius et al 2011 garme et al 2014 optimizing the structure mass and creating good balance between performance environmental footprint and safety by careful and well informed consideration of the installed power the crew passenger and systems conditions and tolerances and the structure load carrying capacity however requires a level of detail and accuracy in the load and response predictions that the prevailing semi empirical design approach does not provide the prevailing semi empirical methods further embodies substantial uncertainties as demonstrated and discussed for example in koelbel 1995 rosén et al 2007 grimsley et al 2010 mccue 2012 bowles and soja 2014 razola et al 2014a razola et al 2016 rosén et al 2017 an obvious potential for improvement would be to use direct calculation methods due to the high speed the high level of non linearity the transient nature of the loads and responses and the stochastic nature of the waves and responses the situation of a high speed planing craft in waves is however very challenging to model numerically as well as experimentally in its full complexity the slamming problem involves hydroelastic interaction between the fluid and structure substantial efforts have been made in recent years on modelling

while details such as the local structure loads due to slamming are not presented in the public reports different options for modelling structure responses for high speed planing craft in waves could be categorized as schematically illustrated in fig 1 the prevailing semi empirical modelling approach is at the lower end of the accuracy and computational effort scales hydroelastic modelling approaches could provide very detailed representation of the involved physics but require computational efforts that are completely unfeasible for design purposes in between there could be various hybrid approaches that relies on more simplistic descriptions of the fluid structure coupling and combines more or less advanced hydromechanic modelling approaches with finite element modelling of the hull structure except from the semi empirical approach none of these approaches are however very well explored and direct calculation approaches feasible for designing high speed planing craft with respect to slamming are still waiting to get established this paper presents an approach for time domain simulation of structure responses for high speed planing craft in waves that has been developed with careful consideration of the trade off between accuracy and computational effort to make it feasible for design purposes the approach is demonstrated through application on a particular high speed planing craft evaluated in comparison to the prevailing semi empirical modelling approaches and full scale trials and crucial modelling assumptions are highlighted and discussed a parallel study presented in begovic et al 2020 explores the prospect of corresponding experimental modelling of the local structure responses 2 modelling approach the time domain simulation approach presented is outlined in fig 2 input is defined in terms of craft geometry mass mass moment of inertia structure layout scantlings speed and sea state properties output is given either as time series or as statistical measures of craft motions accelerations hydromechanic loads and structure responses the different analysis steps are described in the following sub sections 2 1 hydromechanic simulations hydromechanic loads and craft motions are simulated using the non linear time domain strip method presented and verified in garme and rosén 2003 and garme 2005 some of the key assumptions in this method are that the fluid is considered ideal and that there is no hydroelastic interaction between the fluid and the structure so that the hull can be modelled as rigid following in the tradition of zarnick 1978 1979 the modelling technique is a generalization of the planing immersing section analogy where the 3 dimensional problem of a planing craft in waves is modelled as a series of 2 dimensional impact problems planing and slamming forces are accounted for in terms of the rate of change of the added mass sectional added masses are calculated based on potential theory using a 2d panel method which enables modelling of section geometry complexities such as chine flats 3d effects by the transom are accounted for as described in garme 2005 a pre calculation technique is applied where the sectional added masses are pre calculated and stored for a number of draughts then during the simulation the momentary added masses and rate of change of added masses are calculated by interpolation between the pre calculated draughts this pre calculation technique significantly reduces the computational effort the draught resolution is determined based on a convergence check of the vertical section forces the longitudinal and temporal resolutions are determined based on convergence checks of the craft s running attitude in calm water and responses in waves simulations are performed at constant speed in regular or irregular waves formulated in terms of a linear wave potential function simulations in irregular waves are performed using a monte carlo scheme where the velocity potential is formulated as a superposition of regular components with random phases and with amplitudes derived from an appropriate wave spectrum results are acquired in terms of time series of rigid body motions velocities and accelerations section draughts and hydromechanic section forces in its present state the method is limited to the vertical plane degrees of freedom i e heave and pitch in long crested head seas in the strip calculations the hydromechanic loads are modelled in terms of section forces to enable detailed structure mechanic simulations a detailed description of the momentary hydromechanic pressure distribution is however needed by assuming that the major part of the hydromechanic load is related to planing and slamming and by introducing a non dimensional pressure distribution shape function c p x y t the pressure distribution on the hull bottom is formulated by scaling the shape function with the simulated section forces 1 p x y t k x t c p x y t where t is time x is the longitudinal space coordinate y is the transversal coordinate with y 0 in the craft centre line k x t is a scale factor that is calculated as 2 k x t f x t 2 0 b x t c p x y t d y where the section forces f and the wet section half beams b are determined from the strip calculations the pressure scaling technique eq 1 and 2 allows for application of arbitrary pressure shape functions here a simple shape function is formulated based on wagner 1932 where the pressure distribution on a wedge with a deadrise β impacting a water surface with a constant impact velocity v is formulated as 3 p y t 1 2 ρ v 2 π tan β b t b t 2 y 2 y 0 b t where ρ is the water density in its simplest form the wagner theory implies incorrect modelling of the boundary conditions at y b t resulting in p y t as y b t the maximum pressure in the vicinity of y b t is however according to wagner 1932 limited by 4 p max 1 2 ρ v 2 π 2 4 tan 2 β by combining and non dimensionalizing eq 3 and 4 a pressure distribution shape function for deep v hull sections is here formulated as 5 c p x y t min b x t b x t 2 y 2 π 4 tan β x y b x t b x 2 y 0 b x t c p x y t 0 y b x t where β x y is the local deadrise and b x is the local chine beam in fig 3 examples of the shape function eq 5 are given for different constant deadrise sections craft geometries such as chine flats where the angle is zero results in the shape function eq 5 breaking down further at small dead rise angles less than β x y 3 the impact is expected to be cushioned by entrapped air to handle these two effects the shape function is supplemented with 6 c p x y t π 4 tan 3 b x t b x 2 y 0 b x t β x y 3 for a wedge of finite beam b the pressure distribution eq 3 is representative only for b x t b 2 when the complete beam is wetted the flow separates at y b 2 and the pressure distribution looses its peaked character becomes more uniform and adjusts to atmospheric pressure at the separation point to account for this effect the pressure shape function is supplemented further with 7 c p x y t 1 b x t b x 2 y 0 b x 2 2 2 structure mechanic simulations for the structure mechanic simulations it is assumed that there is no hydroelastic interaction between the fluid and the structure and that the structure responses can be considered as quasi static and linear the simulations can hereby be performed by applying the simulated hydromechanic pressure distribution sequences eq 1 quasi statically on a finite element representation of the hull structure by using a global model and defining the boundary conditions by the use of inertia relief which implies that applied loads are counterbalanced by inertia forces induced by an acceleration field false constraints are avoided and structural inertia effects are included the solution can hereby be considered to be quasi dynamic the hydromechanic pressure could be applied time step by time step in the finite element model however the computational effort can be significantly reduced by instead applying a pre calculation technique similar as in the hydromechanic simulations the pre calculations are performed by formulating a constant pressure load case p e for each of the hull bottom elements i e e 1 n e where n e is the total number of hull bottom elements for each single element load case the fe equation system is solved and the resulting responses ξ n e e g stresses strains or nodal displacements for a selected number of nodes of interest i e n 1 n n where n n is the total number of selected nodes are stored in a data base this pre calculation is performed once and for all nodes for the structure in question then during simulation in any speed and sea state the simulated pressure distribution eq 1 is discretized in accordance with the finite element mesh and the resulting pressure loads p e t for each of the individual hull bottom elements are multiplied with the pre calculated responses to give the structural response time series in the selected nodes as 8 ξ n t ξ n e p e p e t 2 3 post processing in the following section the application of the here presented simulation approach will be demonstrated and evaluated for a high speed planing craft in irregular waves results will be presented in terms of peak value statistics where the response peak values are identification by using the method presented in zselescky and mckee 1989 vertical acceleration in the craft centre of gravity will be presented in terms of the statistical average of the highest 1 10th of the peak values 9 m 1 10 1 n s i m 10 i 9 10 n s i m n s i m χ i where χ ι i 1 n sim is the sorted population of peak values from a particular simulation and n sim is the total number of peaks the structure responses will be presented in terms of statistical extreme values which are determined by fitting the simulated peak values to analytical distribution functions and extrapolating to appropriate extreme levels slamming related vertical acceleration and pressure peak processes for high speed planing craft can be assumed to follow a two parameter weibull distribution 10 f χ 1 e χ a c where a and c are scale and shape parameters e g kaplan 1991 wang and moan 2004 razola et al 2016 begovic et al 2016 by taking logs of eq 10 twice 11 ln ln 1 f c ln χ c ln a and expressing the simulated short term cumulative distribution as 12 f χ i i 1 2 n s i m the coefficients a and c can be determined by least square approximation as shown in kaplan 1991 and garme and rosén 2003 high speed craft response peak values are distributed differently on different levels typically approximately rayleigh distributed c 2 on the lower levels corresponding to linear wave loads and exponentially distributed c 1 on the higher levels corresponding to non linear slamming loads since it is the slamming loads that are of interest the coefficients a and c are determined for the tail of the distribution in this paper the weibull fitting is performed on the highest 5 of the response peak values if not stated otherwise an example of such fitting is given in fig 4 according to ochi 1973 the extreme value χ n α among n peak values that is exceeded with a certain small probability α is related to the corresponding short term peak distribution f χ n α as 13 f χ n α 1 α n by combining eq 10 and 13 and using the weibull coefficients derived from the fitting extreme values can be calculated as 14 χ n α a ln n α 1 c the structure responses will be presented in terms of the extreme value with 1 probability of exceedance during 3 h operation i e eq 14 with α 0 01 and 15 n t n s i m t s i m where t sim is the simulation time n sim is the number of peak values during t sim and t 3 h 10 800 s this is the design measure stipulated for direct calculations by dnvgl 2019 3 application evaluation the capabilities of the simulation approach are here demonstrated and evaluated by application on the high speed planing craft storebro 90e which for example has been in service for the swedish navy coast guard and marine police the craft general arrangement and structure layout are shown in fig 5 it is about 10 m long has a displacement of 6 5 tonnes and a maximum speed of 40 knots the hull has deep v sections and wide chine flats the structure is a sandwich construction with carbon fibre vinyl ester laminates and foam core the internal structure consists of transverse bulkheads at 3 10 6 53 and 8 80 m measured from the transom marked with full lines in the structure layout a couple of floors and one longitudinal girder on each side marked with dashed lines the shaded panel in fig 5 is the particular focus in this study as indicated in fig 5 this panel is 2 27 m long and tapered its beam is 0 68 m and the local deadrise is 25 deg at the aft end and 0 3 m and 35 deg respectively at the forward end simulations are performed at 35 knots in various realizations of the ittc 78 wave spectrum for each condition the simulation time is chosen to give at least 1000 wave encounters fig 6 gives an example of simulated vertical acceleration in the craft centre of gravity at 35 knots in an irregular sea state with 1 m significant wave height and 3 5 s zero crossing period as seen the method captures the transient nature of planing craft in waves with very large craft motion indicated by periods of 1 g acceleration when the craft is completely out of the water fig 7 summarize the statistical average of the highest 1 10th of vertical acceleration peak values from 15 simulations at 35 knots in different sea states as seen the highest accelerations are reached for a wave mean period of 3 5 s the craft was designed with a design acceleration corresponding to 4 4 g as seen in fig 7 4 4 g is reached when the craft operates at 35 knots in 0 75 m wave height and 3 5 s wave period for the structure modelling the fea package ansys is used the sandwich panels are modelled using shell91 which is a shell element with equivalent properties defined by multiple layers with sandwich logic where the core is assumed to carry the transverse shear and the laminates are assumed to carry the in plane forces and bending moments the intersections between sides and decks which are built as single skin are modelled with shell93 the beams and girder webs are modelled with shell91 and the beam flanges are modelled using link8 boundary conditions are modelled using inertia relief hereby avoiding false boundary constraint forces and including structural inertia effects only structure members that are contributing to the hull strength are modelled other components are however included as masses where the masses of some of the major components such as the engine are well defined in both magnitude and location whereas masses and locations of other components such as insulation and furniture are approximated in total summing up to the 6 5 tones craft displacement fig 8 gives examples of simulated deformations at two successive time instants during a wave encounter together with the corresponding pressure distributions and vertical accelerations at cg the simulated pressure is here applied directly on the fe model the rest of the presented results are however calculated using the pre calculation approach according to eq 8 fig 9 gives examples of time series of simulated inner laminate strains in the transversal direction at four different transversal positions at x 7 267 m in the studied panel during one particular wave encounter for this particular wave encounter it can be seen that the largest strains occur towards the upper panel edge y 0 88 1 01 as seen the considered positions in the inner laminate are here mainly loaded in tension the compression seen for t 122 625 s is a result of the loading and deformation of the panel on the other side of the girder which is loaded before the studied panel fig 10 gives examples of simulated transversal strains in the inner laminate and core shear along a section at x 7 267 m at one particular instant during one particular wave encounter as seen the largest laminate strains here occur by the keel line y 0 whereas the largest core shear occur by the keel line y 0 and by the longitudinal girder y 0 49 detailed validation of the simulation approach will be needed and the parallel study presented in begovic et al 2020 explores the prospect of creating a model experiment setup that could enable such validation in the future the experimental modelling however involves equally large challenges as the numerical modelling and further development is needed before even attempting to go through with detailed quantitative validation in the present paper the evaluation of the simulation approach is therefore limited to qualitative comparison between simulations design limits and full scale trials fig 11 summarizes laminate strain and core shear along the transversal section at x 7 267 m in the studied panel both derived from the simulations marked with o and by using uniform design pressure according to dnvgl 2015 marked with x and the simulations have been performed at 35 knots in a sea state with 0 75 m significant wave height and 3 5 s mean zero crossing period which as mentioned in connection with fig 7 should be in parity with the design condition for the craft the simulations are presented in terms of extreme values 1 probability of being exceeded during 3 h as observed in fig 9 the studied points are subjected to compression negative as well as tension positive during one impact cycle fig 11 therefore presents the simulations in terms of both compression negative extreme values lower curves and tension positive extreme values upper curves as seen the largest simulated laminate compressive strain 0 1 is found at the lower edge of the panel at the girder at y 0 49 m whereas the largest simulated laminate tensile strain 0 13 is found close to the mid span of the panel at y 0 88 m the largest core shear is found at the panel edges with the maximum absolute value 1 75 found at the upper panel edge by the chine the craft was designed using a maximum allowable strain in the laminates of 0 2 in compression and 0 42 in tension and a maximum allowable core shear strain of 1 4 comparing with the results in fig 11 it can be noted that the simulated laminate strains are far below the allowable the low utilization of the laminates can be explained by the laminates thicknesses having been ruled not by slamming but to account for rough shore landings the largest simulated core shear 1 75 absolute value exceeds the allowable core shear 1 4 that was ruling the design it should however be noticed that the production related local variations in geometry core and laminate thicknesses etc in the built up chine areas are not modelled in detail by the here used shell elements values marked with in fig 11 are responses resulting from a uniform pressure 39 kpa applied between the girder and the hull side in the finite element representation of the studied structure whereas values marked with x corresponds to a uniform pressure 45 kpa applied between the girder and chine flat and 105 kpa applied on the chine flat these pressures have been derived according to dnvgl 2015 with a design acceleration of 4 4 g corresponding to the statistical average of the highest 1 10th of peak values as seen the maximum compressive strain and shear strain resulting from these rule loads are in parity with the corresponding maximum simulated strains simulations have also been performed at 35 knots in a significant wave height of 0 50 m and a wave zero crossing mean period of 2 5 s this corresponds to conditions in which full scale trials have been performed where laminate strain and core shear were measured in several positions garme and rosén 2003 fig 12 shows extreme values of laminate strains and core shear along the transversal section x 7 267 m in the studied panel both derived from the simulations marked with o and from the trials marked with x the comparison between the simulations and the measurements of course involves large uncertainties to begin with the full scale experimental set up was not made specifically for simulation evaluation purposes but for evaluating the hull structure design the positions of the transducers and the thickness of the laminates involves uncertainties further as observed in rosén 2005 the shear gauge at y 0 62 is probably malfunctioning yet another large uncertainty is in the observation and representation of the waves where the sea state at the trials was determined through an approach where the vessel was used as a wave buoy at zero speed and then represented in the simulations by a two parameter ittc78 spectra through a monte carlo scheme still clear qualitative agreement can be observed with good correlation between simulated and measured laminate strains at y 1 01 and acceptable correlation in the mid span of the panel whereas the correlation is rather poor at y 0 62 the maximum simulated shear is close to the maximum measured shear but in a slightly different position 4 discussion the presented results are encouraging showing that the method predicts vertical accelerations and structure responses in consistency with responses measured in full scale design limits for the studied craft and the prevailing semi empirical design methods a simulation comprising 1000 wave encounters can be performed in just a few minutes on a standard pc making the approach feasible for design purposes where very extensive simulations are needed for capturing the craft operational profile and limiting states the computational efficiency is however relying on a number of rather drastic assumptions and idealizations some of these assumptions and idealizations and some other modelling issues will here be discussed in more detail 4 1 fluid structure interaction key assumptions in the presented modelling approach are that there is no hydroelastic interaction between the fluid and the structure and that the structure responses can be considered quasi static hereby the hydromechanic problem can be solved for a rigid hull and the derived pressure distribution at each time step can be applied quasi statically in the structure model this significantly reduces the computational efforts compared to if a fully coupled solution would have been used globally these assumptions are certainly valid for small high performance planning craft with very stiff structure as the one studied in this paper regarding local structure such as hull bottom panels faltinsen 1999 states that local hydroelastic effects only need to be considered for deadrise angles less than 10 deg which is much lower than for the craft studied here according to bereznitski 2001 hydroelastic effects can be considered limited if the loading frequency is smaller than half the dry natural frequency of the considered structure component typical dry panel frequencies for 90e are in the order of 200 hz determined by modal analysis in ansys whereas typical load frequencies at 35 knots in a sea state with a significant wave height of 0 75 m and a wave mean period of 3 5 s are around 30 hz determined from the simulations the non hydroelastic assumption is hence confirmed also in relation to bereznitski s criteria stenius et al 2011 formulates a similar measure for characterizing hydroelastic effects taking into account inertia related as well as kinematic hydroelastic effects also the stenius criterion confirms the non hydroelastic assumption for the craft studied here for application of the presented simulation approach on other craft particularly on larger craft with more flexible panels the non hydroelastic assumption must be evaluated further for example by following the procedures in stenius et al 2011 the non linear strip method has been thoroughly evaluated and simulated motions and loads have shown to compare well with model experiments as well as full scale trials garme and rosén 2003 garme 2005 it has also been successfully applied in design projects and various research studies e g garme et al 2014 razola et al 2014a razola et al 2016 a key feature in the approach presented here is the detailed modelling of the slamming pressure distribution by introducing a pressure shape function scaled with the hydrodynamic section forces from the strip calculations in this paper a simple pressure shape function derived based on wagner 1932 theory with some adjustments to account for chine flats and chine separation has been used detailed evaluation of this pressure modelling technique and alternative pressure shape functions is performed in razola et al 2014b as mentioned a first step towards quantitative validation of the simulated structure responses is taken in the parallel study presented in begovic et al 2020 4 2 post processing the simulation results have in this paper been presented in terms of short term peak value statistics in the present study the peak identification method presented in zseleczky and mckee 1989 has been used this method relies on a user specified threshold which defines the magnitude required for a peak to be considered as a peak in the present paper a threshold of 150 of the considered signals standard deviation has been used fig 13 is a brief investigation of the sensitivity in the choice of threshold where the threshold is formulated in terms of multiples of the signal standard deviation as seen the different thresholds results in significantly different numbers of identified peaks and the number of identified peaks also varies between the different positions in the panel for the same threshold however as seen the corresponding extreme values are remarkably stable as described extreme values are calculated by fitting a weibull distribution to the highest 5 of the simulated peak distributions fig 14 is a brief investigation of the sensitivity in this fitting where fitting of the highest 4 6 and 8 of peak values are compared as seen the weibull parameters and the corresponding extreme values are rather stable another issue is how long simulation times and how many peak values that are required for convergence of the statistical measures according to savitsky and koelbel 1993 a test record on planing craft should contain at least 75 wave encounters in order to obtain statistically acceptable samples whereas according to ittc recommended procedures and guidelines 2017 the minimum number of encounters to be tested is 50 testing more than 100 is standard and more than 200 is considered excellent practice fig 15 is a brief investigation of the convergence of simulated acceleration quantile averages the results indicate that 75 wave encounters is all too little and that rather 250 peak values are required for convergence of the average of the highest 1 10th of peak values and even more for the average of the highest 1 100th similarly the extreme values of the structural responses are found to require up to 500 peak values for convergence as mentioned simulation times resulting in at least 1000 wave encounters are used in the present study various issues related to peak value identification and statistical analysis of high speed planing craft responses are thoroughly explored in razola et al 2016 5 conclusions an approach for time domain simulation of structure responses for high speed planing craft in waves is presented and demonstrated on a particular high speed planing craft the following conclusions are made the presented approach captures the characteristic phenomena for planing craft in waves such as the nonlinear hydrodynamics the large craft motions and transient accelerations the peaked propagating pressure distribution and the related structure responses including inertia effects hereby the approach enables analysis of loads and responses related to slamming with significantly higher resolution than what is possible with the prevailing semi empirical design methods the relatively simplistic non linear strip method and the pre calculation of sectional added masses and structure responses makes the approach highly computationally efficient if effectively implemented real time simulations should be achievable this enables long simulations times feasible for statistical analysis in design applications the approaches for short term statistical analysis applied in the paper are found to be consistent calculated extreme response values show consistent agreement with measured responses from full scale trials and responses to uniform design pressures from classification rules the here performed comparison is however limited and involves uncertainties and more thorough validation is needed the presented approach is an important step towards establishing a direct calculation approach for structure design of high speed planing craft the approach has also been found useful in research for example in evaluation and further development of the prevailing semi empirical design methods future work should for example consider investigation of appropriate levels of detail in the finite element structure calculations evaluation of the range of applicability of made assumptions and systematic experimental validation high speed planing craft in waves is however equally challenging to model experimentally as numerically a first step towards enabling more thorough experimental validation of the here presented numerical approach is taken in the parallel study presented in begovic et al 2020 that explores a novel setup for experimental modelling of local slamming related structure responses for a high speed

21424,a two phase flow computational fluid dynamics cfd model is employed for both spilling and plunging breaking wave simulations a numerical wave tank is built to evaluate the performance of two different free surface modelling approaches i e continuous free surface conditions and free surface jump conditions and three k ω sst turbulence models i e the original k ω sst the buoyancy modified k ω sst and the free surface k ω sst a newly proposed model the influences of the free surface modelling approaches and the turbulence models are investigated by comparing with the published experimental measurements in terms of breaking point free surface elevations time averaged velocity field time averaged turbulent kinetic energy and general turbulent behaviour respectively overall the free surface k ω sst with the free surface jump conditions performs best in terms of the accuracy of the predictions against the experimental data and the capture of the physical breaking phenomena for instance the trapped air pocket and the development of the free surface in the surf zone keywords cfd breaking waves free surface jump conditions modified k ω sst turbulence model 1 introduction breaking waves are considered one of the most severe environmental loads on marine structures the large nonlinear impact forces and high order excitations from the breaking waves can lead to significant damage of the marine structures therefore it is of great importance to estimate breaking onset and velocity field accurately in order to calculate breaking wave loads more accurately moreover the breaking waves are more frequently observed when the waves propagate from offshore to coastal areas if the sands on the seabed are fine 300 μ m then coastal erosion and sediment transport can occur especially in the surf and swash zones of the breaking waves it means that it is also important to predict the turbulent behaviour of breaking waves in shallow water which is closely related to the sediment dynamics therefore the hydrodynamic behaviour and the turbulent kinematics of the breaking waves are the main research concerns for breaking wave modelling experiments played an important role to study the physics of breaking waves even though most experiments are conducted in small scales see the following examples ting and kirby 1994 conducted experiments on both spilling and plunging breakers to study the undertow and the turbulence effects in the surf zone the characteristics of mean flow and turbulence of spilling and plunging breakers were studied it was found that for the spilling breakers the turbulent kinetic energy is transported seaward and it is landward for the plunging breakers in addition the turbulence intensity and the vertical gradient of undertow under the plunging breakers are much smaller than that under the spilling breakers the experimental data from ting and kirby 1994 is also chosen as the validation data in the present study subsequently ting 2001 2002 conducted experimental studies on the turbulent characteristics of the irregular breaking waves other experimental research on breaking waves over a slope or a bar can be also found in seyama and kimura 1989 beji and battjes 1993 iwata et al 1997 and chang and liu 1998 and the large scale experiments by ting and nelson 2011 and ting 2013 most of these tests focused on the energy transformation and turbulent characteristics in the surf zones of breaking waves which is complex and important for near shore sediment transport computational fluid dynamics cfd is considered as a good alternative or assistance to experiments due to its reasonable accuracy obviating scale effects and eliminating disturbances from operations and facilities breaking waves are characterized by strong wave wave interactions resulting in energy being transferred from the primary wave frequency to higher frequencies thornton 1979 it was also shown by svendsen 1987 that the surf zones of the breaking waves were characterized by a strong turbulence generation in the following decades a large number of cfd simulations on breaking waves involving turbulence models were conducted e g lin and liu 1998 watanabe and saeki 1999 bradford 2000 christensen and deigaard 2001 rhee and stern 2002 christensen 2006 lubin et al 2006 wang et al 2009 xie 2013 chella et al 2015 brown et al 2016 and devolder et al 2018 watanabe and saeki 1999 carried a two phase large eddy simulation les of a plunging breaker over a slope with the volume of fluid vof method the characteristics of vorticity and velocity field after wave breaking were discussed it was found that the fluid motion is two dimensional in the wave direction before wave breaking and has a three dimensional flow structure comprised of horizontal helical and vertical eddies after breaking christensen 2006 studied undertow and turbulence of spilling and plunging breakers using a two phase cfd model based on the vof method and les turbulence model the turbulence levels were overpredicted compared to the experimental data ting and kirby 1994 with unknown reasons the three dimensional les simulations usually need sufficiently fine mesh resolutions as a result it is very time consuming and demands large computational power alternatively reynolds averaged navierstokes rans model is more commonly adopted for breaking wave modelling due to its high computational efficiency lin and liu 1998 developed a single phase algebraic nonlinear reynolds stress k ε turbulence model with the vof method to simulate spilling breakers in the surf zone both turbulence intensity and mean vorticity were found concentrated in the regions of the breaking wave fronts the production and dissipation were considered responsible for the change in the turbulent kinetic energy and the wave profile this means that modifications of these two terms or using a different turbulence model can produce very different results bradford 2000 simulated spilling and plunging breakers using a single phase cfd model based on the vof method combined with one and two equation turbulence models i e k model k ε model and rng model the curling forward of the wave crest in the plunging breakers cannot be captured which was explained as the limitation of the vof method to model complex free surface geometries and the inadequate spatial resolution however in the authors opinion more important reasons are the large dissipation of the turbulence models and the single phase flow model similar research on breaking wave simulations with k ε turbulence model can also be found in shao 2006 and bakhtyar et al 2009 based on the incompressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics isph by shao 2006 khayyer et al 2008 presented a 2d single phase flow method i e corrected incompressible sph cisph method for the study of different types of solitary wave breaking on a slope the numerical results were compared with the laboratory photographs li 2000 li and raichlen 2003 to demonstrate the sufficient numerical accuracy the effect of motions smaller than the size of particles or the sub particle scale sps turbulence gotoh 2001 was not taken into account the k ω turbulence model was recommended by bradford 2000 due to the possibly better predictions of turbulent kinetic energy mayer and madsen 2001 showed that spilling breaker simulations with a stability improved k ω turbulence model and the vof method agreed well with the experimental measurements ting and kirby 1994 with respect to elevation statistics and flow kinematics with the development of computer technology and fluid dynamics more two phase cfd simulations with rans turbulence models were developed to study breaking wave modelling xie 2013 employed a two phase flow model to investigate both spilling and plunging breakers in the surf zones based on k ε turbulence model and the vof method this model performed well in capturing the overturning jet the air entrainment and the prediction of spilling breaking point chella et al 2015 2016 used a two phase flow model combining level set method lsm and k ω turbulence model to simulate waves breaking over a sloping seabed the characteristics of hydrodynamics and free surface profiles of spilling and plunging breakers were discussed and compared to each other the numerical model agreed well with the measurements of ting and kirby 1994 1995 1996 in terms of velocity prediction surface elevation profile and breaking positions brown et al 2016 evaluated different rans turbulence models for numerical efficiency and accuracy of breaking wave modelling with vof method the comparisons against laboratory data of ting and kirby 1994 were made in terms of surface elevation velocity and turbulent kinetic energy profiles it was pointed out that turbulence model could improve computational efficiency significantly the top three recommendations form brown et al 2016 considering both numerical accuracy and efficiency are nonlinear k ε reynolds stress model rsm and k ω sst devolder et al 2018 implemented buoyancy modified k ω and k ω sst turbulence model for breaking waves the basic idea is to set a laminar viscosity around the free surface in the wave propagation zone and switch back to original turbulence model in the surf zone through a buoyancy term triggered by a large horizontal density gradient this improvement was motivated by the extra wave damping around the free surface introduced by the rans turbulence models the resultant of turbulent kinetic energy showed a better agreement with the measurement than the traditional turbulence model but the values were still overestimated devolder et al 2018 mentioned that the turbulent kinetic energy was also overpredicted in the other published numerical studies xie 2013 jacobsen et al 2014 brown et al 2016 using the vof method and rans models therefore the significance of switching to the original turbulence model in the surf zone is not clear which actually results in the larger turbulent kinetic energy larsen and fuhrman 2018 discussed the over production of turbulence beneath surface waves using traditional rans turbulence models which appears in both pre breaking and breaking wave processes the over predicted turbulent kinetic energy and eddy viscosity showed an asymptotic exponential growth and was considered to result in the damped surface elevations a new stabilized turbulence model was implemented by limiting the eddy viscosity and showed a good improvement on the turbulence prediction for the spilling breaking case of ting and kirby 1994 wang and liu 2020 validated a 2d isph model by solving the rans equations in simulating transient free surface turbulent flow problems the concept of massless isph was stressed an adaptive wall boundary condition for k ε turbulence model was employed to avoid the unrealistic production of turbulence near the wall boundary the turbulence evolution due to flow separation and wave breaking under solitary waves was reproduced properly all the aforementioned numerical research with the vof method employed the continuous free surface conditions which means the physical quantities velocity density and pressure etc are continuous and gradually changed across the free surface as mentioned in vukčević et al 2017 the imbalance between dynamic pressure gradient and density gradient that can occur in this approach generates a spurious air velocity in the momentum equation which has a big influence on the breaking wave simulations afshar 2010 vukčević et al 2017 implemented free surface jump conditions using a general ghost fluid method gfm desjardins et al 2008 lalanne et al 2015 in foam extend the density and the dynamic pressure have a shape distribution at the interface the validation was conducted through inviscid flow over a two dimensional ramp and steady resistance simulations of a container ship at different froude numbers the results agreed well with the analytical and experimental data in the authors view free surface jump conditions are an important improvement on the free surface simulation based on the vof method especially for the breaking waves as a summary both the free surface modelling approach and turbulence model are of great importance for breaking wave modelling to the authors knowledge there is limited research on the influence of free surface modelling approaches on breaking wave predictions especially for the vof method as for the influences from different rans turbulence models the research papers did not exclude the influence from spurious air velocities it is therefore difficult to distinguish between different turbulence models when the results are dominated by the spurious air velocities these are the main motivations of the present research a two phase flow model in foam extend is used to perform two dimensional numerical simulations on the spilling and the plunging breakers in the present study free surface k ω sst turbulence model is developed based on the traditional k ω sst turbulence model menter 1994 for wave turbulence simulations the paper is organized as follows first mesh refinement and time step refinement studies are performed for the plunging breaking waves propagating over a slope without turbulence models under the continuous free surface conditions and the free surface jump conditions then the influences of the free surface modelling approaches and turbulence models on the breaking point prediction are discussed for both the spilling and the plunging breakers the free surface jump conditions are selected for the following studies to exclude the effects from the spurious air velocity subsequently the free surface elevations and the averaged velocity fields of the spilling and the plunging breakers are studied with different turbulence models finally the influences of different k ω sst turbulence models on the turbulent kinetic energy and the general turbulence behaviour are investigated in details for both the spilling and the plunging breakers 2 numerical method the numerical simulations in the present study are conducted using foam extend 4 0 jasak et al 2015a b the governing equations boundary conditions free surface modelling approaches and turbulence models are presented in this section respectively 2 1 governing equations the incompressible viscous flows of two immiscible fluids i e air and water are governed by navier stokes equations see equations 1 and 2 the surface tension effect is considered negligible in the present study 1 u 0 2 ρ u t ρ u u t μ e u p r g h g x ρ where u u v w is the mean velocity vector ρ is the fluid density μ e is the effective dynamic viscosity different for two phases p r g h is the pressure in excess of the static pressure defined as p r g h p ρ g x g is the gravitational acceleration vector x x y z are the cartesian coordinates in most fluid dynamics problems gravity forces or other inertial forces dominate thus making surface tension effects negligible hughes 1993 the relative importance of the inertial force and the surface tension force for free surface waves has been studied and discussed in the published research see table 1 there are usually critical dimensionless parameters making the surface tension negligible as summarized in table 1 weber number is defined as w e b e r v c 2 ρ w a t e r l w σ where v c is taken as the wave celerity ρ w a t e r is the water density l w is the characteristic length taken as d b still water depth at the breaking point and σ 0 07 nm 1 is the surface tension the present wave parameters presented in table 1 are based on the incident waves the comparison of the present waves and the critical conditions of the surface tension in table 1 shows that the surface tension can be neglected for both the spilling and plunging waves in the present study 2 2 interface capturing vof method is used to capture the free surface between the two phases the volume fraction of water α in vof method is defined as 3 α v w v where v is a control volume and v w is the volume of the water in the control volume therefore the range of α is from 0 to 1 the transport equation for α is rusche 2003 4 α t α u α 1 α u r 0 an interface compression technique is used by adding an artificial compressive term the third term in equation 4 to prevent the excessive smearing of the free surface the compressive velocity u r is defined as vukčević et al 2017 5 u r c α n η c o r d f δ t where c α is a compression constant to control the sharpness of the free surface n η is the unit vector normal to the interface η c o r d f is the reference compression courant number which is 0 5 in the present study d f is the distance between two cell centers sharing an internal face and δ t is the time step the readers can refer to rusche 2003 and vukčević et al 2017 for more detailed information the term u r is only active within the thin interface region where the value of α is between 0 and 1 because of the multiplication term α 1 α for the pure water or the air phase the third term will vanish the calculated α is used to calculate the effective dynamic viscosity μ e in equation 2 which is continuous without any abrupt change the dynamic pressure and density could be sharp or smeared according to different free surface modelling approaches 2 3 free surface modelling approaches the interface η separates two phases i e water and air in the present study the density in each phase is assumed to be constant i e ρ ρ a i r in the phase of air ρ ρ w a t e r in the phase of water two different methods are used to address the condition across the interface one is a conditionally averaged approach which is referred to as continuous free surface condition in the present study this method is most commonly used with the vof method the other one is ghost fluid method gfm fedkiw et al 1999 kang et al 2000 desjardins et al 2008 bo and grove 2014 lalanne et al 2015 approach which is referred to as free surface jump condition vukčević et al 2017 in the present research the details of these two free surface modelling approaches will be given in the following subsections 2 3 1 continuous free surface conditions the continuous free surface conditions assume that all the fluid properties are continuous across the free surface including the density it is widely used in the modelling of free surface waves together with the vof method see jacobsen et al 2012 bruinsma 2016 liu et al 2018a b as well as in violent breaking wave simulations see lupieri and contento 2015 brown et al 2016 devolder et al 2018 the fluid properties across the free surface are calculated based on α where α is calculated from equation 4 6 ρ α ρ w a t e r 1 α ρ a i r 7 ν e α ν e w a t e r 1 α ν e a i r where ν e w a t e r is the effective kinematic viscosity in water and ν e a i r is the effective kinematic viscosity in air all the fluid properties across the free surface are continuous therefore the calculated velocity and dynamic pressure in equations 1 and 2 change gradually from one phase to another however the continuous free surface conditions will lead to spurious air velocities around the free surface the cause of the spurious air velocity is described in detail by vukčević et al 2017 the dynamic pressure gradient p r g h and the density gradient ρ see the right side of equation 2 should be balanced in a hydrostatic state 8 ρ u t p r g h g x ρ s u here the source term s u represents the imbalance between p r g h and ρ the value of s u is generally not zero in the vicinity of the interface due to the segregated solution algorithms the s u term creates a temporal change of velocity which is non physical since the air has a much smaller density than the water presented in the time derivative term the change in velocity is greater in the air phase resulting in the spurious air velocities afshar 2010 also mentioned the influence of this spurious air velocity for wave propagation and the premature breaking was observed for deep water stokes waves 2 3 2 free surface jump conditions the free surface jump conditions used in the present study are based on vukčević et al 2017 it assumes that the density ρ and dynamic pressure p r g h are sharp across the free surface and can be written as 9 ρ ρ ρ 10 p r g h ρ g x where the notations follow the previous papers on gfm desjardins et al 2008 huang et al 2007 i e superscript represents the heavier phase and superscript represents the lighter phase ρ and p r g h are the jumps of the density and dynamic pressure across the free surface the kinetic boundary condition is continuous across the free surface i e the velocity field is continuous shown as 11 u u u 0 the pressure field without regard to the surface tension effects is also a continuous field 12 p 0 furthermore the surface divergence of surface tension force and surface gradient of the normal velocity are neglected huang et al 2007 vukčević 2016 therefore the effective kinematic viscosity is assumed continuous across the free surface 13 ν e α ν e w a t e r 1 α ν e a i r 2 4 relaxation method the wave relaxation method presented by jacobsen et al 2012 is employed to generate waves in the inlet relaxation zone and absorb waves in the outlet relaxation zone see fig 1 inside the relaxation zones the relaxation function γ r is applied with the expression of 14 γ r 1 e x p χ r 3 5 1 e x p 1 1 15 φ γ r φ c o m p u t e d 1 γ r φ t a r g e t where φ is either velocity vector u or volume fraction α χ r 0 1 and γ 1 at the interface between the working zone and the relaxation zones the values in the relaxation zones ramp up to the target values which is according to the selected wave theory in the inlet relaxation zone and zero in the outlet relaxation zone in the present study both the inlet and outlet relaxation zones are one wavelength long 2 5 turbulence modelling there are several inconsistencies regrading the application of turbulence models to free surface wave simulations for example some free surface simulations do not include a turbulence model the concern is that most of the existing turbulence models are designed for single phase flow without adverse pressure gradients and dominant free stream flow whose turbulence behaviour could be very different from the two phase free surface turbulence where waves are present therefore a turbulence model is not included in some wave structure interaction research paulsen et al 2014 jasak et al 2015a b due to these uncertainties the other controversy is regarding the choice of the turbulence model that is the most appropriate for free surface simulation there are many different les and rans turbulence models rans turbulence models are widely used in breaking wave simulations e g k ε xie 2013 k ω chella et al 2016 k ω sst liu et al 2019 modified k ω and k ω sst devolder et al 2018 and reynolds stress model brown et al 2016 all with the continuous free surface conditions however there is no consensus as to which turbulence model or what kind of turbulence model can give the best prediction for breaking wave simulations in this section the k ω sst turbulence model is selected as a basic turbulence model by taking an overall consideration of the numerical results and recommendations from brown et al 2016 and devolder et al 2018 three different k ω sst turbulence models will be employed in the present study i e the original k ω sst turbulence model menter 1994 the buoyancy modified k ω sst turbulence model devolder et al 2018 and the free surface k ω sst turbulence model 2 5 1 k ω sst turbulence model the original k ω sst turbulence model used in the present study is based on menter 1994 two advection diffusion equations for turbulent kinetic energy k and turbulent characteristic frequency ω are 16 k t u k p k β k ω ν σ k ν t k 17 ω t u ω δ s 2 β ω 2 ν σ ω ν t ω 2 1 f 1 σ ω 2 ω k ω t 18 ν t a 1 k m a x a 1 ω s f 2 where p k m i n ν t u u t 10 β k ω s is the absolute value of the vorticity any constant φ σ k σ ω β δ of the k ω sst turbulence model is calculated from the constant φ 1 σ k 1 σ ω 1 β 1 δ 1 in the k ω turbulence model wilcox 1988 and the constant φ 2 σ k 2 σ ω 2 β 2 δ 2 in the transformed k ε model mohammadi and pironneau 1993 the constants of the k ω sst turbulence model in the present study are σ k 1 0 85 σ k 2 1 0 σ ω 1 0 5 σ ω 2 0 856 β 1 0 075 β 2 0 0828 a 1 0 31 δ 1 0 5532 δ 2 0 4403 β 0 09 2 5 2 buoyancy modified k ω sst turbulence model the buoyancy modified k ω sst turbulence model is based on the model developed by devolder et al 2018 the basic idea is to introduce a buoyancy term in the equation of k which implements laminar viscosity around free surface before wave breaking and activates turbulent viscosity after breaking the transport equation for ω is the same with the original k ω sst turbulence model see equation 17 the k equation of the buoyancy modified k ω sst turbulence model is 19 k t u k p k g b β k ω ν σ k ν t k where the nomenclature is same with the original k ω sst turbulence model see s e c t i o n 2 5 1 the buoyancy term g b is defined as 20 g b ν t σ t ρ ρ g where σ t 0 85 first g b suppresses the turbulence level at the free surface the vertical density gradient is large across the free surface for non breaking waves therefore g b sets ν t to zero i e it is in the laminar regime near free surface to prevent excessive wave damping secondly for the breaking waves the horizontal density gradient is large after the breaking point and g b is zero i e it will perform the same as the original k ω sst turbulence model after the breaking point the buoyancy modified k ω sst turbulence model requires high precision of breaking point prediction to trigger g b which is demanding for the realistic breaking waves especially the plunging breakers with an air pocket due to the complicated free surface shape more details can be seen in devolder et al 2018 it is worth noting that the density is explicitly included in the turbulence transport equations in devolder et al 2018 in the present study the buoyancy modified k ω sst turbulence model is employed with the free surface jump conditions thus the density term is excluded in the turbulence transport equations see the comparison of equations 19 and 17 in the present study and equations 19 and 20 in devolder et al 2018 2 5 3 free surface k ω sst turbulence model the basic idea of the free surface k ω sst turbulence model is similar to the buoyancy modified k ω sst turbulence model i e using a laminar regime around the free surface to prevent over prediction on wave damping the results from devolder et al 2018 figs 3 and 6 show that k in the surf zone is over predicted more than twice when compared to the experimental data ting and kirby 1994 therefore the free surface k ω sst turbulence model restrains the turbulence intensity around the free surface in the surf zone the forms of the transport equations for k and ω are the same with the original k ω sst turbulence model see equations 16 and 17 in order to prevent the unbounded increase of ν t near the free surface the target turbulent kinetic energy near the free surface k f s can be calculated from equation 18 as follows 21 k f s β l ν l max a 1 ω s f 2 a 1 where β l ν t ν l is the ratio between the turbulent eddy viscosity and the laminar viscosity in the absence of a better model β l 1 by default and it means that the same amount of eddy viscosity is attributed to the turbulence as is for the molecular viscosity in order to make k towards k f s in the vicinity of the free surface the relaxation zone with an implicit treatment is employed using a function γ written as 22 γ t k k f s k 1 γ 0 γ max ψ l l b 1 the term γ γ x t approaches zero around the free surface and when γ 1 the original transport equation for k is recovered the term ψ l is the incident level set field defined as the least distance towards the incident free surface which is employed to guarantee numerical stability where the total level set field has a distortion the term l b is the user defined blending length which represents the distance from the free surface where the target viscosity laminar viscosity in the present study is imposed the term l b should be as small as possible to ensure the laminar region confined to the vicinity of the free surface meanwhile l b should be able to cover at least a few cells near the free surface in this way the effects of the laminar viscosity are confined to a very narrow region around the free surface and also help to reduce the k value after wave breaking the value of l b is kept constant and around one cell height for all the simulations in the present study the quantified control gives this turbulence model a broader and more flexible application for the different type of free surface simulations the main concepts of the aforementioned turbulence models are summarized in table 2 2 6 computational domain and boundary conditions the setup of the computational domain corresponds to the experimental tests conducted by ting and kirby 1994 the layout of the numerical wave tank is presented in fig 2 the dimensions of the wave tank are 40m long and 0 7m high where x and z is the horizontal and vertical coordinates respectively the water depth in the horizontal region is 0 4m the water depth at x 0 is 0 38m therefore in the numerical model one short slope of 1 1 is created prior to the long slope of 1 35 to obtain the consistent water depth with the experimental tests the incident waves are generated based on the stream function theory dean 1965 each computational cell adjacent to the domain boundary has a boundary face which could be three states i e completely wet completely dry and intersected by the free surface see fig 3 the boundary conditions are shown as follows i at the inlet boundary of the computational domain the boundary conditions for the dry boundary faces are 23 n p r g h a i r 0 u 0 α 0 and for the wet boundary faces the boundary conditions are 24 n p r g h w a t e r 0 u u w a v e x y z t α 1 where n is the boundary unit normal vector p r g h a i r and p r g h w a t e r are the pressure in excess of the static pressure in air and water respectively the u w a v e x y z t for the wet boundary faces is set based on the chosen potential wave theory for the boundary faces intersected by the free surface i and ii are the intersection points η is the linear approximation to the real free surface η see fig 4 the shaded part represents the wet area a w the wet geometry center point is c w and α at the boundary is defined as a w a where a is the area of the boundary face velocity and pressure can be obtained from equation 24 and applied at the c w point moreover k and ω are calculated as follows 25 k i n l e t 1 5 u c i 2 ω i n l e t k i n l e t 0 5 c μ l where u c is the wave celerity the turbulence intensity i 2 lyn et al 1995 empirical constant c μ 0 09 and turbulence length l 0 07 h h is incident wave height ii at the outlet of the computational domain p r g h k and ω are prescribed with the normal zero gradient boundary condition and u 0 is applied along the boundary iii at the top of the computational domain air and water can flow out freely and only air is allowed to flow in for the velocity at top boundary a normal zero gradient boundary condition is applied for the outflow for the inflow the velocity is obtained from the flux in the patch normal direction the pressure at the top boundary is set as total pressure which is calculated by 26 p t p 0 0 5 u 2 where p t is the total pressure p 0 is the reference pressure and is set as 0 here the normal zero gradient boundary condition is applied for k and ω at the top boundary iv the no slip wall boundary condition is used for the slope bottom the fluid velocity at the bottom boundary is zero the normal zero gradient boundary condition is applied for p r g h a fixed value of zero is applied for k and ω is calculated as ω w a l l 60 ν β 1 δ y 1 2 where y 1 is the distance between the first cell layer point and the wall menter 1994 y is less than 3 for all the simulations in the present study 2 7 numerical scheme equations are solved with the finite volume method versteeg and malalasekera 2007 approach and the pimple pressure implicit method for pressure linked equations holzmann 2017 the convection terms the diffusion terms and the gradient terms are discretized by second order gauss linear upwind scheme limited gauss linear scheme and second order gauss scheme with face limited limiter respectively second order backward scheme is used to integrate the equations in time special treatment for dynamic pressure across the interface can be seen in vukčević et al 2017 3 results and discussion two types of typical breaking waves spilling and plunging breakers are simulated according to the experimental test conducted by ting and kirby 1994 the incident wave parameters the breaking wave heights and the breaking points in ting and kirby 1994 are shown in table 3 here h 0 is the wave height in deep water λ 0 is the wavelength in deep water h and t are the incident wave height and wave period from inlet relaxation zone x b is the horizontal coordinate of the breaking point and d b is the still water depth at the breaking point the breaking point of spilling breaker is defined as the location where the wave crests begin to entrain the air bubbles the breaking point of the plunging breaker is defined as the point where the front face of the wave becomes nearly vertical 3 1 mesh and time step refinement studies the plunging breaking wave case without a turbulence model is chosen for the mesh and time step refinement studies on account of more violent impacts than the spilling breakers the refinement studies are conducted under the free continuous surface conditions and the free surface jump conditions respectively all the numerical schemes and setups of these two conditions are identical with the only difference being the free surface modelling approach stream function waves with a wave height of 0 128m and a wave period of 5 0s are generated in the numerical wave tank the simulations are performed for 30 t where t is the incident wave period the results of breaking position and breaking wave height are calculated by averaging the values from the last 20 t four meshes with different resolutions used in the present study are shown in table 4 the number of cells per wavelength and per wave height is calculated based on the grid resolution at the starting point of the slope the time step is controlled by the maximum courant number which varies from 0 5 to 0 3 for the mesh with the converged resolution fig 5 shows the numerical results for the different meshes in terms of the breaking positions and the breaking wave heights the simulations with both the continuous free surface conditions and the free surface jump conditions are performed and marked with circles and diamonds respectively the grid convergence index gci method celik et al 2008 is used to evaluate the numerical uncertainty in the fine grid resolution m 4 g c i f i n e 34 and the relative error between m 3 and m 4 e a 34 the relevant calculation procedure is shown in table 5 and the detailed calculations of the variables can be found in celik et al 2008 the relative error between m 3 and m 4 e a 34 1 5 for both the breaking position and the breaking wave height therefore m 3 with 580 grids per wavelength and 32 grids per wave height is considered to give sufficient accuracy for the present simulation cases the time step refinement study is conducted by decreasing the maximum courant number from 0 5 to 0 3 the results are shown as the open markers in fig 5 for the continuous free surface condition the relative error of the breaking positions between these two courant numbers is 0 35 and the relative error of the breaking wave heights between these two courant numbers is 0 94 for the free surface jump conditions the relative error of the breaking positions between these two courant numbers is 0 40 and the relative error of breaking wave heights between these two courant numbers is 1 11 therefore the grid resolution of m 3 with the maximum courant number 0 5 is considered to give satisfactory numerical accuracy and will be used in the subsequent simulations it appears that the very coarse mesh predicts a later breaking point compared to that of the finer meshes there are large smearing effects in the computational field of the coarse mesh which introduce high numerical diffusion and may cause the late prediction on the breaking point the breaking point of the continuous free surface condition is always prior to that of the free surface jump conditions which will be discussed in detail in section 3 2 1 the central part of m 3 and the zoom in mesh around the starting point of the slope are shown in fig 6 the mesh around the slope is refined to capture the boundary layer on the wall for the cases with turbulence models the non dimensional wall distance y is less than 3 menter 1994 3 2 breaking point prediction of the breaking point is of great importance in breaking wave simulations especially for the interaction of breaking waves and marine structures according to the numerical simulations of breaking waves past a vertical monopile structure conducted by kamath et al 2016 the largest wave force occurs when the breaker tongue is just below the wave crest level the breaker just has a slight overturning bredmose and jacobsen 2010 and the lowest wave force is obtained when the wave breaks behind the cylinder the difference between the highest and lowest wave force on the monopile structure with different breaking locations is 30 33 kamath et al 2016 another example can be seen is the experimental research conducted by obhrai et al 2005 into violent breaking waves on a vertical wall for the same regular incident waves which generated plunging breakers the maximum pressure on the wall is more than 10 times larger than the minimum pressure and the difference between the maximum and minimum wave force on the wall is more than 50 this is due to different reflections from the wall that result in different breaking locations and subsequently generate different wave shapes hitting the wall this means that inaccurate prediction of the breaking position could result in a large error for the prediction of wave loads on marine structures therefore the factors influencing the numerical prediction of breaking point are discussed in this section 3 2 1 the influence of free surface modelling approaches on the prediction of breaking point two different free surface modelling approaches i e the continuous free surface conditions and the free surface jump conditions are used to simulate spilling and plunging breakers for the spilling breaking waves the comparisons of free surface shapes with instantaneous air velocity magnitude contours of the continuous free surface conditions and the free surface jump conditions are shown in fig 7 the dimensionless time t is defined as t t t s t a r t t where t s t a r t corresponds to the first time instant in fig 7 and t s t a r t 41 1 s in the spilling breaker simulations the red vertical line represents the experimental breaking position from ting and kirby 1994 the two free surfaces have almost the same phase at the starting time instant however the wave front of the continuous free surface conditions is steeper than that of the free surface jump conditions the relatively high air velocity of the continuous free surface conditions can be observed within a thin layer just above the wave crest which is larger than that of the free surface jump conditions this larger air velocity around the free surface is the spurious air velocity introduced by the continuous condition as discussed in section 2 3 1 the influence of the spurious air velocity can be seen in the following time instants when t 0 05 the simulated wave with the continuous free surface conditions already begins to break with a small jet at the wave front however the waves with the free surface jump conditions still propagates without any breaking until t 0 10 then the wave crest is nearly vertical and has the tendency to generate the jet when t 0 25 both waves with the continuous free surface conditions and the free surface jump conditions fully break the air velocity fields around the wave crest become chaotic and increase in value with the wave energy transferring to turbulent kinetic energy it appears that the continuous free surface conditions will predict an early breaking due to disturbance from the spurious air velocity for the present spilling breaker the difference of breaking position between the continuous free surface conditions and the jump free surface conditions is around 0 33m i e 8 6 of the incident wavelength λ 3 843 m the comparisons in fig 7 show that the free surface jump conditions are able to eliminate the spurious air velocity and give a better prediction on the breaking point closer to corresponding experimental breaking point than the continuous free surface conditions the free surface jump conditions has more significant and obvious influence on the plunging breaker than the spilling breaker simulations as shown in fig 8 the starting time t s t a r t is 100 6s for the plunging breaker simulations at the starting time instant the wave front of the continuous free surface conditions is much steeper than that of the free surface jump conditions and the spurious air velocity is observed clearly the wave with the continuous free surface condition has already broken slightly at t 0 04 however in the simulation using the free surface jump conditions the wave front becomes vertical when t 0 10 fig 8d shows that both numerical models capture the main characteristics of the plunging breakers i e the water jet moves forward curls over and drops onto the wave trough with trapped and compressed air pocket after the breaking point for the present plunging breaker the difference of breaking position between the continuous free surface conditions and the free surface jump conditions is around 0 75m i e 7 0 of the incident wavelength λ 10 658 m the early breaking prediction caused by the continuous free surface conditions can also be found in several other numerical results lupieri and contento 2015 brown et al 2016 devolder et al 2018 however there is no proper solution given in those studies regarding the spurious air velocity which can disturb the water horizontal velocity at the wave crest dramatically and cause an early breaking see figs 7b 8b the spurious air velocity can be up to 5 6 times of the maximum horizontal velocity of the waves field moreover it cannot be improved by refining the mesh afshar 2010 the present numerical results show that the free surface jump conditions based on ghost fluid method vukčević et al 2017 is able to avoid the effects from the spurious air velocity and predict a more accurate breaking position than that of the continuous free surface conditions 3 2 2 the influence of turbulence models on the prediction of breaking point in this section the influence of different turbulence models on the breaking point prediction is discussed the three turbulence models presented in section 2 6 are applied to both the spilling and the plunging breaker simulations i e the original k ω sst turbulence model k ω sst the buoyancy modified k ω sst turbulence model bm k ω sst and the free surface k ω sst turbulence model fs k ω sst no tm is short for no turbulence model the blending length l b in the fs k ω sst model is 0 004 which is around one cell height in the free surface region it is worth noting that only the free surface jump conditions are used together with different turbulence models due to the exclusion of spurious air velocity and its better prediction on breaking point when compared to the continuous free surface conditions the breaking positions are slightly different at each wave period fig 9 shows the instantaneous spilling breaking point without turbulence model and with different turbulence models the contour in the water phase is a plot with the velocity magnitude the red vertical line represents the experimental breaking position the numerical model without turbulence model gives the earliest prediction of the breaking point the distance to the experimental breaking point is 20 8 of the incident wavelength λ the spilling breaker with the original k ω sst turbulence model does not break in the numerical wave tank during the simulation the bm k ω sst turbulence model gives a late breaking point which is 13 8 of λ compared to the experimental breaking point the breaking point from the fs k ω sst turbulence model agrees well with the experimental breaking point in general turbulence models have the tendency to give a late prediction on the breaking point during the prebreaking phase the dissipation rates of both spilling and plunging breakers are comparable to the non breaking dissipation rate iafrati 2011 all the aforementioned turbulence models introduce larger dissipation and diffusion effects at the free surface in the governing equations compared to the no tm model which contribute to a stable energy distribution at the free surface therefore the free surface wave with a turbulence model can sustain for a longer time than that without turbulence model likewise the original k ω sst turbulence model has larger turbulent kinetic energy at the free surface region than the bm k ω sst and the fs k ω sst turbulence models which causes larger dissipation and diffusion at the free surface and the non breaking behaviour fig 10 shows the instantaneous plunging breaking point without turbulence model and with different turbulence models it is similar to the spilling breaker simulations in that the numerical breaking point without a turbulence model is earlier than with a turbulence model the distance between the numerical breaking point without turbulence model and the experimental breaking point is 3 8 of the λ the original k ω sst turbulence model gives a late prediction of the plunging breaking point around 11 3 of the λ compared to the experiment both the bm k ω sst and the fs k ω sst models can predict the plunging breaking point precisely and the velocity fields from these two turbulence models are similar basically the influence of the turbulence model for the breaking point prediction is similar for both the spilling and the plunging breakers the improved breaking point prediction with the fs k ω sst model also shows that it is necessary to modify the k value as well as the viscosity value around the free surface to obtain more realistic dissipation and diffusion table 6 presents a summary of the breaking points for different numerical models the breaking point is the average position of the last 20t wave periods the horizontal coordinates of the breaking points are x b n and x b e for the present numerical simulations and the published experimental tests respectively the term x b e x b n λ is the relative error of breaking position to incident wavelength the free surface jump conditions without including a turbulence model can improve the prediction of the breaking point however the accuracy is still not sufficient relative error 20 5 for the spilling breaker and 3 3 for the plunging breaker a turbulence model is therefore necessary to correctly simulate breaking waves the turbulence model has the tendency to postpone the wave breaking due to the larger diffusion and dissipation at the free surface than the case without turbulence model however the wave damping effects from the diffusion and dissipation are too large with the original k ω sst turbulence model due to the large k and ν t values close to the free surface region the basic concept of the bm k ω sst and the fs k ω sst models is to reset the ν value as laminar viscosity in the vicinity of free surface and then reduce the wave damping to a realistic level the results in table 6 also show that this concept works well to improve the numerical prediction of spilling and plunging breakers in addition the fs k ω sst model gives a better prediction on the breaking point compared to the bm k ω sst model especially for spilling breakers this can be explained by the precise control of the laminar region around the free surface which is kept as small as possible in the present study the results of this study help to explain why many research papers can obtain satisfactory results for spilling breaker prediction when using the continuous free surface conditions and original turbulence model xie 2013 choi et al 2015 jose et al 2017 liu et al 2019 this is due to the opposite influence of the continuous free surface conditions and the turbulence model on the simulated breaking point hence this combination appears to give a seemingly accurate prediction however it is not completely correct in physics and may not suitable for the other breaking wave cases therefore the authors recommend to use the free surface jump conditions with the special turbulence model for breaking wave simulations it is also shown in table 6 that the influence of the turbulence model on the breaking point is smaller for a plunging compared to a spilling breaker in the present study the spilling and the plunging breakers are generated in the same numerical wave tank over the same slope the incident wavelength of the plunging breaker is 10 658m i e around three times as that of the spilling breaker λ 3 843m and the incident wave heights are very similar the keulegan carpenter number kc is defined as k c 2 π η m a x λ where η m a x is the maximum surface elevation and incident wavelength λ is selected as the characteristic length due to its indication of the water particle orbital diameter according to the present numerical results and the experimental data from ting and kirby 1994 η m a x of the spilling and the plunging breakers are similar which is around 0 55m therefore during the wave propagation process before breaking k c of the plunging breaker is around three times smaller than that of the spilling breaker this means the relative importance of inertia forces is larger for the plunging breakers than the spilling breakers in other words the turbulence effects are larger for the spilling breakers than the plunging breakers before breaking in the present study 3 3 surface elevations and averaged velocity field fig 11 shows the time averaged numerical results of surface elevations of the spilling breakers along the wave tank with different turbulence models the horizontal axis denotes different horizontal locations along x axis in the numerical wave tank and x 0 is the start of the slope the vertical axis represents the time averaged surface elevation over 20 t there are three solid lines in each figure which represent the maximum averaged and minimum time averaged surface elevations from top to bottom respectively the experimental data by ting and kirby 1994 is presented with red dots in the figures the root mean square error rmse denoted by e is calculated with respect to the experimental data for the maximum e m a x mean e m e a n and minimum e m i n surface elevations the choice of the turbulence model has a large influence on the surface elevation predictions for spilling breaking waves the original k ω sst turbulence model can not predict a breaking action due to the large dissipation and diffusion around the free surface therefore the e m a x of the k ω sst model is the largest among the four models unexpected non breaking waves are not a specific feature of the k ω sst model but can occur to the breaking waves when the turbulence plays an important role as for the prediction of the mean and minimum surface profiles the four models do not show a big difference in terms of e m e a n and e m i n similar phenomena can be also found in the discussion by brown et al 2016 and devolder et al 2018 when using the continuous free surface conditions with different turbulence models therefore more discussion will be addressed at the maximum surface elevations where the significant discrepancies between the numerical and the experimental results occur in general the maximum surface elevations obtained by the turbulence models are slightly lower than that without turbulence model which can be explained by the energy transformation during wave propagation the total mechanical energy in the water phase is composed of potential energy and kinetic energy the potential energy and the kinetic energy are interchangeable during the wave propagating process the potential energy term has a zero value at a still free surface and is larger with a higher free surface elevation the kinetic energy has two contributions i e the mean velocity and the velocity fluctuations the velocity fluctuations are produced by extracting energy from the mean flow and the extracted energy is then transferred down the turbulence energy cascade and is dissipated by viscous forces at the small scales the dissipation and the diffusion in the simulations with a turbulence model are larger compared to simulations without a turbulence model this can explain why lower surface elevations are observed when a turbulence model is included in the present free surface simulations in term of the free surface prediction the fs k ω sst model shows better performance than the bm k ω sst model denoted by smaller e m a x in fig 11 this is mainly due to the influence of the buoyancy term g b as shown in equation 20 the g b term switches the turbulence model to the original k ω sst model at the position where an important horizontal density gradient is detected devolder et al 2018 however the criterion is not always applicable for breaking position prediction due to the complicated free surface geometries during wave breaking which also varies with different breaker types and incident wave conditions hence the inaccurate trigger of g b results in the inaccurate predictions of free surface elevation and breaking position when using the bm k ω sst model fig 12 shows the numerical phase averaged surface elevations of the spilling breakers along the slope with different turbulence models the horizontal axis is the non dimensional time over one wave period and the vertical axis is the non dimensional surface elevation η η η h where η is the instantaneous water surface elevation η is the mean water surface elevation h is local mean local water depth the subscript be denotes the experimental breaking point the fs k ω sst turbulence model gives a good prediction on the phase averaged surface elevation with the measurement ting and kirby 1996 due to the accurate prediction on the breaking point the k ω sst turbulence model shows lower phase averaged surface elevations than the experimental data due to the predicted non breaking waves the bm k ω sst turbulence model shows higher phase averaged surface elevations than the other models and experimental data the no tm shows the chaotic variations of the surface elevations due to the incapability of the turbulence in the surf zone fig 13 shows the time averaged simulated surface elevations for the plunging breakers along the wave tank with different turbulence models the axes and nomenclature are the same with that of the spilling breakers the e m e a n and e m i n do not show a significant difference between different turbulence models similar with the spilling breakers the no tm predicts an early plunging breaking position the maximum surface elevations obtained when applying a turbulence model are also slightly lower when compared to the simulations without a turbulence model for the plunging breaker case the difference is that the numerical model with the k ω sst model will break for the plunging breaker case but not for the spilling breaker case this is due to the relative importance of the turbulence effects to the inertia forces as explained in section 3 2 2 the numerical plunging breaking positions from both the bm k ω sst and the fs k ω sst models agree well with the experimental data ting and kirby 1994 devolder et al 2018 also mentioned that the wave damping relevant to g b term might not be triggered for some plunging breaker cases due to low wave steepness of the plunging breakers therefore the results of the bm k ω sst model show a similar behaviour with the fs k ω sst model in terms of the free surface elevation predictions fig 14 presents the comparisons of simulated and measured time averaged horizontal velocities u over 20t of the spilling breakers at different locations the rows represent the results from different turbulence models a no turbulence model b k ω sst c bm k ω sst d fs k ω sst the columns represent different horizontal sampling positions x 5 945m x 6 665m x 7 275m x 7 885m x 8 495m x 9 110m and x 9 725m the first location is prior to the experimental breaking point and the other locations are after the experimental breaking point in each figure the horizontal axis represents the values of time averaged horizontal velocities and the vertical axis represents the vertical coordinates in the wave tank see fig 2 for more information the red dots represent the experimentally measured data and the solid lines represent the present numerical results the e is the rmse of the numerical results of u along water depth with respect to the experimental data in general the basic variation trends of u can be captured at all the sampling locations i e the values of u are negative from just above the bottom of the wave tank to the vicinity of the free surface and u becomes positive near the free surface according to the e values at different locations the results from the k ω sst model agree best with the experimental data surprisingly even though the wave does not break with the k ω sst model the e values of u without a turbulence model are the largest at all the sampling positions and is therefore not recommended for the spilling breaker simulations the no tm the bm k ω sst and the fs k ω sst models have the tendency to overestimate the u in the vicinity of the free surface due to the less wave damping laminar viscosity around the free surface than the k ω sst model therefore less energy around the free surface is dissipated and diffused with these three models than with the k ω sst model and more energy is transferred to the kinetic energy in the form of u for the bm k ω sst and the fs k ω models a better prediction of u is seen before breaking and e is larger in the surf zone and then reduces in the distant zone from the breaking position this can be explained by the strong three dimensional effects in the surf zone the velocity in the spanwise direction is small compared to the other two directions before breaking and far behind the surf zone while in the vicinity after breaking the velocity in the spanwise direction is comparable to the other two directions liu et al 2018a however the present two dimensional simulations cannot capture the spanwise velocities and result in larger velocities in the longitudinal section than in the measurements fig 15 shows the comparisons of simulated and measured phase averaged horizontal velocities over 20t of the spilling breakers at different vertical locations the good agreement can be observed between the horizontal velocity predicted by fs k ω sst turbulence model and the experimental data ting and kirby 1996 the k ω sst and bm k ω sst turbulence model show higher horizontal velocities at the given locations due to the predicted later breaking point or non breaking the notm cannot predict velocities or surface elevations shown in fig 12 well in the surf zone where the turbulence characteristics cannot be ignored fig 16 presents the comparisons of simulated and measured u over 20t of the plunging breakers at different locations the axes and nomenclature are the same with those of the spilling breakers the rows represent the results from different turbulence models a no turbulence model b k ω sst c bm k ω sst d fs k ω sst the columns represent different horizontal sampling positions x 7 295m x 7 795m x 8 345m x 8 795m x 9 295m x 9 795m and x 10 395m the first location is prior to the experimental breaking point the second one is at the breaking position and the other locations are after the experimental breaking point as seen previously the predictions of u before and at the experimental breaking position show a better agreement with the experimental data than the other locations due to the strong three dimensional effects in the surf zone the surf zone of the plunging breaker is larger than that of the spilling breaker due to the larger incident wavelength therefore the last sampling location is still inside or close to the surf zone where the e value is still large the u fields of the plunging breakers are also more uniform along the water depth compared to the spilling breakers due to the smaller water depth over wavelength the e values for the k ω sst model are smaller than that with the bm k ω sst model and without a turbulence model at most of the sampling positions however the sharp velocity change around the free surface is not captured by the k ω sst model and the breaking position is not predicted accurately the other three models have a similar performance for the u prediction before breaking however the e values of the bm k ω sst and the no tm models are larger than that of the fs k ω sst model at most of the locations after the breaking point 3 4 turbulence behaviour the turbulence behaviour underwater can be of great importance to the sediment transport of a movable seabed under free surface waves therefore the time averaged turbulent kinetic energy and the reynolds stress tensor of the spilling and the plunging breakers are discussed in this section fig 17 shows the time averaged turbulent kinetic energy k over 20t of the spilling breakers compared to the experimental data ting and kirby 1994 shown as red dots the rows represent k from different turbulence models a k ω sst b bm k ω sst c fs k ω sst the columns represent different horizontal sampling positions which are consistent with the sampling locations of u in each figure the horizontal axis represents the values of k and the vertical axis represents the vertical coordinates in the wave tank previous studies xie 2013 jacobsen et al 2014 brown et al 2016 devolder et al 2018 have shown that the rans models overpredict k in the water phase under the free surface the same tendency is also captured in the present simulations shown in fig 17 the k of the k ω sst model agrees best with the experimental data reported by ting and kirby 1994 however the wave breaking is not captured as compared to the experimental tests this means that the k of non breaking waves with the k ω sst model is comparable with k of breaking wave in these experiments the maximum k values from the bm k ω sst and the fs k ω sst models are more than twice of the maximum k values in the experiments devolder et al 2018 explained this overprediction by the fact that the traditional turbulence models are not designed for two phase flow in the authors opinion a more important reason is due to the two dimensional simulations which cannot solve the secondary flow interaction in the spanwise direction most of the rans turbulence models e g k ε k ω and k ω sst are isotropic eddy viscosity models this means that the spanwise information cannot be captured well even with three dimensional simulations unless the geometry has variations in the spanwise direction the better predictions of undersurface k from a les compared to a rans turbulence model can be seen in zhou et al 2017 their study showed that the overestimation of k when using a rans model was due to the lack of the three dimensional effects and the isotropic eddy viscosity assumption generally the k is lowest at the bottom boundary and increases gradually to the water surface due to the artificial laminar viscosity around the free surface of the bm k ω sst and the fs k ω sst models a smaller k value can be observed around the free surface than the surrounding positions the predictions of k from the bm k ω sst and the fs k ω sst models are similar when x 7 275 m the first three sampling locations after x 7 885 m the k from the bm k ω sst model increases rapidly until the last sampling position however in the same region the k from the fs k ω sst model increases gradually until x 9 110 m and then reduces slightly at x 9 725 m it can be conjectured that the g b term of the bm k ω sst model becomes zero after x 7 275 m then the turbulence model is switched to the original k ω sst model and a larger k is observed in this region than that of the fs k ω sst model in addition to the time averaged k the phase averaged k in the surf zone using different turbulence models are compared with the experimental data by ting and kirby 1996 as shown in fig 18 bm k ω sst and fs k ω sst turbulence models show good prediction in terms of the phase average turbulent kinetic energy at different water depth as compared to the experimental data ting and kirby 1996 the waves predicted by k ω sst turbulence model are non breaking and the numerical k value is therefore lower than that of the other turbulence models fig 19 depicts the contour of the predicted reynolds stress magnitude of the spilling breakers with different turbulence models the reynolds stresses play a crucial role in the equations for the u and indicate the turbulence intensity of the flow field columns represents different turbulence models a k ω sst b bm k ω sst c fs k ω sst and rows represent different time instants 1 t t 0 00 2 t t 0 15 3 t t 0 25 4 t t 0 75 the breaking onset is recorded as t t 0 00 and the other time instants are relative to the breaking onset due to the non breaking waves predicted by the k ω sst model the turbulence intensity from the k ω sst model is less than that from the other turbulence models generally a high turbulence intensity can be observed at the wave front and these high values continue to exist near the water surface which also corresponds to the k predictions in fig 17 the buoyancy term g b of the bm k ω sst model is supposed to be zero after x 7 275 m see the variations of k in fig 19 it can also be observed that there are high reynolds stresses in the vicinity of the water surface after x 7 275 m the turbulence intensity predicted by the bm k ω sst model is larger around the free surface than that predicted by the fs k ω sst model due to the switch to the original k ω sst model after x 7 275 m the comparisons of between the reynolds stresses at t t 0 25 and t t 0 75 for both the bm k ω sst and the fs k ω sst models demonstrate that the turbulence is generated at the wave crest and then spreads to the bottom boundary through the convection and diffusion terms which is also observed in the experiments conducted by ting and kirby 1994 fig 20 shows the comparison of k profiles over 20t of the plunging breakers against the experimental data ting and kirby 1994 denoted by red dots the axes and nomenclature are the same as the spilling breaker case in fig 17 the columns represent different sampling locations which are the same as fig 16 the experimental data shows that the variations of k of the plunging breakers are very minor along the water depth and only vary significantly at the wave front due to the small water depth to wavelength ratio this characteristic is only captured by the fs k ω sst model the k ω sst model overestimates the k values in the surf zone x 9 082 m considerably which suggests that a special turbulence model for two phase free surface flow is required the bm k ω sst model is supposed to trigger the g b term to be zero before x 8 795 m due to the sharp increase of k from x 8 345 m to x 8 795 m after x 8 795 m the k values predicted by the bm k ω sst model are much larger than the experimental data similar to the k ω sst model results the large over predictions on k for both the spilling and the plunging breakers in the surf zones using the bm k ω sst model suggest that it is necessary to limit the turbulence viscosity in the surf zone fig 21 describes the contour of the predicted reynolds stress magnitude for the plunging breakers with different turbulence models i e a k ω sst b bm k ω sst c fs k ω sst the rows represent different time instants 1 t t 0 00 2 t t 0 06 3 t t 0 16 4 t t 0 30 and t t 0 00 represents the breaking onset the turbulence intensity at the wave front from the k ω sst model is much higher than those from the bm k ω sst and the fs k ω sst models at the breaking onset at t t 0 06 the jet from the overturning wave front plunges into the free surface and traps an air pocket the fs k ω sst model forms a more typical and representative air pocket of the plunging breakers than the other turbulence models at this time the high turbulence intensity is still mainly concentrated at the wave crest according to the observations of ting and kirby 1994 it starts the violent transition to rotational flows from this point and the trapped air pocket fills the entire water column with air bubbles this experimental phenomenon is well captured especially by the bm k ω sst and the fs k ω sst models even though the small air bubbles are not included in the present study it is observed that from t t 0 06 to t t 0 16 the air pocket formed by the impinging jet travels quickly from the water surface to the bottom the turbulence intensity spreads from the wave crest to the bottom of the wave tank in this way and the vertical mixing is faster and stronger in the plunging breakers than in the spilling breakers the turbulence intensity decays rapidly from t t 0 16 to t t 0 30 after the wave front roller passes moreover the turbulent intensity of the plunging breakers is much smaller compared to the spilling breakers in the experiments ting and kirby 1994 the results from the fs k ω sst model reveal this characteristic see the comparison of figs 19c and 21c 4 conclusions the influences of the free surface jump conditions and different k ω sst turbulence models on breaking wave modelling are investigated using a two phase flow model in foam extend three different turbulence models are studied i e the original k ω sst model from menter 1994 the bm k ω sst model from devolder et al 2018 and the fs k ω sst model proposed in the present study similar investigations on breaking wave modelling can be found in brown et al 2016 and devolder et al 2018 however the previous studies all use the continuous free surface conditions which causes large spurious air velocities in the vicinity of the free surface the spurious air velocities then introduce a bias to the evaluation of the different turbulence models therefore it is necessary to identify the effects of free surface modelling approach for breaking wave prediction and then evaluate the different turbulence models in the present study both the influences from the free surface modelling approach and the turbulence models are taken into consideration in spilling and plunging breaker simulations the breaking point is firstly investigated with different free surface modelling approaches and different turbulence models then the free surface elevations and the time averaged velocity fields are studies with different turbulence models when using the free surface jump conditions finally the turbulent behaviour of different turbulence models is discussed in detail the following main conclusions can be drawn from this investigation i due to the disturbance from the spurious air velocity the continuous free surface conditions predict an earlier breaking than the jump conditions and experimental measurements the jump conditions can eliminate the spurious air velocity and give a better agreement with the experimental breaking point than the continuous conditions it has significant influence on both the modelling of spilling and plunging breakers in the present study for the present spilling breaker the difference of breaking positions between the continuous free surface conditions and the free surface jump conditions is 0 33m 8 6 λ and that for the plunging breaker is 0 75m 7 1 λ the free surface jump conditions are therefore recommended for the breaking wave modelling ii turbulence models have the tendency to postpone breaking position due to the larger dissipation and diffusion effects at the free surface when compared to using the no tm model the breaking point using the fs k ω sst model agrees well with the experimental breaking point for both the spilling and the plunging breakers the original k ω sst model has larger wave damping than the other models which results in a non breaking prediction for the spilling breaker and the late breaking position for the plunging breaker the influence of the turbulence models on the breaking point is smaller for the plunging than the spilling breaker in the present study this is due to the smaller kc of the plunging breaker when compared to the spilling breaker hence the turbulence effects are larger for the spilling breaker case than the plunging breaker case before breaking iii the turbulence model has a large influence on the surface elevation predictions for both the spilling and the plunging breaking waves the maximum surface elevations obtained by turbulence models are lower than that without turbulence model due to the transfer of potential energy to turbulent kinetic energy iv better predictions of u for the spilling and the plunging breaking waves are observed outside the surf zone rather than inside the surf zone when using different turbulence models the velocity in the spanwise direction is comparable to the other two directions in the surf zone which cannot be captured in the present two dimensional simulations v the predictions of k for the spilling and the plunging breaking waves are also better outside the surf zone rather than inside the surf zone all the turbulence models in the present study overestimate k for the spilling and the plunging breakers due to the lack of the three dimensional effects and the isotropic eddy viscosity assumption vi for the spilling breakers a high turbulence intensity is generated at the wave crest and then spreads to the bottom boundary through the convection and diffusion slowly for plunging breakers the high turbulence intensity is initially concentrated at the wave crest then the air pocket formed by the impinging jet travels quickly from the water surface to the bottom boundary both the fs k ω sst and the bm k ω sst models can capture these phenomena well however in terms of the realistic profile of the plunging air pocket and the values of k the fs k ω sst model predicts the turbulence behaviour of breaking waves best vii in summary the fs k ω sst and the bm k ω sst models have the similar basic concept i e set the viscosity as laminar viscosity in the vicinity of the free surface however the trigger conditions of g b in the bm k ω sst model are ambiguously connected to the breaking onset the inaccurate triggering position of g b causes extra errors another main difference between these two models is that the turbulence at free surface is still limited to laminar level in the surf zone for the fs k ω sst but not for the bm k ω sst it is important to note that the present fs k ω sst model only demonstrates the concept to limit the turbulence intensity in the surf zone due to the large overestimations of k from most rans models compared to the experimental data however quantitative research on the surf zone turbulence still requires substantial effort which will be the future work credit authorship contribution

21424,a two phase flow computational fluid dynamics cfd model is employed for both spilling and plunging breaking wave simulations a numerical wave tank is built to evaluate the performance of two different free surface modelling approaches i e continuous free surface conditions and free surface jump conditions and three k ω sst turbulence models i e the original k ω sst the buoyancy modified k ω sst and the free surface k ω sst a newly proposed model the influences of the free surface modelling approaches and the turbulence models are investigated by comparing with the published experimental measurements in terms of breaking point free surface elevations time averaged velocity field time averaged turbulent kinetic energy and general turbulent behaviour respectively overall the free surface k ω sst with the free surface jump conditions performs best in terms of the accuracy of the predictions against the experimental data and the capture of the physical breaking phenomena for instance the trapped air pocket and the development of the free surface in the surf zone keywords cfd breaking waves free surface jump conditions modified k ω sst turbulence model 1 introduction breaking waves are considered one of the most severe environmental loads on marine structures the large nonlinear impact forces and high order excitations from the breaking waves can lead to significant damage of the marine structures therefore it is of great importance to estimate breaking onset and velocity field accurately in order to calculate breaking wave loads more accurately moreover the breaking waves are more frequently observed when the waves propagate from offshore to coastal areas if the sands on the seabed are fine 300 μ m then coastal erosion and sediment transport can occur especially in the surf and swash zones of the breaking waves it means that it is also important to predict the turbulent behaviour of breaking waves in shallow water which is closely related to the sediment dynamics therefore the hydrodynamic behaviour and the turbulent kinematics of the breaking waves are the main research concerns for breaking wave modelling experiments played an important role to study the physics of breaking waves even though most experiments are conducted in small scales see the following examples ting and kirby 1994 conducted experiments on both spilling and plunging breakers to study the undertow and the turbulence effects in the surf zone the characteristics of mean flow and turbulence of spilling and plunging breakers were studied it was found that for the spilling breakers the turbulent kinetic energy is transported seaward and it is landward for the plunging breakers in addition the turbulence intensity and the vertical gradient of undertow under the plunging breakers are much smaller than that under the spilling breakers the experimental data from ting and kirby 1994 is also chosen as the validation data in the present study subsequently ting 2001 2002 conducted experimental studies on the turbulent characteristics of the irregular breaking waves other experimental research on breaking waves over a slope or a bar can be also found in seyama and kimura 1989 beji and battjes 1993 iwata et al 1997 and chang and liu 1998 and the large scale experiments by ting and nelson 2011 and ting 2013 most of these tests focused on the energy transformation and turbulent characteristics in the surf zones of breaking waves which is complex and important for near shore sediment transport computational fluid dynamics cfd is considered as a good alternative or assistance to experiments due to its reasonable accuracy obviating scale effects and eliminating disturbances from operations and facilities breaking waves are characterized by strong wave wave interactions resulting in energy being transferred from the primary wave frequency to higher frequencies thornton 1979 it was also shown by svendsen 1987 that the surf zones of the breaking waves were characterized by a strong turbulence generation in the following decades a large number of cfd simulations on breaking waves involving turbulence models were conducted e g lin and liu 1998 watanabe and saeki 1999 bradford 2000 christensen and deigaard 2001 rhee and stern 2002 christensen 2006 lubin et al 2006 wang et al 2009 xie 2013 chella et al 2015 brown et al 2016 and devolder et al 2018 watanabe and saeki 1999 carried a two phase large eddy simulation les of a plunging breaker over a slope with the volume of fluid vof method the characteristics of vorticity and velocity field after wave breaking were discussed it was found that the fluid motion is two dimensional in the wave direction before wave breaking and has a three dimensional flow structure comprised of horizontal helical and vertical eddies after breaking christensen 2006 studied undertow and turbulence of spilling and plunging breakers using a two phase cfd model based on the vof method and les turbulence model the turbulence levels were overpredicted compared to the experimental data ting and kirby 1994 with unknown reasons the three dimensional les simulations usually need sufficiently fine mesh resolutions as a result it is very time consuming and demands large computational power alternatively reynolds averaged navierstokes rans model is more commonly adopted for breaking wave modelling due to its high computational efficiency lin and liu 1998 developed a single phase algebraic nonlinear reynolds stress k ε turbulence model with the vof method to simulate spilling breakers in the surf zone both turbulence intensity and mean vorticity were found concentrated in the regions of the breaking wave fronts the production and dissipation were considered responsible for the change in the turbulent kinetic energy and the wave profile this means that modifications of these two terms or using a different turbulence model can produce very different results bradford 2000 simulated spilling and plunging breakers using a single phase cfd model based on the vof method combined with one and two equation turbulence models i e k model k ε model and rng model the curling forward of the wave crest in the plunging breakers cannot be captured which was explained as the limitation of the vof method to model complex free surface geometries and the inadequate spatial resolution however in the authors opinion more important reasons are the large dissipation of the turbulence models and the single phase flow model similar research on breaking wave simulations with k ε turbulence model can also be found in shao 2006 and bakhtyar et al 2009 based on the incompressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics isph by shao 2006 khayyer et al 2008 presented a 2d single phase flow method i e corrected incompressible sph cisph method for the study of different types of solitary wave breaking on a slope the numerical results were compared with the laboratory photographs li 2000 li and raichlen 2003 to demonstrate the sufficient numerical accuracy the effect of motions smaller than the size of particles or the sub particle scale sps turbulence gotoh 2001 was not taken into account the k ω turbulence model was recommended by bradford 2000 due to the possibly better predictions of turbulent kinetic energy mayer and madsen 2001 showed that spilling breaker simulations with a stability improved k ω turbulence model and the vof method agreed well with the experimental measurements ting and kirby 1994 with respect to elevation statistics and flow kinematics with the development of computer technology and fluid dynamics more two phase cfd simulations with rans turbulence models were developed to study breaking wave modelling xie 2013 employed a two phase flow model to investigate both spilling and plunging breakers in the surf zones based on k ε turbulence model and the vof method this model performed well in capturing the overturning jet the air entrainment and the prediction of spilling breaking point chella et al 2015 2016 used a two phase flow model combining level set method lsm and k ω turbulence model to simulate waves breaking over a sloping seabed the characteristics of hydrodynamics and free surface profiles of spilling and plunging breakers were discussed and compared to each other the numerical model agreed well with the measurements of ting and kirby 1994 1995 1996 in terms of velocity prediction surface elevation profile and breaking positions brown et al 2016 evaluated different rans turbulence models for numerical efficiency and accuracy of breaking wave modelling with vof method the comparisons against laboratory data of ting and kirby 1994 were made in terms of surface elevation velocity and turbulent kinetic energy profiles it was pointed out that turbulence model could improve computational efficiency significantly the top three recommendations form brown et al 2016 considering both numerical accuracy and efficiency are nonlinear k ε reynolds stress model rsm and k ω sst devolder et al 2018 implemented buoyancy modified k ω and k ω sst turbulence model for breaking waves the basic idea is to set a laminar viscosity around the free surface in the wave propagation zone and switch back to original turbulence model in the surf zone through a buoyancy term triggered by a large horizontal density gradient this improvement was motivated by the extra wave damping around the free surface introduced by the rans turbulence models the resultant of turbulent kinetic energy showed a better agreement with the measurement than the traditional turbulence model but the values were still overestimated devolder et al 2018 mentioned that the turbulent kinetic energy was also overpredicted in the other published numerical studies xie 2013 jacobsen et al 2014 brown et al 2016 using the vof method and rans models therefore the significance of switching to the original turbulence model in the surf zone is not clear which actually results in the larger turbulent kinetic energy larsen and fuhrman 2018 discussed the over production of turbulence beneath surface waves using traditional rans turbulence models which appears in both pre breaking and breaking wave processes the over predicted turbulent kinetic energy and eddy viscosity showed an asymptotic exponential growth and was considered to result in the damped surface elevations a new stabilized turbulence model was implemented by limiting the eddy viscosity and showed a good improvement on the turbulence prediction for the spilling breaking case of ting and kirby 1994 wang and liu 2020 validated a 2d isph model by solving the rans equations in simulating transient free surface turbulent flow problems the concept of massless isph was stressed an adaptive wall boundary condition for k ε turbulence model was employed to avoid the unrealistic production of turbulence near the wall boundary the turbulence evolution due to flow separation and wave breaking under solitary waves was reproduced properly all the aforementioned numerical research with the vof method employed the continuous free surface conditions which means the physical quantities velocity density and pressure etc are continuous and gradually changed across the free surface as mentioned in vukčević et al 2017 the imbalance between dynamic pressure gradient and density gradient that can occur in this approach generates a spurious air velocity in the momentum equation which has a big influence on the breaking wave simulations afshar 2010 vukčević et al 2017 implemented free surface jump conditions using a general ghost fluid method gfm desjardins et al 2008 lalanne et al 2015 in foam extend the density and the dynamic pressure have a shape distribution at the interface the validation was conducted through inviscid flow over a two dimensional ramp and steady resistance simulations of a container ship at different froude numbers the results agreed well with the analytical and experimental data in the authors view free surface jump conditions are an important improvement on the free surface simulation based on the vof method especially for the breaking waves as a summary both the free surface modelling approach and turbulence model are of great importance for breaking wave modelling to the authors knowledge there is limited research on the influence of free surface modelling approaches on breaking wave predictions especially for the vof method as for the influences from different rans turbulence models the research papers did not exclude the influence from spurious air velocities it is therefore difficult to distinguish between different turbulence models when the results are dominated by the spurious air velocities these are the main motivations of the present research a two phase flow model in foam extend is used to perform two dimensional numerical simulations on the spilling and the plunging breakers in the present study free surface k ω sst turbulence model is developed based on the traditional k ω sst turbulence model menter 1994 for wave turbulence simulations the paper is organized as follows first mesh refinement and time step refinement studies are performed for the plunging breaking waves propagating over a slope without turbulence models under the continuous free surface conditions and the free surface jump conditions then the influences of the free surface modelling approaches and turbulence models on the breaking point prediction are discussed for both the spilling and the plunging breakers the free surface jump conditions are selected for the following studies to exclude the effects from the spurious air velocity subsequently the free surface elevations and the averaged velocity fields of the spilling and the plunging breakers are studied with different turbulence models finally the influences of different k ω sst turbulence models on the turbulent kinetic energy and the general turbulence behaviour are investigated in details for both the spilling and the plunging breakers 2 numerical method the numerical simulations in the present study are conducted using foam extend 4 0 jasak et al 2015a b the governing equations boundary conditions free surface modelling approaches and turbulence models are presented in this section respectively 2 1 governing equations the incompressible viscous flows of two immiscible fluids i e air and water are governed by navier stokes equations see equations 1 and 2 the surface tension effect is considered negligible in the present study 1 u 0 2 ρ u t ρ u u t μ e u p r g h g x ρ where u u v w is the mean velocity vector ρ is the fluid density μ e is the effective dynamic viscosity different for two phases p r g h is the pressure in excess of the static pressure defined as p r g h p ρ g x g is the gravitational acceleration vector x x y z are the cartesian coordinates in most fluid dynamics problems gravity forces or other inertial forces dominate thus making surface tension effects negligible hughes 1993 the relative importance of the inertial force and the surface tension force for free surface waves has been studied and discussed in the published research see table 1 there are usually critical dimensionless parameters making the surface tension negligible as summarized in table 1 weber number is defined as w e b e r v c 2 ρ w a t e r l w σ where v c is taken as the wave celerity ρ w a t e r is the water density l w is the characteristic length taken as d b still water depth at the breaking point and σ 0 07 nm 1 is the surface tension the present wave parameters presented in table 1 are based on the incident waves the comparison of the present waves and the critical conditions of the surface tension in table 1 shows that the surface tension can be neglected for both the spilling and plunging waves in the present study 2 2 interface capturing vof method is used to capture the free surface between the two phases the volume fraction of water α in vof method is defined as 3 α v w v where v is a control volume and v w is the volume of the water in the control volume therefore the range of α is from 0 to 1 the transport equation for α is rusche 2003 4 α t α u α 1 α u r 0 an interface compression technique is used by adding an artificial compressive term the third term in equation 4 to prevent the excessive smearing of the free surface the compressive velocity u r is defined as vukčević et al 2017 5 u r c α n η c o r d f δ t where c α is a compression constant to control the sharpness of the free surface n η is the unit vector normal to the interface η c o r d f is the reference compression courant number which is 0 5 in the present study d f is the distance between two cell centers sharing an internal face and δ t is the time step the readers can refer to rusche 2003 and vukčević et al 2017 for more detailed information the term u r is only active within the thin interface region where the value of α is between 0 and 1 because of the multiplication term α 1 α for the pure water or the air phase the third term will vanish the calculated α is used to calculate the effective dynamic viscosity μ e in equation 2 which is continuous without any abrupt change the dynamic pressure and density could be sharp or smeared according to different free surface modelling approaches 2 3 free surface modelling approaches the interface η separates two phases i e water and air in the present study the density in each phase is assumed to be constant i e ρ ρ a i r in the phase of air ρ ρ w a t e r in the phase of water two different methods are used to address the condition across the interface one is a conditionally averaged approach which is referred to as continuous free surface condition in the present study this method is most commonly used with the vof method the other one is ghost fluid method gfm fedkiw et al 1999 kang et al 2000 desjardins et al 2008 bo and grove 2014 lalanne et al 2015 approach which is referred to as free surface jump condition vukčević et al 2017 in the present research the details of these two free surface modelling approaches will be given in the following subsections 2 3 1 continuous free surface conditions the continuous free surface conditions assume that all the fluid properties are continuous across the free surface including the density it is widely used in the modelling of free surface waves together with the vof method see jacobsen et al 2012 bruinsma 2016 liu et al 2018a b as well as in violent breaking wave simulations see lupieri and contento 2015 brown et al 2016 devolder et al 2018 the fluid properties across the free surface are calculated based on α where α is calculated from equation 4 6 ρ α ρ w a t e r 1 α ρ a i r 7 ν e α ν e w a t e r 1 α ν e a i r where ν e w a t e r is the effective kinematic viscosity in water and ν e a i r is the effective kinematic viscosity in air all the fluid properties across the free surface are continuous therefore the calculated velocity and dynamic pressure in equations 1 and 2 change gradually from one phase to another however the continuous free surface conditions will lead to spurious air velocities around the free surface the cause of the spurious air velocity is described in detail by vukčević et al 2017 the dynamic pressure gradient p r g h and the density gradient ρ see the right side of equation 2 should be balanced in a hydrostatic state 8 ρ u t p r g h g x ρ s u here the source term s u represents the imbalance between p r g h and ρ the value of s u is generally not zero in the vicinity of the interface due to the segregated solution algorithms the s u term creates a temporal change of velocity which is non physical since the air has a much smaller density than the water presented in the time derivative term the change in velocity is greater in the air phase resulting in the spurious air velocities afshar 2010 also mentioned the influence of this spurious air velocity for wave propagation and the premature breaking was observed for deep water stokes waves 2 3 2 free surface jump conditions the free surface jump conditions used in the present study are based on vukčević et al 2017 it assumes that the density ρ and dynamic pressure p r g h are sharp across the free surface and can be written as 9 ρ ρ ρ 10 p r g h ρ g x where the notations follow the previous papers on gfm desjardins et al 2008 huang et al 2007 i e superscript represents the heavier phase and superscript represents the lighter phase ρ and p r g h are the jumps of the density and dynamic pressure across the free surface the kinetic boundary condition is continuous across the free surface i e the velocity field is continuous shown as 11 u u u 0 the pressure field without regard to the surface tension effects is also a continuous field 12 p 0 furthermore the surface divergence of surface tension force and surface gradient of the normal velocity are neglected huang et al 2007 vukčević 2016 therefore the effective kinematic viscosity is assumed continuous across the free surface 13 ν e α ν e w a t e r 1 α ν e a i r 2 4 relaxation method the wave relaxation method presented by jacobsen et al 2012 is employed to generate waves in the inlet relaxation zone and absorb waves in the outlet relaxation zone see fig 1 inside the relaxation zones the relaxation function γ r is applied with the expression of 14 γ r 1 e x p χ r 3 5 1 e x p 1 1 15 φ γ r φ c o m p u t e d 1 γ r φ t a r g e t where φ is either velocity vector u or volume fraction α χ r 0 1 and γ 1 at the interface between the working zone and the relaxation zones the values in the relaxation zones ramp up to the target values which is according to the selected wave theory in the inlet relaxation zone and zero in the outlet relaxation zone in the present study both the inlet and outlet relaxation zones are one wavelength long 2 5 turbulence modelling there are several inconsistencies regrading the application of turbulence models to free surface wave simulations for example some free surface simulations do not include a turbulence model the concern is that most of the existing turbulence models are designed for single phase flow without adverse pressure gradients and dominant free stream flow whose turbulence behaviour could be very different from the two phase free surface turbulence where waves are present therefore a turbulence model is not included in some wave structure interaction research paulsen et al 2014 jasak et al 2015a b due to these uncertainties the other controversy is regarding the choice of the turbulence model that is the most appropriate for free surface simulation there are many different les and rans turbulence models rans turbulence models are widely used in breaking wave simulations e g k ε xie 2013 k ω chella et al 2016 k ω sst liu et al 2019 modified k ω and k ω sst devolder et al 2018 and reynolds stress model brown et al 2016 all with the continuous free surface conditions however there is no consensus as to which turbulence model or what kind of turbulence model can give the best prediction for breaking wave simulations in this section the k ω sst turbulence model is selected as a basic turbulence model by taking an overall consideration of the numerical results and recommendations from brown et al 2016 and devolder et al 2018 three different k ω sst turbulence models will be employed in the present study i e the original k ω sst turbulence model menter 1994 the buoyancy modified k ω sst turbulence model devolder et al 2018 and the free surface k ω sst turbulence model 2 5 1 k ω sst turbulence model the original k ω sst turbulence model used in the present study is based on menter 1994 two advection diffusion equations for turbulent kinetic energy k and turbulent characteristic frequency ω are 16 k t u k p k β k ω ν σ k ν t k 17 ω t u ω δ s 2 β ω 2 ν σ ω ν t ω 2 1 f 1 σ ω 2 ω k ω t 18 ν t a 1 k m a x a 1 ω s f 2 where p k m i n ν t u u t 10 β k ω s is the absolute value of the vorticity any constant φ σ k σ ω β δ of the k ω sst turbulence model is calculated from the constant φ 1 σ k 1 σ ω 1 β 1 δ 1 in the k ω turbulence model wilcox 1988 and the constant φ 2 σ k 2 σ ω 2 β 2 δ 2 in the transformed k ε model mohammadi and pironneau 1993 the constants of the k ω sst turbulence model in the present study are σ k 1 0 85 σ k 2 1 0 σ ω 1 0 5 σ ω 2 0 856 β 1 0 075 β 2 0 0828 a 1 0 31 δ 1 0 5532 δ 2 0 4403 β 0 09 2 5 2 buoyancy modified k ω sst turbulence model the buoyancy modified k ω sst turbulence model is based on the model developed by devolder et al 2018 the basic idea is to introduce a buoyancy term in the equation of k which implements laminar viscosity around free surface before wave breaking and activates turbulent viscosity after breaking the transport equation for ω is the same with the original k ω sst turbulence model see equation 17 the k equation of the buoyancy modified k ω sst turbulence model is 19 k t u k p k g b β k ω ν σ k ν t k where the nomenclature is same with the original k ω sst turbulence model see s e c t i o n 2 5 1 the buoyancy term g b is defined as 20 g b ν t σ t ρ ρ g where σ t 0 85 first g b suppresses the turbulence level at the free surface the vertical density gradient is large across the free surface for non breaking waves therefore g b sets ν t to zero i e it is in the laminar regime near free surface to prevent excessive wave damping secondly for the breaking waves the horizontal density gradient is large after the breaking point and g b is zero i e it will perform the same as the original k ω sst turbulence model after the breaking point the buoyancy modified k ω sst turbulence model requires high precision of breaking point prediction to trigger g b which is demanding for the realistic breaking waves especially the plunging breakers with an air pocket due to the complicated free surface shape more details can be seen in devolder et al 2018 it is worth noting that the density is explicitly included in the turbulence transport equations in devolder et al 2018 in the present study the buoyancy modified k ω sst turbulence model is employed with the free surface jump conditions thus the density term is excluded in the turbulence transport equations see the comparison of equations 19 and 17 in the present study and equations 19 and 20 in devolder et al 2018 2 5 3 free surface k ω sst turbulence model the basic idea of the free surface k ω sst turbulence model is similar to the buoyancy modified k ω sst turbulence model i e using a laminar regime around the free surface to prevent over prediction on wave damping the results from devolder et al 2018 figs 3 and 6 show that k in the surf zone is over predicted more than twice when compared to the experimental data ting and kirby 1994 therefore the free surface k ω sst turbulence model restrains the turbulence intensity around the free surface in the surf zone the forms of the transport equations for k and ω are the same with the original k ω sst turbulence model see equations 16 and 17 in order to prevent the unbounded increase of ν t near the free surface the target turbulent kinetic energy near the free surface k f s can be calculated from equation 18 as follows 21 k f s β l ν l max a 1 ω s f 2 a 1 where β l ν t ν l is the ratio between the turbulent eddy viscosity and the laminar viscosity in the absence of a better model β l 1 by default and it means that the same amount of eddy viscosity is attributed to the turbulence as is for the molecular viscosity in order to make k towards k f s in the vicinity of the free surface the relaxation zone with an implicit treatment is employed using a function γ written as 22 γ t k k f s k 1 γ 0 γ max ψ l l b 1 the term γ γ x t approaches zero around the free surface and when γ 1 the original transport equation for k is recovered the term ψ l is the incident level set field defined as the least distance towards the incident free surface which is employed to guarantee numerical stability where the total level set field has a distortion the term l b is the user defined blending length which represents the distance from the free surface where the target viscosity laminar viscosity in the present study is imposed the term l b should be as small as possible to ensure the laminar region confined to the vicinity of the free surface meanwhile l b should be able to cover at least a few cells near the free surface in this way the effects of the laminar viscosity are confined to a very narrow region around the free surface and also help to reduce the k value after wave breaking the value of l b is kept constant and around one cell height for all the simulations in the present study the quantified control gives this turbulence model a broader and more flexible application for the different type of free surface simulations the main concepts of the aforementioned turbulence models are summarized in table 2 2 6 computational domain and boundary conditions the setup of the computational domain corresponds to the experimental tests conducted by ting and kirby 1994 the layout of the numerical wave tank is presented in fig 2 the dimensions of the wave tank are 40m long and 0 7m high where x and z is the horizontal and vertical coordinates respectively the water depth in the horizontal region is 0 4m the water depth at x 0 is 0 38m therefore in the numerical model one short slope of 1 1 is created prior to the long slope of 1 35 to obtain the consistent water depth with the experimental tests the incident waves are generated based on the stream function theory dean 1965 each computational cell adjacent to the domain boundary has a boundary face which could be three states i e completely wet completely dry and intersected by the free surface see fig 3 the boundary conditions are shown as follows i at the inlet boundary of the computational domain the boundary conditions for the dry boundary faces are 23 n p r g h a i r 0 u 0 α 0 and for the wet boundary faces the boundary conditions are 24 n p r g h w a t e r 0 u u w a v e x y z t α 1 where n is the boundary unit normal vector p r g h a i r and p r g h w a t e r are the pressure in excess of the static pressure in air and water respectively the u w a v e x y z t for the wet boundary faces is set based on the chosen potential wave theory for the boundary faces intersected by the free surface i and ii are the intersection points η is the linear approximation to the real free surface η see fig 4 the shaded part represents the wet area a w the wet geometry center point is c w and α at the boundary is defined as a w a where a is the area of the boundary face velocity and pressure can be obtained from equation 24 and applied at the c w point moreover k and ω are calculated as follows 25 k i n l e t 1 5 u c i 2 ω i n l e t k i n l e t 0 5 c μ l where u c is the wave celerity the turbulence intensity i 2 lyn et al 1995 empirical constant c μ 0 09 and turbulence length l 0 07 h h is incident wave height ii at the outlet of the computational domain p r g h k and ω are prescribed with the normal zero gradient boundary condition and u 0 is applied along the boundary iii at the top of the computational domain air and water can flow out freely and only air is allowed to flow in for the velocity at top boundary a normal zero gradient boundary condition is applied for the outflow for the inflow the velocity is obtained from the flux in the patch normal direction the pressure at the top boundary is set as total pressure which is calculated by 26 p t p 0 0 5 u 2 where p t is the total pressure p 0 is the reference pressure and is set as 0 here the normal zero gradient boundary condition is applied for k and ω at the top boundary iv the no slip wall boundary condition is used for the slope bottom the fluid velocity at the bottom boundary is zero the normal zero gradient boundary condition is applied for p r g h a fixed value of zero is applied for k and ω is calculated as ω w a l l 60 ν β 1 δ y 1 2 where y 1 is the distance between the first cell layer point and the wall menter 1994 y is less than 3 for all the simulations in the present study 2 7 numerical scheme equations are solved with the finite volume method versteeg and malalasekera 2007 approach and the pimple pressure implicit method for pressure linked equations holzmann 2017 the convection terms the diffusion terms and the gradient terms are discretized by second order gauss linear upwind scheme limited gauss linear scheme and second order gauss scheme with face limited limiter respectively second order backward scheme is used to integrate the equations in time special treatment for dynamic pressure across the interface can be seen in vukčević et al 2017 3 results and discussion two types of typical breaking waves spilling and plunging breakers are simulated according to the experimental test conducted by ting and kirby 1994 the incident wave parameters the breaking wave heights and the breaking points in ting and kirby 1994 are shown in table 3 here h 0 is the wave height in deep water λ 0 is the wavelength in deep water h and t are the incident wave height and wave period from inlet relaxation zone x b is the horizontal coordinate of the breaking point and d b is the still water depth at the breaking point the breaking point of spilling breaker is defined as the location where the wave crests begin to entrain the air bubbles the breaking point of the plunging breaker is defined as the point where the front face of the wave becomes nearly vertical 3 1 mesh and time step refinement studies the plunging breaking wave case without a turbulence model is chosen for the mesh and time step refinement studies on account of more violent impacts than the spilling breakers the refinement studies are conducted under the free continuous surface conditions and the free surface jump conditions respectively all the numerical schemes and setups of these two conditions are identical with the only difference being the free surface modelling approach stream function waves with a wave height of 0 128m and a wave period of 5 0s are generated in the numerical wave tank the simulations are performed for 30 t where t is the incident wave period the results of breaking position and breaking wave height are calculated by averaging the values from the last 20 t four meshes with different resolutions used in the present study are shown in table 4 the number of cells per wavelength and per wave height is calculated based on the grid resolution at the starting point of the slope the time step is controlled by the maximum courant number which varies from 0 5 to 0 3 for the mesh with the converged resolution fig 5 shows the numerical results for the different meshes in terms of the breaking positions and the breaking wave heights the simulations with both the continuous free surface conditions and the free surface jump conditions are performed and marked with circles and diamonds respectively the grid convergence index gci method celik et al 2008 is used to evaluate the numerical uncertainty in the fine grid resolution m 4 g c i f i n e 34 and the relative error between m 3 and m 4 e a 34 the relevant calculation procedure is shown in table 5 and the detailed calculations of the variables can be found in celik et al 2008 the relative error between m 3 and m 4 e a 34 1 5 for both the breaking position and the breaking wave height therefore m 3 with 580 grids per wavelength and 32 grids per wave height is considered to give sufficient accuracy for the present simulation cases the time step refinement study is conducted by decreasing the maximum courant number from 0 5 to 0 3 the results are shown as the open markers in fig 5 for the continuous free surface condition the relative error of the breaking positions between these two courant numbers is 0 35 and the relative error of the breaking wave heights between these two courant numbers is 0 94 for the free surface jump conditions the relative error of the breaking positions between these two courant numbers is 0 40 and the relative error of breaking wave heights between these two courant numbers is 1 11 therefore the grid resolution of m 3 with the maximum courant number 0 5 is considered to give satisfactory numerical accuracy and will be used in the subsequent simulations it appears that the very coarse mesh predicts a later breaking point compared to that of the finer meshes there are large smearing effects in the computational field of the coarse mesh which introduce high numerical diffusion and may cause the late prediction on the breaking point the breaking point of the continuous free surface condition is always prior to that of the free surface jump conditions which will be discussed in detail in section 3 2 1 the central part of m 3 and the zoom in mesh around the starting point of the slope are shown in fig 6 the mesh around the slope is refined to capture the boundary layer on the wall for the cases with turbulence models the non dimensional wall distance y is less than 3 menter 1994 3 2 breaking point prediction of the breaking point is of great importance in breaking wave simulations especially for the interaction of breaking waves and marine structures according to the numerical simulations of breaking waves past a vertical monopile structure conducted by kamath et al 2016 the largest wave force occurs when the breaker tongue is just below the wave crest level the breaker just has a slight overturning bredmose and jacobsen 2010 and the lowest wave force is obtained when the wave breaks behind the cylinder the difference between the highest and lowest wave force on the monopile structure with different breaking locations is 30 33 kamath et al 2016 another example can be seen is the experimental research conducted by obhrai et al 2005 into violent breaking waves on a vertical wall for the same regular incident waves which generated plunging breakers the maximum pressure on the wall is more than 10 times larger than the minimum pressure and the difference between the maximum and minimum wave force on the wall is more than 50 this is due to different reflections from the wall that result in different breaking locations and subsequently generate different wave shapes hitting the wall this means that inaccurate prediction of the breaking position could result in a large error for the prediction of wave loads on marine structures therefore the factors influencing the numerical prediction of breaking point are discussed in this section 3 2 1 the influence of free surface modelling approaches on the prediction of breaking point two different free surface modelling approaches i e the continuous free surface conditions and the free surface jump conditions are used to simulate spilling and plunging breakers for the spilling breaking waves the comparisons of free surface shapes with instantaneous air velocity magnitude contours of the continuous free surface conditions and the free surface jump conditions are shown in fig 7 the dimensionless time t is defined as t t t s t a r t t where t s t a r t corresponds to the first time instant in fig 7 and t s t a r t 41 1 s in the spilling breaker simulations the red vertical line represents the experimental breaking position from ting and kirby 1994 the two free surfaces have almost the same phase at the starting time instant however the wave front of the continuous free surface conditions is steeper than that of the free surface jump conditions the relatively high air velocity of the continuous free surface conditions can be observed within a thin layer just above the wave crest which is larger than that of the free surface jump conditions this larger air velocity around the free surface is the spurious air velocity introduced by the continuous condition as discussed in section 2 3 1 the influence of the spurious air velocity can be seen in the following time instants when t 0 05 the simulated wave with the continuous free surface conditions already begins to break with a small jet at the wave front however the waves with the free surface jump conditions still propagates without any breaking until t 0 10 then the wave crest is nearly vertical and has the tendency to generate the jet when t 0 25 both waves with the continuous free surface conditions and the free surface jump conditions fully break the air velocity fields around the wave crest become chaotic and increase in value with the wave energy transferring to turbulent kinetic energy it appears that the continuous free surface conditions will predict an early breaking due to disturbance from the spurious air velocity for the present spilling breaker the difference of breaking position between the continuous free surface conditions and the jump free surface conditions is around 0 33m i e 8 6 of the incident wavelength λ 3 843 m the comparisons in fig 7 show that the free surface jump conditions are able to eliminate the spurious air velocity and give a better prediction on the breaking point closer to corresponding experimental breaking point than the continuous free surface conditions the free surface jump conditions has more significant and obvious influence on the plunging breaker than the spilling breaker simulations as shown in fig 8 the starting time t s t a r t is 100 6s for the plunging breaker simulations at the starting time instant the wave front of the continuous free surface conditions is much steeper than that of the free surface jump conditions and the spurious air velocity is observed clearly the wave with the continuous free surface condition has already broken slightly at t 0 04 however in the simulation using the free surface jump conditions the wave front becomes vertical when t 0 10 fig 8d shows that both numerical models capture the main characteristics of the plunging breakers i e the water jet moves forward curls over and drops onto the wave trough with trapped and compressed air pocket after the breaking point for the present plunging breaker the difference of breaking position between the continuous free surface conditions and the free surface jump conditions is around 0 75m i e 7 0 of the incident wavelength λ 10 658 m the early breaking prediction caused by the continuous free surface conditions can also be found in several other numerical results lupieri and contento 2015 brown et al 2016 devolder et al 2018 however there is no proper solution given in those studies regarding the spurious air velocity which can disturb the water horizontal velocity at the wave crest dramatically and cause an early breaking see figs 7b 8b the spurious air velocity can be up to 5 6 times of the maximum horizontal velocity of the waves field moreover it cannot be improved by refining the mesh afshar 2010 the present numerical results show that the free surface jump conditions based on ghost fluid method vukčević et al 2017 is able to avoid the effects from the spurious air velocity and predict a more accurate breaking position than that of the continuous free surface conditions 3 2 2 the influence of turbulence models on the prediction of breaking point in this section the influence of different turbulence models on the breaking point prediction is discussed the three turbulence models presented in section 2 6 are applied to both the spilling and the plunging breaker simulations i e the original k ω sst turbulence model k ω sst the buoyancy modified k ω sst turbulence model bm k ω sst and the free surface k ω sst turbulence model fs k ω sst no tm is short for no turbulence model the blending length l b in the fs k ω sst model is 0 004 which is around one cell height in the free surface region it is worth noting that only the free surface jump conditions are used together with different turbulence models due to the exclusion of spurious air velocity and its better prediction on breaking point when compared to the continuous free surface conditions the breaking positions are slightly different at each wave period fig 9 shows the instantaneous spilling breaking point without turbulence model and with different turbulence models the contour in the water phase is a plot with the velocity magnitude the red vertical line represents the experimental breaking position the numerical model without turbulence model gives the earliest prediction of the breaking point the distance to the experimental breaking point is 20 8 of the incident wavelength λ the spilling breaker with the original k ω sst turbulence model does not break in the numerical wave tank during the simulation the bm k ω sst turbulence model gives a late breaking point which is 13 8 of λ compared to the experimental breaking point the breaking point from the fs k ω sst turbulence model agrees well with the experimental breaking point in general turbulence models have the tendency to give a late prediction on the breaking point during the prebreaking phase the dissipation rates of both spilling and plunging breakers are comparable to the non breaking dissipation rate iafrati 2011 all the aforementioned turbulence models introduce larger dissipation and diffusion effects at the free surface in the governing equations compared to the no tm model which contribute to a stable energy distribution at the free surface therefore the free surface wave with a turbulence model can sustain for a longer time than that without turbulence model likewise the original k ω sst turbulence model has larger turbulent kinetic energy at the free surface region than the bm k ω sst and the fs k ω sst turbulence models which causes larger dissipation and diffusion at the free surface and the non breaking behaviour fig 10 shows the instantaneous plunging breaking point without turbulence model and with different turbulence models it is similar to the spilling breaker simulations in that the numerical breaking point without a turbulence model is earlier than with a turbulence model the distance between the numerical breaking point without turbulence model and the experimental breaking point is 3 8 of the λ the original k ω sst turbulence model gives a late prediction of the plunging breaking point around 11 3 of the λ compared to the experiment both the bm k ω sst and the fs k ω sst models can predict the plunging breaking point precisely and the velocity fields from these two turbulence models are similar basically the influence of the turbulence model for the breaking point prediction is similar for both the spilling and the plunging breakers the improved breaking point prediction with the fs k ω sst model also shows that it is necessary to modify the k value as well as the viscosity value around the free surface to obtain more realistic dissipation and diffusion table 6 presents a summary of the breaking points for different numerical models the breaking point is the average position of the last 20t wave periods the horizontal coordinates of the breaking points are x b n and x b e for the present numerical simulations and the published experimental tests respectively the term x b e x b n λ is the relative error of breaking position to incident wavelength the free surface jump conditions without including a turbulence model can improve the prediction of the breaking point however the accuracy is still not sufficient relative error 20 5 for the spilling breaker and 3 3 for the plunging breaker a turbulence model is therefore necessary to correctly simulate breaking waves the turbulence model has the tendency to postpone the wave breaking due to the larger diffusion and dissipation at the free surface than the case without turbulence model however the wave damping effects from the diffusion and dissipation are too large with the original k ω sst turbulence model due to the large k and ν t values close to the free surface region the basic concept of the bm k ω sst and the fs k ω sst models is to reset the ν value as laminar viscosity in the vicinity of free surface and then reduce the wave damping to a realistic level the results in table 6 also show that this concept works well to improve the numerical prediction of spilling and plunging breakers in addition the fs k ω sst model gives a better prediction on the breaking point compared to the bm k ω sst model especially for spilling breakers this can be explained by the precise control of the laminar region around the free surface which is kept as small as possible in the present study the results of this study help to explain why many research papers can obtain satisfactory results for spilling breaker prediction when using the continuous free surface conditions and original turbulence model xie 2013 choi et al 2015 jose et al 2017 liu et al 2019 this is due to the opposite influence of the continuous free surface conditions and the turbulence model on the simulated breaking point hence this combination appears to give a seemingly accurate prediction however it is not completely correct in physics and may not suitable for the other breaking wave cases therefore the authors recommend to use the free surface jump conditions with the special turbulence model for breaking wave simulations it is also shown in table 6 that the influence of the turbulence model on the breaking point is smaller for a plunging compared to a spilling breaker in the present study the spilling and the plunging breakers are generated in the same numerical wave tank over the same slope the incident wavelength of the plunging breaker is 10 658m i e around three times as that of the spilling breaker λ 3 843m and the incident wave heights are very similar the keulegan carpenter number kc is defined as k c 2 π η m a x λ where η m a x is the maximum surface elevation and incident wavelength λ is selected as the characteristic length due to its indication of the water particle orbital diameter according to the present numerical results and the experimental data from ting and kirby 1994 η m a x of the spilling and the plunging breakers are similar which is around 0 55m therefore during the wave propagation process before breaking k c of the plunging breaker is around three times smaller than that of the spilling breaker this means the relative importance of inertia forces is larger for the plunging breakers than the spilling breakers in other words the turbulence effects are larger for the spilling breakers than the plunging breakers before breaking in the present study 3 3 surface elevations and averaged velocity field fig 11 shows the time averaged numerical results of surface elevations of the spilling breakers along the wave tank with different turbulence models the horizontal axis denotes different horizontal locations along x axis in the numerical wave tank and x 0 is the start of the slope the vertical axis represents the time averaged surface elevation over 20 t there are three solid lines in each figure which represent the maximum averaged and minimum time averaged surface elevations from top to bottom respectively the experimental data by ting and kirby 1994 is presented with red dots in the figures the root mean square error rmse denoted by e is calculated with respect to the experimental data for the maximum e m a x mean e m e a n and minimum e m i n surface elevations the choice of the turbulence model has a large influence on the surface elevation predictions for spilling breaking waves the original k ω sst turbulence model can not predict a breaking action due to the large dissipation and diffusion around the free surface therefore the e m a x of the k ω sst model is the largest among the four models unexpected non breaking waves are not a specific feature of the k ω sst model but can occur to the breaking waves when the turbulence plays an important role as for the prediction of the mean and minimum surface profiles the four models do not show a big difference in terms of e m e a n and e m i n similar phenomena can be also found in the discussion by brown et al 2016 and devolder et al 2018 when using the continuous free surface conditions with different turbulence models therefore more discussion will be addressed at the maximum surface elevations where the significant discrepancies between the numerical and the experimental results occur in general the maximum surface elevations obtained by the turbulence models are slightly lower than that without turbulence model which can be explained by the energy transformation during wave propagation the total mechanical energy in the water phase is composed of potential energy and kinetic energy the potential energy and the kinetic energy are interchangeable during the wave propagating process the potential energy term has a zero value at a still free surface and is larger with a higher free surface elevation the kinetic energy has two contributions i e the mean velocity and the velocity fluctuations the velocity fluctuations are produced by extracting energy from the mean flow and the extracted energy is then transferred down the turbulence energy cascade and is dissipated by viscous forces at the small scales the dissipation and the diffusion in the simulations with a turbulence model are larger compared to simulations without a turbulence model this can explain why lower surface elevations are observed when a turbulence model is included in the present free surface simulations in term of the free surface prediction the fs k ω sst model shows better performance than the bm k ω sst model denoted by smaller e m a x in fig 11 this is mainly due to the influence of the buoyancy term g b as shown in equation 20 the g b term switches the turbulence model to the original k ω sst model at the position where an important horizontal density gradient is detected devolder et al 2018 however the criterion is not always applicable for breaking position prediction due to the complicated free surface geometries during wave breaking which also varies with different breaker types and incident wave conditions hence the inaccurate trigger of g b results in the inaccurate predictions of free surface elevation and breaking position when using the bm k ω sst model fig 12 shows the numerical phase averaged surface elevations of the spilling breakers along the slope with different turbulence models the horizontal axis is the non dimensional time over one wave period and the vertical axis is the non dimensional surface elevation η η η h where η is the instantaneous water surface elevation η is the mean water surface elevation h is local mean local water depth the subscript be denotes the experimental breaking point the fs k ω sst turbulence model gives a good prediction on the phase averaged surface elevation with the measurement ting and kirby 1996 due to the accurate prediction on the breaking point the k ω sst turbulence model shows lower phase averaged surface elevations than the experimental data due to the predicted non breaking waves the bm k ω sst turbulence model shows higher phase averaged surface elevations than the other models and experimental data the no tm shows the chaotic variations of the surface elevations due to the incapability of the turbulence in the surf zone fig 13 shows the time averaged simulated surface elevations for the plunging breakers along the wave tank with different turbulence models the axes and nomenclature are the same with that of the spilling breakers the e m e a n and e m i n do not show a significant difference between different turbulence models similar with the spilling breakers the no tm predicts an early plunging breaking position the maximum surface elevations obtained when applying a turbulence model are also slightly lower when compared to the simulations without a turbulence model for the plunging breaker case the difference is that the numerical model with the k ω sst model will break for the plunging breaker case but not for the spilling breaker case this is due to the relative importance of the turbulence effects to the inertia forces as explained in section 3 2 2 the numerical plunging breaking positions from both the bm k ω sst and the fs k ω sst models agree well with the experimental data ting and kirby 1994 devolder et al 2018 also mentioned that the wave damping relevant to g b term might not be triggered for some plunging breaker cases due to low wave steepness of the plunging breakers therefore the results of the bm k ω sst model show a similar behaviour with the fs k ω sst model in terms of the free surface elevation predictions fig 14 presents the comparisons of simulated and measured time averaged horizontal velocities u over 20t of the spilling breakers at different locations the rows represent the results from different turbulence models a no turbulence model b k ω sst c bm k ω sst d fs k ω sst the columns represent different horizontal sampling positions x 5 945m x 6 665m x 7 275m x 7 885m x 8 495m x 9 110m and x 9 725m the first location is prior to the experimental breaking point and the other locations are after the experimental breaking point in each figure the horizontal axis represents the values of time averaged horizontal velocities and the vertical axis represents the vertical coordinates in the wave tank see fig 2 for more information the red dots represent the experimentally measured data and the solid lines represent the present numerical results the e is the rmse of the numerical results of u along water depth with respect to the experimental data in general the basic variation trends of u can be captured at all the sampling locations i e the values of u are negative from just above the bottom of the wave tank to the vicinity of the free surface and u becomes positive near the free surface according to the e values at different locations the results from the k ω sst model agree best with the experimental data surprisingly even though the wave does not break with the k ω sst model the e values of u without a turbulence model are the largest at all the sampling positions and is therefore not recommended for the spilling breaker simulations the no tm the bm k ω sst and the fs k ω sst models have the tendency to overestimate the u in the vicinity of the free surface due to the less wave damping laminar viscosity around the free surface than the k ω sst model therefore less energy around the free surface is dissipated and diffused with these three models than with the k ω sst model and more energy is transferred to the kinetic energy in the form of u for the bm k ω sst and the fs k ω models a better prediction of u is seen before breaking and e is larger in the surf zone and then reduces in the distant zone from the breaking position this can be explained by the strong three dimensional effects in the surf zone the velocity in the spanwise direction is small compared to the other two directions before breaking and far behind the surf zone while in the vicinity after breaking the velocity in the spanwise direction is comparable to the other two directions liu et al 2018a however the present two dimensional simulations cannot capture the spanwise velocities and result in larger velocities in the longitudinal section than in the measurements fig 15 shows the comparisons of simulated and measured phase averaged horizontal velocities over 20t of the spilling breakers at different vertical locations the good agreement can be observed between the horizontal velocity predicted by fs k ω sst turbulence model and the experimental data ting and kirby 1996 the k ω sst and bm k ω sst turbulence model show higher horizontal velocities at the given locations due to the predicted later breaking point or non breaking the notm cannot predict velocities or surface elevations shown in fig 12 well in the surf zone where the turbulence characteristics cannot be ignored fig 16 presents the comparisons of simulated and measured u over 20t of the plunging breakers at different locations the axes and nomenclature are the same with those of the spilling breakers the rows represent the results from different turbulence models a no turbulence model b k ω sst c bm k ω sst d fs k ω sst the columns represent different horizontal sampling positions x 7 295m x 7 795m x 8 345m x 8 795m x 9 295m x 9 795m and x 10 395m the first location is prior to the experimental breaking point the second one is at the breaking position and the other locations are after the experimental breaking point as seen previously the predictions of u before and at the experimental breaking position show a better agreement with the experimental data than the other locations due to the strong three dimensional effects in the surf zone the surf zone of the plunging breaker is larger than that of the spilling breaker due to the larger incident wavelength therefore the last sampling location is still inside or close to the surf zone where the e value is still large the u fields of the plunging breakers are also more uniform along the water depth compared to the spilling breakers due to the smaller water depth over wavelength the e values for the k ω sst model are smaller than that with the bm k ω sst model and without a turbulence model at most of the sampling positions however the sharp velocity change around the free surface is not captured by the k ω sst model and the breaking position is not predicted accurately the other three models have a similar performance for the u prediction before breaking however the e values of the bm k ω sst and the no tm models are larger than that of the fs k ω sst model at most of the locations after the breaking point 3 4 turbulence behaviour the turbulence behaviour underwater can be of great importance to the sediment transport of a movable seabed under free surface waves therefore the time averaged turbulent kinetic energy and the reynolds stress tensor of the spilling and the plunging breakers are discussed in this section fig 17 shows the time averaged turbulent kinetic energy k over 20t of the spilling breakers compared to the experimental data ting and kirby 1994 shown as red dots the rows represent k from different turbulence models a k ω sst b bm k ω sst c fs k ω sst the columns represent different horizontal sampling positions which are consistent with the sampling locations of u in each figure the horizontal axis represents the values of k and the vertical axis represents the vertical coordinates in the wave tank previous studies xie 2013 jacobsen et al 2014 brown et al 2016 devolder et al 2018 have shown that the rans models overpredict k in the water phase under the free surface the same tendency is also captured in the present simulations shown in fig 17 the k of the k ω sst model agrees best with the experimental data reported by ting and kirby 1994 however the wave breaking is not captured as compared to the experimental tests this means that the k of non breaking waves with the k ω sst model is comparable with k of breaking wave in these experiments the maximum k values from the bm k ω sst and the fs k ω sst models are more than twice of the maximum k values in the experiments devolder et al 2018 explained this overprediction by the fact that the traditional turbulence models are not designed for two phase flow in the authors opinion a more important reason is due to the two dimensional simulations which cannot solve the secondary flow interaction in the spanwise direction most of the rans turbulence models e g k ε k ω and k ω sst are isotropic eddy viscosity models this means that the spanwise information cannot be captured well even with three dimensional simulations unless the geometry has variations in the spanwise direction the better predictions of undersurface k from a les compared to a rans turbulence model can be seen in zhou et al 2017 their study showed that the overestimation of k when using a rans model was due to the lack of the three dimensional effects and the isotropic eddy viscosity assumption generally the k is lowest at the bottom boundary and increases gradually to the water surface due to the artificial laminar viscosity around the free surface of the bm k ω sst and the fs k ω sst models a smaller k value can be observed around the free surface than the surrounding positions the predictions of k from the bm k ω sst and the fs k ω sst models are similar when x 7 275 m the first three sampling locations after x 7 885 m the k from the bm k ω sst model increases rapidly until the last sampling position however in the same region the k from the fs k ω sst model increases gradually until x 9 110 m and then reduces slightly at x 9 725 m it can be conjectured that the g b term of the bm k ω sst model becomes zero after x 7 275 m then the turbulence model is switched to the original k ω sst model and a larger k is observed in this region than that of the fs k ω sst model in addition to the time averaged k the phase averaged k in the surf zone using different turbulence models are compared with the experimental data by ting and kirby 1996 as shown in fig 18 bm k ω sst and fs k ω sst turbulence models show good prediction in terms of the phase average turbulent kinetic energy at different water depth as compared to the experimental data ting and kirby 1996 the waves predicted by k ω sst turbulence model are non breaking and the numerical k value is therefore lower than that of the other turbulence models fig 19 depicts the contour of the predicted reynolds stress magnitude of the spilling breakers with different turbulence models the reynolds stresses play a crucial role in the equations for the u and indicate the turbulence intensity of the flow field columns represents different turbulence models a k ω sst b bm k ω sst c fs k ω sst and rows represent different time instants 1 t t 0 00 2 t t 0 15 3 t t 0 25 4 t t 0 75 the breaking onset is recorded as t t 0 00 and the other time instants are relative to the breaking onset due to the non breaking waves predicted by the k ω sst model the turbulence intensity from the k ω sst model is less than that from the other turbulence models generally a high turbulence intensity can be observed at the wave front and these high values continue to exist near the water surface which also corresponds to the k predictions in fig 17 the buoyancy term g b of the bm k ω sst model is supposed to be zero after x 7 275 m see the variations of k in fig 19 it can also be observed that there are high reynolds stresses in the vicinity of the water surface after x 7 275 m the turbulence intensity predicted by the bm k ω sst model is larger around the free surface than that predicted by the fs k ω sst model due to the switch to the original k ω sst model after x 7 275 m the comparisons of between the reynolds stresses at t t 0 25 and t t 0 75 for both the bm k ω sst and the fs k ω sst models demonstrate that the turbulence is generated at the wave crest and then spreads to the bottom boundary through the convection and diffusion terms which is also observed in the experiments conducted by ting and kirby 1994 fig 20 shows the comparison of k profiles over 20t of the plunging breakers against the experimental data ting and kirby 1994 denoted by red dots the axes and nomenclature are the same as the spilling breaker case in fig 17 the columns represent different sampling locations which are the same as fig 16 the experimental data shows that the variations of k of the plunging breakers are very minor along the water depth and only vary significantly at the wave front due to the small water depth to wavelength ratio this characteristic is only captured by the fs k ω sst model the k ω sst model overestimates the k values in the surf zone x 9 082 m considerably which suggests that a special turbulence model for two phase free surface flow is required the bm k ω sst model is supposed to trigger the g b term to be zero before x 8 795 m due to the sharp increase of k from x 8 345 m to x 8 795 m after x 8 795 m the k values predicted by the bm k ω sst model are much larger than the experimental data similar to the k ω sst model results the large over predictions on k for both the spilling and the plunging breakers in the surf zones using the bm k ω sst model suggest that it is necessary to limit the turbulence viscosity in the surf zone fig 21 describes the contour of the predicted reynolds stress magnitude for the plunging breakers with different turbulence models i e a k ω sst b bm k ω sst c fs k ω sst the rows represent different time instants 1 t t 0 00 2 t t 0 06 3 t t 0 16 4 t t 0 30 and t t 0 00 represents the breaking onset the turbulence intensity at the wave front from the k ω sst model is much higher than those from the bm k ω sst and the fs k ω sst models at the breaking onset at t t 0 06 the jet from the overturning wave front plunges into the free surface and traps an air pocket the fs k ω sst model forms a more typical and representative air pocket of the plunging breakers than the other turbulence models at this time the high turbulence intensity is still mainly concentrated at the wave crest according to the observations of ting and kirby 1994 it starts the violent transition to rotational flows from this point and the trapped air pocket fills the entire water column with air bubbles this experimental phenomenon is well captured especially by the bm k ω sst and the fs k ω sst models even though the small air bubbles are not included in the present study it is observed that from t t 0 06 to t t 0 16 the air pocket formed by the impinging jet travels quickly from the water surface to the bottom the turbulence intensity spreads from the wave crest to the bottom of the wave tank in this way and the vertical mixing is faster and stronger in the plunging breakers than in the spilling breakers the turbulence intensity decays rapidly from t t 0 16 to t t 0 30 after the wave front roller passes moreover the turbulent intensity of the plunging breakers is much smaller compared to the spilling breakers in the experiments ting and kirby 1994 the results from the fs k ω sst model reveal this characteristic see the comparison of figs 19c and 21c 4 conclusions the influences of the free surface jump conditions and different k ω sst turbulence models on breaking wave modelling are investigated using a two phase flow model in foam extend three different turbulence models are studied i e the original k ω sst model from menter 1994 the bm k ω sst model from devolder et al 2018 and the fs k ω sst model proposed in the present study similar investigations on breaking wave modelling can be found in brown et al 2016 and devolder et al 2018 however the previous studies all use the continuous free surface conditions which causes large spurious air velocities in the vicinity of the free surface the spurious air velocities then introduce a bias to the evaluation of the different turbulence models therefore it is necessary to identify the effects of free surface modelling approach for breaking wave prediction and then evaluate the different turbulence models in the present study both the influences from the free surface modelling approach and the turbulence models are taken into consideration in spilling and plunging breaker simulations the breaking point is firstly investigated with different free surface modelling approaches and different turbulence models then the free surface elevations and the time averaged velocity fields are studies with different turbulence models when using the free surface jump conditions finally the turbulent behaviour of different turbulence models is discussed in detail the following main conclusions can be drawn from this investigation i due to the disturbance from the spurious air velocity the continuous free surface conditions predict an earlier breaking than the jump conditions and experimental measurements the jump conditions can eliminate the spurious air velocity and give a better agreement with the experimental breaking point than the continuous conditions it has significant influence on both the modelling of spilling and plunging breakers in the present study for the present spilling breaker the difference of breaking positions between the continuous free surface conditions and the free surface jump conditions is 0 33m 8 6 λ and that for the plunging breaker is 0 75m 7 1 λ the free surface jump conditions are therefore recommended for the breaking wave modelling ii turbulence models have the tendency to postpone breaking position due to the larger dissipation and diffusion effects at the free surface when compared to using the no tm model the breaking point using the fs k ω sst model agrees well with the experimental breaking point for both the spilling and the plunging breakers the original k ω sst model has larger wave damping than the other models which results in a non breaking prediction for the spilling breaker and the late breaking position for the plunging breaker the influence of the turbulence models on the breaking point is smaller for the plunging than the spilling breaker in the present study this is due to the smaller kc of the plunging breaker when compared to the spilling breaker hence the turbulence effects are larger for the spilling breaker case than the plunging breaker case before breaking iii the turbulence model has a large influence on the surface elevation predictions for both the spilling and the plunging breaking waves the maximum surface elevations obtained by turbulence models are lower than that without turbulence model due to the transfer of potential energy to turbulent kinetic energy iv better predictions of u for the spilling and the plunging breaking waves are observed outside the surf zone rather than inside the surf zone when using different turbulence models the velocity in the spanwise direction is comparable to the other two directions in the surf zone which cannot be captured in the present two dimensional simulations v the predictions of k for the spilling and the plunging breaking waves are also better outside the surf zone rather than inside the surf zone all the turbulence models in the present study overestimate k for the spilling and the plunging breakers due to the lack of the three dimensional effects and the isotropic eddy viscosity assumption vi for the spilling breakers a high turbulence intensity is generated at the wave crest and then spreads to the bottom boundary through the convection and diffusion slowly for plunging breakers the high turbulence intensity is initially concentrated at the wave crest then the air pocket formed by the impinging jet travels quickly from the water surface to the bottom boundary both the fs k ω sst and the bm k ω sst models can capture these phenomena well however in terms of the realistic profile of the plunging air pocket and the values of k the fs k ω sst model predicts the turbulence behaviour of breaking waves best vii in summary the fs k ω sst and the bm k ω sst models have the similar basic concept i e set the viscosity as laminar viscosity in the vicinity of the free surface however the trigger conditions of g b in the bm k ω sst model are ambiguously connected to the breaking onset the inaccurate triggering position of g b causes extra errors another main difference between these two models is that the turbulence at free surface is still limited to laminar level in the surf zone for the fs k ω sst but not for the bm k ω sst it is important to note that the present fs k ω sst model only demonstrates the concept to limit the turbulence intensity in the surf zone due to the large overestimations of k from most rans models compared to the experimental data however quantitative research on the surf zone turbulence still requires substantial effort which will be the future work credit authorship contribution
