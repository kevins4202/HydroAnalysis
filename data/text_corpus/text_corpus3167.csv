15835,the effects of land use on riverine n2o emissions are not well understood especially in suburban zones between urban and rural with distinct anthropogenic perturbations here we investigated in situ riverine n2o emissions among suburban urban and rural sections of a typical agricultural urban gradient river the qinhuai river of southeastern china from june 2010 to september 2012 our results showed that suburban agriculture greatly increased riverine n concentration compared to traditional agricultural rivers tar the mean total dissolved nitrogen tdn concentration was 8 18 mg n l 1 in the suburban agricultural rivers suar which was almost the same as that in the urban rivers ur of 8 50 mg n l 1 compared to that in tar 0 92 mg n l 1 however the annual average indirect n2o flux from the suar was only 27 15 μg n2o n m 2 h 1 which was slightly higher than that from the tar 13 14 μg n2o n m 2 h 1 but much lower than that from the ur 131 10 μg n2o n m 2 h 1 moreover the average n2o emission factor ef5r n2o n din n in the suar 0 0002 was significantly lower than those in the tar 0 0028 and ur 0 0004 the limited indirect n2o fluxes from the suar are best explained by the high riverine dissolved organic carbon doc and low dissolved oxygen which probably reduced the denitrification source n2o by favoring complete denitrification to produce n2 and inhibited the nitrification source n2o respectively an exponential decrease model incorporating dissolved inorganic nitrogen and doc could greatly improve our ef5r predictions in the agricultural urban gradient river given the unprecedented suburban agriculture in the world more studies in suburban agricultural rivers are needed to further refine the ef5r and better reveal the mechanisms behind indirect n2o emissions as influenced by suburban agriculture graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords indirect n2o emission n2o emission factor suburban agriculture high doc low do 1 introduction the current concentration of atmospheric nitrous oxide n2o a potent greenhouse gas is 329 ppb in 2019 and continues to increase at 0 75 ppb per year as a result of anthropogenic perturbation of the natural nitrogen n cycle qin et al 2019 such high n2o concentrations substantially contribute to ecological damage including climate change and stratospheric ozone destruction convey and peck 2019 n2o emissions from various ecosystems have thus become one of the key issues in ecology and global climate change research hu et al 2020 yan et al 2012 agriculture is considered the largest contributor of n2o from both direct and indirect sources and accounts for approximately 60 of the total anthropogenic emissions kroeze et al 1999 syakila and kroeze 2011 although there are many studies concerning direct n2o emissions from fertilized soils and animal manure dobbie and smith 2003 toyoda et al 2011 indirect n2o emissions from groundwater streams and rivers in agricultural areas have received much less attention and remain a major source of uncertainty in the global anthropogenic n2o budget groffman et al 2009 sutton et al 2007 currently studies of indirect n2o emissions have focused on agricultural and urban rivers tian et al 2019 wang et al 2021 however previous studies have rarely focused on indirect n2o emissions from rivers in suburban agricultural regions suburban agriculture is a residual form of agriculture at the fringe areas of growing cities which typically include greenhouse vegetable production livestock breeding and aquaculture opitz et al 2016 with the increase in urbanization suburban agriculture currently plays an important role in providing goods and services for local to global markets olsson et al 2016 for example in nanjing china and hanoi vietnam it was estimated that 15 20 and 62 83 of vegetables and meat were produced on suburban agricultural soil respectively fang et al 2011 khai et al 2007 moreover suburban areas are rapidly expanding due to the population of cities around the world especially in developing countries the population living in cities surpassed 50 of the global population for the first time in 2008 grimm et al 2008 and it is estimated that this number will reach 70 by 2050 malano et al 2014 at that time the world urban population will reach 7 4 billion an increase of 2 3 billion compared with the current value malano et al 2014 such explosive urban population growth will definitely require greater levels of suburban agriculture suburban agricultural rivers suar have different nutrient characteristics than traditional agricultural rivers tar and urban rivers ur which may result in distinct n2o emission patterns in suar on the one hand suar has a much higher n loading than tar which probably results in hotspots of indirect n2o emissions for example in the shanghai urban river network the average n input through leaching and runoff in suburban areas 58 21 kg n ha 1 yr 1 was much greater than that in rural areas 30 65 kg n ha 1 yr 1 yu et al 2013 tang et al 2019 reported that more than 1000 kg n ha 1 yr 1 was applied to greenhouse vegetable soil in suar areas whereas 500 600 kg n ha 1 yr 1 was applied in the tar area in eastern china yan et al 2011 these high n loading probably increase indirect n2o emissions in suar because many previous studies assumed that n2o is linearly correlated with n concentration hu et al 2012 williams and crutzen 2010 yang et al 2020 on the other hand suar has much higher dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations than tar and ur because of intensive organic planting and livestock breeding which may reduce indirect n2o emissions for example the carbon input in freshwater aquaculture ponds in the taihu lake basin a typical suburban region in east china was more than 1 20 mg c ha 1 yr 1 yuan et al 2019 more than 7 5 mg c ha 1 yr 1 was applied in greenhouse vegetable soil in a suburban area of tianjin luan et al 2019 high doc concentration in the suar may decrease indirect river n2o emissions which probably reduces the denitrification source n2o by favoring complete denitrification to produce n2 quick et al 2019 furthermore high doc concentration may result in dissolved oxygen do depletion which would then reduce the nitrification source n2o emissions by inhibiting nitrification quick et al 2019 soued et al 2016 reported that aquatic systems with higher doc and lower do concentrations tended to be n2o sinks yuan et al 2021 and zhang et al 2021a reported a weak source of n2o and sometimes even a sink of n2o in summer in aquaculture ponds and streams with enriched doc but lower do concentrations because of the consumption of emitted n2o in anaerobic sediments although the stimulation or reduction of indirect n2o production was examined separately in tar and ur the patterns of indirect n2o emission in suar with both high n and doc loading remain poorly understood the qinhuai river is located in the lower reaches of the yangtze river jiangsu province southeastern china the qinhuai river region is a typical traditional agricultural suburban agricultural urban gradient region xia et al 2017 2016 in the tar of the qinhuai river basin paddy rice and wheat rotation are the most common watershed landscapes which together account for 55 to 82 of the total watershed area besides irrigated water bodies are densely distributed in the tar region such as reservoirs ponds and ditches in the suar most of the paddy fields are used for aquacultures such as rearing hairy crabs fish and lobster whereas the drylands are used for commercial poultry farming and greenhouse vegetable production the percentages of agricultural land in the suburban region range from 40 to 69 nanjing city and jurong city are also located in the qinhuai river basin in these urban areas rivers are usually supplemented by reclaimed water from wastewater treatment plants wwtps which may release large amounts of n therefore the qinhuai river is a typical traditional agricultural suburban agricultural urban gradient river and thus is suitable for investigating the indirect n2o emissions in suburban agricultural rivers we hypothesized that suar has distinctive indirect n2o emissions patterns compared to tar and ur because of high n and doc loading and that it is possible to refine the n2o emission factor ef5r in an agricultural urban gradient river especially in suar therefore the objectives of this study were to ⅰ investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of n2o emissions from suar compared to tar and ur ⅱ explore the potential factors influencing n2o emissions in suar and ⅲ better predict n2o emission factors in an agricultural urban gradient river 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region and sampling design the qinhuai river basin is located in the lower reaches of the yangtze river between 31 30 n and 32 10 n and 118 40 e and 119 20 e in jiangsu province southeastern china details on the watershed have been previously described xia et al 2017 2016 generally the qinhuai river basin is a relatively flat basin with stable hydrological conditions the river discharge depth discharge subcatchment area is mostly lower than 0 5 mm d 1 and occasionally greater than 1 mm d 1 in rainfall seasons this basin has a watershed area of 2631 km2 with most of the elevation no more than 50 m the width of the rivers varies from 30 to 60 m and the depth of the rivers ranges from 2 to 3 m the mean annual temperature and precipitation of this basin were 15 c and 1050 mm respectively xia et al 2016 fifteen sites located along the 80 9 km qinhuai river stretch were sampled in this study fig 1 of which ten well belong to tar suar and ur sites based on our previous studies specifically tar1 to tar5 belong to tar sites suar1 to suar3 belong to suar sites and ur1 and ur2 belong to ur sites fig 1 xia et al 2017 2016 in addition to the distinctive differences in land use components between them table s1 these 10 sites were distinguished based on nutrient dynamics bacterial groups chemical properties and the dual isotope values of nitrate xia et al 2017 2016 briefly tar exported most of the nutrient loads at high river flows 1 mm d 1 suar exported most of the nutrient loads at moderate river flows between 0 5 and 1 mm d 1 and the ur reference area exported most of the nutrient loads under low to moderate river flows xia et al 2016 moreover we validated the three land use categories by bacterial groups and chemical properties the dual isotope features of nitrate and the bayesian isotopic model xia et al 2017 except for the 10 typical tar suar and ur sampling sites the other 5 sampling sites were defined as mixture sites mr1 to mr5 according to their mixture of tar suar and ur upstream specifically mr1 and mr2 were mixtures of tar and ur mr3 and mr4 were mixtures of tar and suar while mr5 was a mixture of tar suar and ur fig 1 in these 15 sampling sites dissolved n2o concentration as well as potential factors influencing n2o emission were measured at monthly intervals from june 2010 to september 2012 to better establish the patterns of n2o emissions from different land use categories 3 most representative sites for tar suar and ur tar3 suar1 and ur1 respectively as well as the 5 mixture sites were picked out for the chamber measurement of n2o fluxes monthly from january 2011 to june 2012 these selected 8 sites were all accessible by road for the convenience of sampling 2 2 sample collection and analysis the dissolved n2o concentrations were measured using the headspace equilibrium technique xia et al 2013 the n2o fluxes were measured based on the floating chamber method clough et al 2006 in each sampling site 3 sub sampling sites were distributed evenly in the region with 4 replicate chambers floating for 15 min along the river surface which can well represent n2o fluxes from a segment river details can be found in the supporting information text s1 text s2 and fig s1 water samples were collected in a polyethylene barrel at a depth of approximately 0 3 m from the surface water at the center of the river the samples were then taken to the laboratory and analyzed as soon as possible for tdn nh4 n no3 n and doc measurements in the laboratory a 30 ml water sample was filtered through sterile 0 45 μm glass fiber filters for the tdn nh4 n no3 n and doc analyses the tdn nh4 n and no3 n concentrations were determined using an astoria flow analyzer which has a relative error of 2 and a lower detection limit of 0 03 mg n l 1 doc was analyzed using a toc analyzer liquitoc ii in situ physicochemical indicators such as water temperature hach hq 11d usa do hach ldo 101 usa ph hach hq 11d usa and redox potential hach mtc 101 usa were measured by a hand held field meter 2 3 statistical analysis data normality was examined using the kolmogorov smirnov test and natural log transformation was used if necessary two way analysis of variance anova was used to test the effect of sampling time and land use on n2o emissions and riverine physicochemical characteristics a least significant difference lsd post hoc test was conducted after obtaining the significant anova results differences in parameters with values of p 0 05 were considered statistically significant the pearson correlation was calculated to preliminarily determine the level of correlation between riverine physicochemical parameters and n2o fluxes and n2o emission factors both univariate and multivariate regression models were used to further explore the critical factors controlling river n2o fluxes and n2o emission factors the adjusted r squared and p values were used to evaluate the explanatory power of the variable the variance inflation factor vif was used to diagnose the collinearity of intervariable before multivariate regression all of these statistical tests were performed with spss 24 0 and sigmaplot 14 0 was used to draw the figures 3 results 3 1 riverine physicochemical characteristics the overall riverine physicochemical characteristics with different watershed landscapes from february 2011 to june 2012 are presented in table 1 different watershed landscapes led to different riverine n concentrations fig 2 the mean concentration of tdn in tar was 0 92 mg n l 1 which was the lowest among all rivers the tdn concentrations in suar and ur were the highest among all rivers which had mean concentrations of 8 18 and 8 50 mg n l 1 respectively the mixed rivers tar suar tar suar ur and tar ur had moderate mean tdn concentrations which were significantly higher than those in the tar but significantly lower than those in the suar and ur p 0 05 in addition the dominant forms of n were also different among different land use rivers the dominant n forms in tar and suar were no3 n and nh4 n respectively while the concentrations of no3 n and nh4 n were approximately equivalent in ur and mr table 1 the river doc concentrations averaged 5 71 mg c l 1 and ranged from 2 61 to 13 10 mg c l 1 fig 3 a the suar and tar had the highest and lowest mean doc concentrations respectively while the ur had a moderate mean doc concentration table 1 the river do concentrations averaged 8 76 mg l 1 and ranged from 0 66 to 21 83 mg l 1 fig 3b the ur and suar had the highest and lowest mean do concentrations respectively while the tar had a moderate mean do concentration table 1 the redox potential eh value of the ur was significantly lower than those in the tar and suar p 0 05 the ph value and water temperature wt did not show any significant difference among all rivers p 0 05 3 2 patterns of riverine dissolved n2o concentrations and chambered n2o fluxes the dissolved n2o concentrations in 15 sampling sites from june 2010 to september 2012 are shown in fig 4 the mean n2o concentration in ur ur1 and ur2 was significantly higher than those in tar tar1 to tar5 and suar suar1 to suar3 p 0 05 however no significant difference was observed in mean n2o concentration between tar and suar p 0 05 the mean n2o concentrations in ur suar tar and mr were 1 67 0 64 0 54 and 0 88 μg n2o n l 1 with standard errors of 0 59 0 09 0 13 and 0 24 μg n2o n l 1 respectively fig 4 in addition the dissolved n2o concentrations in all rivers did not show any significant difference among seasons p 0 05 table s2 fig 5 a shows that the chambered n2o fluxes of 8 sampling sites increased along the agricultural urban gradient from february 2011 to june 2012 which was consistent with the dissolved n2o concentrations the n2o fluxes from the tar were the lowest among all rivers with a mean flux of 13 14 μg n2o n m 2 h 1 ur were hot spots for n2o emissions with a mean flux of 131 10 μg n2o n m 2 h 1 the suar had a moderate mean flux 27 15 μg n2o n m 2 h 1 which was significantly higher than that from the tar but much lower than that from the ur p 0 05 in the mixed rivers tar suar mr3 and mr4 tar suar ur mr5 and tar ur mr1 and mr2 chambered mean n2o fluxes averaged at 27 06 34 08 and 69 45 μg n2o n m 2 h 1 respectively in addition riverine n2o fluxes also showed high seasonal variation in general high riverine n2o fluxes were observed in summer 78 29 μg n2o n m 2 h 1 and spring 50 11 μg n2o n m 2 h 1 while low riverine n2o fluxes were shown in autumn 33 21 μg n2o n m 2 h 1 and winter 27 16 μg n2o n m 2 h 1 table s2 and fig s2a the emission factors ef5r based on the dissolved n2o n din concentration ratio ranged from 0 0001 to 0 0084 with a mean ef5r of 0 0006 which was significantly lower than the current fixed ipcc ef5r of 0 0026 p 0 05 table 1 the ef5r in the tar was significantly higher than those in other rivers fig 5b p 0 05 which had a mean value of 0 0028 followed by the tar suar ur 0 0005 ur 0 0004 tar suar 0 0004 tar ur 0 0004 and suar 0 0002 table 1 in addition the ef5r in all rivers did not show any significant difference among seasons p 0 05 table s2 and fig s2b 3 3 influencing factors and regression models of n2o emissions correlation analyses revealed that the n2o fluxes from all rivers were significantly and positively correlated to the concentrations of tdn no3 n and wt p 0 05 but not correlated to nh4 n doc do ph and eh p 0 05 table 2 however when considering different river types separately doc and do played important and distinct roles in n2o fluxes between ur and suar the n2o fluxes were negatively correlated to doc concentrations in suar r 0 45 p 0 05 but positively correlated to doc concentrations in ur r 0 67 p 0 05 similarly the n2o fluxes were negatively correlated to do concentrations in ur r 0 38 p 0 05 while positively correlated to do concentrations in suar r 0 62 p 0 05 the ef5r in all rivers was significantly and negatively correlated with tdn concentrations as well as the concentrations of nh4 n and no3 n p 0 05 table 2 the exponential regression indicated that ef5r fit well with din concentrations using an exponential decrease equation r2 0 64 p 0 01 fig 6 1 y 0 008 e 2 245 d i n moreover compared with one predictor of din the explained variation in ef5r could be improved to 83 when both din and doc were used as model independent variables r2 0 83 p 0 01 vif 1 24 fig 7 2 y 0 014 e 6 795 d i n 0 001 e 0 106 d o c to avoid the extreme and dispersed values affect the model robustness regression analysis was performed again after removing ef5r greater than 0 0026 ipcc ef5r the results showed that the explanation of the ef5r variation improved from 35 to 42 when including doc in the multiple regression model fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 high n levels but low indirect n2o emissions in the suar our results showed that suburban agriculture greatly increased river n concentrations 8 18 mg n l 1 compared to traditional agriculture 0 92 mg n l 1 table 1 according to our previous studies the low n concentration in tar may be explained by the high n removal capacity in waterways of this rice paddy dominated watershed although 500 600 kg n ha 1 y 1 urea was applied li et al 2013 in this watershed rice paddies are usually found in the lower parts of the landscape which can intercept a large fraction of runoff n generated from the upper landscape yan et al 2011 moreover the discharged n would continue to be removed through deposition and denitrification to n2 by thousands of ponds three rivers and one reservoir with long retention times in the jurong watershed li et al 2013 the elevated n level in suar may be related to intensive aquaculture livestock manure and vegetable farming which were characterized by high n input for example many studies have reported that livestock and aquaculture substantially contributed to high n concentrations than other land uses jones et al 2019 mwanake et al 2019 moreover only 25 11 36 of input nitrogen was converted to fish biomass with the remainder mostly excreted into adjacent water hu et al 2012 in addition most water bodies such as paddies and ponds have been converted for aquaculture use in suburban agricultural regions which resulted in the switch from n sink to n source this shift in the sink source not only leads to more n input but also lower n removal especially as these water bodies are near rivers with shorter water residence times therefore the reported din concentration in the suar of this study was even higher than that in some wastewater influenced urban rivers such as the beijing urban river network 3 86 mg n l 1 chaohu lake urban basin 5 61 mg n l 1 and spain guadalete urban river estuary 3 10 mg n l 1 burgos et al 2015 wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b thus suburban agriculture greatly increased riverine n concentration because of the high intensity farming and breeding operations interestingly we observed relatively low n2o emissions in the suar figs 4 and 5 the mean n2o flux in the suar was at the low end of the range previously reported in the literature 25 to 7440 μg n2o n m 2 h 1 hu et al 2016 similarly low dissolved n2o concentrations and fluxes were also observed in livestock rivers compared to that in traditional agriculture rivers in the mara river kenya mwanake et al 2019 when comparing the n2o emission factors ef5r ef5r in the suar was not only much lower than that of the ipcc ef5r of 0 0026 but also much lower than the global average ef5r of 0 0016 hu et al 2016 therefore our findings suggest that saur may contribute little to agricultural n2o emissions in this agricultural urban gradient river despite the high level of n in the suar 4 2 potential causes of low indirect n2o emissions in the suar the differences in riverine n2o emissions amongst different land use may be caused by physical factors e g gas transfer velocity and or biogeochemical processes e g nitrification and denitrification generally the gas transfer velocity mainly depends on hydrological and meteorological conditions such as water depth velocities and temperature clough et al 2007 the gas transfer velocities may differ significantly at temporal scale in the qinhuai river the qinhuai river basin is subject to a subtropical monsoon climate which shaped distinct seasonal patterns of hydrological and meteorological conditions for example the river discharge depth and water temperature ranged widely from 0 to 13 mm d 1 and 1 42 to 33 5 c among sample seasons respectively xia et al 2016 these broad physical factors may lead to different seasonal gas transfer velocities in our study the inconsistent patterns between seasonal dissolved n2o concentrations and chambered n2o fluxes may be attributed to different seasonal gas transfer velocities however it seems unlikely that gas transfer velocities differ significantly at spatial scale within this basin the qinhuai river basin is a relatively flat basin with most of the elevation no more than 50 m which shaped relatively stable hydrological conditions throughout the whole region for each sampling site the differences in river discharge depth and water temperature among sampling sites were mostly smaller than 0 4 mm d 1 and 1 c respectively meanwhile the width and depth of the rivers also narrowly varied from 30 to 60 m and 2 to 3 m respectively xia et al 2016 these stable hydrological and meteorological factors have little impact on gas transfer velocity on the spatial scale the spatial variations of riverine n2o fluxes among different land use in this basin are therefore more likely caused by biogeochemical processing rather than physical factors the possible biogeochemical reasons for the high n concentration but low indirect n2o emissions in the suar may be the high riverine doc and low do concentrations first the high doc concentration in the suar 7 59 mg c l 1 may decrease the denitrification source n2o by favoring the further reduction of n2o to n2 aquatic n2o can be emitted as a byproduct of denitrification in anoxic environments which sequentially reduces no3 to no2 no n2o and then n2 n2o n2o n2 is determined by the ratio of electron donors e g doc and electron acceptors e g no3 n quick et al 2019 the average ratio of doc to no3 n in the suar in this study 81 83 was much higher than the mean value for global rivers and streams 55 n 443 stanley et al 2016 when an electron donor doc is abundant and an electron acceptor no3 n is limited n2o is replaced by n2 as the end product of denitrification and accumulation because there are sufficient electron donors docs to reduce n2o to n2 the negative relationship between the n2o emission rate and doc concentration in the suar indicated that doc promoted the transformation of n2o to n2 by favoring complete denitrification table 2 this finding is also consistent with many previous studies from boreal aquatic soued et al 2016 to subtropical tropical borges et al 2015 mwanake et al 2019 teodoru et al 2015 which suggested that high doc and low do lead to complete denitrification and the consumption of n2o furthermore high doc concentration enhanced microbial metabolism and may then result in do depletion quick et al 2019 the low do concentration 5 70 mg l 1 in the suar may also decrease n2o production and emission first n2o n2o n2 may decrease under reducing and low do concentration conditions because n2o reductase is more sensitive than the other denitrifying enzymes to oxygen ciarlo et al 2007 second the n2o generating pathway from nitrification may also be inhibited by the low do concentration in the suar although the concentration of nh4 n in the suar reached 6 67 mg n l 1 n2o can be produced as an intermediate product of nitrification which sequentially oxidizes nh3 to nh2oh and then n2o oxygen is required for the ammonia monooxygenase enzyme to oxidize nh3 to nh2oh poth and focht 1985 therefore the reduced condition is unfavorable for n2o production from hydroxylamine oxidation third the inhibited nitrification process resulting from a low do concentration cannot supply enough nitrate substrate for denitrification in anaerobic sediment which may thereby reduce denitrification source n2o zhu et al 2020 in our study the significantly positive correlation between river n2o emission rates and do concentrations in suar suggested that low do is not conducive to n2o production table 2 accordingly large amounts of ammonium accumulation in suar were observed compared to that in tar and ur fig 2c thus we suggested that the high doc concentration in the suar could also limit n2o emissions possibly by depleting do and inhibiting nitrification process 4 3 implications for the ipcc methodology and n2o budget estimate our results showed that the current fixed ipcc ef5r of 0 0026 is too high for the surface water of the qinhuai river especially for the suar the ef5r in the qinhuai river averaged 0 0006 which was significantly lower than the ipcc ef5r table 1 meanwhile applying one ef5r for all waters is inappropriate because the ef5r observed from rivers with different watershed landscapes varied greatly as shown in this study table 1 similarly high ef5r variations in different water bodies were also previously reported in published elsewhere which widely ranged from 0 00009 to 0 0326 beaulieu et al 2011 clough et al 2006 tian et al 2019 moreover fig 6 shows that the ef5r follows an exponential decrease trend with the increase of din concentrations which was consistent with a global meta analysis hu et al 2016 this negative relationship suggests that the low ef5r may result from the high din which decreases denitrification and nitrification efficiency with increasing n concentration due to progressive biological saturation bernot and dodds 2005 mulholland et al 2008 o brien et al 2007 further investigation should be performed to understand the indirect n2o emissions from agricultural urban gradient rivers to establish a reliable ef5r in the calculation of anthropogenic n2o budgets can doc be used as a predictive tool for indirect n2o emissions in agricultural urban gradient rivers high variability in n2o emissions and doc concentrations has been broadly observed in aquatic systems such as urban rivers agricultural rivers and aquaculture ponds hu et al 2016 stanley et al 2016 however the doc value has rarely been used to predict indirect river n2o emissions especially in agricultural urban gradient rivers hu et al 2016 suggested that riverine n2o emission estimates would be further enhanced sometimes including both doc and din variables but when doc should be included was unknown our study explicitly shows that moderate doc values promote indirect n2o emissions in ur while high doc values inhibit indirect n2o emissions in suar table 2 this finding is consistent with previous reports on different water bodies which suggested that moderate doc could promote indirect n2o production by enhancing microbial metabolism while high doc reduced the denitrification source n2o by favoring complete denitrification to produce n2 baulch et al 2011 quick et al 2019 soued et al 2016 in this study the explained variation in ef5r could be improved from 64 to 83 by using din and doc together as independent variables in the model compared with using only din to predict ef5r fig 7 therefore doc should be incorporated into the predictive model to explain the significant variability in indirect n2o emissions in rivers with agricultural urban gradients especially in suar intense inputs of carbon to suburban agriculture are prevalent around the world for example more than 1 20 mg c ha 1 yr 1 was used for freshwater aquaculture ponds in the taihu lake basin in china yuan et al 2019 similarly a high dose of c inputs mean 7 5 mg c ha 1 yr 1 was applied in greenhouse vegetable soil when chemical fertilizers were completely or partially replaced by pig manure or corn straw in a greenhouse farm in tianjin china luan et al 2019 globally the expansion rate of suburban agriculture will continue unabated for example global aquaculture production has increased by 500 since the late 1980s and will be projected to reach 230 mt by 2030 fao 2016 in china the total area covered by greenhouse vegetables increased from 2 5 million ha in 2005 to 4 67 million ha in 2018 fei et al 2018 li 2005 such an unprecedented rapid expansion of suburban agriculture will undoubtedly increase the doc concentration of adjacent water bodies we suggest that present and future indirect n2o budgets in suburban agricultural rivers should consider riverine doc variation 5 conclusion in summary our results indicate that suburban agriculture increased river n concentration but decreased indirect river n2o emissions the limited indirect n2o emissions in suburban agricultural rivers could have resulted from the high riverine dissolved organic carbon doc and low dissolved oxygen do which probably reduced the denitrification source n2o by favoring complete denitrification to produce n2 and inhibited the nitrification source n2o the current uniform ipcc ef5r 0 0026 appears too high for the qinhuai river mean 0 0006 especially in suar with the prevalent suar around the world and increasing availability of doc data we suggest including din and doc into estimate riverine n2o

15835,the effects of land use on riverine n2o emissions are not well understood especially in suburban zones between urban and rural with distinct anthropogenic perturbations here we investigated in situ riverine n2o emissions among suburban urban and rural sections of a typical agricultural urban gradient river the qinhuai river of southeastern china from june 2010 to september 2012 our results showed that suburban agriculture greatly increased riverine n concentration compared to traditional agricultural rivers tar the mean total dissolved nitrogen tdn concentration was 8 18 mg n l 1 in the suburban agricultural rivers suar which was almost the same as that in the urban rivers ur of 8 50 mg n l 1 compared to that in tar 0 92 mg n l 1 however the annual average indirect n2o flux from the suar was only 27 15 μg n2o n m 2 h 1 which was slightly higher than that from the tar 13 14 μg n2o n m 2 h 1 but much lower than that from the ur 131 10 μg n2o n m 2 h 1 moreover the average n2o emission factor ef5r n2o n din n in the suar 0 0002 was significantly lower than those in the tar 0 0028 and ur 0 0004 the limited indirect n2o fluxes from the suar are best explained by the high riverine dissolved organic carbon doc and low dissolved oxygen which probably reduced the denitrification source n2o by favoring complete denitrification to produce n2 and inhibited the nitrification source n2o respectively an exponential decrease model incorporating dissolved inorganic nitrogen and doc could greatly improve our ef5r predictions in the agricultural urban gradient river given the unprecedented suburban agriculture in the world more studies in suburban agricultural rivers are needed to further refine the ef5r and better reveal the mechanisms behind indirect n2o emissions as influenced by suburban agriculture graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords indirect n2o emission n2o emission factor suburban agriculture high doc low do 1 introduction the current concentration of atmospheric nitrous oxide n2o a potent greenhouse gas is 329 ppb in 2019 and continues to increase at 0 75 ppb per year as a result of anthropogenic perturbation of the natural nitrogen n cycle qin et al 2019 such high n2o concentrations substantially contribute to ecological damage including climate change and stratospheric ozone destruction convey and peck 2019 n2o emissions from various ecosystems have thus become one of the key issues in ecology and global climate change research hu et al 2020 yan et al 2012 agriculture is considered the largest contributor of n2o from both direct and indirect sources and accounts for approximately 60 of the total anthropogenic emissions kroeze et al 1999 syakila and kroeze 2011 although there are many studies concerning direct n2o emissions from fertilized soils and animal manure dobbie and smith 2003 toyoda et al 2011 indirect n2o emissions from groundwater streams and rivers in agricultural areas have received much less attention and remain a major source of uncertainty in the global anthropogenic n2o budget groffman et al 2009 sutton et al 2007 currently studies of indirect n2o emissions have focused on agricultural and urban rivers tian et al 2019 wang et al 2021 however previous studies have rarely focused on indirect n2o emissions from rivers in suburban agricultural regions suburban agriculture is a residual form of agriculture at the fringe areas of growing cities which typically include greenhouse vegetable production livestock breeding and aquaculture opitz et al 2016 with the increase in urbanization suburban agriculture currently plays an important role in providing goods and services for local to global markets olsson et al 2016 for example in nanjing china and hanoi vietnam it was estimated that 15 20 and 62 83 of vegetables and meat were produced on suburban agricultural soil respectively fang et al 2011 khai et al 2007 moreover suburban areas are rapidly expanding due to the population of cities around the world especially in developing countries the population living in cities surpassed 50 of the global population for the first time in 2008 grimm et al 2008 and it is estimated that this number will reach 70 by 2050 malano et al 2014 at that time the world urban population will reach 7 4 billion an increase of 2 3 billion compared with the current value malano et al 2014 such explosive urban population growth will definitely require greater levels of suburban agriculture suburban agricultural rivers suar have different nutrient characteristics than traditional agricultural rivers tar and urban rivers ur which may result in distinct n2o emission patterns in suar on the one hand suar has a much higher n loading than tar which probably results in hotspots of indirect n2o emissions for example in the shanghai urban river network the average n input through leaching and runoff in suburban areas 58 21 kg n ha 1 yr 1 was much greater than that in rural areas 30 65 kg n ha 1 yr 1 yu et al 2013 tang et al 2019 reported that more than 1000 kg n ha 1 yr 1 was applied to greenhouse vegetable soil in suar areas whereas 500 600 kg n ha 1 yr 1 was applied in the tar area in eastern china yan et al 2011 these high n loading probably increase indirect n2o emissions in suar because many previous studies assumed that n2o is linearly correlated with n concentration hu et al 2012 williams and crutzen 2010 yang et al 2020 on the other hand suar has much higher dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations than tar and ur because of intensive organic planting and livestock breeding which may reduce indirect n2o emissions for example the carbon input in freshwater aquaculture ponds in the taihu lake basin a typical suburban region in east china was more than 1 20 mg c ha 1 yr 1 yuan et al 2019 more than 7 5 mg c ha 1 yr 1 was applied in greenhouse vegetable soil in a suburban area of tianjin luan et al 2019 high doc concentration in the suar may decrease indirect river n2o emissions which probably reduces the denitrification source n2o by favoring complete denitrification to produce n2 quick et al 2019 furthermore high doc concentration may result in dissolved oxygen do depletion which would then reduce the nitrification source n2o emissions by inhibiting nitrification quick et al 2019 soued et al 2016 reported that aquatic systems with higher doc and lower do concentrations tended to be n2o sinks yuan et al 2021 and zhang et al 2021a reported a weak source of n2o and sometimes even a sink of n2o in summer in aquaculture ponds and streams with enriched doc but lower do concentrations because of the consumption of emitted n2o in anaerobic sediments although the stimulation or reduction of indirect n2o production was examined separately in tar and ur the patterns of indirect n2o emission in suar with both high n and doc loading remain poorly understood the qinhuai river is located in the lower reaches of the yangtze river jiangsu province southeastern china the qinhuai river region is a typical traditional agricultural suburban agricultural urban gradient region xia et al 2017 2016 in the tar of the qinhuai river basin paddy rice and wheat rotation are the most common watershed landscapes which together account for 55 to 82 of the total watershed area besides irrigated water bodies are densely distributed in the tar region such as reservoirs ponds and ditches in the suar most of the paddy fields are used for aquacultures such as rearing hairy crabs fish and lobster whereas the drylands are used for commercial poultry farming and greenhouse vegetable production the percentages of agricultural land in the suburban region range from 40 to 69 nanjing city and jurong city are also located in the qinhuai river basin in these urban areas rivers are usually supplemented by reclaimed water from wastewater treatment plants wwtps which may release large amounts of n therefore the qinhuai river is a typical traditional agricultural suburban agricultural urban gradient river and thus is suitable for investigating the indirect n2o emissions in suburban agricultural rivers we hypothesized that suar has distinctive indirect n2o emissions patterns compared to tar and ur because of high n and doc loading and that it is possible to refine the n2o emission factor ef5r in an agricultural urban gradient river especially in suar therefore the objectives of this study were to ⅰ investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of n2o emissions from suar compared to tar and ur ⅱ explore the potential factors influencing n2o emissions in suar and ⅲ better predict n2o emission factors in an agricultural urban gradient river 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region and sampling design the qinhuai river basin is located in the lower reaches of the yangtze river between 31 30 n and 32 10 n and 118 40 e and 119 20 e in jiangsu province southeastern china details on the watershed have been previously described xia et al 2017 2016 generally the qinhuai river basin is a relatively flat basin with stable hydrological conditions the river discharge depth discharge subcatchment area is mostly lower than 0 5 mm d 1 and occasionally greater than 1 mm d 1 in rainfall seasons this basin has a watershed area of 2631 km2 with most of the elevation no more than 50 m the width of the rivers varies from 30 to 60 m and the depth of the rivers ranges from 2 to 3 m the mean annual temperature and precipitation of this basin were 15 c and 1050 mm respectively xia et al 2016 fifteen sites located along the 80 9 km qinhuai river stretch were sampled in this study fig 1 of which ten well belong to tar suar and ur sites based on our previous studies specifically tar1 to tar5 belong to tar sites suar1 to suar3 belong to suar sites and ur1 and ur2 belong to ur sites fig 1 xia et al 2017 2016 in addition to the distinctive differences in land use components between them table s1 these 10 sites were distinguished based on nutrient dynamics bacterial groups chemical properties and the dual isotope values of nitrate xia et al 2017 2016 briefly tar exported most of the nutrient loads at high river flows 1 mm d 1 suar exported most of the nutrient loads at moderate river flows between 0 5 and 1 mm d 1 and the ur reference area exported most of the nutrient loads under low to moderate river flows xia et al 2016 moreover we validated the three land use categories by bacterial groups and chemical properties the dual isotope features of nitrate and the bayesian isotopic model xia et al 2017 except for the 10 typical tar suar and ur sampling sites the other 5 sampling sites were defined as mixture sites mr1 to mr5 according to their mixture of tar suar and ur upstream specifically mr1 and mr2 were mixtures of tar and ur mr3 and mr4 were mixtures of tar and suar while mr5 was a mixture of tar suar and ur fig 1 in these 15 sampling sites dissolved n2o concentration as well as potential factors influencing n2o emission were measured at monthly intervals from june 2010 to september 2012 to better establish the patterns of n2o emissions from different land use categories 3 most representative sites for tar suar and ur tar3 suar1 and ur1 respectively as well as the 5 mixture sites were picked out for the chamber measurement of n2o fluxes monthly from january 2011 to june 2012 these selected 8 sites were all accessible by road for the convenience of sampling 2 2 sample collection and analysis the dissolved n2o concentrations were measured using the headspace equilibrium technique xia et al 2013 the n2o fluxes were measured based on the floating chamber method clough et al 2006 in each sampling site 3 sub sampling sites were distributed evenly in the region with 4 replicate chambers floating for 15 min along the river surface which can well represent n2o fluxes from a segment river details can be found in the supporting information text s1 text s2 and fig s1 water samples were collected in a polyethylene barrel at a depth of approximately 0 3 m from the surface water at the center of the river the samples were then taken to the laboratory and analyzed as soon as possible for tdn nh4 n no3 n and doc measurements in the laboratory a 30 ml water sample was filtered through sterile 0 45 μm glass fiber filters for the tdn nh4 n no3 n and doc analyses the tdn nh4 n and no3 n concentrations were determined using an astoria flow analyzer which has a relative error of 2 and a lower detection limit of 0 03 mg n l 1 doc was analyzed using a toc analyzer liquitoc ii in situ physicochemical indicators such as water temperature hach hq 11d usa do hach ldo 101 usa ph hach hq 11d usa and redox potential hach mtc 101 usa were measured by a hand held field meter 2 3 statistical analysis data normality was examined using the kolmogorov smirnov test and natural log transformation was used if necessary two way analysis of variance anova was used to test the effect of sampling time and land use on n2o emissions and riverine physicochemical characteristics a least significant difference lsd post hoc test was conducted after obtaining the significant anova results differences in parameters with values of p 0 05 were considered statistically significant the pearson correlation was calculated to preliminarily determine the level of correlation between riverine physicochemical parameters and n2o fluxes and n2o emission factors both univariate and multivariate regression models were used to further explore the critical factors controlling river n2o fluxes and n2o emission factors the adjusted r squared and p values were used to evaluate the explanatory power of the variable the variance inflation factor vif was used to diagnose the collinearity of intervariable before multivariate regression all of these statistical tests were performed with spss 24 0 and sigmaplot 14 0 was used to draw the figures 3 results 3 1 riverine physicochemical characteristics the overall riverine physicochemical characteristics with different watershed landscapes from february 2011 to june 2012 are presented in table 1 different watershed landscapes led to different riverine n concentrations fig 2 the mean concentration of tdn in tar was 0 92 mg n l 1 which was the lowest among all rivers the tdn concentrations in suar and ur were the highest among all rivers which had mean concentrations of 8 18 and 8 50 mg n l 1 respectively the mixed rivers tar suar tar suar ur and tar ur had moderate mean tdn concentrations which were significantly higher than those in the tar but significantly lower than those in the suar and ur p 0 05 in addition the dominant forms of n were also different among different land use rivers the dominant n forms in tar and suar were no3 n and nh4 n respectively while the concentrations of no3 n and nh4 n were approximately equivalent in ur and mr table 1 the river doc concentrations averaged 5 71 mg c l 1 and ranged from 2 61 to 13 10 mg c l 1 fig 3 a the suar and tar had the highest and lowest mean doc concentrations respectively while the ur had a moderate mean doc concentration table 1 the river do concentrations averaged 8 76 mg l 1 and ranged from 0 66 to 21 83 mg l 1 fig 3b the ur and suar had the highest and lowest mean do concentrations respectively while the tar had a moderate mean do concentration table 1 the redox potential eh value of the ur was significantly lower than those in the tar and suar p 0 05 the ph value and water temperature wt did not show any significant difference among all rivers p 0 05 3 2 patterns of riverine dissolved n2o concentrations and chambered n2o fluxes the dissolved n2o concentrations in 15 sampling sites from june 2010 to september 2012 are shown in fig 4 the mean n2o concentration in ur ur1 and ur2 was significantly higher than those in tar tar1 to tar5 and suar suar1 to suar3 p 0 05 however no significant difference was observed in mean n2o concentration between tar and suar p 0 05 the mean n2o concentrations in ur suar tar and mr were 1 67 0 64 0 54 and 0 88 μg n2o n l 1 with standard errors of 0 59 0 09 0 13 and 0 24 μg n2o n l 1 respectively fig 4 in addition the dissolved n2o concentrations in all rivers did not show any significant difference among seasons p 0 05 table s2 fig 5 a shows that the chambered n2o fluxes of 8 sampling sites increased along the agricultural urban gradient from february 2011 to june 2012 which was consistent with the dissolved n2o concentrations the n2o fluxes from the tar were the lowest among all rivers with a mean flux of 13 14 μg n2o n m 2 h 1 ur were hot spots for n2o emissions with a mean flux of 131 10 μg n2o n m 2 h 1 the suar had a moderate mean flux 27 15 μg n2o n m 2 h 1 which was significantly higher than that from the tar but much lower than that from the ur p 0 05 in the mixed rivers tar suar mr3 and mr4 tar suar ur mr5 and tar ur mr1 and mr2 chambered mean n2o fluxes averaged at 27 06 34 08 and 69 45 μg n2o n m 2 h 1 respectively in addition riverine n2o fluxes also showed high seasonal variation in general high riverine n2o fluxes were observed in summer 78 29 μg n2o n m 2 h 1 and spring 50 11 μg n2o n m 2 h 1 while low riverine n2o fluxes were shown in autumn 33 21 μg n2o n m 2 h 1 and winter 27 16 μg n2o n m 2 h 1 table s2 and fig s2a the emission factors ef5r based on the dissolved n2o n din concentration ratio ranged from 0 0001 to 0 0084 with a mean ef5r of 0 0006 which was significantly lower than the current fixed ipcc ef5r of 0 0026 p 0 05 table 1 the ef5r in the tar was significantly higher than those in other rivers fig 5b p 0 05 which had a mean value of 0 0028 followed by the tar suar ur 0 0005 ur 0 0004 tar suar 0 0004 tar ur 0 0004 and suar 0 0002 table 1 in addition the ef5r in all rivers did not show any significant difference among seasons p 0 05 table s2 and fig s2b 3 3 influencing factors and regression models of n2o emissions correlation analyses revealed that the n2o fluxes from all rivers were significantly and positively correlated to the concentrations of tdn no3 n and wt p 0 05 but not correlated to nh4 n doc do ph and eh p 0 05 table 2 however when considering different river types separately doc and do played important and distinct roles in n2o fluxes between ur and suar the n2o fluxes were negatively correlated to doc concentrations in suar r 0 45 p 0 05 but positively correlated to doc concentrations in ur r 0 67 p 0 05 similarly the n2o fluxes were negatively correlated to do concentrations in ur r 0 38 p 0 05 while positively correlated to do concentrations in suar r 0 62 p 0 05 the ef5r in all rivers was significantly and negatively correlated with tdn concentrations as well as the concentrations of nh4 n and no3 n p 0 05 table 2 the exponential regression indicated that ef5r fit well with din concentrations using an exponential decrease equation r2 0 64 p 0 01 fig 6 1 y 0 008 e 2 245 d i n moreover compared with one predictor of din the explained variation in ef5r could be improved to 83 when both din and doc were used as model independent variables r2 0 83 p 0 01 vif 1 24 fig 7 2 y 0 014 e 6 795 d i n 0 001 e 0 106 d o c to avoid the extreme and dispersed values affect the model robustness regression analysis was performed again after removing ef5r greater than 0 0026 ipcc ef5r the results showed that the explanation of the ef5r variation improved from 35 to 42 when including doc in the multiple regression model fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 high n levels but low indirect n2o emissions in the suar our results showed that suburban agriculture greatly increased river n concentrations 8 18 mg n l 1 compared to traditional agriculture 0 92 mg n l 1 table 1 according to our previous studies the low n concentration in tar may be explained by the high n removal capacity in waterways of this rice paddy dominated watershed although 500 600 kg n ha 1 y 1 urea was applied li et al 2013 in this watershed rice paddies are usually found in the lower parts of the landscape which can intercept a large fraction of runoff n generated from the upper landscape yan et al 2011 moreover the discharged n would continue to be removed through deposition and denitrification to n2 by thousands of ponds three rivers and one reservoir with long retention times in the jurong watershed li et al 2013 the elevated n level in suar may be related to intensive aquaculture livestock manure and vegetable farming which were characterized by high n input for example many studies have reported that livestock and aquaculture substantially contributed to high n concentrations than other land uses jones et al 2019 mwanake et al 2019 moreover only 25 11 36 of input nitrogen was converted to fish biomass with the remainder mostly excreted into adjacent water hu et al 2012 in addition most water bodies such as paddies and ponds have been converted for aquaculture use in suburban agricultural regions which resulted in the switch from n sink to n source this shift in the sink source not only leads to more n input but also lower n removal especially as these water bodies are near rivers with shorter water residence times therefore the reported din concentration in the suar of this study was even higher than that in some wastewater influenced urban rivers such as the beijing urban river network 3 86 mg n l 1 chaohu lake urban basin 5 61 mg n l 1 and spain guadalete urban river estuary 3 10 mg n l 1 burgos et al 2015 wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b thus suburban agriculture greatly increased riverine n concentration because of the high intensity farming and breeding operations interestingly we observed relatively low n2o emissions in the suar figs 4 and 5 the mean n2o flux in the suar was at the low end of the range previously reported in the literature 25 to 7440 μg n2o n m 2 h 1 hu et al 2016 similarly low dissolved n2o concentrations and fluxes were also observed in livestock rivers compared to that in traditional agriculture rivers in the mara river kenya mwanake et al 2019 when comparing the n2o emission factors ef5r ef5r in the suar was not only much lower than that of the ipcc ef5r of 0 0026 but also much lower than the global average ef5r of 0 0016 hu et al 2016 therefore our findings suggest that saur may contribute little to agricultural n2o emissions in this agricultural urban gradient river despite the high level of n in the suar 4 2 potential causes of low indirect n2o emissions in the suar the differences in riverine n2o emissions amongst different land use may be caused by physical factors e g gas transfer velocity and or biogeochemical processes e g nitrification and denitrification generally the gas transfer velocity mainly depends on hydrological and meteorological conditions such as water depth velocities and temperature clough et al 2007 the gas transfer velocities may differ significantly at temporal scale in the qinhuai river the qinhuai river basin is subject to a subtropical monsoon climate which shaped distinct seasonal patterns of hydrological and meteorological conditions for example the river discharge depth and water temperature ranged widely from 0 to 13 mm d 1 and 1 42 to 33 5 c among sample seasons respectively xia et al 2016 these broad physical factors may lead to different seasonal gas transfer velocities in our study the inconsistent patterns between seasonal dissolved n2o concentrations and chambered n2o fluxes may be attributed to different seasonal gas transfer velocities however it seems unlikely that gas transfer velocities differ significantly at spatial scale within this basin the qinhuai river basin is a relatively flat basin with most of the elevation no more than 50 m which shaped relatively stable hydrological conditions throughout the whole region for each sampling site the differences in river discharge depth and water temperature among sampling sites were mostly smaller than 0 4 mm d 1 and 1 c respectively meanwhile the width and depth of the rivers also narrowly varied from 30 to 60 m and 2 to 3 m respectively xia et al 2016 these stable hydrological and meteorological factors have little impact on gas transfer velocity on the spatial scale the spatial variations of riverine n2o fluxes among different land use in this basin are therefore more likely caused by biogeochemical processing rather than physical factors the possible biogeochemical reasons for the high n concentration but low indirect n2o emissions in the suar may be the high riverine doc and low do concentrations first the high doc concentration in the suar 7 59 mg c l 1 may decrease the denitrification source n2o by favoring the further reduction of n2o to n2 aquatic n2o can be emitted as a byproduct of denitrification in anoxic environments which sequentially reduces no3 to no2 no n2o and then n2 n2o n2o n2 is determined by the ratio of electron donors e g doc and electron acceptors e g no3 n quick et al 2019 the average ratio of doc to no3 n in the suar in this study 81 83 was much higher than the mean value for global rivers and streams 55 n 443 stanley et al 2016 when an electron donor doc is abundant and an electron acceptor no3 n is limited n2o is replaced by n2 as the end product of denitrification and accumulation because there are sufficient electron donors docs to reduce n2o to n2 the negative relationship between the n2o emission rate and doc concentration in the suar indicated that doc promoted the transformation of n2o to n2 by favoring complete denitrification table 2 this finding is also consistent with many previous studies from boreal aquatic soued et al 2016 to subtropical tropical borges et al 2015 mwanake et al 2019 teodoru et al 2015 which suggested that high doc and low do lead to complete denitrification and the consumption of n2o furthermore high doc concentration enhanced microbial metabolism and may then result in do depletion quick et al 2019 the low do concentration 5 70 mg l 1 in the suar may also decrease n2o production and emission first n2o n2o n2 may decrease under reducing and low do concentration conditions because n2o reductase is more sensitive than the other denitrifying enzymes to oxygen ciarlo et al 2007 second the n2o generating pathway from nitrification may also be inhibited by the low do concentration in the suar although the concentration of nh4 n in the suar reached 6 67 mg n l 1 n2o can be produced as an intermediate product of nitrification which sequentially oxidizes nh3 to nh2oh and then n2o oxygen is required for the ammonia monooxygenase enzyme to oxidize nh3 to nh2oh poth and focht 1985 therefore the reduced condition is unfavorable for n2o production from hydroxylamine oxidation third the inhibited nitrification process resulting from a low do concentration cannot supply enough nitrate substrate for denitrification in anaerobic sediment which may thereby reduce denitrification source n2o zhu et al 2020 in our study the significantly positive correlation between river n2o emission rates and do concentrations in suar suggested that low do is not conducive to n2o production table 2 accordingly large amounts of ammonium accumulation in suar were observed compared to that in tar and ur fig 2c thus we suggested that the high doc concentration in the suar could also limit n2o emissions possibly by depleting do and inhibiting nitrification process 4 3 implications for the ipcc methodology and n2o budget estimate our results showed that the current fixed ipcc ef5r of 0 0026 is too high for the surface water of the qinhuai river especially for the suar the ef5r in the qinhuai river averaged 0 0006 which was significantly lower than the ipcc ef5r table 1 meanwhile applying one ef5r for all waters is inappropriate because the ef5r observed from rivers with different watershed landscapes varied greatly as shown in this study table 1 similarly high ef5r variations in different water bodies were also previously reported in published elsewhere which widely ranged from 0 00009 to 0 0326 beaulieu et al 2011 clough et al 2006 tian et al 2019 moreover fig 6 shows that the ef5r follows an exponential decrease trend with the increase of din concentrations which was consistent with a global meta analysis hu et al 2016 this negative relationship suggests that the low ef5r may result from the high din which decreases denitrification and nitrification efficiency with increasing n concentration due to progressive biological saturation bernot and dodds 2005 mulholland et al 2008 o brien et al 2007 further investigation should be performed to understand the indirect n2o emissions from agricultural urban gradient rivers to establish a reliable ef5r in the calculation of anthropogenic n2o budgets can doc be used as a predictive tool for indirect n2o emissions in agricultural urban gradient rivers high variability in n2o emissions and doc concentrations has been broadly observed in aquatic systems such as urban rivers agricultural rivers and aquaculture ponds hu et al 2016 stanley et al 2016 however the doc value has rarely been used to predict indirect river n2o emissions especially in agricultural urban gradient rivers hu et al 2016 suggested that riverine n2o emission estimates would be further enhanced sometimes including both doc and din variables but when doc should be included was unknown our study explicitly shows that moderate doc values promote indirect n2o emissions in ur while high doc values inhibit indirect n2o emissions in suar table 2 this finding is consistent with previous reports on different water bodies which suggested that moderate doc could promote indirect n2o production by enhancing microbial metabolism while high doc reduced the denitrification source n2o by favoring complete denitrification to produce n2 baulch et al 2011 quick et al 2019 soued et al 2016 in this study the explained variation in ef5r could be improved from 64 to 83 by using din and doc together as independent variables in the model compared with using only din to predict ef5r fig 7 therefore doc should be incorporated into the predictive model to explain the significant variability in indirect n2o emissions in rivers with agricultural urban gradients especially in suar intense inputs of carbon to suburban agriculture are prevalent around the world for example more than 1 20 mg c ha 1 yr 1 was used for freshwater aquaculture ponds in the taihu lake basin in china yuan et al 2019 similarly a high dose of c inputs mean 7 5 mg c ha 1 yr 1 was applied in greenhouse vegetable soil when chemical fertilizers were completely or partially replaced by pig manure or corn straw in a greenhouse farm in tianjin china luan et al 2019 globally the expansion rate of suburban agriculture will continue unabated for example global aquaculture production has increased by 500 since the late 1980s and will be projected to reach 230 mt by 2030 fao 2016 in china the total area covered by greenhouse vegetables increased from 2 5 million ha in 2005 to 4 67 million ha in 2018 fei et al 2018 li 2005 such an unprecedented rapid expansion of suburban agriculture will undoubtedly increase the doc concentration of adjacent water bodies we suggest that present and future indirect n2o budgets in suburban agricultural rivers should consider riverine doc variation 5 conclusion in summary our results indicate that suburban agriculture increased river n concentration but decreased indirect river n2o emissions the limited indirect n2o emissions in suburban agricultural rivers could have resulted from the high riverine dissolved organic carbon doc and low dissolved oxygen do which probably reduced the denitrification source n2o by favoring complete denitrification to produce n2 and inhibited the nitrification source n2o the current uniform ipcc ef5r 0 0026 appears too high for the qinhuai river mean 0 0006 especially in suar with the prevalent suar around the world and increasing availability of doc data we suggest including din and doc into estimate riverine n2o

15836,estuarine mudflats are profoundly affected by increased coastal erosion and reduced sediment delivery from major rivers although managers are having difficulties to control the cause of increased coastal erosion they can help to manage the resilience of mudflat ecosystems to erosion through river flow regulation in this study we associated the resilience of a mudflat ecosystem to erosion with various magnitudes of river flow using a mechanism based eco morphodynamic model ecosystem resilience was reported in terms of i what range of erosion rate the system can withstand before function collapse persistence ii at which point function can be recovered recovery and iii the uncertainty of system response to disturbances response uncertainty specifically the function of intertidal mudflat was characterized by landscape heterogeneity primary productivity and sediment stabilization in a case study of the yellow river estuary yre of china it is found that increased erosion induced a collapse of the functioning state once collapsed the erosion rate at which mudflat could recovered was lower than the erosion rate at which mudflat collapsed increased river flow enhanced the resilience of the mudflat ecosystem to erosion by increasing sediment deposition rate which was an important attribute in the interaction process driving ecosystem resilience furthermore

microalgal growth sediment accumulation and water redistribution weerman et al 2010 benthic microalgae grow on the higher grounds and secrete colloidal carbohydrates which increase sediment cohesion and decrease surface erosion promoting sediment accumulation subsequently the elevated sediment supports microalgal growth this positive feedback between microalgal growth and sediment accumulation leading to the development of hummocks in turn water redistribute from the hummocks to the surrounding lower grounds after tide goes out inhibiting the buildup of colloidal carbohydrates thereby enabling erosion of microalgae and sediment in the lower grounds this negative feedback between sediment accumulation and water redistribution leading to the development of hollows fig 2 we predicted

sensitivity analysis see supplementary fig s2 2 2 study system the yellow river estuary yre is located in the west of the bohai sea fig 3 a as the second largest river in china water discharge and sediment load from the yellow river to the sea have contributed considerably to the accretion system of the yre milliman et al 1987 the median grain size of suspended sediment deposited on the estuary was around 20 30 μm wang et al 2010b these fine grained sediments together with deposited particulate organic matter constitute a valuable benthos habitat in the estuary the intertidal mudflat we studied is situated on the north side of the river mouth which is a sheltered area with negligible wave effects the suspended sediment concentration ssc in this area is affected primarily by the water and sediment discharge of the yellow river zhang et al 2014 our study area is characterized by a patterned landscape of microalgae covered hummocks alternating with water filled hollows fig 3 previous field observations in this area found higher chlorophyll a a proxy of microalgal biomass and colloidal carbohydrates contents in sediments from the hummocks than in sediments from the hollows zhang et al 2020 supporting the weerman s mechanism fig 2 as an explanation of the pattern formation in our study area self organization process in the studied mudflat is highly dynamic during spring to summer zhang et al 2021 a pattern develops in each spring fig 3b and became less obvious in summer fig 3c field experiment and theoretical model suggested that the seasonal variation is largely caused by increased herbivory of benthic animals the patterned mudflat provides a valuable habitat for benthic animals due to abundant food resources and spatially heterogenous environmental conditions as time progresses benthic animals eat microalgae and substantially modify the patterning process in summer hence the self organized pattern generated by the feedback between microalgae sediment and hydrodynamics accommodate and modified by benthic animals has important effects on the productivity sedimentation and energy flow in the estuarine mudflat system restoration of river flow and sediment load implemented by the yellow river conservancy committee yrcc has resulted in an incremental increase in the total area of yre since 2003 cui and li 2011 however the tidal flat on the north side of river mouth still presents different degrees of retreat due to net erosion kong et al 2015 release of floodwaters for restoration usually starts in late june which aims at maintaining the long term stability of the morphological characteristics of the yre but ignoring the ecological function of the mudflat 2 3 simulation process and scenarios we evaluated the effect of river flow on the resilience of the patterned mudflat ecosystem to erosion through changing the parameters erosion rate e and deposition rate s in in the eco morphodynamic model we first investigated the resilience of the patterned mudflat ecosystem to erosion by considering different e in the eco morphodynamic model the e varied from 0 0012 cm tide to 0 0032 cm tide based on bottom elevation changes in the yre from 1964 to 2010 zhang et al 2020 during this step the s in was constant sin 0 0022 cm tide then we explored how altered river flow affect the resilience of the patterned mudflat ecosystem to erosion to do this we first ran a sediment transport model details for the model has been described in previous work by zhang et al 2020 and the supplementary text s1 with a series of boundary conditions for steady river flow to predict the ssc in the mudflat under different flow discharges 11 steady flow discharges ranging from 50 m3 s to 1000 m3 s were determined based on the measured daily runoff at the lijin station the last hydrometric station before the river mouth from april to june of 2011 2012 and 2013 zhang et al 2020 after that the ssc values under different flow discharges were transformed to s in values through equation 5 lastly we assessed the effect of different s in on the resilience of the patterned mudflat ecosystem to erosion the resilience of the patterned mudflat ecosystem was represented by the persistence of system to increasing erosion the recovery of system under decreasing erosion and uncertainty of system response the river discharges that can satisfy high system persistence easy recovery and low uncertainty could be recommended as environmental flow the quantity timing and quality of water flows required to sustain freshwater and estuarine ecosystems and the human livelihoods and well being than depend on these ecosystems https www conservationgateway org files pages brisbane declaration aspx for the estuarine mudflat ecosystem during spring to summer 3 results 3 1 response of the patterned estuarine mudflat ecosystem to changing erosion the eco morphodynamic model revealed a range of erosion conditions where alternative stable states occurred and a threshold of erosion where the patterned estuarine mudflat ecosystem were particularly vulnerable to collapse fig 4 when the erosion rates e were below 0 0020 cm tide only a patterned mudflat with high microalgal density and strong sediment stabilization was observed at e between 0 0020 and 0 0023 cm tide the system exhibited two alternative stable states one a patterned mudflat the other a homogeneous mudflat with low microalgal density and severe sediment erosion when e dropped in this range the mudflat could be in either one of the alternative stable states depending on its history the dashed lines a slight perturbation might trigger the switch of state from one to the other response uncertainty when the erosion rate surpassed the threshold value 0 0023 cm tide a tipping point occurred above which only a homogeneous state was possible system persistence recovery only occurred when e decreased to lower levels 0 0020 cm tide at which the erosion condition was gentle enough to allow microalgae and sediment to re accumulate system recovery 3 2 effect of flow discharge on the resilience of the patterned estuarine mudflat ecosystem to erosion flow discharge was an important determinant of sediment deposition rate s in in the estuarine mudflat sediment deposition rate showed a positive relationship with flow discharge when flow discharge exceeded 400 m3 s fig s3 when s in was below 0 0017 cm tide corresponding flow discharge below 600 m3 s only a homogeneous mudflat was predicted after that changes in s in strongly affected the resilience of the patterned mudflat ecosystem to erosion in system persistence system recovery and response uncertainty fig 5 first a pattered mudflat could persist at higher e when s in increased second increased s in allowed for much easier recovery from a homogeneous state moreover the range of e where system exhibited uncertain responses increased as s in increased from 0 0017 to 0 0023 cm tide corresponding flow discharge 600 700 m3 s but decreased as s in increased from 0 0023 to 0 0032 cm tide corresponding flow discharge 700 800 m3 s afterwards the uncertain range did not change as s in increased 4 discussion using an eco morphodynamic model we examined how altered river flow affected the resilience of a patterned estuarine mudflat system with complex bio physical interactions our results suggested that functioning collapse happened in the patterned mudflat system as increasing erosion altered the system from being organized around microalgal growth sediment accumulation mutually enhancing processes to sediment erosion microalgal loss mutually accelerating process once collapsed the erosion rate at which mudflat could recovered was lower than the erosion rate at which mudflat collapsed river flow had a strong impact on the resilience of the patterned mudflat system to erosion which reflected in three aspects increased flow discharge allowed for enhanced system persistence easier recovery after disturbances and reduced response uncertainty the interference of grazing was a property that affected microalgal density at patch scale in contrast the interference of river flow was a property that affected sediment deposition at landscape scale thus at any given time the two stressors acted on different attributes depended on different mechanisms were coupled by cross scale interactions in space to define the resilience of the patterned mudflat system it is clear from fig 4 that as river flow increased from 600 m3 s to 700 m3 s the abilities of system persistence and recovery increased substantially however there was a trend of increase for the response uncertainty with the increase in river flow when the river flow reached 800 m3 s the response uncertainty decreased to the minimum afterward the increase of river flow resulted in enhanced resilience in all three dimensions system persistence system recovery and response uncertainty we thus recommended that river flow of 800 m3 s should be maintained during april to june for the resilience of the patterned mudflat to erosion in the yre it is important to highlight that we assumed a constant grazer density m which applied to a human controlled case mudflat aquacultures since any decline in population will be compensated by supplementary larvae and food in a natural setting grazer density would be affected by changes in microalgal density we then performed an analysis including natural grazer population dynamics it is obvious from fig 5 and fig 6 that resilience was considerably enhanced for the system with a dynamic grazer density compared to the system with a constant grazer density since at any given time drop in microalgal density would lead to the decrease in grazer density alleviating the grazing pressure this was consistent with a previous modeling study of dynamic grazing pressure in arid ecosystems van de koppel and rietkerk 2000 hence given the same river flow allocation the ecological benefit of the system with dynamic grazer population was much greater than the system with a constant grazer number under the river flow of 800 m3 s a patterned mudflat functioning state could persist for almost the whole set of erosion conditions in the system with dynamic grazer population fig 6 our analyses were based on two extreme cases where grazer numbers were either completely independent or fully determined by microalgal density these assumptions could not be maintained for semi managed systems or natural systems where the dependent of grazer growth on vegetation varied seasonally and spatially illius and o conner 1999 our predictions however did support the notion that enhancing the resilience of a patterned mudflat to erosion by regulating river flow discussed here is best to combine with active management of mudflat aquacultures especially for mudflat driven by complex bio physical interactions there are several limitations of this study worth noting first we investigated the landscape heterogeneity spatially averaged microalgal density and sediment elevation of the patterned mudflat ecosystem at steady state for each level of erosion rate the underlying assumption was that the change in erosion rates occurred at slower pace than the dynamics of ecosystem hence the ecosystem had time to reach stable states while the change in erosion rates is faster than the dynamics of ecosystem collapse may happen at higher microalgal density and lower erosion rate and the system may unable to recover to its pre collapse state even if erosion rate decrease substantially gordon et al 2008 sherratt 2013 thereby a rapid change in erosion conditions will challenge environmental flow management effective river flow regulation should be implemented sufficiently quick to prevent loss of microalgae or sediment by erosion second this study was limited to describing a static flow and aimed to identify the minimum flow discharge for a relatively resilient mudflat ecosystem we calculated sin and the subsequent resilience of the patterned ecosystem under different magnitudes of steady flow discharge if however environmental flow management seeks to define a variable flow scenario two major issues need to be further discussed i under unsteady flow conditions flow sediment hysteresis may occur and change the existing relationship between river flow and sediment deposition rate juez et al 2018 pietroń et al 2018 and ii the resilience and possible state transition of the ecosystem depend on the rate of at which sediment deposition rate changes are implemented greatly increasing the uncertainties of this highly dynamic ecosystem third we only considered the interference of erosion and grazing in the loss of mature microalgae further studies could build on our analyses by incorporating interference that act at the early growth stage of microalgae e g temperature nutrition status facing globally changing environments ecosystem management have shifted from a focus on restoring a specific system state to enhancing system resilience to variable stressors rosenfeld 2017 arthington et al 2018 gourgue et al 2021 although increasing models included a resilience thinking for assessing environmental flows most of these methods aimed at maintaining the vital rates e g growth fecundity migration of a particular species assemblage which was not necessarily a requirement for the resilience of ecosystem functions johnson 2013 zhao et al 2018 gladstone gallagher et al 2019 by contrast we characterized the functions of the mudflat ecosystem in various perspective landscape heterogeneity primary productivity and sedimentary condition based on combinations of biological geological and physical processes that occurred within the ecosystem furthermore using a mechanism based model we translated these complex interactions into simple outcomes which would be easily interpretable for policy makers and suitable for uptake into environmental flow managements 5 conclusions local interventions cannot single handedly eliminate the threats of increasing erosion on mudflats however taking a patterned estuarine mudflat as a case study our model predictions showed that increase river flow had the option to enhance the resilience of the patterned mudflat ecosystem to erosion through affecting sediment deposition rate which was an important attribute in the interaction process driving ecosystem resilience in addition under the same river flow the system with dynamic grazer population a natural case was more resilient than the system with a constant grazer number a mudflat aquaculture case highlighting the importance of considering the interactions of multiple management

and sediment discharge of the yellow river zhang et al 2014 our study area is characterized by a patterned landscape of microalgae covered hummocks alternating with water filled hollows fig 3 previous field observations in this area found higher chlorophyll a a proxy of microalgal biomass and colloidal carbohydrates contents in sediments from the hummocks than in sediments from the hollows zhang et al 2020 supporting the weerman s mechanism fig 2 as an explanation of the pattern formation in our study area self organization process in the studied mudflat is highly dynamic during spring to summer zhang et al 2021 a pattern develops in each spring fig 3b and became less obvious in summer fig 3c field experiment and theoretical model suggested that the seasonal variation is largely caused by increased herbivory of benthic animals the patterned mudflat provides a valuable habitat for benthic animals due to abundant food resources and spatially heterogenous environmental conditions as time progresses benthic animals eat microalgae and substantially modify the patterning process in summer hence the self organized pattern generated by the feedback between microalgae sediment and hydrodynamics accommodate and modified by benthic animals has important effects on the productivity sedimentation and energy flow in the estuarine mudflat system restoration of river flow and sediment load implemented by the yellow river conservancy committee yrcc has resulted in an incremental increase in the total area of yre since 2003 cui and li 2011 however the tidal flat on the north side of river mouth still presents different degrees of retreat due to net erosion kong et al 2015 release of floodwaters for restoration usually starts in late june which aims at maintaining the long term stability of the morphological characteristics of the yre but ignoring the ecological function of the mudflat 2 3 simulation process and scenarios we evaluated the effect of river flow on the resilience of the patterned mudflat ecosystem to erosion through changing the parameters erosion rate e and deposition rate s in in the eco morphodynamic model we first investigated the resilience of the patterned mudflat ecosystem to erosion by considering different e in the eco morphodynamic model the e varied from 0 0012 cm tide to 0 0032 cm tide based on bottom elevation changes in the yre from 1964 to 2010 zhang et al 2020 during this step the s in was constant sin 0 0022 cm tide then we explored how altered river flow affect the resilience of the patterned mudflat ecosystem to erosion to do this we first ran a sediment transport model details for the model has been described in previous work by zhang et al 2020 and the supplementary text s1 with a series of boundary conditions for steady river flow to predict the ssc in the mudflat under different flow discharges 11 steady flow discharges ranging from 50 m3 s to 1000 m3 s were determined based on the measured daily runoff at the lijin station the last hydrometric station before the river mouth from april to june of 2011 2012 and 2013 zhang et al 2020 after that the ssc values under different flow discharges were transformed to s in values through equation 5 lastly we assessed the effect of different s in on the resilience of the patterned mudflat ecosystem to erosion the resilience of the patterned mudflat ecosystem was represented by the persistence of system to increasing erosion the recovery of system under decreasing erosion and uncertainty of system response the river discharges that can satisfy high system persistence easy recovery and low uncertainty could be recommended as environmental flow the quantity timing and quality of water flows required to sustain freshwater and estuarine ecosystems and the human livelihoods and well being than depend on these ecosystems https www conservationgateway org files pages brisbane declaration aspx for the estuarine mudflat ecosystem during spring to summer 3 results 3 1 response of the patterned estuarine mudflat ecosystem to changing erosion the eco morphodynamic model revealed a range of erosion conditions where alternative stable states occurred and a threshold of erosion where the patterned estuarine mudflat ecosystem were particularly vulnerable to collapse fig 4 when the erosion rates e were below 0 0020 cm tide only a patterned mudflat with high microalgal density and strong sediment stabilization was observed at e between 0 0020 and 0 0023 cm tide the system exhibited two alternative stable states one a patterned mudflat the other a homogeneous mudflat with low microalgal density and severe sediment erosion when e dropped in this range the mudflat could be in either one of the alternative stable states depending on its history the dashed lines a slight perturbation might trigger the switch of state from one to the other response uncertainty when the erosion rate surpassed the threshold value 0 0023 cm tide a tipping point occurred above which only a homogeneous state was possible system persistence recovery only occurred when e decreased to lower levels 0 0020 cm tide at which the erosion condition was gentle enough to allow microalgae and sediment to re accumulate system recovery 3 2 effect of flow discharge on the resilience of the patterned estuarine mudflat ecosystem to erosion flow discharge was an important determinant of sediment deposition rate s in in the estuarine mudflat sediment deposition rate showed a positive relationship with flow discharge when flow discharge exceeded 400 m3 s fig s3 when s in was below 0 0017 cm tide corresponding flow discharge below 600 m3 s only a homogeneous mudflat was predicted after that changes in s in strongly affected the resilience of the patterned mudflat ecosystem to erosion in system persistence system recovery and response uncertainty fig 5 first a pattered mudflat could persist at higher e when s in increased second increased s in allowed for much easier recovery from a homogeneous state moreover the range of e where system exhibited uncertain responses increased as s in increased from 0 0017 to 0 0023 cm tide corresponding flow discharge 600 700 m3 s but decreased as s in increased from 0 0023 to 0 0032 cm tide corresponding flow discharge 700 800 m3 s afterwards the uncertain range did not change as s in increased 4 discussion using an eco morphodynamic model we examined how altered river flow affected the resilience of a patterned estuarine mudflat system with complex bio physical interactions our results suggested that functioning collapse happened in the patterned mudflat system as increasing erosion altered the system from being organized around microalgal growth sediment accumulation mutually enhancing processes to sediment erosion microalgal loss mutually accelerating process once collapsed the erosion rate at which mudflat could recovered was lower than the erosion rate at which mudflat collapsed river flow had a strong impact on the resilience of the patterned mudflat system to erosion which reflected in three aspects increased flow discharge allowed for enhanced system persistence easier recovery after disturbances and reduced response uncertainty the interference of grazing was a property that affected microalgal density at patch scale in contrast the interference of river flow was a property that affected sediment deposition at landscape scale thus at any given time the two stressors acted on different attributes depended on different mechanisms were coupled by cross scale interactions in space to define the resilience of the patterned mudflat system it is clear from fig 4 that as river flow increased from 600 m3 s to 700 m3 s the abilities of system persistence and recovery increased substantially however there was a trend of increase for the response uncertainty with the increase in river flow when the river flow reached 800 m3 s the response uncertainty decreased to the minimum afterward the increase of river flow resulted in enhanced resilience in all three dimensions system persistence system recovery and response uncertainty we thus recommended that river flow of 800 m3 s should be maintained during april to june for the resilience of the patterned mudflat to erosion in the yre it is important to highlight that we assumed a constant grazer density m which applied to a human controlled case mudflat aquacultures since any decline in population will be compensated by supplementary larvae and food in a natural setting grazer density would be affected by changes in microalgal density we then performed an analysis including natural grazer population dynamics it is obvious from fig 5 and fig 6 that resilience was considerably enhanced for the system with a dynamic grazer density compared to the system with a constant grazer density since at any given time drop in microalgal density would lead to the decrease in grazer density alleviating the grazing pressure this was consistent with a previous modeling study of dynamic grazing pressure in arid ecosystems van de koppel and rietkerk 2000 hence given the same river flow allocation the ecological benefit of the system with dynamic grazer population was much greater than the system with a constant grazer number under the river flow of 800 m3 s a patterned mudflat functioning state could persist for almost the whole set of erosion conditions in the system with dynamic grazer population fig 6 our analyses were based on two extreme cases where grazer numbers were either completely independent or fully determined by microalgal density these assumptions could not be maintained for semi managed systems or natural systems where the dependent of grazer growth on vegetation varied seasonally and spatially illius and o conner 1999 our predictions however did support the notion that enhancing the resilience of a patterned mudflat to erosion by regulating river flow discussed here is best to combine with active management of mudflat aquacultures especially for mudflat driven by complex bio physical interactions there are several limitations of this study worth noting first we investigated the landscape heterogeneity spatially averaged microalgal density and sediment elevation of the patterned mudflat ecosystem at steady state for each level of erosion rate the underlying assumption was that the change in erosion rates occurred at slower pace than the dynamics of ecosystem hence the ecosystem had time to reach stable states while the change in erosion rates is faster than the dynamics of ecosystem collapse may happen at higher microalgal density and lower erosion rate and the system may unable to recover to its pre collapse state even if erosion rate decrease substantially gordon et al 2008 sherratt 2013 thereby a rapid change in erosion conditions will challenge environmental flow management effective river flow regulation should be implemented sufficiently quick to prevent loss of microalgae or sediment by erosion second this study was limited to describing a static flow and aimed to identify the minimum flow discharge for a relatively resilient mudflat ecosystem we calculated sin and the subsequent resilience of the patterned ecosystem under different magnitudes of steady flow discharge if however environmental flow management seeks to define a variable flow scenario two major issues need to be further discussed i under unsteady flow conditions flow sediment hysteresis may occur and change the existing relationship between river flow and sediment deposition rate juez et al 2018 pietroń et al 2018 and ii the resilience and possible state transition of the ecosystem depend on the rate of at which sediment deposition rate changes are implemented greatly increasing the uncertainties of this highly dynamic ecosystem third we only considered the interference of erosion and grazing in the loss of mature microalgae further studies could build on our analyses by incorporating interference that act at the early growth stage of microalgae e g temperature nutrition status facing globally changing environments ecosystem management have shifted from a focus on restoring a specific system state to enhancing system resilience to variable stressors rosenfeld 2017 arthington et al 2018 gourgue et al 2021 although increasing models included a resilience thinking for assessing environmental flows most of these methods aimed at maintaining the vital rates e g growth fecundity migration of a particular species assemblage which was not necessarily a requirement for the resilience of ecosystem functions johnson 2013 zhao et al 2018 gladstone gallagher et al 2019 by contrast we characterized the functions of the mudflat ecosystem in various perspective landscape heterogeneity primary productivity and sedimentary condition based on combinations of biological geological and physical processes that occurred within the ecosystem furthermore using a mechanism based model we translated these complex interactions into simple outcomes which would be easily interpretable for policy makers and suitable for uptake into environmental flow managements 5 conclusions local interventions cannot single handedly eliminate the threats of increasing erosion on mudflats however taking a patterned estuarine mudflat as a case study our model predictions showed that increase river flow had the option to enhance the resilience of the patterned mudflat ecosystem to erosion through affecting sediment deposition rate which was an important attribute in the interaction process driving ecosystem resilience in addition under the same river flow the system with dynamic grazer population a natural case was more resilient than the system with a constant grazer number a mudflat aquaculture case highlighting the importance of considering the interactions of multiple management strategies to optimized performance as a preliminary we believe our work represents a fundamental shift to modeling ecosystem resilience based on the mechanism of bio physical interactions rather than relying on just quantifying the vital rates of particular species to compare river flow scenarios declaration of competing interest we certify that the submission is original work that is not under

15837,the restorative and regenerative ability of the circular economy has led to the rapid growth of this concept over the past decade as it facilitates the broadly adopted principles of sustainable development and beyond through restorative and regenerative actions the water sector is poised to benefit from this transition due to its intrinsic circularity and the resources it handles predominantly found in wastewater that are valuable and critical currently the vast range of resource recovery technologies coupled with few industrial examples hinder strategic decision making resource recovery on a regional scale improves market share and mitigates investment risk therefore a structured approach has been developed for the selection of priority technologies to act as a guide for strategic planning a representative uk wastewater model acts as the baseline with multi criteria analysis used to select resources and create an enhanced resource recovery scenario it was found that implementing the recovery of 5 priority resources and technology pathways increased nitrogen and phosphorus recovery by 68 and 71 respectively lastly the need for a cross cutting approach for the holistic assessment of circular solutions is discussed graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords resource recovery circular economy multi criteria analysis wastewater treatment global sensitivity analysis 1 introduction as governments implement ambitious targets to curb the anthropogenic impact of climate change industrial practices must change in tandem it has been recognised that further action is needed to ensure planetary health which has led to the rapid growth of the circular economy ce concept over the past decade kirchherr et al 2017 the ellen macarthur foundation define the ce as one that is restorative and regenerative by design and aims to keep products components and materials at their highest utility and value at all times distinguishing between technical and biological cycles ellen macarthur foundation 2015 ce practices are linked with achieving many sustainable development goals facilitating sustainable development panchal et al 2021 and beyond by actively restoring and regenerating material and energy cycles jazbec et al 2020 the water sector is uniquely poised for this transition due to its intrinsic circularity and the environmental economic and social value of capturing the resources it handles mihelcic et al 2017 the water sector handles an array of resources predominantly found in wastewater that are valuable and critical bestowing opportunities for revenue generation and diversification resources recovered from wastewater fall into many categories such as water energy biofuels fertilisers and biopolymers kehrein et al 2020a some of which are becoming increasingly scarce due to growing global population and urbanisation dagilienė et al 2021 investment in resource recovery infrastructure enables water utilities to realise benefits that reach far beyond revenue generation resource recovery is intrinsically linked to sustainable and circular practices such as process intensification resource circularity and waste valorisation which can reduce plant footprint improve operating costs increase energy efficiency reduce negative externalities and offset the carbon footprint of wastewater treatment facilities coma et al 2017 gherghel et al 2019 kehrein et al 2020a ruiken et al 2013 these prospective benefits have resulted in extensive work in recent decades by both academia and industry to develop technologies that shift the focus of wastewater treatment plants from pollutant removal to resource recovery facilities kehrein et al 2020a this has resulted in a multitude of technological options for the extraction of resources from wastewater providing water utilities with ample choice along the entire treatment pathway for plant design and process retrofitting kehrein et al 2020c however decision makers must consider trade offs between the benefits of selected technologies and the potential impacts when identifying which resources to target for recovery furthermore on a practical level plant operators have limited experience in innovative resource recovery technologies with few full scale examples of evidence based assessments for process optimisation the latter creates challenges for selection of priority resource recovery technologies and strategic planning especially whenever necessary factors such as cost risk and market potential need to be incorporated into decision making with the current emphasis placed on resource recovery and circularity there seems to be disproportionately few methods or examples of evaluating the resource recovery alternatives in wastewater treatments plants wwtps to support decision making chrispim et al 2020 efforts to systematically investigate the resource recovery potential of wwtps focus on site specific assessments for instance kehrein et al 2020c developed a framework for strategic planning and process design of water resource factories sppd wrf the sppd wrf aims to integrate resource recovery metrics in the site specific design of treatment processes thereby making resource recovery a measurable process design objective on a plant scale kehrein et al 2020c similarly the framework developed and implemented by chrispim et al 2020 at a large wwtp in sao paulo focused on site specific evaluation of resource recovery technologies through energy water and nutrient recovery analysis whilst considering the broader influences of market demand legislation technological options and stakeholders the identification of resource recovery alternatives on a regional sectoral level gives water utilities the ability to improve market share mitigating some investment risk and enables strategic planning of circular solutions by the water sector a study in scotland aimed to quantify available resources and estimate their commercial value in wastewater crew 2018 the authors achieved this valuation alongside estimations of potential carbon savings but provided no methodology to support decision making for optimising resource recovery strategies on this scale whilst considering wider impacts there are studies which advocate for the wider assessment of resource recovery scenarios however poor data availability costs and design complexity is restricting the use of integrated approaches for effective decision making kehrein et al 2020a 2020c van der hoek et al 2018 therefore there is a need for a structured approach to support decision making by assessing resource recovery potential from wastewater on a regional scale to select appropriate technologies for a given scenario given that water utilities monitor material and energy flows there is data available for measuring their current position within the ce and monitoring and or estimating the potential of the water sector s transition as circular strategies are adopted such as resource recovery this work aims to detail an approach for supporting water utility companies through planning and identification of strategies for resource recovery from wastewater on a regional scale 2 methodology the structured approach proposed for the identification of resource recovery strategies on a regional scale is detailed in fig 1 it starts with understanding the baseline scenario through construction of a system model which is crucial as it enables performance improvements to be benchmarked this is achieved through material flow analysis mfa and substance flow analysis sfa next a combination of market analysis and multi criteria analysis mca are used to rank and select resource recovery options a long list of resources with associated technology pathways has been developed based on previous studies in literature ukwir aunon et al 2015 and crew crew 2018 and shortlisted using technology readiness level trl the priority resources are identified by scoring shortlisted resources using a range of criteria such as cost carbon and treatment impacts altering criteria weighting permits the investigation of how future scenarios i e prioritizing carbon impacts can affect the priority resources the selected resource recovery options are implemented within the model to create an updated resource recovery scenario to understand the improvements achieved by retrofitting the technologies lastly a six capitals approach is discussed as part of the need for a holistic value assessment for strategic planning of resource recovery technologies 2 1 baseline scenario model the first step is to establish a baseline scenario model for benchmarking purposes to allow the gains made by implementation of resource recovery technologies to be investigated mfa and sfa are conducted to identify unnecessary waste of natural resources energy and materials along process chains as suggested by the oecd 2008 this information is used for the investigation of resource recovery strategies to improve understanding of the approach presented in this work the uk wastewater sector was used as an example a mass balance to represent the uk wastewater sector was constructed together with mfa chemical oxygen demand cod biological oxygen demand bod total suspended solids tss volatile suspended solids vss water and sfa nitrogen n phosphorus p organic carbon oc input data for the mass balance model was taken from publicly available databases and literature for the year 2018 19 for england and wales including population equivalent pe served flow handled facilities pe 25 000 sludge composition type of wastewater treatment and sludge management processes european environmental agency 2018 ofwat 2019 smyth et al 2021 northern irish and scottish flows were calculated from reported pe and typical wastewater production per capita from literature the 2018 19 operating year was chosen as this is the most recent price reporting year for ofwat pr19 standard wastewater loadings were used with removal efficiencies and kinetic parameters taken from literature tchobanoglous et al 2014 this information was combined to produce a representation of the uk wastewater sector which is visualised in fig 2 and displays system boundaries the uk wastewater treatment sector was represented using eight wastewater treatment methods six sludge treatment options and three types of solids disposal the wastewater pathways are as follows conventional activated sludge cas with preanoxic zone a trickling filter tf b phosphorus removal assumed to be chemical c disinfection d postanoxic denitrification e and phosphorus removal and postanoxic denitrification f the fraction of influent wastewater handled by each treatment pathway is a 44 b 4 a c 31 a d 13 b c 3 b d 3 b e 1 and b f 1 finally 99 2 of influent wastewater is discharged from the process the sludge treatment and disposal pathways are as follows primary sludge 1 waste activated sludge 2 advanced anaerobic digestion aad assumed thermal hydrolysis th pretreatment 3 anaerobic digestion ad 4 liming 5 incineration ash landfilled 6 composting 7 land reclamation 8 farmland application 9 and landfill 10 sludge production is split 61 primary and 39 waste activated sludge the fractions of sludge sent to each treatment system are 52 aad 34 ad 3 liming 7 incineration and 0 1 composting the remaining 4 is untreated finally sludge disposal fractions for each method are 3 land reclamation 95 farmland application and 2 landfill the values and parameters used for the construction of the mass balance model are summarised in tables s1 s3 supplementary material 2 2 market potential analysis this section describes the methodology followed for the estimation of the market potential of recovered resources for the uk market the market potential of a product reveals the extent to which it can fulfil the current market needs it therefore indicates the potential demand for recovered resources and in the context of this work highlights the position of wastewater resources within the circular economy on a regional scale if the potential market penetration is low then the potential uptake of a new product or feedstock is less likely thereby it is important to understand the market potential of resources available in wastewater before significant investments are made kehrein et al 2020a published a critical review of technologies available to recover resources from municipal wwtps and calculated the market potentials for the netherlands and flanders belgium each resource was considered independently so the market potential represents the maximum resource recovery that could be achieved under ideal circumstances using appropriate technologies this includes the calculation of the absolute market potentials meaning additional aspects such as market viability incentives and regulations were not considered the market potential calculation by kehrein et al 2020a was performed alongside a review of recovery technologies and bottlenecks to inform decision makers on the resources in wastewater here it is used as the basis to analyse the attractiveness of uk wastewater resources in terms of their potential market demand and goes further by integrating the results in a category of the mca for the selection of priority resources the market potential is found by calculating the total amount of a product that can be recovered from wastewater compared to the total market demand for that product the market demand for each resource was taken from relevant governmental and industrial reports with values chosen as close to the modelled time period as possible 2018 19 agricultural industries confederation 2021 ahdb 2019 alberici et al 2017 baumann and westermann 2016 department for business energy and industrial strategy 2020 department for environment food and rural affairs 2018 department for transport 2020 eurostat 2019 grand view research 2021 mineral products association 2018 the resources chosen for this analysis were a combination of those shortlisted for mca based on trl and those from the assessment by kehrein et al 2020a to enable comparisons between the uk and netherlands belgium for validation of results the next stage was to establish the amount of recoverable resources from uk wastewater streams the total resources handled were calculated utilising the wastewater loads from the mass balance model and reported sludge production ofwat 2019 removal efficiencies from literature were applied to calculate the fraction of each resource that could potentially be recovered kehrein et al 2020a mills 2016 organics group 2020 palmieri et al 2019 soares et al 2021 tchobanoglous et al 2014 and are summarised in table s5 supplementary material 2 3 multi criteria technology selection this section explains the approach followed in the mca for the identification of the priority resources considering different scenarios the mca methodology was developed as part of a project commissioned by uk water industry research ukwir to understand the greatest sustainable economic benefit for resource recovery from the water cycle ukwir 2021 the mca was used to assess the resource recovery opportunities in the uk wastewater sector initially the selected categories for the mca were recovery potential market potential treatment impacts cost and carbon impacts the criteria were chosen to establish how technologies would impact business goals of water utility companies additional criteria were also included in the mca to align with uk water utilities who are increasingly adopting the capitals concept for holistic value assessment of their systems to maximise stakeholder benefits as evidenced by their inclusion in the total value and impact assessment by yorkshire water 2018 capitals are used to broaden the scope of assessments for decision making by recognising the effects businesses have on a system and monetising their impacts environmental human social natural intellectual financial and relationship capitals have been linked with and can be seen as an extension of sustainability pillars by water utilities to reflect this and provide a holistic assessment of recovered resources the mca incorporates the 6 capitals listed alongside the initial assessment categories 2 3 1 scoring a long list of resources was drawn from previous work by ukwir aunon et al 2015 and crew crew 2018 a discussion on the resource recovery technologies analysed in this study is provided in section 3 of the supplementary material the resource recovery technologies were shortlisted by assessing the trl the in house experience and industrial knowledge of jacobs engineering group inc was used to evaluate resource recovery technologies and determine a near term resources shortlist and technology pathway by screening opportunities with trl 7 system prototype demonstration in operational environment ukwir 2021 some longlisted resources were considered unlikely to be near term despite their associated processes attaining trl 7 or above and not included in the shortlisted resources this resulted in a shortlist of 13 relevant resource recovery opportunities and associated technology pathways which are given in table 1 once shortlisted a semi quantitative scoring system between 1 lowest and 5 highest was applied to the chosen criteria which evaluate aspects of economically sustainable resource recovery scoring criteria guidance provided in table s6 of supplementary material scores for each technology were decided using in house expertise of jacobs engineering group inc ukwir 2021 with exception of the market potential which utilises the results calculated in section 2 2 2 3 2 scenario analysis to investigate the sensitivity of the recovery options to future scenarios criteria weightings were applied to reflect the possibility of short term changes to the status quo in areas of compliance carbon and resource efficiency legislation ukwir 2021 the results were used to calculate a final average score and ranking for resource recovery strategies by considering sensitivity to the following scenarios status quo business as usual which focusses on viable markets for recovered resources cost of implementation impacts on treatment capacity and resulting compliance emissions compliance focuses on water and air emissions which drives treatment of final effluent and intermittent discharges to more stringent standards and improved environmental social outcomes carbon reduction assumes companies have carbon related targets for operational and embodied carbon which mandate reduction in carbon sources and creation of carbon sinks increased sequestration resource max assumes numerical targets and metrics aligned with resource recovery resource efficiency and principles of the waste hierarchy and circular economy are applied with focus on sustainable resource recovery minimisation of waste and keeping resources in use at maximum value the scenarios and weightings presented have been constructed by industrial experts full explanation of technology scoring and scenario weighting can be found in tables s7 s9 supplementary material 2 3 3 global sensitivity analysis global sensitivity analysis gsa was conducted to improve the understanding of which criteria and scenario weights have the most significant influence on the final scores achieved and therefore the final resource ranking gsa assesses the impact that varying model inputs within a specified range has on output results for gsa the range of variable inputs are all considered simultaneously sarrazin et al 2016 sobol sensitivity analysis was applied the sobol sequence is a quasi random low discrepancy sequence used to generate uniform samples of parameter space sobol 2001 the sobol scheme is extended with saltelli s sampling scheme saltelli 2002 from salib python package herman and usher 2017 to reduce error in the resulting sensitivities sobol variance based gsa was run for 414 000 iterations on each resource with bounds allowing input fluctuations of 10 to calculate the sensitivity of input parameters mca criteria scores and scenario weightings on mca output results sobol 2001 the sensitivity of resources to each criterion is presented as the sensitivity index with the sum of indices equalling 1 the greater the sensitivity index of a given criterion the greater influence it has on the final score of each resource and therefore ranking 2 3 4 priority resource selection the average score achieved across the 4 investigated scenarios was used to create a final ranking with the top 5 identified as priority resources an interaction matrix was constructed to show how each of the priority resources can be combined with the other shortlisted technologies to create integrated resource recovery strategies case studies focusing on the recovery of priority resources were used to understand additional resource recovery opportunities that could be exploited these were divided into technologies which are required as part of the process for priority resource capture x as well as other strategies with the potential to enhance system performance xx this produces integrated resource recovery schemes that focus on the best performing resources for a given scenario additional resources that can be captured and potential process enhancements to decide the final strategy treatment methods from the original mass balance model are compared with resource recovery schemes to evaluate potential performance 2 4 evaluation of resource recovery scenario following the provision of five priority resources and their associated technology pathway to target within the studied uk example the baseline scenario was updated accordingly to estimate the potential gains in nutrient recovery mfa and sfa of the updated resource recovery scenario model show how nutrients flow around the new system enabling comparisons to be drawn in terms of nutrient recovery and revealing the enhancements of implementing resource recovery technologies when creating the resource recovery scenario it is important to remain realistic in terms of application of the priority resources and technologies for example even though ags systems may improve resource recovery eps and struvite recovery it is not reasonable to consider that all wwtps will utilise this technology therefore a more pragmatic and representative approach is to target systems that already have p removal due to the phosphorous accumulating properties of ags systems 3 results and discussion 3 1 baseline scenario material and substance flow analysis this section shows the results of the baseline uk model in the uk 5946 mm3 a of wastewater is handled 1 38 mtds a of sludge is produced and 0 77 mtds a of treated solids are disposed the results of the mfa and sfa were used to construct sankey diagrams which are shown in fig 3 sankey diagrams are commonly utilised to summarise flow analysis as they enable the viewer to be exposed to not only how materials flow around a system but also the magnitude of these flows as the width of the flow is proportional to its magnitude sankey diagrams were generated using microsoft power bi software microsoft corporation 2014 secondary tertiary treatment nutrient assimilation and effluent discharge are significant hotspots of the system where large fractions of nutrients are lost of the total influent n and p it was calculated that 8 and 25 are currently recycled through farmland application respectively which occurs due to 95 of biosolids being recycled to farmland during the year studied this high fraction is due to the fact that all of the reported sludge treatment methods comply with the biosolids assurance scheme bas the bas aligns practices with government strategies for beneficial use of sludge biosolids assurance scheme 2020 although low nutrient recovery rates suggest that using biosolids in this way might not be the optimal method for recovery in the current scenario of influent oc 26 was recovered through farmland application and biogas production it should be noted that the percentages quoted are the total quantity of nutrients applied to farmland as the availability of n and p to the next crop yield are 15 and 50 respectively for biosolids application ahdb 2019 this means that not all nutrients will be usefully recycled during the year of application the modelling of n recovery in amsterdam west wwtp 1 014 000 pe estimates that 11 is recovered when 100 of digested sludge is applied to land van der hoek et al 2018 this is comparable with the model s estimate considering that not all sludge is digested or applied to land mfa and sfa of the uk example reveal that a large fraction of nutrients in wastewater nutrients are not recovered this does mean there is significant scope for improvement through implementation of resource recovery technologies 3 2 market potential analysis market potentials for uk wastewater resources are summarised in table 2 the market potential reveals the uk market demand for the resources studied the quantity of resources that are potentially recoverable and the ratio of these values table 2 shows that technology for the production of fuels and subsequent energy and electricity generation whether gasification aad or anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbr can substitute little more than 1 of uk demand however the water sector consumes approximately 3 of uk energy so there is potential to move towards improved sector self sufficiency majid et al 2020 grit recovery has limited market potential meaning sustainable disposal e g land reclamation may be more appropriate rather than marketing it as a valuable product cellulose single cell proteins scp biochar volatile fatty acids vfas struvite and biosolids np have theoretical market potentials between 4 and 24 therefore it has been shown that these resources can substitute a significant fraction of the current market meaning there should be a demand from businesses to utilise them as feedstocks water reuse ultrafiltration uf micro filtration mf and ro co2 generation heat recovery phosphorus recovery sludge propionate and hydrogen production have market potentials greater than 25 this shows that wastewater can provide a significant fraction of the current market demand creating attractive opportunities to improve the sustainability of some industrially useful feedstocks it was shown that large scale polyhydroxyalkanoates pha and eps production may in fact saturate markets however demand for these biopolymers is growing grand view research 2021 due to its energy density the market potential of hydrogen was studied by calculating the fraction of wastewater effluent that must be electrolysed to fulfil fuel demands of heavy goods vehicles hgv it was shown that only 0 0001 of effluent should undergo electrolysis to supply all hgv miles 5 9 mvm million vehicle miles required for sludge transportation the market potentials calculated in table 2 are in agreement with those calculated by kehrein et al 2020a as the trends and magnitudes are similar to those seen for the netherlands and belgium the calculation of uk market potentials in this study gives an example of how to provide quantitative results to feed the mca scoring whenever data is readily available rather than relying exclusively on qualitative criteria the results can also be used as a validation of selected priority resources as they have been calculated considering data that is specific to the uk scenario 3 3 multi criteria analysis 3 3 1 scoring and investigation of future scenarios this section discusses the results from the mca considering both the unweighted scores and the weighted scores for the investigation of potential future scenarios the unweighted scores for each resource are highlighted in fig 4 revealing the individual scoring for each category when each category is given equal weighting the total scores range from the lowest of 19 fog to the highest of 32 heat from heat pumps out of a maximum of 40 results from the application of criteria weightings to study the impact of potential future scenarios to the ranking of technologies are summarised in fig 5 the final scores were calculated by averaging the weighted scores for each resource across the four scenarios this revealed after weighting that again heat recovery through utilisation of heat pumps was ranked highest and fog recovery the lowest the resources that experienced the greatest range over the scenarios were hydrogen syngas aat and biogas co digestion currently hydrogen generation requires large inputs of electrical energy so may be limited if strict emissions limits were implemented but it performs strongly in terms of recovery and market potential although the carbon benefits and recovery potential for syngas are high undesirable cost and market potential for energy generation results in large fluctuations between scenarios at present co digestion is not a viable recovery option in the uk due to regulatory limits however any updates to facilitate its implementation would result in enhanced generation of biogas meaning its use is uncertain 3 4 global sensitivity analysis this section summarises the results of the gsa completed for the scoring of shortlisted resources to investigate the impact of uncertainties in the scenario weightings and criteria scores fig 6 a shows the results of the gsa conducted on mca scores the greater the sensitivity index the greater the influence that a specific mca criterion score or the weightings of a potential future scenario has on the final score of a technology regarding the mca categories carbon has the largest influence on seven out of the thirteen shortlisted resources followed by market potential and treatment impacts with the largest influence on three resources each when considering only the potential future scenarios scoring was most sensitive to carbon reduction measures which may be due to the fact that circular solutions are seen as an important route to carbon neutrality for the water sector the final score of the technologies had the lowest sensitivity to human and intellectual capital shown to have the lowest influence for ten of the thirteen shortlisted resources this criterion had the lowest weighting for all four scenarios investigated and there was little variation in awarded scores as more emphasis is placed on maximising the 6 capitals it is likely that greater focus will be placed on these criteria by businesses in the future box plots have been drawn in fig 6b to reveal the variance exhibited by each resource and its associated technology across all iterations of the gsa the resources are ordered in terms of median scores and heat recovery is the top performer as even the minimum score recorded for heat is higher than the median score of any other after heat recovery the scores plateau somewhat until biomethane where there is a decline which reveals that selection of methods for the recovery of chemical energy may not be favourable comparing resources by applying this method helps to ensure robust selection of resources as it confirms the top ranked options perform well over a range of conditions and should be resilient to system changes and scoring uncertainty 3 5 priority resource selection the investigation of different scenarios and gsa enabled the ranking of the different technologies the final average values were used to rank wastewater resources and the top 5 are highlighted as priority resources which are heat heat pumps ammonia stripping biopolymers eps struvite and biosolids these are deemed priority resources as they have performed best across the multiple objectives of the mca as well as showing resilience and consistency to potential future influences and are summarised in fig 7 three of the priority resources align with the five resources with the greatest market potentials calculated by kehrein et al 2020 which are eps heat and biosolids kehrein et al 2020a a report for scotland also names heat recovery via heat pumps as a resource with significant potential and concludes that biopolymer resources are promising in terms of recovery and market value crew 2018 the comparison in fig 5 provides confidence that even if the analysed system experiences changes then selected resources should still perform effectively therefore supporting the robustness of priority resource selection fig 6b further supports this selection by revealing the extent to which uncertainty in scoring influences technology ranking as priority resources still outperform the others over the range investigated during gsa 3 6 resource recovery scenario results this section discusses the results from the implementation of the integrated resource recovery scenario within the uk wastewater example the resource recovery scenario is developed from the selected priority resources and the results of mfa indicate the gains in terms of nutrient recovery compared with the baseline scenario 3 6 1 resource recovery scenario development potential integrated resource recovery scenarios are discussed in this section and shown in the interaction matrix table 3 realistic scenarios for integration of resource recovery solutions were identified based on the results of the mca revealing how recovering priority resources can be coupled with technologies for co production of other shortlisted resources maximizing resource recovery efficiency based on case studies biosys 2021 centrisys cnp 2021 kehrein et al 2020b severn trent 2021 the royal borough of kingston upon thames 2021 and literature gherghel et al 2019 kehrein et al 2020a the combination of priority resource recovery with additional technologies for the creation of an integrated scenario is discussed in the following paragraphs this part of the assessment is necessary as it enables the construction of an appropriate integrated system of technologies that is representative of specific cases heat pumps that capture heat from effluent streams have highly generic applications so could be potentially integrated with most shortlisted resources processes for biogas and biosolids have been highlighted to potentially enhance heat recovery efficiency as they can be exploited for on site heating this is due to barriers such as heat losses encountered by exporting heat and the infrastructure costs associated so usage on site is preferred to maximise recovery nagpal et al 2021 on site recovery could be used for heating process units biological treatment ad processes for biogas generation or applied for advanced biosolids treatment including biodrying and dewatering applications kehrein et al 2020a ammonia stripping has been shown to be more efficient in terms of energy and recovery when conducted on digestate or digester reject liquors as they are highly concentrated with nitrogen van der hoek et al 2018 therefore systems that employ this ammonia recovery strategy will have anaerobic digestion on site producing biogas and biosolids additionally to enhance performance of the ammonia recovery system co digestion could be considered to increase the nutrient concentration of digester streams montusiewicz and lebiocka 2011 although co digestion is currently prohibited in uk ammonia can be directly combusted to generate energy or used to produce fertiliser and although processes that utilise it for energy recovery tend to consume more energy than is recovered and barriers such as low production rates and high cost compared with industrial fertilisers limit uptake kehrein et al 2020a biopolymers eps are present in the solid fraction produced from ags systems enhanced biological nutrient removal occurs due to the presence of phosphate accumulating organisms in ags systems therefore after eps extraction phosphorus can be recovered as struvite kehrein et al 2020b controlled release of the accumulated phosphorus requires subjecting sludge to anaerobic conditions so ad can be used to simultaneously produce biogas and biosolids th may help disrupt the large flocs granules produced during ags treatment enhancing yields establishing an integrated scenario will improve the viability of this resource recovery scheme as currently the eps market still needs to be fully established due to the high cost of production tavares ferreira et al 2021 struvite recovery via controlled precipitation captures phosphorus and nitrogen from concentrated streams after sludge digestion where nutrients have been solubilised therefore biogas and biosolids production is a prerequisite of this recovery scheme struvite production is limited compared with industrial fertilisers due to the scale of viable plants maintenance costs and issues with product quality ghosh et al 2019 to enhance the degree of struvite recovery co digestion could be utilised to increase nutrient load of digester streams and renewable heat recovered via heat pumps employed for various on site applications biosolids are produced from ad systems and this resource is currently widely adopted by the uk water sector however in the uk the sludge use in agriculture regulations must be adhered to before application of sewage sludge to land which specifies the of type of activity and contaminant limits that must be met public health england and wales and public health scotland 1989 additionally the introduction of new legislation may impact the practicalities of spreading biosolids produced from sewage sludge severn trent 2021 there are many ways to integrate other resource recovery practices to enhance biosolids generation such as using heat pumps to generate renewable energy to support heating required for sludge digestion co digestion of sewage sludge and municipal solid waste has been successfully exploited across europe in countries including denmark germany and switzerland to improve biosolids nutrient loading and biogas yields cavinato et al 2013 regulatory issues prohibit co digestion in the uk as it makes the process complex and expensive specifically around the use of food waste where animal by product regulations mitigate the digestates scope within the sludge use in agriculture regulations ciwem 2011 in europe there are no such issues with slaughtered animals that were fit for consumption requiring only a simple thermal sanitation step before ad holm nielsen et al 2009 based on this analysis an integrated system for the recovery of priority resources and co production of additional resources can be created using appropriate technologies for the specific case analysed treatment trains representative of the existing uk asset base from the baseline model were compared with technologies required for the recovery of priority resources to decide on the final integrated resource recovery scenario it was shown that the priority resource recovery pathways require and are even enhanced by the integration of aad for the production of biosolids and biogas therefore the scenario integrated within the baseline model is as follows treatment trains with p removal are replaced with ags processes for eps and struvite recovery addition of nh3 stripping to remaining non ags sludge treatment ad systems addition of th pretreatment to remaining non ags sludge treatment ad systems resultant biosolids utilised for farmland application thermal energy generation from heat pumps on effluent streams is compared with chemical energy from biogas 3 6 2 resource recovery scenario material and substance flow analysis results in this section the resultant scenario provided in section 3 4 1 is implemented within the baseline model to quantify the impacts of the implementing resource recovery technologies the cas and tf treatment schemes with p removal 34 of total flow were replaced by ags systems which produce additional eps and struvite resources reported data from a full scale nereda granular sludge plant in garmerwolde netherlands pronk et al 2015 was used to model the ags process sludge struvite eps and biogas production rates were taken from literature guo et al 2020 kehrein et al 2020b th units were integrated with ad processes used to treat the sludge produced by the remaining system to enhance biogas production and bioavailability of nutrients morgan sagastume et al 2011 thermally driven ammonia stripping was implemented on the concentrated liquor streams of the aad systems to enhance nitrogen recovery organics group 2020 the quantity of energy from biogas production is compared with the potential of heat pumps on effluent streams for energy recovery the parameters used for these calculations are summarised in table s4 supplementary material the reconfigured model favouring resource recovery practices was used to conduct mfa and sfa to investigate the degree to which nutrient recovery is improved this resulted in decreased sludge 1 13 mds a and biosolids 0 66 mds a production which is influenced by the relatively low generation by ags systems fig 8 shows the results of the mfa and sfa for the updated resource recovery scenario the influence of focussing on resource recovery is shown in fig 8 by the greater variety of product streams generated such as eps struvite and ammonia the results from fig 8 were used to calculate the nutrients recovered in the resource recovery scenario and then compared with the baseline values to calculate gains achieved which are summarised in fig 9 although biosolids production decreased by approximately 0 1 mtds a the effect of th meant that the nitrogen content was consistent between scenarios 50 5 tn d and 50 2 tn d in baseline and resource recovery scenarios respectively thermal stripping of digestion liquors recovered 21 2 tn d and additionally 12 1 tn d and 1 5 tn d was captured in eps and struvite respectively this increased the recovery of nitrogen by 68 compared with the baseline enhanced p recovery was mainly influenced by the phosphorus accumulating properties of ags systems which resulted in a greater fraction being applied as biosolids 46 0 tp d struvite and eps further supplemented this by recovering 3 4 tp d and 4 5 tp d respectively resulting in an increase of 71 compared with the baseline scenario for p recovery through the existing mix of biological and physio chemical treatment processes there was minimal impact on the recovery of oc due to the balance of reduced sludge production of ags systems increased biogas generation of aad processes and the recovery of eps these results demonstrate the potential to achieve significant advances in recovery of n and p from uk wastewater energy recovery yields were compared for biogas generation and effluent heat pump strategies the energy stored in biogas generated by the system is equivalent to 4 6 pj a however 6 4 mj m3 of energy can be captured from effluent wastewater therefore it was calculated that heat pumps are required on approximately 12 of the total flow to match energy recovery from biogas even in the updated resource recovery scenario large quantities of nitrogen are assimilated during wastewater treatment but the low n concentration of wastewater influent limits efficiency of pretreatment recovery however 80 of influent n van der hoek et al 2018 and 50 of influent p mo and zhang 2013 is in the form of urine thus potentially warranting an investigation into investment in separate collection infrastructure to enhance nutrient recovery in this scenario for example it was shown that adding urine to the stripper inlet stream equivalent to 10 of sludge liquor volume translates to approximately 40 increase in ammonia concentration morales et al 2013 when assessing the use of heat pumps for the recovery of thermal energy it was shown to be approximately 8 times greater than the chemical energy from biogas which is in agreement with the values of hao et al 2019 3 7 use of a capitals assessment this work provides a structured approach that guides the selection of resource recovery technologies to accelerate their adoption by the water industry regional analysis is required for understanding the reaction of systems to certain scenarios making it vital for planning and refining of strategic approaches superti et al 2021 this approach can be used as a strategic planning tool for circular solutions on a regional level enabling structural changes to be achieved for enhancement of the water sector s ce transition the inclusion of the 6 capitals in this assessment alongside more traditional criteria enables the assessment to go further than the typical focus of financial and manufactured capital resulting in a more holistic evaluation of technologies the use of a capitals assessment is seen as a way to maximise value creation in a more inclusive way which is evidenced by their incorporation within national water strategic plans including the uk strategy of water innovation 2050 2020 and water services association of australia circular economy transition jazbec et al 2020 their inclusion in this approach aims to identify technologies that generate greater net sustainability of the entire system however the assessment of capitals relied on expert judgement scoring ukwir 2021 so to fully understand the value of capturing resources the next phase of the assessment should be to quantify the capitals to act as the final validation of selected technologies the method developed by yorkshire water 2018 could act as a starting point for this as it places value on circular flow of resources and a cost on negative externalities this will require more detailed analysis of the studied system such as lca to expand the assessment for incorporation of other sustainability aspects the recommended technologies provided by the regional assessment are required to act as the foundation for further analysis by individual water utilities or treatment sites for the uk example it was recommended that heat ammonia biopolymers struvite and biosolids should be priority resources local factors should be included for selection in these specific cases as there are many alternative methods technologies drivers and barriers to consider at this scale which could be accounted for in a quantitative capitals assessment therefore there is a need for the development of a holistic value assessment to enable the conclusive appraisal of implementing circular solutions at any scale 4 conclusion a structured approach is proposed for selecting technologies for resource recovery from wastewater acting as strategic planning tool to accelerate the water sectors ce transition the proposed approach utilises mca to select resources and associated technology pathways for recovery on a regional scale the resultant strategy is then implemented within a model of the baseline scenario to quantify improvements achieved in terms of nutrient recovery the uk wastewater sector is used as an example using data reported by water utilities for the year 2018 19 revealing that 8 and 24 of nitrogen and phosphorus respectively are recovered in the present model mca scored resources based on aspects such as cost carbon market potential and treatment impacts and investigated sensitivity to future scenarios and scoring uncertainty the five priority resources for this scenario are heat heat pumps extracellular polymers ags ammonia stripping struvite and biosolids the recovery of these resources was integrated into the modelled system to create an updated resource recovery scenario this increased the recovery rate of nitrogen and phosphorus by 68 and 71 respectively however large fractions of nitrogen are still assimilated highlighting the potential need for source separation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

15837,the restorative and regenerative ability of the circular economy has led to the rapid growth of this concept over the past decade as it facilitates the broadly adopted principles of sustainable development and beyond through restorative and regenerative actions the water sector is poised to benefit from this transition due to its intrinsic circularity and the resources it handles predominantly found in wastewater that are valuable and critical currently the vast range of resource recovery technologies coupled with few industrial examples hinder strategic decision making resource recovery on a regional scale improves market share and mitigates investment risk therefore a structured approach has been developed for the selection of priority technologies to act as a guide for strategic planning a representative uk wastewater model acts as the baseline with multi criteria analysis used to select resources and create an enhanced resource recovery scenario it was found that implementing the recovery of 5 priority resources and technology pathways increased nitrogen and phosphorus recovery by 68 and 71 respectively lastly the need for a cross cutting approach for the holistic assessment of circular solutions is discussed graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords resource recovery circular economy multi criteria analysis wastewater treatment global sensitivity analysis 1 introduction as governments implement ambitious targets to curb the anthropogenic impact of climate change industrial practices must change in tandem it has been recognised that further action is needed to ensure planetary health which has led to the rapid growth of the circular economy ce concept over the past decade kirchherr et al 2017 the ellen macarthur foundation define the ce as one that is restorative and regenerative by design and aims to keep products components and materials at their highest utility and value at all times distinguishing between technical and biological cycles ellen macarthur foundation 2015 ce practices are linked with achieving many sustainable development goals facilitating sustainable development panchal et al 2021 and beyond by actively restoring and regenerating material and energy cycles jazbec et al 2020 the water sector is uniquely poised for this transition due to its intrinsic circularity and the environmental economic and social value of capturing the resources it handles mihelcic et al 2017 the water sector handles an array of resources predominantly found in wastewater that are valuable and critical bestowing opportunities for revenue generation and diversification resources recovered from wastewater fall into many categories such as water energy biofuels fertilisers and biopolymers kehrein et al 2020a some of which are becoming increasingly scarce due to growing global population and urbanisation dagilienė et al 2021 investment in resource recovery infrastructure enables water utilities to realise benefits that reach far beyond revenue generation resource recovery is intrinsically linked to sustainable and circular practices such as process intensification resource circularity and waste valorisation which can reduce plant footprint improve operating costs increase energy efficiency reduce negative externalities and offset the carbon footprint of wastewater treatment facilities coma et al 2017 gherghel et al 2019 kehrein et al 2020a ruiken et al 2013 these prospective benefits have resulted in extensive work in recent decades by both academia and industry to develop technologies that shift the focus of wastewater treatment plants from pollutant removal to resource recovery facilities kehrein et al 2020a this has resulted in a multitude of technological options for the extraction of resources from wastewater providing water utilities with ample choice along the entire treatment pathway for plant design and process retrofitting kehrein et al 2020c however decision makers must consider trade offs between the benefits of selected technologies and the potential impacts when identifying which resources to target for recovery furthermore on a practical level plant operators have limited experience in innovative resource recovery technologies with few full scale examples of evidence based assessments for process optimisation the latter creates challenges for selection of priority resource recovery technologies and strategic planning especially whenever necessary factors such as cost risk and market potential need to be incorporated into decision making with the current emphasis placed on resource recovery and circularity there seems to be disproportionately few methods or examples of evaluating the resource recovery alternatives in wastewater treatments plants wwtps to support decision making chrispim et al 2020 efforts to systematically investigate the resource recovery potential of wwtps focus on site specific assessments for instance kehrein et al 2020c developed a framework for strategic planning and process design of water resource factories sppd wrf the sppd wrf aims to integrate resource recovery metrics in the site specific design of treatment processes thereby making resource recovery a measurable process design objective on a plant scale kehrein et al 2020c similarly the framework developed and implemented by chrispim et al 2020 at a large wwtp in sao paulo focused on site specific evaluation of resource recovery technologies through energy water and nutrient recovery analysis whilst considering the broader influences of market demand legislation technological options and stakeholders the identification of resource recovery alternatives on a regional sectoral level gives water utilities the ability to improve market share mitigating some investment risk and enables strategic planning of circular solutions by the water sector a study in scotland aimed to quantify available resources and estimate their commercial value in wastewater crew 2018 the authors achieved this valuation alongside estimations of potential carbon savings but provided no methodology to support decision making for optimising resource recovery strategies on this scale whilst considering wider impacts there are studies which advocate for the wider assessment of resource recovery scenarios however poor data availability costs and design complexity is restricting the use of integrated approaches for effective decision making kehrein et al 2020a 2020c van der hoek et al 2018 therefore there is a need for a structured approach to support decision making by assessing resource recovery potential from wastewater on a regional scale to select appropriate technologies for a given scenario given that water utilities monitor material and energy flows there is data available for measuring their current position within the ce and monitoring and or estimating the potential of the water sector s transition as circular strategies are adopted such as resource recovery this work aims to detail an approach for supporting water utility companies through planning and identification of strategies for resource recovery from wastewater on a regional scale 2 methodology the structured approach proposed for the identification of resource recovery strategies on a regional scale is detailed in fig 1 it starts with understanding the baseline scenario through construction of a system model which is crucial as it enables performance improvements to be benchmarked this is achieved through material flow analysis mfa and substance flow analysis sfa next a combination of market analysis and multi criteria analysis mca are used to rank and select resource recovery options a long list of resources with associated technology pathways has been developed based on previous studies in literature ukwir aunon et al 2015 and crew crew 2018 and shortlisted using technology readiness level trl the priority resources are identified by scoring shortlisted resources using a range of criteria such as cost carbon and treatment impacts altering criteria weighting permits the investigation of how future scenarios i e prioritizing carbon impacts can affect the priority resources the selected resource recovery options are implemented within the model to create an updated resource recovery scenario to understand the improvements achieved by retrofitting the technologies lastly a six capitals approach is discussed as part of the need for a holistic value assessment for strategic planning of resource recovery technologies 2 1 baseline scenario model the first step is to establish a baseline scenario model for benchmarking purposes to allow the gains made by implementation of resource recovery technologies to be investigated mfa and sfa are conducted to identify unnecessary waste of natural resources energy and materials along process chains as suggested by the oecd 2008 this information is used for the investigation of resource recovery strategies to improve understanding of the approach presented in this work the uk wastewater sector was used as an example a mass balance to represent the uk wastewater sector was constructed together with mfa chemical oxygen demand cod biological oxygen demand bod total suspended solids tss volatile suspended solids vss water and sfa nitrogen n phosphorus p organic carbon oc input data for the mass balance model was taken from publicly available databases and literature for the year 2018 19 for england and wales including population equivalent pe served flow handled facilities pe 25 000 sludge composition type of wastewater treatment and sludge management processes european environmental agency 2018 ofwat 2019 smyth et al 2021 northern irish and scottish flows were calculated from reported pe and typical wastewater production per capita from literature the 2018 19 operating year was chosen as this is the most recent price reporting year for ofwat pr19 standard wastewater loadings were used with removal efficiencies and kinetic parameters taken from literature tchobanoglous et al 2014 this information was combined to produce a representation of the uk wastewater sector which is visualised in fig 2 and displays system boundaries the uk wastewater treatment sector was represented using eight wastewater treatment methods six sludge treatment options and three types of solids disposal the wastewater pathways are as follows conventional activated sludge cas with preanoxic zone a trickling filter tf b phosphorus removal assumed to be chemical c disinfection d postanoxic denitrification e and phosphorus removal and postanoxic denitrification f the fraction of influent wastewater handled by each treatment pathway is a 44 b 4 a c 31 a d 13 b c 3 b d 3 b e 1 and b f 1 finally 99 2 of influent wastewater is discharged from the process the sludge treatment and disposal pathways are as follows primary sludge 1 waste activated sludge 2 advanced anaerobic digestion aad assumed thermal hydrolysis th pretreatment 3 anaerobic digestion ad 4 liming 5 incineration ash landfilled 6 composting 7 land reclamation 8 farmland application 9 and landfill 10 sludge production is split 61 primary and 39 waste activated sludge the fractions of sludge sent to each treatment system are 52 aad 34 ad 3 liming 7 incineration and 0 1 composting the remaining 4 is untreated finally sludge disposal fractions for each method are 3 land reclamation 95 farmland application and 2 landfill the values and parameters used for the construction of the mass balance model are summarised in tables s1 s3 supplementary material 2 2 market potential analysis this section describes the methodology followed for the estimation of the market potential of recovered resources for the uk market the market potential of a product reveals the extent to which it can fulfil the current market needs it therefore indicates the potential demand for recovered resources and in the context of this work highlights the position of wastewater resources within the circular economy on a regional scale if the potential market penetration is low then the potential uptake of a new product or feedstock is less likely thereby it is important to understand the market potential of resources available in wastewater before significant investments are made kehrein et al 2020a published a critical review of technologies available to recover resources from municipal wwtps and calculated the market potentials for the netherlands and flanders belgium each resource was considered independently so the market potential represents the maximum resource recovery that could be achieved under ideal circumstances using appropriate technologies this includes the calculation of the absolute market potentials meaning additional aspects such as market viability incentives and regulations were not considered the market potential calculation by kehrein et al 2020a was performed alongside a review of recovery technologies and bottlenecks to inform decision makers on the resources in wastewater here it is used as the basis to analyse the attractiveness of uk wastewater resources in terms of their potential market demand and goes further by integrating the results in a category of the mca for the selection of priority resources the market potential is found by calculating the total amount of a product that can be recovered from wastewater compared to the total market demand for that product the market demand for each resource was taken from relevant governmental and industrial reports with values chosen as close to the modelled time period as possible 2018 19 agricultural industries confederation 2021 ahdb 2019 alberici et al 2017 baumann and westermann 2016 department for business energy and industrial strategy 2020 department for environment food and rural affairs 2018 department for transport 2020 eurostat 2019 grand view research 2021 mineral products association 2018 the resources chosen for this analysis were a combination of those shortlisted for mca based on trl and those from the assessment by kehrein et al 2020a to enable comparisons between the uk and netherlands belgium for validation of results the next stage was to establish the amount of recoverable resources from uk wastewater streams the total resources handled were calculated utilising the wastewater loads from the mass balance model and reported sludge production ofwat 2019 removal efficiencies from literature were applied to calculate the fraction of each resource that could potentially be recovered kehrein et al 2020a mills 2016 organics group 2020 palmieri et al 2019 soares et al 2021 tchobanoglous et al 2014 and are summarised in table s5 supplementary material 2 3 multi criteria technology selection this section explains the approach followed in the mca for the identification of the priority resources considering different scenarios the mca methodology was developed as part of a project commissioned by uk water industry research ukwir to understand the greatest sustainable economic benefit for resource recovery from the water cycle ukwir 2021 the mca was used to assess the resource recovery opportunities in the uk wastewater sector initially the selected categories for the mca were recovery potential market potential treatment impacts cost and carbon impacts the criteria were chosen to establish how technologies would impact business goals of water utility companies additional criteria were also included in the mca to align with uk water utilities who are increasingly adopting the capitals concept for holistic value assessment of their systems to maximise stakeholder benefits as evidenced by their inclusion in the total value and impact assessment by yorkshire water 2018 capitals are used to broaden the scope of assessments for decision making by recognising the effects businesses have on a system and monetising their impacts environmental human social natural intellectual financial and relationship capitals have been linked with and can be seen as an extension of sustainability pillars by water utilities to reflect this and provide a holistic assessment of recovered resources the mca incorporates the 6 capitals listed alongside the initial assessment categories 2 3 1 scoring a long list of resources was drawn from previous work by ukwir aunon et al 2015 and crew crew 2018 a discussion on the resource recovery technologies analysed in this study is provided in section 3 of the supplementary material the resource recovery technologies were shortlisted by assessing the trl the in house experience and industrial knowledge of jacobs engineering group inc was used to evaluate resource recovery technologies and determine a near term resources shortlist and technology pathway by screening opportunities with trl 7 system prototype demonstration in operational environment ukwir 2021 some longlisted resources were considered unlikely to be near term despite their associated processes attaining trl 7 or above and not included in the shortlisted resources this resulted in a shortlist of 13 relevant resource recovery opportunities and associated technology pathways which are given in table 1 once shortlisted a semi quantitative scoring system between 1 lowest and 5 highest was applied to the chosen criteria which evaluate aspects of economically sustainable resource recovery scoring criteria guidance provided in table s6 of supplementary material scores for each technology were decided using in house expertise of jacobs engineering group inc ukwir 2021 with exception of the market potential which utilises the results calculated in section 2 2 2 3 2 scenario analysis to investigate the sensitivity of the recovery options to future scenarios criteria weightings were applied to reflect the possibility of short term changes to the status quo in areas of compliance carbon and resource efficiency legislation ukwir 2021 the results were used to calculate a final average score and ranking for resource recovery strategies by considering sensitivity to the following scenarios status quo business as usual which focusses on viable markets for recovered resources cost of implementation impacts on treatment capacity and resulting compliance emissions compliance focuses on water and air emissions which drives treatment of final effluent and intermittent discharges to more stringent standards and improved environmental social outcomes carbon reduction assumes companies have carbon related targets for operational and embodied carbon which mandate reduction in carbon sources and creation of carbon sinks increased sequestration resource max assumes numerical targets and metrics aligned with resource recovery resource efficiency and principles of the waste hierarchy and circular economy are applied with focus on sustainable resource recovery minimisation of waste and keeping resources in use at maximum value the scenarios and weightings presented have been constructed by industrial experts full explanation of technology scoring and scenario weighting can be found in tables s7 s9 supplementary material 2 3 3 global sensitivity analysis global sensitivity analysis gsa was conducted to improve the understanding of which criteria and scenario weights have the most significant influence on the final scores achieved and therefore the final resource ranking gsa assesses the impact that varying model inputs within a specified range has on output results for gsa the range of variable inputs are all considered simultaneously sarrazin et al 2016 sobol sensitivity analysis was applied the sobol sequence is a quasi random low discrepancy sequence used to generate uniform samples of parameter space sobol 2001 the sobol scheme is extended with saltelli s sampling scheme saltelli 2002 from salib python package herman and usher 2017 to reduce error in the resulting sensitivities sobol variance based gsa was run for 414 000 iterations on each resource with bounds allowing input fluctuations of 10 to calculate the sensitivity of input parameters mca criteria scores and scenario weightings on mca output results sobol 2001 the sensitivity of resources to each criterion is presented as the sensitivity index with the sum of indices equalling 1 the greater the sensitivity index of a given criterion the greater influence it has on the final score of each resource and therefore ranking 2 3 4 priority resource selection the average score achieved across the 4 investigated scenarios was used to create a final ranking with the top 5 identified as priority resources an interaction matrix was constructed to show how each of the priority resources can be combined with the other shortlisted technologies to create integrated resource recovery strategies case studies focusing on the recovery of priority resources were used to understand additional resource recovery opportunities that could be exploited these were divided into technologies which are required as part of the process for priority resource capture x as well as other strategies with the potential to enhance system performance xx this produces integrated resource recovery schemes that focus on the best performing resources for a given scenario additional resources that can be captured and potential process enhancements to decide the final strategy treatment methods from the original mass balance model are compared with resource recovery schemes to evaluate potential performance 2 4 evaluation of resource recovery scenario following the provision of five priority resources and their associated technology pathway to target within the studied uk example the baseline scenario was updated accordingly to estimate the potential gains in nutrient recovery mfa and sfa of the updated resource recovery scenario model show how nutrients flow around the new system enabling comparisons to be drawn in terms of nutrient recovery and revealing the enhancements of implementing resource recovery technologies when creating the resource recovery scenario it is important to remain realistic in terms of application of the priority resources and technologies for example even though ags systems may improve resource recovery eps and struvite recovery it is not reasonable to consider that all wwtps will utilise this technology therefore a more pragmatic and representative approach is to target systems that already have p removal due to the phosphorous accumulating properties of ags systems 3 results and discussion 3 1 baseline scenario material and substance flow analysis this section shows the results of the baseline uk model in the uk 5946 mm3 a of wastewater is handled 1 38 mtds a of sludge is produced and 0 77 mtds a of treated solids are disposed the results of the mfa and sfa were used to construct sankey diagrams which are shown in fig 3 sankey diagrams are commonly utilised to summarise flow analysis as they enable the viewer to be exposed to not only how materials flow around a system but also the magnitude of these flows as the width of the flow is proportional to its magnitude sankey diagrams were generated using microsoft power bi software microsoft corporation 2014 secondary tertiary treatment nutrient assimilation and effluent discharge are significant hotspots of the system where large fractions of nutrients are lost of the total influent n and p it was calculated that 8 and 25 are currently recycled through farmland application respectively which occurs due to 95 of biosolids being recycled to farmland during the year studied this high fraction is due to the fact that all of the reported sludge treatment methods comply with the biosolids assurance scheme bas the bas aligns practices with government strategies for beneficial use of sludge biosolids assurance scheme 2020 although low nutrient recovery rates suggest that using biosolids in this way might not be the optimal method for recovery in the current scenario of influent oc 26 was recovered through farmland application and biogas production it should be noted that the percentages quoted are the total quantity of nutrients applied to farmland as the availability of n and p to the next crop yield are 15 and 50 respectively for biosolids application ahdb 2019 this means that not all nutrients will be usefully recycled during the year of application the modelling of n recovery in amsterdam west wwtp 1 014 000 pe estimates that 11 is recovered when 100 of digested sludge is applied to land van der hoek et al 2018 this is comparable with the model s estimate considering that not all sludge is digested or applied to land mfa and sfa of the uk example reveal that a large fraction of nutrients in wastewater nutrients are not recovered this does mean there is significant scope for improvement through implementation of resource recovery technologies 3 2 market potential analysis market potentials for uk wastewater resources are summarised in table 2 the market potential reveals the uk market demand for the resources studied the quantity of resources that are potentially recoverable and the ratio of these values table 2 shows that technology for the production of fuels and subsequent energy and electricity generation whether gasification aad or anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbr can substitute little more than 1 of uk demand however the water sector consumes approximately 3 of uk energy so there is potential to move towards improved sector self sufficiency majid et al 2020 grit recovery has limited market potential meaning sustainable disposal e g land reclamation may be more appropriate rather than marketing it as a valuable product cellulose single cell proteins scp biochar volatile fatty acids vfas struvite and biosolids np have theoretical market potentials between 4 and 24 therefore it has been shown that these resources can substitute a significant fraction of the current market meaning there should be a demand from businesses to utilise them as feedstocks water reuse ultrafiltration uf micro filtration mf and ro co2 generation heat recovery phosphorus recovery sludge propionate and hydrogen production have market potentials greater than 25 this shows that wastewater can provide a significant fraction of the current market demand creating attractive opportunities to improve the sustainability of some industrially useful feedstocks it was shown that large scale polyhydroxyalkanoates pha and eps production may in fact saturate markets however demand for these biopolymers is growing grand view research 2021 due to its energy density the market potential of hydrogen was studied by calculating the fraction of wastewater effluent that must be electrolysed to fulfil fuel demands of heavy goods vehicles hgv it was shown that only 0 0001 of effluent should undergo electrolysis to supply all hgv miles 5 9 mvm million vehicle miles required for sludge transportation the market potentials calculated in table 2 are in agreement with those calculated by kehrein et al 2020a as the trends and magnitudes are similar to those seen for the netherlands and belgium the calculation of uk market potentials in this study gives an example of how to provide quantitative results to feed the mca scoring whenever data is readily available rather than relying exclusively on qualitative criteria the results can also be used as a validation of selected priority resources as they have been calculated considering data that is specific to the uk scenario 3 3 multi criteria analysis 3 3 1 scoring and investigation of future scenarios this section discusses the results from the mca considering both the unweighted scores and the weighted scores for the investigation of potential future scenarios the unweighted scores for each resource are highlighted in fig 4 revealing the individual scoring for each category when each category is given equal weighting the total scores range from the lowest of 19 fog to the highest of 32 heat from heat pumps out of a maximum of 40 results from the application of criteria weightings to study the impact of potential future scenarios to the ranking of technologies are summarised in fig 5 the final scores were calculated by averaging the weighted scores for each resource across the four scenarios this revealed after weighting that again heat recovery through utilisation of heat pumps was ranked highest and fog recovery the lowest the resources that experienced the greatest range over the scenarios were hydrogen syngas aat and biogas co digestion currently hydrogen generation requires large inputs of electrical energy so may be limited if strict emissions limits were implemented but it performs strongly in terms of recovery and market potential although the carbon benefits and recovery potential for syngas are high undesirable cost and market potential for energy generation results in large fluctuations between scenarios at present co digestion is not a viable recovery option in the uk due to regulatory limits however any updates to facilitate its implementation would result in enhanced generation of biogas meaning its use is uncertain 3 4 global sensitivity analysis this section summarises the results of the gsa completed for the scoring of shortlisted resources to investigate the impact of uncertainties in the scenario weightings and criteria scores fig 6 a shows the results of the gsa conducted on mca scores the greater the sensitivity index the greater the influence that a specific mca criterion score or the weightings of a potential future scenario has on the final score of a technology regarding the mca categories carbon has the largest influence on seven out of the thirteen shortlisted resources followed by market potential and treatment impacts with the largest influence on three resources each when considering only the potential future scenarios scoring was most sensitive to carbon reduction measures which may be due to the fact that circular solutions are seen as an important route to carbon neutrality for the water sector the final score of the technologies had the lowest sensitivity to human and intellectual capital shown to have the lowest influence for ten of the thirteen shortlisted resources this criterion had the lowest weighting for all four scenarios investigated and there was little variation in awarded scores as more emphasis is placed on maximising the 6 capitals it is likely that greater focus will be placed on these criteria by businesses in the future box plots have been drawn in fig 6b to reveal the variance exhibited by each resource and its associated technology across all iterations of the gsa the resources are ordered in terms of median scores and heat recovery is the top performer as even the minimum score recorded for heat is higher than the median score of any other after heat recovery the scores plateau somewhat until biomethane where there is a decline which reveals that selection of methods for the recovery of chemical energy may not be favourable comparing resources by applying this method helps to ensure robust selection of resources as it confirms the top ranked options perform well over a range of conditions and should be resilient to system changes and scoring uncertainty 3 5 priority resource selection the investigation of different scenarios and gsa enabled the ranking of the different technologies the final average values were used to rank wastewater resources and the top 5 are highlighted as priority resources which are heat heat pumps ammonia stripping biopolymers eps struvite and biosolids these are deemed priority resources as they have performed best across the multiple objectives of the mca as well as showing resilience and consistency to potential future influences and are summarised in fig 7 three of the priority resources align with the five resources with the greatest market potentials calculated by kehrein et al 2020 which are eps heat and biosolids kehrein et al 2020a a report for scotland also names heat recovery via heat pumps as a resource with significant potential and concludes that biopolymer resources are promising in terms of recovery and market value crew 2018 the comparison in fig 5 provides confidence that even if the analysed system experiences changes then selected resources should still perform effectively therefore supporting the robustness of priority resource selection fig 6b further supports this selection by revealing the extent to which uncertainty in scoring influences technology ranking as priority resources still outperform the others over the range investigated during gsa 3 6 resource recovery scenario results this section discusses the results from the implementation of the integrated resource recovery scenario within the uk wastewater example the resource recovery scenario is developed from the selected priority resources and the results of mfa indicate the gains in terms of nutrient recovery compared with the baseline scenario 3 6 1 resource recovery scenario development potential integrated resource recovery scenarios are discussed in this section and shown in the interaction matrix table 3 realistic scenarios for integration of resource recovery solutions were identified based on the results of the mca revealing how recovering priority resources can be coupled with technologies for co production of other shortlisted resources maximizing resource recovery efficiency based on case studies biosys 2021 centrisys cnp 2021 kehrein et al 2020b severn trent 2021 the royal borough of kingston upon thames 2021 and literature gherghel et al 2019 kehrein et al 2020a the combination of priority resource recovery with additional technologies for the creation of an integrated scenario is discussed in the following paragraphs this part of the assessment is necessary as it enables the construction of an appropriate integrated system of technologies that is representative of specific cases heat pumps that capture heat from effluent streams have highly generic applications so could be potentially integrated with most shortlisted resources processes for biogas and biosolids have been highlighted to potentially enhance heat recovery efficiency as they can be exploited for on site heating this is due to barriers such as heat losses encountered by exporting heat and the infrastructure costs associated so usage on site is preferred to maximise recovery nagpal et al 2021 on site recovery could be used for heating process units biological treatment ad processes for biogas generation or applied for advanced biosolids treatment including biodrying and dewatering applications kehrein et al 2020a ammonia stripping has been shown to be more efficient in terms of energy and recovery when conducted on digestate or digester reject liquors as they are highly concentrated with nitrogen van der hoek et al 2018 therefore systems that employ this ammonia recovery strategy will have anaerobic digestion on site producing biogas and biosolids additionally to enhance performance of the ammonia recovery system co digestion could be considered to increase the nutrient concentration of digester streams montusiewicz and lebiocka 2011 although co digestion is currently prohibited in uk ammonia can be directly combusted to generate energy or used to produce fertiliser and although processes that utilise it for energy recovery tend to consume more energy than is recovered and barriers such as low production rates and high cost compared with industrial fertilisers limit uptake kehrein et al 2020a biopolymers eps are present in the solid fraction produced from ags systems enhanced biological nutrient removal occurs due to the presence of phosphate accumulating organisms in ags systems therefore after eps extraction phosphorus can be recovered as struvite kehrein et al 2020b controlled release of the accumulated phosphorus requires subjecting sludge to anaerobic conditions so ad can be used to simultaneously produce biogas and biosolids th may help disrupt the large flocs granules produced during ags treatment enhancing yields establishing an integrated scenario will improve the viability of this resource recovery scheme as currently the eps market still needs to be fully established due to the high cost of production tavares ferreira et al 2021 struvite recovery via controlled precipitation captures phosphorus and nitrogen from concentrated streams after sludge digestion where nutrients have been solubilised therefore biogas and biosolids production is a prerequisite of this recovery scheme struvite production is limited compared with industrial fertilisers due to the scale of viable plants maintenance costs and issues with product quality ghosh et al 2019 to enhance the degree of struvite recovery co digestion could be utilised to increase nutrient load of digester streams and renewable heat recovered via heat pumps employed for various on site applications biosolids are produced from ad systems and this resource is currently widely adopted by the uk water sector however in the uk the sludge use in agriculture regulations must be adhered to before application of sewage sludge to land which specifies the of type of activity and contaminant limits that must be met public health england and wales and public health scotland 1989 additionally the introduction of new legislation may impact the practicalities of spreading biosolids produced from sewage sludge severn trent 2021 there are many ways to integrate other resource recovery practices to enhance biosolids generation such as using heat pumps to generate renewable energy to support heating required for sludge digestion co digestion of sewage sludge and municipal solid waste has been successfully exploited across europe in countries including denmark germany and switzerland to improve biosolids nutrient loading and biogas yields cavinato et al 2013 regulatory issues prohibit co digestion in the uk as it makes the process complex and expensive specifically around the use of food waste where animal by product regulations mitigate the digestates scope within the sludge use in agriculture regulations ciwem 2011 in europe there are no such issues with slaughtered animals that were fit for consumption requiring only a simple thermal sanitation step before ad holm nielsen et al 2009 based on this analysis an integrated system for the recovery of priority resources and co production of additional resources can be created using appropriate technologies for the specific case analysed treatment trains representative of the existing uk asset base from the baseline model were compared with technologies required for the recovery of priority resources to decide on the final integrated resource recovery scenario it was shown that the priority resource recovery pathways require and are even enhanced by the integration of aad for the production of biosolids and biogas therefore the scenario integrated within the baseline model is as follows treatment trains with p removal are replaced with ags processes for eps and struvite recovery addition of nh3 stripping to remaining non ags sludge treatment ad systems addition of th pretreatment to remaining non ags sludge treatment ad systems resultant biosolids utilised for farmland application thermal energy generation from heat pumps on effluent streams is compared with chemical energy from biogas 3 6 2 resource recovery scenario material and substance flow analysis results in this section the resultant scenario provided in section 3 4 1 is implemented within the baseline model to quantify the impacts of the implementing resource recovery technologies the cas and tf treatment schemes with p removal 34 of total flow were replaced by ags systems which produce additional eps and struvite resources reported data from a full scale nereda granular sludge plant in garmerwolde netherlands pronk et al 2015 was used to model the ags process sludge struvite eps and biogas production rates were taken from literature guo et al 2020 kehrein et al 2020b th units were integrated with ad processes used to treat the sludge produced by the remaining system to enhance biogas production and bioavailability of nutrients morgan sagastume et al 2011 thermally driven ammonia stripping was implemented on the concentrated liquor streams of the aad systems to enhance nitrogen recovery organics group 2020 the quantity of energy from biogas production is compared with the potential of heat pumps on effluent streams for energy recovery the parameters used for these calculations are summarised in table s4 supplementary material the reconfigured model favouring resource recovery practices was used to conduct mfa and sfa to investigate the degree to which nutrient recovery is improved this resulted in decreased sludge 1 13 mds a and biosolids 0 66 mds a production which is influenced by the relatively low generation by ags systems fig 8 shows the results of the mfa and sfa for the updated resource recovery scenario the influence of focussing on resource recovery is shown in fig 8 by the greater variety of product streams generated such as eps struvite and ammonia the results from fig 8 were used to calculate the nutrients recovered in the resource recovery scenario and then compared with the baseline values to calculate gains achieved which are summarised in fig 9 although biosolids production decreased by approximately 0 1 mtds a the effect of th meant that the nitrogen content was consistent between scenarios 50 5 tn d and 50 2 tn d in baseline and resource recovery scenarios respectively thermal stripping of digestion liquors recovered 21 2 tn d and additionally 12 1 tn d and 1 5 tn d was captured in eps and struvite respectively this increased the recovery of nitrogen by 68 compared with the baseline enhanced p recovery was mainly influenced by the phosphorus accumulating properties of ags systems which resulted in a greater fraction being applied as biosolids 46 0 tp d struvite and eps further supplemented this by recovering 3 4 tp d and 4 5 tp d respectively resulting in an increase of 71 compared with the baseline scenario for p recovery through the existing mix of biological and physio chemical treatment processes there was minimal impact on the recovery of oc due to the balance of reduced sludge production of ags systems increased biogas generation of aad processes and the recovery of eps these results demonstrate the potential to achieve significant advances in recovery of n and p from uk wastewater energy recovery yields were compared for biogas generation and effluent heat pump strategies the energy stored in biogas generated by the system is equivalent to 4 6 pj a however 6 4 mj m3 of energy can be captured from effluent wastewater therefore it was calculated that heat pumps are required on approximately 12 of the total flow to match energy recovery from biogas even in the updated resource recovery scenario large quantities of nitrogen are assimilated during wastewater treatment but the low n concentration of wastewater influent limits efficiency of pretreatment recovery however 80 of influent n van der hoek et al 2018 and 50 of influent p mo and zhang 2013 is in the form of urine thus potentially warranting an investigation into investment in separate collection infrastructure to enhance nutrient recovery in this scenario for example it was shown that adding urine to the stripper inlet stream equivalent to 10 of sludge liquor volume translates to approximately 40 increase in ammonia concentration morales et al 2013 when assessing the use of heat pumps for the recovery of thermal energy it was shown to be approximately 8 times greater than the chemical energy from biogas which is in agreement with the values of hao et al 2019 3 7 use of a capitals assessment this work provides a structured approach that guides the selection of resource recovery technologies to accelerate their adoption by the water industry regional analysis is required for understanding the reaction of systems to certain scenarios making it vital for planning and refining of strategic approaches superti et al 2021 this approach can be used as a strategic planning tool for circular solutions on a regional level enabling structural changes to be achieved for enhancement of the water sector s ce transition the inclusion of the 6 capitals in this assessment alongside more traditional criteria enables the assessment to go further than the typical focus of financial and manufactured capital resulting in a more holistic evaluation of technologies the use of a capitals assessment is seen as a way to maximise value creation in a more inclusive way which is evidenced by their incorporation within national water strategic plans including the uk strategy of water innovation 2050 2020 and water services association of australia circular economy transition jazbec et al 2020 their inclusion in this approach aims to identify technologies that generate greater net sustainability of the entire system however the assessment of capitals relied on expert judgement scoring ukwir 2021 so to fully understand the value of capturing resources the next phase of the assessment should be to quantify the capitals to act as the final validation of selected technologies the method developed by yorkshire water 2018 could act as a starting point for this as it places value on circular flow of resources and a cost on negative externalities this will require more detailed analysis of the studied system such as lca to expand the assessment for incorporation of other sustainability aspects the recommended technologies provided by the regional assessment are required to act as the foundation for further analysis by individual water utilities or treatment sites for the uk example it was recommended that heat ammonia biopolymers struvite and biosolids should be priority resources local factors should be included for selection in these specific cases as there are many alternative methods technologies drivers and barriers to consider at this scale which could be accounted for in a quantitative capitals assessment therefore there is a need for the development of a holistic value assessment to enable the conclusive appraisal of implementing circular solutions at any scale 4 conclusion a structured approach is proposed for selecting technologies for resource recovery from wastewater acting as strategic planning tool to accelerate the water sectors ce transition the proposed approach utilises mca to select resources and associated technology pathways for recovery on a regional scale the resultant strategy is then implemented within a model of the baseline scenario to quantify improvements achieved in terms of nutrient recovery the uk wastewater sector is used as an example using data reported by water utilities for the year 2018 19 revealing that 8 and 24 of nitrogen and phosphorus respectively are recovered in the present model mca scored resources based on aspects such as cost carbon market potential and treatment impacts and investigated sensitivity to future scenarios and scoring uncertainty the five priority resources for this scenario are heat heat pumps extracellular polymers ags ammonia stripping struvite and biosolids the recovery of these resources was integrated into the modelled system to create an updated resource recovery scenario this increased the recovery rate of nitrogen and phosphorus by 68 and 71 respectively however large fractions of nitrogen are still assimilated highlighting the potential need for source separation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

on the presence depth and duration of street level floods by measuring flood profiles i e flood stage hydrographs in real time with a time interval on the order of minutes hyperlocal flood data collected by low cost sensors have many use cases for a variety of stakeholders including municipal agencies community members and researchers here we outline examples of potential uses of flood sensor data before during and after flood events based on dialog with stakeholders in new york city these uses include inputs to predictive flood models generation of real time flood alerts for community members and emergency response teams storm recovery assistance and cataloging of storm impacts and informing infrastructure design and investment for long term flood resilience project planning graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction flooding is one of the most dangerous and costly natural hazards and has a large impact on infrastructure mobility and public health and safety nasem 2019 university of maryland 2018 floods can occur due to storm surges higher high tides e g spring tides and king tides disruptions to drainage infrastructure or high intensity precipitation and are expected to occur more frequently in many regions due to climate change effects such as sea level rise and increased occurrence of extreme precipitation events farris et al 2021 kunkel et al 2020 lenderink and van meijgaard 2010 sillman et al 2013 and increased urbanization zhang et al 2018 despite the disruptive impacts of flooding and the existence of models that estimate risk of flood occurrence there has been very little quantitative data available on the actual occurrence frequency and extent of flooding in urban areas in new york city nyc for example street level flood data have previously only been available through community sourced reports such as those made to nyc s 311 service request portal social media posts and reports to the community flood watch project which is a collaboration between the city of new york new york sea grant and the science and resilience institute at jamaica bay and involves a network of residents who report local flooding and share flood related photos stories and experiences campbell et al 2021 while community reported flood data are an important source of information for understanding flood impacts some limitations of these data include the need for an individual to witness and report a flood for the event to be recorded smith and rodriguez 2017 a lack of representativeness of 311 data given that some communities including low income or minority residents have been found to be less likely to report street condition issues kontokosta and hong 2021 and often a lack of quantitative data on the water depth profile and geographic extent during the duration of the flood event helmrich et al 2021 to give one example more flood reports were made to nyc s 311 service request portal from 2004 2015 during midday when people are more likely to be out of their homes than at night smith and rodriguez 2017 given limited quantitative data available on urban flooding our team has been designing building and deploying low cost ultrasonic sensors to systematically collect data on the presence depth and duration of street level floods our project called floodnet is a partnership between academic researchers at new york university and the city university of new york and nyc municipal agencies nyc mayor s office of climate environmental justice and mayor s office of the chief technology officer working in consultation with community organizations in this perspective we highlight the use of low cost sensors to collect quantitative flood data and provide concrete examples of potential data uses with nyc as a case study while our efforts are currently focused on nyc the low cost sensors presented herein were designed for universal use and could be of similar utility in other contexts 2 flood sensors water level sensors available for flood detection include ultrasonic e g mousa et al 2016 loftis et al 2018 pressure e g garcia et al 2015 radar lidar e g loftis et al 2018 paul et al 2020 capacitive conductivity based e g chetpattananondh et al 2014 shi et al 2021 and camera based e g lo et al 2015 filonenko et al 2015 hiroi and kawaguchi 2016 technologies the floodnet project has been focused on the design construction and deployment of ultrasonic flood sensors in nyc to record floods caused by stormwater and high tide events the floodnet sensors fig 1 are novel in that they were designed to be compact rugged low cost and deployed in a manner that is independent of existing urban power and network infrastructure these requirements were implemented to allow the deployment of a hyperlocal city wide sensor network given that urban floods often occur in a distributed manner due to local variations in land development population density sewer design elevation and topology all information on the sensor design including build instructions quality control practices and data analysis pipelines is open source and provided in a github repository to allow interested parties to build and deploy their own sensors https github com floodnet nyc flood sensor the floodnet sensors use an industrial grade mb7389 maxbotix ultrasonic range finder to collect distance readings between the sensor and the horizontal surface being monitored as flood waters rise that distance decreases distance readings are collected by the sensors every minute and are transmitted over lorawan a long range wireless low power wide area network to internet connected data collection gateways which upload the readings for ingestion into a data analysis and quality control pipeline this pipeline converts distance to calibrated depth measurements with an accuracy of 1 0 cm and detects and filters out anomalous non flood data points e g vehicles garbage people or other items placed underneath the sensor that reduce the distance measurements thus allowing real time flood data visualization the accuracy of distance measurements made by sensors deployed on streets has been tested though 1 manual measurement of the distance between the sensor and ground level for all sensors at the time of deployment 2 manual measurement of the depth profile of select flood events and comparison with sensor readings and 3 deployment of two sensors over tidally influenced water bodies and comparison of measured diurnal water stage with tide gauge data collected by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration data not shown the sensors are battery powered with solar energy harvesting alleviating the need for existing power infrastructure the sensors are 6 7 cm 6 7 cm 10 0 cm including the housing and ultrasonic sensor with a per unit cost below 200 to date the floodnet project has deployed 28 sensors street sign poles in nyc following permission from nyc to do so we plan to expand the network over the next few years to include hundreds of sensors deployed across nyc s five boroughs 3 flood data uses cases real time hyper local data provided by flood sensors have the potential to transform flood related emergency management and resilience planning in urban areas given the resolution and precision of the data collected by the flood sensors there are many opportunities for city residents community organizations and city agencies to use the data at a variety of time horizons including before during and after a flood event the potential applications described below have emerged from frequent dialogues with stakeholders prior to flood events municipalities and communities can plan for potential floods with the help of hydrologic and hydraulic h h models that can predict stormwater and tidal flooding examples of h h and other modeling efforts in nyc are the nyc stormwater flood maps that were produced alongside the city s stormwater resiliency plan nyc mayor s office of resiliency 2021 the future 100 year and tidal flood maps displayed in the nyc coastal flood hazard mapper produced by the nyc department of city planning nyc department of city planning 2017 and the stevens institute flood advisory system georgas et al 2016 goals of these model outputs include communicating flood risks to community members and identifying key areas for flood mitigation interventions such as signage on flood prone roadways and informing placement of gray and green infrastructure interventions nyc extreme weather task force 2021 an outstanding challenge is validating flood models rosenzweig et al 2021 hjelmstad et al 2021 due in part to the large areal extent of urban areas and number of distinct locations expected to flood quantitative data from a network of low cost flood sensors can be used to help validate and iterate models that predict flood occurrence and depth as a function of rainfall intensity and tide level a benefit of sensors that collect flood depth data at a frequency on the order of minutes is that the sensors can provide detailed flood profiles as opposed to single flood occurrence or depth measurements which can aid hydrologic modeling examples of flood profiles measured by the floodnet sensors are illustrated by data captured by the sensors deployed in gowanus brooklyn during tropical storm henri on august 21 2021 fig 2 a c tropical storm henri produced a record amount of rain in nyc and resulted in flooding in many nyc neighborhoods during the storm the floodnet sensors in gowanus collected a detailed data set illustrating the flood profile including two distinct flood events on the same night separated by an hour where the water receded this detail would likely not have been captured from community reports alone additionally the sensors captured information on the severity of the storm events at two locations in gowanus for example the sensor data demonstrated that flood waters reached depths greater than 20 inches 50 8 cm above street level and that flood waters rose at a fast rate a subsequent flood caused by hurricane ida two weeks later september 1 2021 was even more severe with flood waters at one location rising 36 inches 91 4 cm in the course of only 15 min data not shown creating serious hazards to public safety flood sensors can record floods from many flood typologies i e not only floods caused by stormwater runoff but also those that are the result of overflowing water bodies storm surge infrastructure failures e g water main breaks or overburdened drainage systems and coastal flooding due to high tides and rising sea levels an example of the latter is illustrated by data from flood sensors deployed in hamilton beach queens which is one of many coastal nyc neighborhoods that experience flooding on a regular basis due to high tides street level flooding recorded during the king tide that occurred in october 2021 fig 2d e illustrates one of the numerous flood events caused by higher high tides during the new or full moon additionally the importance of hyperlocal data collection is illustrated by flood data collected at multiple locations in the same neighborhoods fig 2 despite being exposed to similar conditions e g precipitation or high tide event each location was observed to have a distinct flood profile including depth sensitivity to rain or tide patterns rate of onset and rate of drainage during flood events flood sensors can benefit communities and city agencies by providing flood data and alerts in real time floodnet sensors for example send alerts to individuals that opt into the system when floodwaters reach a depth of 3 inches i e in advance of a 4 inch depth that is considered nuisance flooding where mobility is expected to be restricted and can be programmed to send alerts at other flood depths if desired individuals receiving alerts can include city agency personnel community members or researchers for city agencies flood alerts can be used to trigger emergency response activities in a targeted and local manner inform road closures and reopenings on flooded roadways and activate on site warning systems like flashing lights or audio alerts to inform people about hazardous water depths in low lying areas as an example during tropical storm henri the floodnet sensors in gowanus sent alerts about rising waters approximately 30 min before flood waters reached their peak depths fig 2 for community members real time flood alerts can warn residents of rising flood waters ideally far enough in advance to protect themselves and property real time flood data can also aid researchers such as those interested in collecting flood water samples or making observations during flood events for example members of our team are interested in the impact of flood water contaminants on urban environmental quality we have used flood sensor data on the presence of floodwaters to indicate when to visit our field sites to collect samples and when to commence sampling campaigns to investigate the fate of floodwater contaminants deposited on sidewalks with time after a flood event after flood events sensor data can be used by recovery teams to identify areas that most urgently need post flood assistance for example data could be used by municipal and non governmental organizations that provide immediate aid with food and shelter to residents displaced by flood water assistance with flooded infrastructure and outreach for longer term recovery measures such as logistical or financial aid to residents and businesses with flood damage data collected during flood events can also be used by teams and agencies such as the national weather service tasked with cataloging storm impacts and establishing flood thresholds in addition to alerting agencies to the times and locations of floods sensor data on flood depth for example can be paired with topographical data e g lidar data to estimate the horizontal extent of flood water to evaluate impacted areas not directly adjacent to the sensor flood sensor data also have utility in long term resilience planning to mitigate the impacts of flood water community organizations and local government representatives can use flood data reports as evidence when advocating for flood related efforts in their neighborhoods this is currently done qualitatively by users of the community flood watch project and could be enhanced by including systematically collected quantitative data flood location profile and frequency data can be used by city agencies to inform drainage infrastructure investments and flood resilience and adaptation projects in addition the impacts of gray and green infrastructure installations for stormwater management specifically reductions in flood extent and frequency can be monitored quantitatively using flood sensors given the potential value of flood sensor data for communities and the limitation that sensor networks are unlikely to have the coverage density needed to monitor every flood prone street in a city it is critical that sensor deployment locations are chosen carefully and with attention towards equity which may have different meanings for different projects and contexts in nyc for example we determine sensor deployment locations in consultation

described herein should be carried out in a manner that recognizes that floods can occur in locations not monitored by a flood sensor this is crucial for ensuring that communities that lack flood

15838,flooding is expected to increase due to intensification of extreme precipitation events sea level rise and urbanization low cost water level sensors have the ability to fill a critical data gap on the presence depth and duration of street level floods by measuring flood profiles i e flood stage hydrographs in real time with a time interval on the order of minutes hyperlocal flood data collected by low cost sensors have many use cases for a variety of stakeholders including municipal agencies community members and researchers here we outline examples of potential uses of flood sensor data before during and after flood events based on dialog with stakeholders in new york city these uses include inputs to predictive flood models generation of real time flood alerts for community members and emergency response teams storm recovery assistance and cataloging of storm impacts and informing infrastructure design and investment for long term flood resilience project planning graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction flooding is one of the most dangerous and costly natural hazards and has a large impact on infrastructure mobility and public health and safety nasem 2019 university of maryland 2018 floods can occur due to storm surges higher high tides e g spring tides and king tides disruptions to drainage infrastructure or high intensity precipitation and are expected to occur more frequently in many regions due to climate change effects such as sea level rise and increased occurrence of extreme precipitation events farris et al 2021 kunkel et al 2020 lenderink and van meijgaard 2010 sillman et al 2013 and increased urbanization zhang et al 2018 despite the disruptive impacts of flooding and the existence of models that estimate risk of flood occurrence there has been very little quantitative data available on the actual occurrence frequency and extent of flooding in urban areas in new york city nyc for example street level flood data have previously only been available through community sourced reports such as those made to nyc s 311 service request portal social media posts and reports to the community flood watch project which is a collaboration between the city of new york new york sea grant and the science and resilience institute at jamaica bay and involves a network of residents who report local flooding and share flood related photos stories and experiences campbell et al 2021 while community reported flood data are an important source of information for understanding flood impacts some limitations of these data include the need for an individual to witness and report a flood for the event to be recorded smith and rodriguez 2017 a lack of representativeness of 311 data given that some communities including low income or minority residents have been found to be less likely to report street condition issues kontokosta and hong 2021 and often a lack of quantitative data on the water depth profile and geographic extent during the duration of the flood event helmrich et al 2021 to give one example more flood reports were made to nyc s 311 service request portal from 2004 2015 during midday when people are more likely to be out of their homes than at night smith and rodriguez 2017 given limited quantitative data available on urban flooding our team has been designing building and deploying low cost ultrasonic sensors to systematically collect data on the presence depth and duration of street level floods our project called floodnet is a partnership between academic researchers at new york university and the city university of new york and nyc municipal agencies nyc mayor s office of climate environmental justice and mayor s office of the chief technology officer working in consultation with community organizations in this perspective we highlight the use of low cost sensors to collect quantitative flood data and provide concrete examples of potential data uses with nyc as a case study while our efforts are currently focused on nyc the low cost sensors presented herein were designed for universal use and could be of similar utility in other contexts 2 flood sensors water level sensors available for flood detection include ultrasonic e g mousa et al 2016 loftis et al 2018 pressure e g garcia et al 2015 radar lidar e g loftis et al

floodnet project has been focused on the design construction and deployment of ultrasonic flood sensors in nyc to record floods caused by stormwater and high tide events the floodnet sensors fig 1 are novel in that they were designed to be compact rugged low cost and deployed in a manner that is independent of existing urban power and network infrastructure these requirements were implemented to allow the deployment of a hyperlocal city wide sensor network given that urban floods often occur in a distributed manner due to local variations in land development population density sewer design elevation and topology all information on the sensor design including build instructions quality control practices and data analysis pipelines is open source and provided in a github repository to allow interested parties to build and deploy their own sensors https github com floodnet nyc flood sensor the floodnet sensors use an industrial grade mb7389 maxbotix ultrasonic range finder to collect distance readings between the sensor and the horizontal surface being monitored as flood waters rise that distance decreases distance readings are collected by the sensors every minute and are transmitted over lorawan a long range wireless low power wide area network to internet connected data collection gateways which upload the readings for ingestion into a data analysis and quality control pipeline this pipeline converts distance to calibrated depth measurements with an accuracy of 1 0 cm and detects and filters out anomalous non flood data points e g vehicles garbage people or other items placed underneath the sensor that reduce the distance measurements thus allowing real time flood data visualization the accuracy of distance measurements made by sensors deployed on streets has been tested though 1 manual measurement of the distance between the sensor and ground level for all sensors at the time of deployment 2 manual measurement of the depth profile of select flood events and comparison with sensor readings and 3 deployment of two sensors over tidally influenced water bodies and comparison of measured diurnal water stage with tide gauge data collected by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration data not shown the sensors are battery powered with solar energy harvesting alleviating the need for existing power infrastructure the sensors are 6 7 cm 6 7 cm 10 0 cm including the housing and ultrasonic sensor with a per unit cost below 200 to date the floodnet project has deployed 28 sensors street sign poles in nyc following permission from nyc to do so we plan to expand the network over the next few years to include hundreds of sensors deployed across nyc s five boroughs 3 flood data uses cases real time hyper local data provided by flood sensors have the potential to transform flood related emergency management and resilience planning in urban areas given the resolution and precision of the data collected by the flood sensors there are many opportunities for city residents community organizations and city agencies to use the data at a variety of time horizons including before during and after a flood event the potential applications described below have emerged from frequent dialogues with stakeholders prior to flood events municipalities and communities can plan for potential floods with the help of hydrologic and hydraulic h h models that can predict stormwater and tidal flooding examples of h h and other modeling efforts in nyc are the nyc stormwater flood maps that were produced alongside the city s stormwater resiliency plan nyc mayor s office of resiliency 2021 the future 100 year and tidal flood maps displayed in the nyc coastal flood hazard mapper produced by the nyc department of city planning nyc department of city planning 2017 and the stevens institute flood advisory system georgas et al 2016 goals of these model outputs include communicating flood risks to community members and identifying key areas for flood mitigation interventions such as signage on flood prone roadways and informing placement of gray and green infrastructure interventions nyc extreme weather task force 2021 an outstanding challenge is validating flood models rosenzweig et al 2021 hjelmstad et al 2021 due in part to the large areal extent of urban areas and number of distinct locations expected to flood quantitative data from a network of low cost flood sensors can be used to help validate and iterate models that predict flood occurrence and depth as a function of rainfall intensity and tide level a benefit of sensors that collect flood depth data at a frequency on the order of minutes is that the sensors can provide detailed flood profiles as opposed to single flood occurrence or depth measurements which can aid hydrologic modeling examples of flood profiles measured by the floodnet sensors are illustrated by data captured by the sensors deployed in gowanus brooklyn during tropical storm henri on august 21 2021 fig 2 a c tropical storm henri produced a record amount of rain in nyc and resulted in flooding in many nyc neighborhoods during the storm the floodnet sensors in gowanus collected a detailed data set illustrating the flood profile including two distinct flood events on the same night separated by an hour where the water receded this detail would likely not have been captured from community reports alone additionally the sensors captured information on the severity of the storm events at two locations in gowanus for example the sensor data demonstrated that flood waters reached depths greater than 20 inches 50 8 cm above street level and that flood waters rose at a fast rate a subsequent flood caused by hurricane ida two weeks later september 1 2021 was even more severe with flood waters at one location rising 36 inches 91 4 cm in the course of only 15 min data not shown creating serious hazards to public safety flood sensors can record floods from many flood typologies i e not only floods caused by stormwater runoff but also those that are the result of overflowing water bodies storm surge infrastructure failures e g water main breaks or overburdened drainage systems and coastal flooding due to high tides and rising sea levels an example of the latter is illustrated by data from flood sensors deployed in hamilton beach queens which is one of many coastal nyc neighborhoods that experience flooding on a regular basis due to high tides street level flooding recorded during the king tide that occurred in october 2021 fig 2d e illustrates one of the numerous flood events caused by higher high tides during the new or full moon additionally the importance of hyperlocal data collection is illustrated by flood data collected at multiple locations in the same neighborhoods fig 2 despite being exposed to similar conditions e g precipitation or high tide event each location was observed to have a distinct flood profile including depth sensitivity to rain or tide patterns rate of onset and rate of drainage during flood events flood sensors can benefit communities and city agencies by providing flood data and alerts in real time floodnet sensors for example send alerts to individuals that opt into the system when floodwaters reach a depth of 3 inches i e in advance of a 4 inch depth that is considered nuisance flooding where mobility is expected to be restricted and can be programmed to send alerts at other flood depths if desired individuals receiving alerts can include city agency personnel community members or researchers for city agencies flood alerts can be used to trigger emergency response activities in a targeted and local manner inform road closures and reopenings on flooded roadways and activate on site warning systems like flashing lights or audio alerts to inform people about hazardous water depths in low lying areas as an example during tropical storm henri the floodnet sensors in gowanus sent alerts about rising waters approximately 30 min before flood waters reached their peak depths fig 2 for community members real time flood alerts can warn residents of rising flood waters ideally far enough in advance to protect themselves and property real time flood data can also aid researchers such as those interested in collecting flood water samples or making observations during flood events for example members of our team are interested in the impact of flood water contaminants on urban environmental quality we have used flood sensor data on the presence of floodwaters to indicate when to visit our field sites to collect samples and when to commence sampling campaigns to investigate the fate of floodwater contaminants deposited on sidewalks with time after a flood event after flood events sensor data can be used by recovery teams to identify areas that most urgently need post flood assistance for example data could be used by municipal and non governmental organizations that provide immediate aid with food and shelter to residents displaced by flood water assistance with flooded infrastructure and outreach for longer term recovery measures such as logistical or financial aid to residents and businesses with flood damage data collected during flood events can also be used by teams and agencies such as the national weather service tasked with cataloging storm impacts and establishing flood thresholds in addition to alerting agencies to the times and locations of floods sensor data on flood depth for example can be paired with topographical data e g lidar data to estimate the horizontal extent of flood water to evaluate impacted areas not directly adjacent to the sensor flood sensor data also have utility in long term resilience planning to mitigate the impacts of flood water community organizations and local government representatives can use flood data reports as evidence when advocating for flood related efforts in their neighborhoods this is currently done qualitatively by users of the community flood watch project and could be enhanced by including systematically collected quantitative data flood location profile and frequency data can be used by city agencies to inform drainage infrastructure investments and flood resilience and adaptation projects in addition the impacts of gray and green infrastructure installations for stormwater management specifically reductions in flood extent and frequency can be monitored quantitatively using flood sensors given the potential value of flood sensor data for communities and the limitation that sensor networks are unlikely to have the coverage density needed to monitor every flood prone street in a city it is critical that sensor deployment locations are chosen carefully and with attention towards equity which may have different meanings for different projects and contexts in nyc for example we determine sensor deployment locations in consultation with government and community partners using criteria that include estimated risks of flood hazard and impact social vulnerability and spatial coverage additionally data interpretation and uses described herein should be carried out in a manner that recognizes that floods can occur in locations not monitored by a flood sensor this is crucial for ensuring that communities that lack flood

15839,seawater is a cost effective and abundant electrolyte used as an electrode rinse solution to enable optimum utilization of reverse electrodialysis red however it is associated with several limitations including the use of precious electrode materials and its long term stability must be addressed prior to its application in the field of seawater technology in this context a novel red based on carbon electrodes was designed and the experimental conditions were optimized for maximizing the harvesting of energy with aquaculture wastewater disinfection and recycling the power obtained by red with a current density of 30 a m2 and a flow rate of 424 ml min designed by response surface methodology was in good agreement with the predicted maximum power density 0 64 w m2 the treatment was sustainable mainly due to an anodic reaction of electro generated sodium hypochlorite naocl under natural conditions which afforded a high disinfection efficiency above 99 5 0 2 within 1 min under continuous flow ph 8 even under real seawater conditions and in aquaculture wastewater simultaneously a stable power of 0 1 0 03 w 0 25 0 07 w m2 generated a reasonable specific energy within 0 02 kwh

electrolyte with high performance and accessibility owing to its high conductivity and abundance could enable the optimum utilization of red ortiz imedio et al 2019 post et al 2008 however several limitations such as long term stability for recycling seawater as well as the presence of organic and inorganic foulants need to be addressed prior to practical applications of seawater technology chon et al 2020 choudhury et al 2018 mossad and zou 2013 fouling in red a major concern in seawater based electrochemical systems is mainly caused by complex organic and inorganic scaling on the cathode surface which significantly influences system performance by decreasing the catalytic activity and charge transport jwa et al 2020 tong et al 2020 scaling is mainly caused by drastic alkalization in the presence of multivalent ions mg2 and ca2 during cathodic reactions hasson et al 1998 2010 this phenomenon is more prominent in large scale systems that employ natural seawater nam et al 2019 therefore the electrode solutions used for this process are still limited to artificial chemicals owing to their electrochemical activity without the fouling issues in scaled up red processes in 2016 tedesco et al assessed a 1 kw pilot scale red as a first step to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing brine and brackish waters tedesco et al 2016 later they scaled it up to 500

artificial chemical salts as electrode rinse solutions erss such as fe based nacl or na2so4 are preferred for high power production however their long term stability and discharge could be major hindrances to commercialization due to economic and environmental problems self sustainable technology with chemical free operation and maintenance could overcome these limitations and be an efficient alternative for eco friendly commercialization of red in this study natural seawater was used as a clean ers in red for sustainable energy harvesting and on site disinfection the electricity

with red the continuous red was utilized for the generation of power and free cl2 using natural seawater and optimal operating conditions based on the predicted optimal operating conditions step i under the constant current mode acid plasma cc was compared to nano pt coated on carbon blacks over cc as a control 20 wt pt c cc for short term stability as shown in fig 3 a both catalysts exhibited power density in the range of of 0 64 0 72 w m2 and 20 wt pt c cc exhibited high power and free cl2 dpd this is in agreement value with the predicted by rsm even with natural seawater as shown in table 1 power density at the two catalysts was well maintained during the initial operation but the performance of 20 wt pt c cc significantly degraded after 10 h with a lower production of free cl2 than acid plasma cc the free cl2 generated on site during the red process accumulated up to 60 7 and 80 8 ppm in the 20 wt pt c cc and acid plasma cc fig 3b respectively which could be attributed to inorganic scaling over the cathode surface mainly caused by the mg2 1200 mg l in natural seawater the inorganic scaling was mainly confirmed as mg oh 2 and caco3 by x ray diffraction xrd they partially covered the 20 wt pt c cc and increased the resistance of the interface between the catalyst surface and electrolytes fig 3c degrading the electrochemical performance consequently the production of free cl2 in 20 wt pt c cc decreased on reducing the power density due to inorganic scaling figs 3a and 3b however at the acid plasma cc a clean catalyst surface fig 3d was observed during operation for 20 h and the power density was maintained suppressed inorganic scaling was induced by the acidic surface of the catalyst and the reinforcement of the o rich functional groups that resist inorganic scaling by o2 n2 plasma treatment the detailed mechanisms over functionalized cathodes are included in another article that has been submitted for publication despite the power variation these two catalysts exhibited low pressures in the hc 0 25 bar and lc 0 5 bar feed streams with no significant increment in the red stack pressure unlike conventional bulk pt ti mesh cathodes 3 3 long term operation of red and seawater recirculation under natural condition natural seawater collected in gujwa eup jeju and tap water exhibited electrical conductivities of 47 3 and 0

free cl2 generated on site in the anodic and was recirculated to the cathode chamber and hc feed stream inducing daily on site disinfection step ii an average power generation of 0 1 0 03 w was observed and pressure in the hc feed stream was maintained in the range of approximately 0 8 1 1 bar for the long term operation of 680 h a maximum power density of 0 36 w m2 was exhibited at a current density of 16 a m2 the use of natural seawater as opposed to artificial nacl reduced the power density to 56 with a variation in ocv from 7 2 to 4 5 v mainly due to an increase in stack resistance by the coexisting multivalent ions with foulants accumulating in the inter spacing of the 100 µm thick spacers and ion exchange membranes avci et al 2018 nevertheless an ex situ observation of the electrode compartment fig 4b confirmed only spare inorganic scaling over 600 h and the electrode surfaces remained clean throughout the operation seawater was almost perfectly disinfected by the long term operation with high removal efficiencies 99 5 0 02 the disinfected seawater was recycled to the hc stream for increasing power harvesting and efficiency using the limited seawater resource step iii five cycles of experiments were evaluated during the 490 550 h period the recycled seawater exhibited a stable neutral ph of 8 0 01 the concentration of free cl2 dpd increased up to 400 μg l within 40 h but did not increase further fig 5 right axis the power and efficiency were also investigated during the five cycles as shown in fig 6 the power at each cycle gradually decreased from 0 11 to 0 05 w with an increase in seawater recirculation because the salinity gradient gradually decreased with recycling and the hc influent conductivity decreased from 46 41 ms cm at cycle 1 to 21 8 ms cm after cycle 5 table 2 however the accumulative power output was 0 4 w for five cycles with only 100 l hc solution compared to 0 5 w without recirculating hc solution the volume of hc solution 500 l therefore 3 9 times higher power could be achieved per used seawater volume with recirculating mode this method highlights the enhanced efficiency with reused seawater over the conventional non recirculating mode by reducing unused exergy leaving the stack hulme et al 2020 weiner et al 2015 net efficiencies were maintained above 3 2 4 with reasonable specific energy values within 0 02 kwh m3 during the recirculation table 2 summarizes the main characteristics of the hc inlet and outlet streams with and without disinfection the seawater was recycled for five cycles to monitor the water quality using on site free cl2 generation and recirculation interestingly the conductivity and total dissolved solids were reduced in the hc feed stream with an increase in the lc feed stream by interchanging the inoculation flow in particular bacteria were almost perfectly removed compared to without disinfection over five cycles and average reduction of 20 in total organic compounds toc was observed the characteristics of acid plasma cc were investigated to confirm the catalytic stability before and after the long term operation of 680 h in the raman spectrum of the general surface of the used cathode fig s5 the major characteristics of acid plasma cc were similar to those of typical pristine carbon including the main g band at 1590 cm 1 a characteristic of graphitic materials the d band at 1350 cm 1 indicating a disordered graphitic lattice and second order peaks at 2710 cm 1 2d ferrari 2007 jeong et al 2017 the intensity ratio of the d and g bands i e the id ig ratio enables an estimation of the degree of carbon deformation in this study a similar ratio before fig s5a and after fig s5b long term operation for 680 h indicated that the original disordered and amorphous structure of the electrode was maintained after long term operation maslova et al 2012 pawlyta et al 2015 schwan et al 1996 therefore the crystallinity of carbon was negligibly affected and damage was observed in the binder nafion by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy data not shown necessitating an improvement in the durability of the acid plasma cc cathode inorganic scaling was confirmed over the partially scaled surface precipitating mg oh 2 brucite mgco3 magnesite and caco3 aragonite with very weak growth as confirmed by xrd fig s6c the porous carbon structure induced porous surface scaling figs s6a and b enabling sufficient exposure of the open structure to the electrolyte facilitating sustainability even with partial scale precipitation the mechanisms of inorganic scaling are closely related to carbon surface chemistry and they could be investigated further in future studies 3 4 ex situ disinfection of aww using red effluent the on site free cl2 produced from red could be extremely useful as an oxidant for ex situ environmental remediation fig 7 shows the effect of the red effluent obtained from step iii when it mixes with aww taken from the domestic flatfish aquaculture plant fig 7a step iv including the effect of free cl2 on aww treatment the aww was treated with rapid disinfection over a dosing ratio red effluent aww of 0 05 and perfectly treated over a dosing ratio of 0 2 while using 2 mg l of free cl2 dpd in the red effluents thus red could be used not only for on site disinfection but also for ex situ seawater based wastewater treatment initial toc and tn in aww were 2 420 and 0 53 mg l respectively and it was not greatly varied after ex situ disinfection tp was below detection limits in previous studies on environmental remediation using red ti ni and carbon based electrodes have been used as non precious cathodes as listed in table 3 jwa et al 2022 ma et al 2020 scialdone et al 2014 2015 shiming et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 zhou et al 2018 for the electrochemical chlorination without red the power consumed for chlorine generation is more than 0 84 mw with a faradaic efficiency of 92 pinto et al 2021 however red demonstrates high removal efficiency with simultaneous power generation table 3 shows the results of red application for environmental remediation using electrode chambers power was obtained simultaneously during environmental remediation using red and the maximum power density 0 36 w m2 obtained in this study despite the use of natural seawater was comparable to the previous results 0 06 0 48 w m2 although those previous studies all used synthetic saline water in the stack natural water was used in both red stack and electrode chambers in this study additionally power produced was maintained during 680 h with natural seawater while long term stability has not been investigated previously in terms of power production herein newly modified chambered red stacks and the operational conditions were optimized to achieve maximum power production and disinfection efficiency resulting in sustained long term power production and more than 99 removal efficiency for expanding the application of carbon in the literature carbon based electrodes have been used for h2o2 production under an o2 supply to cathode compartment for the effective removal of dyes in wastewater scialdone et al 2015 shiming et al 2020 and the disinfection of aww jwa et al 2022 in this study the surface modified carbon electrode acid plasma cc with reinforced anti scaling properties was applied to natural seawater anti scaling acid plasma cc exhibited higher generation of h2o2 faradaic efficiency of 64 than that with pristine carbon blacks faradaic efficiency of 45 at adjusted cathodic potentials below 0 9 v vs ag agcl under the batch ers flow however in practical applications a fast seawater recirculation rate 424 ml min consumes h2o2 by hclo according to the following reaction 10 significantly reducing residual h2o2 in the red effluent shiming et al 2020 10 h 2 o 2 h c l o h 2 o o 2 h c l therefore the disinfection of aww was induced by on site free cl2 and the amounts of free cl2 were effectively managed by red operational conditions ers flow mode current or flow rate when equipped with an acid plasma cc electrode 4 conclusions in this study we investigated the electrochemical disinfection of aww via red 100 cell pairs equipped with an acid plasma cc at the optimized current 30 a m2 and flow rate 424 ml min seawater was on site disinfected in electrode solution and the recirculation mode almost completely disinfected seawater by the on site production of hocl and ocl under the continuous flow mode seawater could be effectively disinfected and used with an average power production of 0 1 0 03 w 0 25 0 07 w m2 in 680 h indicating the anti scaling properties of carbon based catalysts additionally integration of seawater disinfection and hc recirculating increased the energy harvesting up to 3 9 times with a stable efficiency of 3 8 0 3 a red effluent containing free cl2 2 mg l exhibited almost complete disinfection when mixed with aww

15839,seawater is a cost effective and abundant electrolyte used as an electrode rinse solution to enable optimum utilization of reverse electrodialysis red however it is associated with several limitations including the use of precious electrode materials and its long term stability must be addressed prior to its application in the field of seawater technology in this context a novel red based on carbon electrodes was designed and the experimental conditions were optimized for maximizing the harvesting of energy with aquaculture wastewater disinfection and recycling the power obtained by red with a current density of 30 a m2 and a flow rate of 424 ml min designed by response surface methodology was in good agreement with the predicted maximum power density 0 64 w m2 the treatment was sustainable mainly due to an anodic reaction of electro generated sodium hypochlorite naocl under natural conditions which afforded a high disinfection efficiency above 99 5 0 2 within 1 min under continuous flow ph 8 even under real seawater conditions and in aquaculture wastewater simultaneously a stable power of 0 1 0 03 w 0 25 0 07 w m2 generated a reasonable specific energy within 0 02 kwh m3 inorganic fouling was efficiently suppressed using a surface modified carbon cathode for 680 h thus the on site seawater disinfection by red described herein is practically feasible and could offer

electrolyte with high performance and accessibility owing to its high conductivity and abundance could enable the optimum utilization of red ortiz imedio et al 2019 post et al 2008 however several limitations such as long term stability for recycling seawater as well as the presence of organic and inorganic foulants need to be addressed prior to practical applications of seawater technology chon et al 2020 choudhury et al 2018 mossad and zou 2013 fouling in red a major concern in seawater based electrochemical systems is mainly caused by complex organic and inorganic scaling on the cathode surface which significantly influences system performance by decreasing the catalytic activity and charge transport jwa et al 2020 tong et al 2020 scaling is mainly caused by drastic alkalization in the presence of multivalent ions mg2 and ca2 during cathodic reactions hasson et al 1998 2010 this phenomenon is more prominent in large scale systems that employ natural seawater nam et al 2019 therefore the electrode solutions used for this process are still limited to artificial chemicals owing to their electrochemical activity without the fouling issues in scaled up red

cell pairs thus doubling the energy efficiency tedesco et al 2017 yasukawa et al 2020 tested a bench scale red using ro brine and treated sewage these commercial scaled up red processes using artificial chemical salts as electrode rinse solutions erss such as fe based nacl or na2so4 are preferred for high power production however their long term stability and discharge could be major hindrances to commercialization due to economic and environmental problems self sustainable technology with chemical free operation and maintenance could overcome these limitations and be an efficient alternative for eco friendly commercialization of red in this study natural seawater was used as a clean ers in red for sustainable energy harvesting and on site disinfection the electricity

variables 3d response surface plots were constructed using two operating parameters current density and flow rate maintaining the time another operating parameter at the zero code level as shown in fig 2 a the power density was maximized at net zero level of current density and gradually increased with an increase in flow rate free cl2 increased with an increase in current density under a low flow rate fig 2b at all ranges of current the ph was neutralized when the flow rate exceeded 300 ml min fig s4 and the disinfection efficiency was 99 5 0 2 the ridge minima and canonical analyses determined the optimum operating conditions for the red process based on these analyses a current density flow rate and treatment time of 30 a m2 424 ml min and 6 7 min respectively enabled maximum power generation with a high disinfection rate ph 8 free cl2 dpd of 38 mg l as summarized in table 1 3 2 red performance and free cl2 generation over modified carbon cathodes in the 100 cells paired with red the continuous red was utilized for the generation of power and free cl2 using natural seawater and optimal operating conditions based on the predicted optimal operating conditions step i under the constant current mode acid plasma cc was compared to nano pt coated on carbon blacks over cc as a control 20 wt pt c cc for short term stability as shown in fig 3 a both catalysts exhibited power density in the range of of 0 64 0 72 w m2 and 20 wt pt c cc exhibited high power and free cl2 dpd this is in agreement value with the predicted by rsm even with natural seawater as shown in table 1 power density at the two catalysts was well maintained during the initial operation but the performance of 20 wt pt c cc significantly degraded after 10 h with a lower production of free cl2 than acid plasma cc the free cl2 generated on site during the red process accumulated up to 60 7 and 80 8 ppm in the 20 wt pt c cc and acid plasma cc fig 3b respectively which could be attributed to inorganic scaling over the cathode surface mainly caused by the mg2 1200 mg l in natural seawater the inorganic scaling was mainly confirmed as mg oh 2 and caco3 by x ray diffraction xrd they partially covered the 20 wt pt c cc and increased the resistance of the interface between the catalyst surface and electrolytes fig 3c degrading the electrochemical performance consequently the production of free cl2 in 20 wt pt c cc decreased on reducing the power density due to inorganic scaling figs 3a and 3b however at the acid plasma cc a clean catalyst surface fig 3d was observed during operation for 20 h and the power density was maintained suppressed inorganic scaling was induced by the acidic surface of the catalyst and the reinforcement of the o rich functional groups that resist inorganic scaling by o2 n2 plasma treatment the detailed mechanisms over functionalized cathodes are included in another article that has been submitted for publication despite the power variation these two catalysts exhibited low pressures in the hc 0 25 bar and lc 0 5 bar feed streams with no significant increment in the red stack pressure unlike conventional bulk pt ti mesh cathodes 3 3 long term operation of red and seawater recirculation under natural condition natural seawater collected in gujwa eup jeju and tap water exhibited electrical conductivities of 47 3 and 0 2 0 05 ms cm respectively although their salinity is similar to that of artificial nacl the diversity and content of multivalent ions is higher with 1200 mg l mg2 and 420 mg l ca2 tedesco et al 2016 2017 yasukawa et al 2020 fig 4 a illustrates the power and pressure in the hc feed stream for the long term operation 680 h of the red 100 cell pairs seawater was initially supplied as an ers and the free cl2 generated on site in the anodic and was recirculated to the cathode chamber and hc feed stream inducing daily on site disinfection step ii an average power generation of 0 1 0 03 w was observed and pressure in the hc feed stream was maintained in the range of approximately 0 8 1 1 bar for the long term operation of 680 h a maximum power density of 0 36 w m2 was exhibited at a current density of 16 a m2 the use of natural seawater as opposed to artificial nacl reduced the power density to 56 with a variation in ocv from 7 2 to 4 5 v mainly due to an increase in stack resistance by the coexisting multivalent ions with foulants accumulating in the inter spacing of the 100 µm thick spacers and ion exchange membranes avci et al 2018 nevertheless an ex situ observation of the electrode compartment fig 4b confirmed only spare inorganic scaling over 600 h and the electrode surfaces remained clean throughout the operation seawater was almost perfectly disinfected by the long term operation with high removal efficiencies 99 5 0 02 the disinfected seawater was recycled to the hc stream for increasing power harvesting and efficiency using the limited seawater resource step iii five cycles of experiments were evaluated during the 490 550 h period the recycled seawater exhibited a stable neutral ph of 8 0 01 the concentration of free cl2 dpd increased up to 400 μg l within 40 h but did not increase further fig 5 right axis the power and efficiency were also investigated during the five cycles as shown in fig 6 the power at each cycle gradually decreased from 0 11 to 0 05 w with an increase in seawater recirculation because the salinity gradient gradually decreased with recycling and the hc influent conductivity decreased from 46 41 ms cm at cycle 1 to 21 8 ms cm after cycle 5 table 2 however the accumulative power output was 0 4 w for five cycles with only 100 l hc solution compared to 0 5 w without recirculating hc solution the volume of hc solution 500 l therefore 3 9 times higher power could be achieved per used seawater volume with recirculating mode this method highlights the enhanced efficiency with reused seawater over the conventional non recirculating mode by reducing unused exergy leaving the stack hulme et al 2020 weiner et al 2015 net efficiencies were maintained above 3 2 4 with reasonable specific energy values within 0 02 kwh m3 during the recirculation table 2 summarizes the main characteristics of the hc inlet and outlet streams with and without disinfection the seawater was recycled for five cycles to monitor the water quality using on site free cl2 generation and recirculation interestingly the conductivity and total dissolved solids were reduced in the hc feed stream with an increase in the lc feed stream by interchanging the inoculation flow in particular bacteria were almost perfectly removed compared to without disinfection over five cycles and average reduction of 20 in total organic compounds toc was observed the characteristics of acid plasma cc were investigated to confirm the catalytic stability before and after the long term operation of 680 h in the raman spectrum of the general surface of the used cathode fig s5 the major characteristics of acid plasma cc were similar to those of typical pristine carbon including the main g band at 1590 cm 1 a characteristic of

the id ig ratio enables an estimation of the degree of carbon deformation in this study a similar ratio before fig s5a and after fig s5b long term operation for 680 h indicated that the original disordered and amorphous structure of the electrode was maintained after long term operation maslova et al 2012 pawlyta et al 2015 schwan et al 1996 therefore the crystallinity of carbon was negligibly affected and damage was observed in the binder nafion by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy data not shown necessitating an improvement in the durability of the acid plasma cc cathode inorganic scaling was confirmed over the partially scaled surface precipitating mg oh 2 brucite mgco3 magnesite and caco3 aragonite with very weak growth as confirmed by xrd fig s6c the porous carbon structure induced porous surface scaling figs s6a and b enabling sufficient exposure of the open structure to the electrolyte facilitating sustainability even with partial scale precipitation the mechanisms of inorganic scaling are closely related to carbon surface chemistry and they could be investigated further in future studies 3 4 ex situ disinfection of aww using red effluent the on site free cl2 produced from red could be extremely useful as an oxidant for ex situ environmental remediation fig 7 shows the effect of the red effluent obtained from step iii when it mixes with aww taken

however red demonstrates high removal efficiency with simultaneous power generation table 3 shows the results of red application for environmental remediation using electrode chambers power was obtained simultaneously during environmental remediation using red and the maximum power density 0 36 w m2 obtained in this study despite the use of natural seawater was comparable to the previous

the operational conditions were optimized to achieve maximum power production and disinfection efficiency resulting in sustained long term power production and more than 99 removal efficiency for expanding the application of carbon in the literature carbon based electrodes have been used for h2o2 production under an o2 supply to cathode compartment for the effective removal of dyes in wastewater scialdone et al 2015 shiming et al 2020 and the disinfection of aww jwa et al 2022 in this study the surface modified carbon electrode acid plasma cc with reinforced anti scaling properties was applied to natural seawater anti scaling acid plasma cc exhibited higher generation of h2o2 faradaic efficiency of 64 than that with pristine carbon blacks faradaic efficiency of 45 at adjusted cathodic potentials below 0 9 v vs ag agcl under the batch ers flow however in practical applications a fast seawater recirculation rate 424 ml min consumes h2o2 by hclo according to the following reaction 10 significantly reducing residual h2o2 in the red effluent shiming et al 2020 10 h 2 o 2 h c l o h 2 o o 2 h c l therefore the disinfection of aww was induced by on site free cl2 and the amounts of free cl2 were effectively managed by red operational conditions ers flow mode current or flow rate when equipped with an acid plasma cc electrode 4 conclusions in this study we investigated the electrochemical disinfection of aww via red 100 cell pairs equipped with an acid plasma cc at the optimized current 30 a m2 and flow rate 424 ml min seawater was on site disinfected in electrode solution and the recirculation mode almost completely disinfected seawater by the on site production of hocl and ocl under the continuous flow mode seawater could be effectively disinfected and used with an average power production of 0 1 0 03 w 0 25 0 07 w m2 in 680 h indicating the anti scaling properties of carbon based catalysts additionally integration of seawater disinfection and hc recirculating increased the energy harvesting up to 3 9 times with a stable efficiency of 3 8 0 3 a red effluent containing free cl2 2 mg l exhibited almost complete disinfection when mixed with aww over 20 red effluent mixed with aww thus the red described here is an energy efficient and cost effective seawater based wastewater treatment process with immense potential for commercialization
