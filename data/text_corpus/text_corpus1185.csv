5925,the estimation of soil moisture content on the global scale is a key research issue in the field of remote sensing and to date a range of methods have been developed to achieve this the temperature vegetation t v technique which is perhaps one of the most common and successful suffers from being inaccurate in some cases especially when the daily t v scatter plots are not able to define the wet and dry edges in a reliable way a further challenge is the scale inconsistency between the results obtained on different days which is a serious concern when monitoring soil moisture changes over periods of time to address these restrictions this paper introduces a new soil moisture index called smisee driven by a new long term t v scatter plot that is established from data covering a 1 year period the normalized ndvi is set as the horizontal axis and three different temperature factors are suggested as the vertical axis in the proposed 1 year scatter plot from these three temperature factors the results proved that lstday taday 10 30 am is the most appropriate choice in contrast to most linear co distance indexes reported in the literature the proposed smisee is a novel non linear soil moisture index that defines the locus of co moisture points in the scatter plot as unequal distance curves to investigate the proposed method two different soil moisture observation networks with different climate and vegetation conditions namely smapvex12 in canada and remedhus in spain were applied the results demonstrated that the efficiency of the proposed 1 year scatter plot which was even applicable to and improved upon other indexes in the literature in addition smisee outperformed see itvdi and φas the most recent similar indexes achieving correlation coefficients of 0 65 and 0 74 for the smapvex12 and remedhus networks respectively these results appear to be promising especially for the vegetated area in the smapvex12 network keywords soil moisture content remote sensing temperature vegetation method soil evaporation efficiency see 1 introduction soil moisture content smc generally to the amount of water between soil particles leng et al 2014 there is a strong requirement for reliable and up to date knowledge about smc and its spatial distribution in many fields including agriculture water resource management meteorology and the prediction of flooding and droughts ahmed et al 2011 dutta et al 2015 younis and iqbal 2015 zhang and zhou 2016 there are two general approaches to the estimation of smc i field measurement techniques and ii remote sensing techniques the in situ technique is perhaps the most accurate however this is not feasible expensive and time consuming making its application impractical in vast regions at short time intervals verstraeten et al 2008 srivastava et al 2013 remote sensing can mitigate all of the disadvantages of field measurements recent advances in satellite imaging systems offer great promise as a means of estimating smc using better spatial and temporal resolutions and even at lower costs weidong et al 2002 wang and qu 2009 the underlying concept is that smc influences some soil properties such as its color albedo light absorbing bands brightness temperature and dielectric constant all of which are quantifiable using different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum nevertheless remote sensing is typically concerned with the surface soil moisture i e the water contained in the upper 10 cm of the soil surface due to the limited penetration of electromagnetic wavelengths ahmed et al 2011 amiri et al 2019 remote sensing techniques can be categorized as 1 optical visible and infrared 2 thermal and 3 microwave active or passive methods depending on which region of the electromagnetic spectrum is applied wang and qu 2009 active and passive microwave remote sensing measures the microwave energy in the wavelength range of 0 5 100 cm emitted passive or scattered active from the phenomena gao et al 2013 petropoulos et al 2015 the underlying concept is that the thermal emission and backscattering coefficient of soil which are convertible to the brightness temperature and soil moisture are quantifiable at the mw frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum by passive and active sensors respectively djamai et al 2015 o neill et al 2015 to date a variety of space based active and passive mw satellites or sensors e g sentinel 1 the advanced scatterometer ascat the advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system amsr e the advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr2 have been developed european space agency esa s soil moisture ocean salinity smos and nasa s soil moisture active passive smap are the newest remote sensing missions devoted to mapping smc every 2 3 days at 40 km resolution using an l band interferometric radiometer at 1 4 ghz al yaari et al 2014 kerr et al 2016 there is a rapidly growing literature on the validation of the space borne mw soil moisture products using other remote sensing datasets in situ measurements and airborne based observations which shows the high potential of those products for smc retrieval jackson et al 2010 parinussa et al 2011 dente et al 2012 jackson et al 2012 louvet et al 2015 chan et al 2016 macelloni et al 2016 rodríguez fernández et al 2017 chen et al 2018 el hajj et al 2018 however inherently coarse resolution several tens of kilometers of passive microwave data and also low accuracy of the existing models in retrieving smc information from radar data due to the effects of vegetation and roughness on the backscattering coefficient diminishes their applicability in many studies piles et al 2011 djamai et al 2016 tagesson et al 2018 more information on microwave remote sensing for smc estimation models can be found in woodhouse 2017 in addition to the passive mw remote sensing the thermal and optical domains of electromagnetic spectrum have been established as the other promising instruments to estimate smc holzman et al 2014 petropoulos et al 2015 in optical remote sensing surface reflectance which is typically confined to the 0 4 2 5 μm wavelength is measured and analyzed weidong et al 2002 wang and qu 2009 investigations have shown that the reflectance of the visible domain decreases as the smc increases ishida et al 1991 there is ample literature on how to improve smc estimation models in optical remote sensing suggesting a variety of techniques such as applying different bands in different humidity conditions asner 1998 maki et al 2004 younis and iqbal 2015 determining the most appropriate absorption bands jackson et al 1983 whiting et al 2004 individual modeling for different soil types idso et al 1976 dalal and henry 1986 and providing linear and nonlinear models of soil moisture and visible domain reflectance bowers and smith 1972 weidong et al 2002 gao et al 2013 the large number of studies conducted using optical remote sensing implies that the visible and the near infrared nir portions of the spectrum are promising for smc estimation however some challenges remain the most serious of which are the disruptive effects of vegetation cover various minerals and their effect on soil reflectance and also cloud contamination wang et al 2006 petropoulos et al 2009 thermal remote sensing which typically employs the 3 5 14 μm wavelength in the spectrum region can quantify soil thermal inertia evaporation transpiration land surface temperature and soil evaporation efficiency all of which are influenced by smc bastiaanssen 2000 liu et al 2002 verstraeten et al 2006 to date various linear or non linear models have been used to express the relationship between smc and those measures carried out in the thermal domain tramutoli et al 2000 wang et al 2006 thermal techniques are generally grounded in explicit physical interpretations that make them simple and easy to use nevertheless these models are usually premised on the assumption of bare soil conditions and they degrade rapidly in areas with dense vegetation cover wang et al 2004 maltese et al 2013 methods that co exploit thermal and optical remote sensing data with the aim of diminishing the constraints of each in the estimation of smc are known as temperature vegetation methods wang and qu 2009 vani et al 2019 the intuitive idea behind temperature vegetation methods is that the land surface temperature is affected by both smc and vegetation cover carlson et al 1995 goward et al 2002 basically the dry soil temperature is higher than its surrounding air temperature this difference however diminishes with an increase in vegetation cover density which is itself the consequence of vegetation transpiration this causes a negative relationship between surface temperature t and vegetation v which is best realized in t v scatter plots nemani et al 1993 gillies et al 1997 wang et al 2007 each pixel of the image with a specific temperature and vegetation factor appears as a point in the t v scatter plot in conditions of invariant air temperature the rate of the negative relationship between t and v in a t v scatter plot depends on the smc in fact this inverse relationship is weaker for wet soils which is itself the consequence of soil evaporation as a result a triangular or trapezoidal shape is expected for a t v scatter plot provided that the pixels of the study area have a variety of vegetation transpiration and soil evaporation each of which is a function of smc yang et al 2015 zhang and zhou 2016 accordingly assuming that all other parameters are equal the position of a pixel in a t v scatter plot depends on its soil moisture condition t v scatter plot methods sometimes called triangular and trapezoidal methods have been widely applied in various applications thanks to the accessibility of optical and thermal data their easy implementation and the appealing results reported by many researchers przeździecki et al 2018 vani et al 2019 there is a vast amount of literature on soil moisture indices for instance the temperature vegetation dryness index tvdi sandholt et al 2002 the improved tvdi wang et al 2004 patel et al 2009 rahimzadeh bajgiran et al 2012 yang et al 2015 zhu et al 2017 the temperature rising rate vegetation dryness index trrvdi zhang et al 2014 temperature vegetation soil moisture dryness index tvsmi amani et al 2017 the water deficit index wdi moran et al 1994 the vegetation dryness index vdi maki et al 2004 the evapotranspiration et and evaporative fraction ef indices bastiaanssen 2000 jiang and islam 2001 komatsu 2003 stisen et al 2008 hssaine et al 2018 and the soil evaporation efficiency index see merlin et al 2012 the above mentioned indexes are all grounded in the same conceptual methodology which runs as follows a t v scatter plot is first created using a set of image pixels and two up and down boundary edges typically called dry and wet edges are then defined on that scatter plot for each pixel which is treated as a point in the t v scatter plot the distances to the wet edge the dry edges and some specific corners of the t v scatter plot are considered in order to provide a set of features associated with the soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration finally these features are applied to calculate the different indexes related to the soil moisture condition obviously the accuracy of wet and dry edges definitions govern the accuracy of the resultant soil moisture indexes merlin et al 2008 petropoulos et al 2009 zhang and zhou 2016 a serious problem arises in situations where there are insufficient pixels with comprehensive temperature and vegetation conditions to form a true trapezoidal shape in the t v scatter plot this leads to an imprecise definition of the wet and dry edges which degrades the accuracy of the derived indices a further concern about the above mentioned methods is the scale of inconsistency between the computed indexes on different days for a given pixel on a given day the smc index takes a number between 0 and 1 based on its distance to the boundaries of the corresponding 1 day scatter plot therefore these pixels take the same scale and comparable soil moisture index values however these values are not necessarily comparable between the maps of different days since they are driven from different t v scatter plots this issue complicates the long term monitoring of the smc in the areas chosen for those 1 day driven indexes given this it can be deduced that despite the many benefits of t v methods there are some concerns that restrict their applicability to all regions and days the main purpose of this paper is to deal with these limitations by proposing an improved t v scatter plot as well as a novel smc index to clarify the aims and objectives of this paper the most common smc indexes which are all based on t v scatter plots are reviewed in the next section the developed scatter plot and the proposed smc index are then introduced section 3 introduces the study area and the applied in situ data while section four presents the obtained results and their evaluation using ground truth samples this section also includes a detailed comparison with other techniques 2 materials and methods 2 1 a review of basic temperature vegetation indexes 2 1 1 temperature vegetation dryness index tvdi on the assumption that pixels within the same specific smc locate on a unique line between the dry and wet edges of the universal triangle in the t v scatter plot sandholt et al 2002 introduced a linear index of smc called the temperature vegetation dryness index tvdi tvdi has a negative relation with smc and is calculated by eq 1 the parameters used in eq 1 are shown in fig 1 a 1 tvd i i a b ls t i l s t min a d r y n d v i i b d r y l s t min the normalized difference vegetation index ndvii and the land surface temperature lsti are the vegetation and temperature factors respectively derived from remote sensing images for the ith pixel a dry and b dry are the parameters of the dry line lstmin refers to the temperature of the wet edge which is considered to be a horizontal line in sandholt et al 2002 in wang et al 2004 patel et al 2009 on the assumption that the wet edge of the t v scatter plot is non horizontal the parameters of this edge were used to calculate lstmin and tvdi mallick et al 2009 established a linear relationship between tvdi and smc using the maximum and minimum smc of area stations and managed to convert tvdi to smc rahimzadeh bajgiran et al 2012 introduced a new index called itvdi in which the difference between the surface temperature and the topographically corrected air temperature was considered as the temperature parameter in the t v scatter plot sun et al 2008 liu and yue 2018 and zhang et al 2014 argued that on many days the apparent dry edge is not formed correctly due to the fact that the input remote sensing images do not necessarily cover the full extent of the vegetation and moisture conditions to address this issue these researchers proposed some theoretical edges for the calculation of the smc index wang et al 2018 expended tvdi along with the singularity index to identify concealed faults in the land covered area carlson and petropoulos 2019 presented an advanced version of triangle method in which the fractional vegetation cover and scaled infrared surface temperature which are themselves calculated from ndvi and surface radiometric temperature are employed to estimate smc availability and evapotranspiration fraction 2 1 2 priestley taylor parameter φ jiang and islam 2001 claimed that one can assign a parameter to each point in the t v scatter plot herein the priestley taylor parameter φ which is directly related to the evapotranspiration ef rate according to fig 1 b the horizontal wet edge has the maximum φ and the pixel with the maximum temperature and the minimum vegetation fraction point a in fig 1 b has the lowest φ value the priestley taylor parameter of the ith pixel φi with a temperature factor of ti is calculated in eq 2 2 φ i t max t i t max t min φ max φ min φ min the parameters of eq 2 are shown in fig 1 b according to eq 2 φ linearly increases from points a to g as shown in fig 1 b in fact the locus of pixels with the same φ is a line between the dry and the wet edge see the black lines in fig 1 b rahimzadeh bajgiran et al 2013 exploited the equations in lee and pielke 1992 and komatsu 2003 to convert the ef calculated using φ which is itself extracted from the t v scatter plot to the soil moisture content stisen et al 2008 realized a non linear relationship between the amount of ef and the priestley taylor parameter in fact these researchers claimed that in a t v scatter plot the locus of points with equal ef value is not a straight line but rather a curved feature referred to as the iso line see the red curves in fig 1 b sadeghi et al 2017 after arguing that the thermal optical trapezoid model totram is just applicable when there are thermal data presented a novel optical trapezoid model optram in which soil moisture is retrieved from shortwave infrared transformed reflectance str using linear regression models babaeian et al 2018 investigated the performance of the universal parameterization of optram in long term monitoring of soil moisture and agricultural drought 2 1 3 soil evaporation efficiency see the soil evaporation efficiency see which is known to be one of the trapezoidal approaches expresses an indicator of the evaporation rate of bare soil and the transpiration of vegetation trapezoidal approaches assume a t v scatter plot that is made up of pixels with different humidity and vegetation conditions this shows a trapezoidal space with four vertices 1 well watered vegetation with maximum transpiration 2 water stressed vegetation with minimum transpiration 3 saturated bare soil with maximum evaporation and 4 dry bare soil with minimum evaporation see fig 1 c moran et al 1994 according to merlin et al 2012 the see can be obtained for each point in the t v scatter plot using eq 3 3 se e i t s max t s i t s max t s min the parameters ts max and ts min are shown in fig 1 c the parameter ts i is the soil skin temperature of the ith point which is affected by the vegetation temperature tv according to eq 4 4 t s i lst f v t v 1 f v where fv is the satellite derived fractional vegetation cover that is considered as the normalized ndvi in merlin et al 2012 tv is calculated from tv max and tv min by different formulas depending on the zone in which the corresponding pixel is located see fig 1 c and the situation which controls the temperature of the pixel in zone a and zone d the temperature of the pixels is mainly controlled by soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration respectively on the other hand both soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration control the temperature of the pixels located in zones b and c merlin et al 2012 more information on relationship between see and soil moisture can be found in merlin et al 2018 since 2008 the see along with some other t v indices has been expanded to improve the spatial resolution of passive microwave sm data piles et al 2011 merlin et al 2012 sánchez ruiz et al 2014 djamai et al 2016 malbéteau et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 also amazirh et al 2018 employed see index to calibrate sentinel 1 radar data and then to retrieve smc 2 2 proposed method a new annual t v scatter plot as mentioned in section 1 despite the many benefits and success of the t v scatter plot methods the application of those methods suffer from two main restrictions firstly the accuracy of the indices extracted from t v scatter plot depend directly on how accurately the dry and wet edges are defined on this basis one cannot expect high accuracy when there are insufficient pixels with comprehensive temperature and vegetation conditions to form true wet and dry edges secondly the smc index maps obtained on different days are not necessarily comparable because they are extracted from different t v scatter plots and thus calculated by various wet and dry edges this issue complicates the long term monitoring of the smc in the areas chosen for those 1 day driven indexes to address the problems mentioned above this paper proposes a new scatter plot in which 1 year interval data are applied rather than the commonly used 1 day scatter plots this newly proposed scatter plot eliminates the previously mentioned problems in two ways firstly because the 1 year period provides more comprehensive information about the occurrence of humidity and the vegetation conditions e g dry soil saturated soil healthy vegetation and stressed vegetation the corners and edges of the trapezoidal shape can be more reliably determined secondly in using annual data in one scatter plot the obtained smc indexes for all points regardless of their date or location in the study area will be comparable because they are all computed from the edges and the corners of a unique t v scatter plot this makes it possible to compare the index maps obtained on different days thus allowing us to study the soil moisture for any required period of time the horizontal axis of the new scatter plot the horizontal axis of the proposed scatter plot is a factor of the vegetation fraction and is calculated using the following equation 5 ndv i ndvi n d v i min ndv i max n d v i min n where ndvimin and ndvimax are the minimum and maximum ndvi over the time period in which the t v scatter plot is produced the parameter n is a function of leaf orientation distribution within the canopy this parameter was set a value of 2 in some previous articles yang et al 2015 zhu et al 2017 carlson and petropoulos 2019 and 1 in some other ones gillies and carlson 1995 sandholt et al 2002 merlin et al 2010 2012 rahimzadeh bajgiran et al 2013 djamai et al 2016 since yang et al 2015 argued that the estimated smc is not sensitive to variations in this parameter and also vegetation factor has its own non linear effect on our smc index this parameter was set to 1 in this article consequently the vegetation fraction index is the normalized ndvi and takes into account the different vegetation conditions in the different regions in other words the normalized ndvi which varies between 0 and 1 in all regions equalizes the trapezoidal shape in the proposed t v scatter plot the vertical axis of the new scatter plot similar to other t v scatter plot methods the vertical axis of our proposed scatter plot is a factor of the surface temperature in light of the 1 year data integration in the proposed method the land surface temperate lst cannot be a proper candidate for this temperature factor the reason is that the surface temperature on different days in addition to being affected by smc is influenced by air temperature and this violates the theoretical equal air temperature assumption in temperature vegetation methods moran et al 1994 in this study three replacement temperature factors are suggested and verified eq 6 to eq 8 6 t 1 l s t day t a day 10 30 a m 7 t 2 l s t night t a night 10 30 p m 8 t 3 l s t day l s t night where lstday and lstnight refer to the land surface temperature in daytime and nighttime respectively determined according to remote sensing techniques in this study using modis data further the parameter ta represents the instantaneous air temperature at satellite overpass time eq 6 is devised based on the theory of simplified aerodynamic resistance energy balance or residual method in which the t v scatter plot method is applied to estimate the sensible heat fluxes h and evapotranspiration ef jiang and islam 1999 according to this theory in temperature equilibrium condition the wet edge of the lst ta v scatter plot with minimum lst ta has some essential features including maximum evapotranspiration ef 1 and minimum heat flux h 0 eq 7 is the same as eq 6 with the exception that in the eq 7 the descending lst and ta at 10 30 pm are utilized instead of ascending ones at 10 30 am since in some regions descending images taken at night are less covered by clouds this temperature factor is suggested to allow us to conclude the possibility of replacing this factor with eq 6 unlike the eqs 6 and 7 eq 8 is based on thermal inertia theory in which apparent thermal inertia ati as a proxy of energy exchange has a negative relationship to the difference in brightness temperature between day and night satellite overpasses lstday lstnight scheidt et al 2010 according to this theory the smallest value of lstday lstnight indicates the largest amount of thermal inertia which represents the maximum ef in the image and vice versa zhang et al 2003 huang et al 2006 2 3 proposed smc index evaporative fraction index improved soil effective efficiency isee in addition to the new annual scatter plot we have also designed a new smc index in so doing we first extract an evaporative fraction index from the annual t v scatter plot and then convert it to the smc index using one of the well known relationships between these two parameters to determine the evaporative fraction index from the t v scatter plot the relationship between evaporative fraction ef as the ratio of evapotranspiration et to the available energy carlson and petropoulos 2019 and priestley taylor parameter as a representative of effective resistance to evapotranspiration is applied jiang and islam 2001 9 ef et r n g φ δ δ γ where δ is the slope of saturated vapor pressure and air temperature hpa k 1 and γ is the psychometric constant hpa k 1 the δ δ γ value which is also called the air temperature control parameter and is typically used to normalize the ef for atmospheric effects is highly dependent on the air temperature rahimzadeh bajgiran et al 2013 in this paper we applied the simplified alternative equation proposed by wang et al 2006 as a very close approximate of δ δ γ eq 10 10 δ δ γ 0 0127 t a 0 3464 where ta is the air temperature centigrade wang et al 2006 although this factor is ignored in most previous methods we have considered it due to the fact that our method is based on the scatter plot produced from different days of the year and with different atmospheric conditions and air temperatures it is worth mentioning that this aerodynamic term accounts for the effect of various wind speed and air temperature conditions stisen et al 2008 as mentioned in section 0 φ in eq 9 is a soil moisture dependent parameter that can be driven from t v scatter plot in this paper we propose a new index called improved see isee as a representative of φ this new index is inspired from 1 the trapezoidal method used to calculate the see from t v scatter plot djamai et al 2016 and 2 the fact that in a t v scatter plot those points with equal evapotranspiration are not arranged as a line but located on a curve stisen et al 2008 accordingly isee index of the ith point in the scatter plot is derived as eq 11 11 ise e i t i max t i t i max t i min s e e max s e e i min s e e i min seemax refers to the highest possible amount of soil evaporations and vegetation transpiration that belongs to the points on the wet edge in 1 year t v scatter plot these points are assumed to have ef 1 and thus according to eq 9 one can conclude that seemax δ γ δ seei min on the other hand represents the lowest possible amount of evaporations and vegetation transpiration for the ith point in an specific ndvi which can be obtained via the following non linear formula eq 12 stisen et al 2008 12 se e i min s e e max n d v i i 2 in eq 11 ti max calculated by putting the vegetation factor ndvi of the ith point into the line equation that connects the highest and lowest isee points a and b respectively in fig 2 a ti min represents the minimum temperature obtained from the wet edge line the prerequisite for determining the above mentioned parameters is the locations of points a and b and the dry and wet edges of fig 2 a should also be defined in advance however it has been always a challenge in all t v scatter plot methods researchers argue that this challenge arises from the fact that apparent daily dry and wet edges are not formed properly in most single day t v scatter plots alternatively some approaches have been proposed in the literature to find out theoretical wet and dry edges zhang et al 2008 long and singh 2012 yang et al 2015 these techniques however require the additional collection and application of environmental parameters such as surface emissivity long wave radiation atmospheric transmissivity incident solar radiation and etc in light of that we apply a 1 year scatter plot a variety of humidity and the vegetation conditions are involved to generate the t v scatter plot e g dry soil saturated soil healthy and stressed vegetation as a result the apparent corners and edges of the trapezoidal shape are properly formed and hence we could manage to find out the dry and wet edges based on the simple technique proposed by merlin et al 2012 which does not require any auxiliary data according to merlin et al 2012 the annual wet edge is regarded as the line that passes through 1 tv min while at the same time all pixels with ndvi 0 5 are located above it in this case tv min is the minimum value of the temperature factor in the plot similarly the annual dry edge is described as a line that passes through 1 tv max when pixels with ndvi 0 5 are all located below that line tv max is however the temperature factor of a vegetated pixel with the highest water stress a temperature albedo scatter plot is used to find this pixel according to merlin et al 2012 initially the pixel temperature which has the highest albedo is selected as tv max next the ndvi of the selected pixel is checked if the ndvi of this pixel is greater than 0 5 the selection is approved otherwise tv max is alternatively set to tv min obviously the determination of tv min and tv max in the temperature vegetation scatter plots can affect the final results since tv min has a firm method of estimation an uncertainty in isee determination is likely to happen according to the possible variations in the estimation of tv max this uncertainty is more serious for those points close to the dry edge and is limited to 0 5 b a where b and a shows the distances of a hypothetical point to the wet edge and dry edge respectively fig 2 a shows in blue the locus of points with equal values of the soil evaporation efficiency index isee in our method the iso lines with identical isee index are curved lines in contrast to most of the previous methods that leaded to direct iso lines in the t v scatter plot this curvature of iso lines is caused by the nonlinear relationship between seei min and seemax in eq 12 curvatures of iso lines imply that the value of the evapotranspiration index changes nonlinearly from the point a with minimum evapotranspiration to the point b with maximum evapotranspiration along the ab line see fig 2 a in other words along the ab line isee index will increase slowly for low ndvi and more rapidly for high ndvi this assumption is introduced and applied to calculate φ by stisen et al 2008 smc index as the last step of our proposed method we need to devise a soil moisture index driven from the soil evaporation efficiency index isee hereinafter we call this index as smisee for this reason we have adopted the equation from noilhan and planton 1989 as the relationship between smc and evaporative fraction index and devised eq 13 which comprises the soil evaporation efficiency index isee 13 s m isee a r cos 1 2 i s e e it must be noted that a variety of linear or nonlinear relationship between these two parameter has been developed and analyzed in many previous literatures noilhan and planton 1989 merlin et al 2010 rahimzadeh bajgiran et al 2013 carlson and petropoulos 2019 of major works covering this issue one could point out to merlin et al 2010 which put forward the claim that over some conditions where soil properties are not available eq 13 is more efficient for retrieving soil moisture fig 2 b shows the smisee curves in the t v scatter plot in contrast to isee fig 2 a these curves are no longer distanced equally in fact the loci of points with equal soil moisture index are curves with different distances which are in contrast to the equal distanced linear shapes assumed in most previous indices reported in the literature fig 3 summarizes the general procedure for determining our proposed soil moisture index smisee using modis products and other in situ parameters the lst products of modis mod11a1 with 1 km spatial resolution for 1 year intervals were downloaded and those images with more than 20 cloudy pixels were excluded from the whole procedure in these products cloudy pixels were masked out using modis quality flags data after selecting non cloudy days ti images including t1 t2 and t3 were then produced using the lst day the lst night and the air temperature for the remaining non cloudy days for non cloudy days ndvi images were produced from the reflectance of the red and nir bands of the modis products mod09a1 with 0 5 km spatial resolution which had already been re sampled to a 1 km spatial resolution the ndvi images were then obtained using eq 5 modis albedo products mod43b3 with 463 m resolution were also used in a first step to locate and exclude snowy pixels as those with an albedo value larger than 0 5 in addition these products were used alongside t and ndvi data in later steps to select vegetation pixels with maximum water stress the mcd43a3 product provides both hemispherical and bi hemispherical reflectance in this study bi hemispherical reflectance shortwave white sky albedo was applied the annual t v scatter plot was then produced using non cloudy images and non snowy pixels tv min and tv max annual wet and dry edges as well as the ab line were all determined using the produced t v scatter plot air temperature of all days used to calculate the δ δ γ value of each day and then to calculate the seemax value for points on the wet edge finally for each point in t v scatter plot isee and smisee are calculated from eqs 12 and 13 as mentioned earlier the extraction of smc indices from the t v scatter plot is grounded on the assumption that all other parameters affecting soil temperature and vegetation index are equal for all points it must be kept in mind that despite the modeling of many atmospheric parameters excluding the damaged pixels from the proposed method and shrinking of the study area to reduce the atmospheric and underlying surface changes this assumption could not be generalized as a result the accuracy of the proposed method might be affected by some uncertainties sources such as cloud shadows soil wetness in deeper layers non modeling effects of atmospheric conditions dependency of the vegetation and temperature factor on the soil and vegetation type and etc in this paper the correlation coefficient r was used to measure the existing correlation between the proposed smisee index and the ground soil moisture data in addition the p value was used to show the significance of the results this measure declares the strength of a statistical claim or null hypothesis results with higher values of correlation coefficient as close as possible to one and a lower p value as close as possible to zero are more statistical relevant 3 study area and in situ data 3 1 spanish study area one of the study areas of this paper is part of the remedhus network this network is located in the duero basin in spain 5 13 5 63 w 41 14 41 48 n and contains 23 soil moisture estimation stations among which 19 were exploited fig 4 shows the spatial extent of the study area that encompasses 19 in situ stations of remedhus network and also 40 30 pixels of modis image with 1 km spatial resolution the remedhus network is located in an area with various soil texture characteristics different percentage of sand clay and silt at different stations diverse land cover rained cereals in the rainy season in winter and spring and irrigated crops such as sugar beet corn and potatoes in summer and various smc situations at 1 year intervals leng et al 2015 these features along with easy access to the temperature and soil moisture measurements of the stations in the network make it useful for many studies sánchez et al 2010 sánchez ruiz et al 2014 in the remedhus stations the surface soil moisture is measured using stevens hydra probe sensors located 5 cm underground in hydra probe sensors an oscillator produces and radiates an electromagnetic signal of 50 mhz and a receiver measures the reflected signal this reflected signal depends on the real dielectric constant which increases with humidity mcnairn et al 2015 in this study we employed surface soil moisture and soil temperature data measured at the 0 5 cm depth for the year 2010 during that year only 19 stations were actively recording data it is worth noting that among all of the available hourly data we only applied the average recorded between 10 am and 11 am modis ascending overpass time and 10 pm and 11 pm modis descending overpass time in addition to the data from the remedhus network we also employed the existing information on air temperature that was measured at a nearby meteorological station in spain 41 72 n 5 30 w at the satellite overpass time 10 30 am for modis terra daytime and 10 30 pm for modis terra nighttime since the region of interest is rather flat with a slope of 10 12 the effect of topographic changes on air temperature was ignored zhang et al 2014 3 2 canadian study area the second study area is the site of the smapvex12 fields located in the canadian red river watershed in southern manitoba canada 97 7 98 5 w 49 40 50 n djamai et al 2016 the smapvex12 network contains 55 agricultural fields utilized by agriculture and agri food canada aafc manitoba agriculture food and rural development mafrd and the united states department of agriculture usda mcnairn et al 2015 fig 5 shows the spatial extent of the study area where encompasses all of the smapvex12 fields and also 90 70 pixels of modis image with 1 km spatial resolution in this part of canada agricultural fields with different types of soil from clay in the east to loam in the west are covered with various crops including cereals 23 4 of the area soybeans 18 5 corn 9 1 canola 16 0 and grassland and pasture 14 6 mcnairn et al 2015 the vegetation cover of this study area is quite massive so the average ndvi obtained from the modis data was approximately 0 7 during the study period this feature along with variations in the range of soil type makes it possible to study the effect of full vegetation cover and different soil type on the proposed method the smc of these fields was measured between june 6 and july 17 2012 using stevens water hydra and delta theta probes at the soil surface 0 5 cm and at depths of 5 cm 20 cm 50 cm 100 cm and 150 cm mcnairn et al 2015 in each of the smapvex12 fields the soil moisture content is measured in 16 stations in two rows at each station three measurements are performed every half hour to ensure the accuracy of the measurement and the mean of these measurements was introduced as the smc of the fields rowlandson et al 2013 as in the remedhus network the volumetric surface soil moisture at the 0 5 cm depth measured at 10 30 am and 10 30 pm are applied to validate the proposed method also the air temperature measured at the ascending and descending overpass time was downloaded for the year 2012 given that the region has a maximum topographic gradient of 2 this air temperature can be considered to be the same across the entire study area hosseini and mcnairn 2017 4 results and discussion 4 1 a visual inspection of t v scatter plots daily vs annual as mentioned earlier a major challenge in the estimation of the smc index in t v methods results from the ambiguities in the identification of the daily dry and wet edges which are mainly due to the non comprehensive temperature and vegetation conditions liu and yue 2018 yang and zhang 2019 to investigate this issue t v scatter plots of the smapvex12 network belong to various days in 2012 are shown and visually inspected in fig 6 a g in these scatter plots the horizontal axis is the ndvi and the vertical axis stands for t1 eq 6 according to fig 6 a g the ideal trapezoidal diagram in the t v scatter plot was not correctly formed on any of the days because all the required humidity and vegetation conditions did not occur together in one image on some days such as 181 215 2012 when vegetation is prominent and there is no bare soil pixel in the image the chart was not formed at all see fig 6 d e this makes it impossible to utilize the temperature vegetation scatter plot to estimate the smc index for these days zhang and zhou 2016 further on some days such as 147 2012 if the daily wet and dry edges are determined using previous methods the two parallel edges will be extracted that will not formed ideal triangular or trapezoidal shape these conditions compelled us to collect some extra parameters and implement more difficult methods to find out the wet and dry edges zhang et al 2014 however when the scatter plot consists of pixels of images belonging to all non cloudy and non snowy days during the 1 year interval fig 6 h the ideal trapezoidal shape mentioned by merlin et al 2012 and trustworthy edges can be clearly identified the lines shown in fig 6 h are the isee curves along which the evapotranspiration has the same value it is worth noting that 1 day scatter plots shown in fig 6 a g are not similar as each one refers to a different day they are also very different from the 1 year scatter plot in fig 6 h since none of them is made up of the comprehensive conditions of the 1 year scatter plot similar results for the remedhus area can be found in fig 7 which shows the scatter plots of the remedhus network for some selected days of 2010 fig 7 a g on the daily scatter plots of this region not only the ideal scattering space not developed but also the density of the points on the scatter plot was very low which makes it difficult to determine the apparent wet and dry edges the reason for this situation is that in some areas such as the remedhus neighborhood where the topographic changes are high the area of the image needs to be shrunk to reduce the topographic changes ran et al 2005 this shrinking of the image diminishes the number of pixels in the image and also the number and density of the points in the scatter plot as seen in fig 7 a g there is no day in which a well shaped trapezoidal chart is obtained and this is the consequence of the small number of pixels this limitation is however addressed for the 1 year case see fig 7 h furthermore one can point to the different shapes of the 1 year t v scatter plots in the two regions although in both regions these 1 year period triangles are much more similar to the ideal trapezoidal shape than those in the 1 day charts they are obviously different the reason for this can be traced to the different annual vegetation cover and soil characteristics of these regions piles et al 2011 as mentioned earlier the vegetation fraction and its changes in the smapvex12 network are much higher than those of the remedhus network this makes the diagram created for the smapvex12 closer to the theoretical triangular shape in nearly the same way one can conclude that the annual smc condition of the study area along with annual vegetation cover can affect the performance of the proposed scatter plot as indicated previously the basic premise of the 1 year scatter plot argument is the existence of pixels with comprehensive humidity conditions over a one year interval as a result in some specific annual humidity situations such as long term droughts or continuous rainfall the ideal trapezoidal diagram in the t v scatter plot may not be correctly formed in cases that these specific conditions are likely to happen it is preferable to extend the 1 year to longer periods to assure the formation of a comprehensive scatter plot meanwhile the investigation of this issue which requires a wide range of in situ smc data over extreme humidity situations is recommended for future studies 4 2 investigating the effects of different temperature factors fig 8 shows the t v scatter plot formed by the 1 year interval data for the remedhus top row and the smapvex12 areas bottom row with different temperature factors including lstday t1 ls t day t a day 10 30 a m t2 ls t night t a night 10 30 p m as well as t3 ls t day l s t night fig 8 a g clearly shows that when using the lstday the plot and its graphs are far from the desired theoretical trapezoidal shape see fig 1 c this can be explained by the fact that the average surface temperature varies on different days mainly due to factors such as air temperature wind speed and different amounts of solar radiation this issue simply violates the assumption of having an equal radiation situation for those pixels that participate in the formation of the temperature vegetation scatter plot this inspection suggests gathering several dates in a single t v scatter plot without normalizing for atmospheric forcing is improper an attempt was made to compare the other three temperature factors t1 t2 and t3 for that matter the soil moisture indices were computed using all of these three factors and were evaluated through correlation coefficient analysis for both study area table 1 in table 1 n1 represents the total number of days during the year that was used to construct the scatter plot n2 is the number of days on which the ground references were available and thus were applied for the validation of the results the correlation coefficient and its p value were estimated for each individual station 19 stations in remedhus and 50 stations in smapvex12 sites using the smisee and the in situ smc values of all n2 days these values were then averaged over the stations and were reported in the last columns of table 1 it must be noted that the performance of temperature factors t1 and t2 in calculating smc indices are investigated by in situ smc values at modis ascending overpass time smc10 30am and modis descending overpass time smc10 30pm respectively on the other hand daily average smc smc10 30am smc10 30pm 2 is applied to evaluate the soil moisture indices computed using temperature factor t3 according to table 1 the temperature vegetation approach in the spanish region has better performance than in the canadian region as stated by garcia et al 2014 this is likely because of that the temperature vegetation approach is more suitable for the water limited region than the radiation limited region garcia et al 2014 on the other hand this is perhaps due to the different vegetation covers in these two study areas where vegetation in the smapvex12 has twice the density of that in the remedhus area see table 1 in fact optical and thermal data such as the modis data is less sensitive to soil parameters including moisture content in dense vegetation cover leng et al 2014 petropoulos et al 2015 however despite the average ndvi of 0 68 in the smapvex12 region there is still a promising correlation between the soil moisture measurements and the proposed index table 1 also shows that in both regions t2 lstnight tanight 10 30 pm is the least appropriate temperature index since it yielded the lowest correlation coefficient and the largest p value more than 0 01 compared to the two other temperature factors on the other hand t1 lstday taday 10 30 am appears especially appealing with the largest correlation coefficient and a p value close to zero in order to deep the comparison between t1 and the other two temperature factors t2 and t3 a correlation study was conducted for both study regions the results which are presented in fig 9 indicate a weak correlation between t1 and t2 in spite of the fact that both of these factors represent the sensible heat fluxes see section 2 2 this lack of correlation between t1 and t2 can explain inappropriate performance of t2 in estimating smc index the presumption of using the residual method lst ta in the t v scatter plot is that the air vegetation and near surface soil are in thermal equilibrium temperature equilibrium is achieved when vertical profile of soil temperature is uniform and the difference between canopy and soil temperature is minimized that usually happens at 6 00 am or times close to 6 00 am like 10 00 am this is the reason that daytime lst ta t1 can be an appropriate temperature factor in t v scatter plot temperature equilibrium condition does not exist at 10 00 pm therefore using lstnight tanight 10 30 pm as a near surface soil and canopy temperature factor in t v scatter plot increases the error of soil moisture retrieval on the other hand notwithstanding the physical difference in t1 and t3 show a stronger correlation implying that these two temperature factors could be exchanged and both make a suitable temperature factor in t v scatter plot using the t1 factor is more advantageous compared to t3 since cloud conditions during night does not have to be considered hence more satellite images are available for processing as an example there were 64 cloudless days in the smapvex12 area among which only 24 also had cloudless night conditions see table 1 the propriety of t1 as a measure of temperature implicitly suggests that this factor is a good representative of in situ land surface temperature this temperature factor however requires field information on air temperature which is not always available station based observations are sparsely distributed and may not be representative of the satellite observation scene this leads to uncertainties in ta values to have a measure of this uncertainty we performed a sensitivity analysis and realized a degrading effect of 2 per 1 uncertainties in ta though corresponding uncertainty is negligible we suggest more research on deriving the t v scatter plot based on remote sensing data only according to the above mentioned advantages of t1 in the remaining analysis of this paper t1 was applied as the temperature factor for constructing the t v scatter plots 4 3 an analysis on the optimum period to form the t v scatter plot in this section next question will be tackled what is the impact of the used time span for constructing the t v scatter plot on the performance of the method to estimate smc a first step is the comparison between daily and annual scatter plots in so doing four cloud free days in the year 2010 in the remedhus network which have the most difference in the average smc were selected average smc values which are expressed in third column of table 2 are derived from the soil moisture of the 19 in situ stations for each day two distinct approaches were taken for the estimation of the smisee index 1 using the scatter plot produced from all cloudless days in the year 2010 i e 106 days and 2 using the scatter plot generated only from the pixels of a specific date i e a one day scatter plot the first case implies that the annual dry and wet edges are extracted from the 1 year scatter plot blue curves in fig 10 while in the second case the apparent edges of 1 day scatter plot red curves in fig 10 are used to calculate smisee these apparent edges are selected as two upper and lower isee curves in such a way as to contain all the pixels with ndvi 0 5 in the corresponding image of that day merlin et al 2012 the equation of these wet and dry edges are used to calculate ti max ti min isee and smisee fig 10 shows the selected edges for both cases according to fig 10 the daily apparent edges are very different from their equivalent ones in the 1 year scatter plot leading to different values of calculated soil moisture indices the average values of the calculated index computed over 19 image pixel containing the 19 stations of the remedhus network are presented in the last columns of table 2 one can easily observe a greater consistency between the average smc and the computed average smisee when using the annual scatter plot this conclusion can also be drawn from fig 11 in which the histogram of smc indices are provided for both cases using daily and annual scatter plots the histograms in fig 11 a which are based on the 1 year t v scatter plot are better able to make distinction between the different smc values at their corresponding dates in contrast fig 11 b shows the overlapping histograms which are made up of smc indices driven from daily edges these overlapping histograms take all the values in the range between 0 and 1 while we know that none of these four dates contain pixels with comprehensive soil moisture conditions in addition one can conclude that even if the daily t v scatter plots are sufficiently comprehensive to provide appropriate wet and dry edges the driven smc indices maps of different days are not necessarily comparable because they are extracted from different t v scatter plots another comparison was made at each remedhus station between in situ soil moisture data and remote sensing soil moisture index calculated from 1 the annual edges of 1 year scatter plot and 2 the edges of 1 day scatter plot see fig 10 the results are shown in the fig 12 this figure depicts a promising agreement between the 1 year smisee indices and their corresponding in situ soil moisture data in terms of correlation coefficient while the 1 day index leads to less favorable results the worst cases occurred for the stations i06 and h07 where no meaningful correlation was observed previous investigation has demonstrated that unlike the 1 day scatter plot the proposed scatter plot is able to monitor the changes in moisture condition of stations that have different texture and soil moisture sánchez et al 2010 the next question is whether the whole year period is essential for the scatter plot generation or if one can achieve similar results with only partial year intervals to answer this question ten different periods of the year were selected to provide the data required for scatter plot generation these time intervals and the obtained results for each are summarized in table 3 and fig 13 it can be seen from table 3 and fig 13 that the quality of the smisee index is directly influenced by the time period and the number of days applied to form the t v scatter plot however the time period appears to be more effective than the number of days for instance july 1 to december 30 a six month duration with 38 days exhibits better results than april 1 to june 30 a three month period with 42 days the reason is that the 38 days of the six month period contain more varying vegetation states and temperature conditions to form the corners of t v scatter plot if any general rule may be drawn it is perhaps that the greater the time duration for the t v scatter plot generation the better the results it should be note that one of the main contributions of suggesting a long term scatter plot is to simplify the temperature vegetation method by reducing the axillary in situ data which is required to estimate the daily wet and dry edges and to compare the index maps obtained on different days however applying very long time series data longer than one year interval which requires downloading and processing a large amount of satellite data is in contrast to the provided simplicity of the proposed method on the other hand since the 1 year period provides almost all comprehensive information about the occurrence of humidity and the vegetation conditions e g dry soil saturated soil healthy vegetation and stressed vegetation it seems that a very long time series data could not provide new information however some other t v scatter plot based on a long time series spanning several years may suggest for future studies 4 4 investigating the effect of soil texture and vegetation cover on the accuracy of the methodology remote sensing indexes are typically designed to represent a specific environmental parameter e g the smisee as an index of smc a serious issue of an index could be its dependence on other environmental factors the purpose of this section is to investigate the possible correlation between the smisee and two important soil characteristics namely soil texture and the percentage of vegetation cover to verify the impact of soil texture all the stations in both the smapvex12 and the remedhus networks were considered these stations cover different soil texture conditions which make them a good case for the analysis sánchez et al 2010 djamai et al 2016 the estimated smisee values for all above mentioned stations were analyzed during the whole year and their correlation coefficients with the ground measured smcs were determined to examine any probable relationship between the performance of the proposed smc index and the soil texture conditions these estimated r values were plotted against the percentage of sand silt and clay as shown in fig 14 a c at the first investigation of these results it seems that there is no clear relationship between the proposed smisee index and the soil texture parameters however more researches on richer data sets are required to draw any firm conclusions about these statistical relationships next we investigate the possible relationship between the proposed smisee index and the percentage of vegetation cover which is a serious concern in all soil moisture content indexes the average and standard deviation of the ndvi as a vegetation density index on the different days of the study periods in the 55 smapvex12 and 19 remedhus stations show a large diversity of ndvi for both regions while the smapvex12 region has a higher vegetation density see section 4 2 the correlation coefficient of the smisee index and the smc in all the existing stations of the networks were determined for each day an attempt was then made to investigate the possible relationship between these r values and the average ndvi of the days the result is presented fig 15 which provides evidence that there is almost no clear meaningful statistical relationship while most of the previous indices are not applicable in dense vegetated areas zhang and zhou 2016 hosseini and mcnairn 2017 zhu et al 2017 the proposed smisee index proved to be insensitive to the vegetation cover since it could achieve to satisfactory results in almost all vegetation covers 4 5 general evaluation of smisee and its comparison to the some recent alternatives in this section we first follow a spatial correlation analysis between in situ smc of each pixels and the proposed smisee index the results are then compared with some successful alternatives recently proposed in the literature to this end smapvex12 network data is applied as it contains more stations 49 nun forests stations for smapvex12 vs 19 stations for remedhus and obviously leading to more reliable correlation coefficients fig 16 shows the obtained results of spatial correlation analyses performed between the estimated smisee data and their corresponding field measurements at the depth of 0 5 cm in 10 days of the year 2012 each of which are shown in an individual chart in these charts each point represents an image pixel containing at least one smc monitoring station for pixels in which more than one station exists the average of measurements of those stations is considered as ground measurement according to fig 16 for each day estimated smc index obtained from 1 year scatter plot generally had correlation coefficients better than 0 5 with in situ smc meanwhile coefficient of determination r2 is 0 5 in most cases to the best of our knowledge there is no standard guideline to determine the level of predictive acceptance for r2 as a rule of thumb henseler et al 2009 suggests that 0 25 r2 0 5 can be regarded as a moderate and acceptable results on the other hand linear correlations between smisee index and in situ smc which are in ranging from 0 51 to 0 77 behave not the same since different linear relations are obtained this suggests more research to convert smisee index to smc which usually requires some extra remote sensing data such as microwave images in the reminder of this section the use of the smisee index for monitoring the soil moisture content is compared with some of the common previously used indices which are introduced in table 4 these alternative indices are dissimilar to the proposed smisee index in two respects 1 they use different equations and 2 in contrast to the smisee which is obtained from a 1 year scatter plot they are driven from daily scatter plots to investigate the effect of each of these factors alternative indices were computed not only from the original one day scatter plot but also from our proposed 1 year scatter plot the obtained results are presented in table 5 for both the smapvex12 and the remedhus networks from the findings shown in table 5 one can conclude that 1 using our proposed 1 year scatter plot improves the performance of previous smc herein the see the non linear φ and the itvdi in the both region of interest and 2 the proposed smisee outperforms other smc indices noted in the literature which explains the suitability of non linear relationship between the location of the points in t v scatter plot and their soil moisture index 5 conclusion soil moisture content is an important environmental parameter that is most commonly extracted from remote sensing images via temperature vegetation relationships these techniques however suffer from being inaccurate in areas of dense vegetation and they provide daily scaled indices that are not necessarily consistent when driven from different days this paper proposes a long term scatter plot herein a nine month to 1 year period which is accompanied by a novel soil moisture index that can properly address both of the above mentioned limitations the proposed long term scatter plot allows for a comprehensive plot in which more humidity and vegetation situation are involved in this kind of plot the pixels related to days with dry soil conditions happen at the top of the trapezoid and yield to the definition of a reliable annual dry edge on the other hand pixels that represent wet soils are mostly placed at the bottom of the chart leading to a well defined annual wet edge three different temperature factors namely lstday taday lstnight tanight and lstday lstnight were used as the temperature factors i e the vertical axis in the proposed 1 year scatter plot the results demonstrated that lstday taday is the most appropriate choice in addition the proposed index of soil moisture content defines a non linear relation herein a cosine one between the position of a point in the t v scatter plot and its corresponding soil effective evaporation a detailed analysis of the challenges as well as the capability of the proposed method to deal with them was conducted across ground truth samples from two different networks including the smapvex12 network in canada and the remedhus network in spain generally the comparison between soil moisture indices regarded in 2 cases i temporal comparison and ii spatial comparison in the case of temporal comparison smc indices associated to a specific location are compared for different dates according to the results shown in table2 figs 11 and 12 smc indices map of different days extracted from daily t v scatter plot and calculated by different daily dry and wet edge are not necessarily comparable while the reliable and long term annual dry and wet edges allow us to compare the humidity condition of a specific point in a specific day with not only other points in that day but also all points in a one year interval in the case of spatial comparison for a specific day moisture indices associated to different locations are compared the results of fig 16 demonstrate that there exist significant linear correlations between smisee index and in situ smc for all 10 days in smapvex12 site while these linear relations are not the same for all days and show their daily normalization changes from date to date actually in different days our soil moisture index is related to the true soil moisture values with different gain and offset parameters this suggests more research to convert smisee index to smc by combining t v indices with some other remote sensing soil moisture products such as microwave images furthermore the proposed method was compared to three other well known indices the see the itvdi and the φ the results were compared in terms of the correlation coefficient between the index value and the corresponding soil moisture content with very promising correlation coefficients of 0 74 and 0 65 for the remedhus and the smapvex12 networks respectively demonstrating the suitability of the proposed methodology in addition it was realized that the long term t v scatter plot could improve the accuracy of the other indices reported in the literature although the best performance to date is achieved by the proposed smisee index based on recent explanations one can conclude that our proposed method has two obvious advantages over recent t v scatter plot methods firstly our proposed method makes it impossible to utilize the temperature vegetation scatter plot to estimate the smc index even on those days when the one day t v scatter plot is not formed at all secondly this method allows us to compare the index maps obtained on different days and to monitor the smc conditions for any desired long term period without the requirement of any auxiliary data moreover outperforms the other smc indices mentioned in the literature in light of the multiple uses of the remote sensing optical and thermal data for improving the spatial resolution of passive microwave soil moisture products further validations could be conducted to assess the validity and utility of the smisee index in downscaling of microwave remote sensing

5925,the estimation of soil moisture content on the global scale is a key research issue in the field of remote sensing and to date a range of methods have been developed to achieve this the temperature vegetation t v technique which is perhaps one of the most common and successful suffers from being inaccurate in some cases especially when the daily t v scatter plots are not able to define the wet and dry edges in a reliable way a further challenge is the scale inconsistency between the results obtained on different days which is a serious concern when monitoring soil moisture changes over periods of time to address these restrictions this paper introduces a new soil moisture index called smisee driven by a new long term t v scatter plot that is established from data covering a 1 year period the normalized ndvi is set as the horizontal axis and three different temperature factors are suggested as the vertical axis in the proposed 1 year scatter plot from these three temperature factors the results proved that lstday taday 10 30 am is the most appropriate choice in contrast to most linear co distance indexes reported in the literature the proposed smisee is a novel non linear soil moisture index that defines the locus of co moisture points in the scatter plot as unequal distance curves to investigate the proposed method two different soil moisture observation networks with different climate and vegetation conditions namely smapvex12 in canada and remedhus in spain were applied the results demonstrated that the efficiency of the proposed 1 year scatter plot which was even applicable to and improved upon other indexes in the literature in addition smisee outperformed see itvdi and φas the most recent similar indexes achieving correlation coefficients of 0 65 and 0 74 for the smapvex12 and remedhus networks respectively these results appear to be promising especially for the vegetated area in the smapvex12 network keywords soil moisture content remote sensing temperature vegetation method soil evaporation efficiency see 1 introduction soil moisture content smc generally to the amount of water between soil particles leng et al 2014 there is a strong requirement for reliable and up to date knowledge about smc and its spatial distribution in many fields including agriculture water resource management meteorology and the prediction of flooding and droughts ahmed et al 2011 dutta et al 2015 younis and iqbal 2015 zhang and zhou 2016 there are two general approaches to the estimation of smc i field measurement techniques and ii remote sensing techniques the in situ technique is perhaps the most accurate however this is not feasible expensive and time consuming making its application impractical in vast regions at short time intervals verstraeten et al 2008 srivastava et al 2013 remote sensing can mitigate all of the disadvantages of field measurements recent advances in satellite imaging systems offer great promise as a means of estimating smc using better spatial and temporal resolutions and even at lower costs weidong et al 2002 wang and qu 2009 the underlying concept is that smc influences some soil properties such as its color albedo light absorbing bands brightness temperature and dielectric constant all of which are quantifiable using different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum nevertheless remote sensing is typically concerned with the surface soil moisture i e the water contained in the upper 10 cm of the soil surface due to the limited penetration of electromagnetic wavelengths ahmed et al 2011 amiri et al 2019 remote sensing techniques can be categorized as 1 optical visible and infrared 2 thermal and 3 microwave active or passive methods depending on which region of the electromagnetic spectrum is applied wang and qu 2009 active and passive microwave remote sensing measures the microwave energy in the wavelength range of 0 5 100 cm emitted passive or scattered active from the phenomena gao et al 2013 petropoulos et al 2015 the underlying concept is that the thermal emission and backscattering coefficient of soil which are convertible to the brightness temperature and soil moisture are quantifiable at the mw frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum by passive and active sensors respectively djamai et al 2015 o neill et al 2015 to date

advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr2 have been developed european space agency esa s soil moisture ocean salinity smos and nasa s soil moisture active passive smap are the newest remote sensing missions devoted to mapping smc every 2 3 days at 40 km resolution using an l band interferometric radiometer at 1 4 ghz al yaari et al 2014 kerr et al 2016 there is a rapidly growing literature on the validation of the space borne mw soil moisture products using other remote sensing datasets in situ measurements and airborne based observations which shows the high potential of those products for smc retrieval jackson et al 2010 parinussa et al 2011 dente et al 2012 jackson et al 2012 louvet et al 2015 chan et al 2016 macelloni et al 2016 rodríguez fernández et al 2017 chen et al 2018 el hajj et al 2018 however inherently coarse resolution several tens of kilometers of passive microwave data and also low accuracy of the existing models in retrieving smc information from radar data due to the effects of vegetation and roughness on the backscattering coefficient diminishes their applicability in many studies piles et al 2011 djamai et al 2016 tagesson et al 2018 more information on microwave remote sensing for smc estimation models can be found in woodhouse 2017 in addition to the passive mw remote sensing the thermal and optical domains of electromagnetic spectrum have been established as the other promising instruments to estimate smc holzman et al 2014 petropoulos et al 2015 in optical remote sensing surface reflectance which is typically confined to the 0 4 2 5 μm wavelength is measured and analyzed weidong et al 2002 wang and qu 2009 investigations have shown that the reflectance of the visible domain decreases as the smc increases ishida et al 1991 there is ample literature on how to improve smc estimation models in optical remote sensing suggesting a variety of techniques such as applying different bands in different humidity conditions asner 1998 maki et al 2004 younis and iqbal 2015 determining the most appropriate absorption bands jackson et al 1983 whiting et al 2004 individual modeling for different soil types idso et al 1976 dalal and henry 1986 and providing linear and nonlinear models of soil moisture and visible domain reflectance bowers and smith 1972 weidong et al 2002 gao et al 2013 the large number of studies conducted using optical remote sensing implies that the visible and the near infrared nir portions of the spectrum are promising for smc estimation however some challenges remain the most serious of which are the disruptive effects of vegetation cover various minerals and their effect on soil reflectance and also cloud contamination wang et al 2006 petropoulos et al 2009 thermal remote sensing which typically employs the 3 5 14 μm wavelength in the spectrum region can quantify soil thermal inertia evaporation transpiration land surface temperature and soil evaporation efficiency all of which are influenced by smc bastiaanssen 2000 liu et al 2002 verstraeten et al 2006 to date various linear or non linear models have been used to express the relationship between smc and those measures carried out in the thermal domain tramutoli et al 2000 wang et al 2006 thermal techniques are generally grounded in explicit physical interpretations that make them simple and easy to use nevertheless these models are usually premised on the assumption of bare soil conditions and they degrade rapidly in areas with dense vegetation cover wang et al 2004 maltese et al 2013 methods that co exploit thermal and optical remote sensing data with the aim of diminishing the constraints of each in the estimation of smc are known as temperature vegetation methods wang and qu 2009 vani et al 2019 the intuitive idea behind temperature vegetation methods is that the land surface temperature is affected by both smc and vegetation cover carlson et al 1995 goward et al 2002 basically the dry soil temperature is higher than its surrounding air temperature this difference however diminishes with an increase in vegetation cover density which is itself the consequence of vegetation transpiration this causes a negative relationship between surface temperature t and vegetation v which is best realized in t v scatter plots nemani et al 1993 gillies et al 1997 wang et al 2007 each pixel of the image with a specific temperature and vegetation factor appears as a point in the t v scatter plot in conditions of invariant air temperature the rate of the negative relationship between t and v in a t v scatter plot depends on the smc in fact this inverse relationship is weaker for wet soils which is itself the consequence of soil evaporation as a result a triangular or trapezoidal shape is expected for a t v scatter plot provided that the pixels of the study area have a variety of vegetation transpiration and soil evaporation each of which is a function of smc yang et al 2015 zhang and zhou 2016 accordingly assuming that all other parameters are equal the position of a pixel in a t v scatter plot depends on its soil moisture condition t v scatter plot methods sometimes called triangular and trapezoidal methods have been widely applied in various applications thanks to the accessibility of optical and thermal data their easy implementation and the appealing results reported by many researchers przeździecki et al 2018 vani et al 2019 there is a vast amount of literature on soil moisture indices for instance the temperature vegetation dryness index tvdi sandholt et al 2002 the improved tvdi wang et al 2004 patel et al 2009 rahimzadeh bajgiran et al 2012 yang et al 2015 zhu et al 2017 the temperature rising rate vegetation dryness index trrvdi zhang et al 2014 temperature vegetation soil moisture dryness index tvsmi amani et al 2017 the water deficit index wdi moran et al 1994 the vegetation dryness index vdi maki et al 2004 the evapotranspiration et and evaporative fraction ef indices bastiaanssen 2000 jiang and islam 2001 komatsu 2003 stisen et al 2008 hssaine et al 2018 and the soil evaporation efficiency index see merlin et al 2012 the above mentioned indexes are all grounded in the same conceptual methodology which runs as follows a t v scatter plot is first created using a set of image pixels and two up and down boundary edges typically called dry and wet edges are then defined on that scatter plot for each pixel which is treated as a point in the t v scatter plot the distances to the wet edge the dry edges and some specific corners of the t v scatter plot are considered in order to provide a set of features associated with the soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration finally these features are applied to calculate the different indexes related to the soil moisture condition obviously the accuracy of wet and dry edges definitions govern the accuracy of the resultant soil moisture indexes merlin et al 2008 petropoulos et al 2009 zhang and zhou 2016 a serious problem arises in situations where there are insufficient pixels with comprehensive temperature and vegetation conditions to form a true trapezoidal shape in the t v scatter plot this leads to an imprecise definition of the wet and dry edges which degrades the accuracy of the derived indices a further concern about the above mentioned methods is the scale of inconsistency between the computed indexes on different days for a given pixel on a given day the smc index takes a number between 0 and 1 based on its distance to the boundaries of the corresponding 1 day scatter plot therefore these pixels take the same scale and comparable soil moisture index values however these values are not necessarily comparable between the maps of different days since they are driven from different t v scatter plots this issue complicates the long term monitoring of the smc in the areas chosen for those 1 day driven indexes given this it can be deduced that despite the many benefits of t v methods there are some concerns that restrict their applicability to all regions and days the main purpose of this paper is to deal with these limitations by proposing an improved t v scatter plot as well as a novel smc index to clarify the aims and objectives of this paper the most common smc indexes which are all based on t v scatter plots are reviewed in the next section the developed scatter plot and the proposed smc index are then introduced section 3 introduces the study area and the applied in situ data while section four presents the obtained results and their evaluation using ground truth samples this section also includes a detailed comparison with other techniques 2 materials and methods 2 1 a review of basic temperature vegetation indexes 2 1 1 temperature vegetation dryness index tvdi on the assumption that pixels within the same specific smc locate on a unique line between the dry and wet edges of the universal triangle in the t v scatter plot sandholt et al 2002 introduced a linear index of smc called the temperature vegetation dryness index tvdi tvdi has a negative relation with smc and is calculated by eq 1 the parameters used in eq 1 are shown in fig 1 a 1 tvd i i a b ls t i l s t min a d r y n d v i i b d r y l s t min the normalized difference vegetation index ndvii and the land surface temperature lsti are the vegetation and temperature factors respectively derived from remote sensing images for the ith pixel a dry and b dry are the parameters of the dry line lstmin refers to the temperature of the wet edge which is considered to be a horizontal line in sandholt et al 2002 in wang et al 2004 patel et al 2009 on the assumption that the wet edge of the t v scatter plot is non horizontal the parameters of this edge were used to calculate lstmin and tvdi mallick et al 2009 established a linear relationship between tvdi and smc using the maximum and minimum smc of area stations and managed to convert tvdi to smc rahimzadeh bajgiran et al 2012 introduced a new index called itvdi in which the difference between the surface temperature and the topographically corrected air temperature was considered as the temperature parameter in the t v scatter plot sun et al 2008 liu and yue 2018 and zhang et al 2014 argued that on many days the apparent dry edge is not formed correctly due to the fact that the input remote sensing images do not necessarily cover the full extent of the vegetation and moisture conditions to address this issue these researchers proposed some theoretical edges for the calculation of the smc index wang et al 2018 expended tvdi along with the singularity index to identify concealed faults in the land covered area carlson and petropoulos 2019 presented an advanced version of triangle method in which the fractional vegetation cover and scaled infrared surface temperature which are themselves calculated from ndvi and surface radiometric temperature are employed to estimate smc availability and evapotranspiration fraction 2 1 2 priestley taylor parameter φ jiang and islam 2001 claimed that one can assign a parameter to each point in the t v scatter plot herein the priestley taylor parameter φ which is directly related to the evapotranspiration ef rate according to fig 1 b the horizontal wet edge has the maximum φ and the pixel with the maximum temperature and the minimum vegetation fraction point a in fig 1 b has the lowest φ value the priestley taylor parameter of the ith pixel φi with a temperature factor of ti is calculated in eq 2 2 φ i t max t i t max t min φ max φ min φ min the parameters of eq 2 are shown in fig 1 b according to eq 2 φ linearly increases from points a to g as shown in fig 1 b in fact the locus of pixels with the same φ is a line between the dry and the wet edge see the black lines in fig 1 b rahimzadeh bajgiran et al 2013 exploited the equations in lee and pielke 1992 and komatsu 2003 to convert the ef calculated using φ which is itself extracted from the t v scatter plot to the soil moisture content stisen et al 2008 realized a non linear relationship between the amount of ef and the priestley taylor parameter in fact these researchers claimed that in a t v scatter plot the locus of points with equal ef value is not a straight line but rather a curved feature referred to as the iso line see the red curves in fig 1 b sadeghi et al 2017 after arguing that the thermal optical trapezoid model totram is just applicable when there are thermal data presented a novel optical trapezoid model optram in which soil moisture is retrieved from shortwave infrared transformed reflectance str using linear regression models babaeian et al 2018 investigated the performance of the universal parameterization of optram in long term monitoring of soil moisture and agricultural drought 2 1 3 soil evaporation efficiency see the soil evaporation efficiency see which is known to be one of the trapezoidal approaches expresses an indicator of the evaporation rate of bare soil and the transpiration of vegetation trapezoidal approaches assume a t v scatter plot that is made up of pixels with different humidity and vegetation conditions this shows a trapezoidal space with four vertices 1 well watered vegetation with maximum transpiration 2 water stressed vegetation with minimum transpiration 3 saturated bare soil with maximum evaporation and 4 dry bare soil with minimum evaporation see fig 1 c moran et al 1994 according to merlin et al 2012 the see can be obtained for each point in the t v scatter plot using eq 3 3 se e i t s max t s i t s max t s min the parameters ts max and ts min are shown in fig 1 c the parameter ts i is the soil skin temperature of the ith point which is affected by the vegetation temperature tv according to eq 4 4 t s i lst f v t v 1 f v where fv is the satellite derived fractional vegetation cover that is considered as the normalized ndvi in merlin et al 2012 tv is calculated from tv max and tv min by different formulas depending on the zone in which the corresponding pixel is located see fig 1 c and the situation which controls the temperature of the pixel in zone a and zone d the temperature of the pixels is mainly controlled by soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration respectively on the other hand both soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration control the temperature of the pixels located in zones b and c merlin et al 2012 more information on relationship between see and soil moisture can be found in merlin et al 2018 since 2008 the see along with some other t v indices has been expanded to improve the spatial resolution of passive microwave sm data piles et al 2011 merlin et al 2012 sánchez ruiz et al 2014 djamai et al 2016 malbéteau et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 also amazirh et al 2018 employed see index to calibrate sentinel 1 radar data and then to retrieve smc 2 2 proposed method a new annual t v scatter plot as mentioned in section 1 despite the many benefits and success of the t v scatter plot methods the application of those methods suffer from two main restrictions firstly the accuracy of the indices extracted from t v scatter plot depend directly on how accurately the dry and wet edges are defined on this basis one cannot expect high accuracy when there are insufficient pixels with comprehensive temperature and vegetation conditions to form true wet and dry edges secondly the smc index maps obtained on different days are not necessarily comparable because they are extracted from different t v scatter plots and thus calculated by various wet and dry edges this issue complicates the long term monitoring of the smc in the areas chosen for those 1 day driven indexes to address the problems mentioned above this paper proposes a new scatter plot in which 1 year interval data are applied rather than the commonly used 1 day scatter plots this newly proposed scatter plot eliminates the previously mentioned problems in two ways firstly because the 1 year period provides more comprehensive information about the occurrence of humidity and the vegetation conditions e g dry soil saturated soil healthy vegetation and stressed vegetation the corners and edges of the trapezoidal shape can be more reliably determined secondly in using annual data in one scatter plot the obtained smc indexes for all points regardless of their date or location in the study area will be comparable because they are all computed from the edges and the corners of a unique t v scatter plot this makes it possible to compare the index maps obtained on different days thus allowing us to study the soil moisture for any required period of time the horizontal axis of the new scatter plot the horizontal axis of the proposed scatter plot is a factor of the vegetation fraction and is calculated using the following equation 5 ndv i ndvi n d v i min ndv i max n d v i min n where ndvimin and ndvimax are the minimum and maximum ndvi over the time period in which the t v scatter plot is produced the parameter n is a function of leaf orientation distribution within the canopy this parameter was set a value of 2 in some previous articles yang et al 2015 zhu et al 2017 carlson and petropoulos 2019 and 1 in some other ones gillies and carlson 1995 sandholt et al 2002 merlin et al 2010 2012 rahimzadeh bajgiran et al 2013 djamai et al 2016 since yang et al 2015 argued that the estimated smc is not sensitive to variations in this parameter and also vegetation factor has its own non linear effect on our smc index this parameter was set to 1 in this article consequently the vegetation fraction index is the normalized ndvi and takes into account the different vegetation conditions in the different regions in other words the normalized ndvi which varies between 0 and 1 in all regions equalizes the trapezoidal shape in the proposed t v scatter plot the vertical axis of the new scatter plot similar to other t v scatter plot methods the vertical axis of our proposed scatter plot is a factor of the surface temperature in light of the 1 year data integration in the proposed method the land surface temperate lst cannot be a proper candidate for this temperature factor the reason is that the surface temperature on different days in addition to being affected by smc is influenced by air temperature and this violates the theoretical equal air temperature assumption in temperature vegetation methods moran et al 1994 in this study three replacement temperature factors are suggested and verified eq 6 to eq 8 6 t 1 l s t day t a day 10 30 a m 7 t 2 l s t night t a night 10 30 p m 8 t 3 l s t day l s t night where lstday and lstnight refer to the land surface temperature in daytime and nighttime respectively determined according to remote sensing techniques in this study using modis data further the parameter ta represents the instantaneous air temperature at satellite overpass time eq 6 is devised based on the theory of simplified aerodynamic resistance energy balance or residual method in which the t v scatter plot method is applied to estimate the sensible heat fluxes h and evapotranspiration ef jiang and islam 1999 according to this theory in temperature equilibrium condition the wet edge of the lst ta v scatter plot with minimum lst ta has some essential features including maximum evapotranspiration ef 1 and minimum heat flux h 0 eq 7 is the same as eq 6 with the exception that in the eq 7 the descending lst and ta at 10 30 pm are utilized instead of ascending ones at 10 30 am since in some regions descending images taken at night are less covered by clouds this temperature factor is suggested to allow us to conclude the possibility of replacing this factor with eq 6 unlike the eqs 6 and 7 eq 8 is based on thermal inertia theory in which apparent thermal inertia ati as a proxy of energy exchange has a negative relationship to the difference in brightness temperature between day and night satellite overpasses lstday lstnight scheidt et al 2010 according to this theory the smallest value of lstday lstnight indicates the largest amount of thermal inertia which represents the maximum ef in the image and vice versa zhang et al 2003 huang et al 2006 2 3 proposed smc index evaporative fraction index improved soil effective efficiency isee in addition to the new annual scatter plot we have also designed a new smc index in so doing we first extract an evaporative fraction index from the annual t v scatter plot and then convert it to the smc index using one of the well known relationships between these two parameters to determine the evaporative fraction index from the t v scatter plot the relationship between evaporative fraction ef as the ratio of evapotranspiration et to the available energy carlson and petropoulos 2019 and priestley taylor parameter as a representative of effective resistance to evapotranspiration is applied jiang and islam 2001 9 ef et r n g φ δ δ γ where δ is the slope of saturated vapor pressure and air temperature hpa k 1 and γ is the psychometric constant hpa k 1 the δ δ γ value which is also called the air temperature control parameter and is typically used to normalize the ef for atmospheric effects is highly dependent on the air temperature rahimzadeh bajgiran et al 2013 in this paper we applied the simplified alternative equation proposed by wang et al 2006 as a very close approximate of δ δ γ eq 10 10 δ δ γ 0 0127 t a 0 3464 where ta is the air temperature centigrade wang et al 2006 although this factor is ignored in most previous methods we have considered it due to the fact that our method is based on the scatter plot produced from different days of the year and with different atmospheric conditions and air temperatures it is worth mentioning that this aerodynamic term accounts for the effect of various wind speed and air temperature conditions stisen et al 2008 as mentioned in section 0 φ in eq 9 is a soil moisture dependent parameter that can be driven from t v scatter plot in this paper we propose a new index called improved see isee as a representative of φ this new index is inspired from 1 the trapezoidal method used to calculate the see from t v scatter plot djamai et al 2016 and 2 the fact that in a t v scatter plot those points with equal evapotranspiration are not arranged as a line but located on a curve stisen et al 2008 accordingly isee index of the ith point in the scatter plot is derived as eq 11 11 ise e i t i max t i t i max t i min s e e max s e e i min s e e i min seemax refers to the highest possible amount of soil evaporations and vegetation transpiration that belongs to the points on the wet edge in 1 year t v scatter plot these points are assumed to have ef 1 and thus according to eq 9 one can conclude that seemax δ γ δ seei min on the other hand represents the lowest possible amount of evaporations and vegetation transpiration for the ith point in an specific ndvi which can be obtained via the following non linear formula eq 12 stisen et al 2008 12 se e i min s e e max n d v i i 2 in eq 11 ti max calculated by putting the vegetation factor ndvi of the ith point into the line equation that connects the highest and lowest isee points a and b respectively in fig 2 a ti min represents the minimum temperature obtained from the wet edge line the prerequisite for determining the above mentioned parameters is the locations of points a and b and the dry and wet edges of fig 2 a should also be defined in advance however it has been always a challenge in all t v scatter plot methods researchers argue that this challenge arises from the fact that apparent daily dry and wet edges are not formed properly in most single day t v scatter plots alternatively some approaches have been proposed in the literature to find out theoretical wet and dry edges zhang et al 2008 long and singh 2012 yang et al 2015 these techniques however require the additional collection and application of environmental parameters such as surface emissivity long wave radiation atmospheric transmissivity incident solar radiation and etc in light of that we apply a 1 year scatter plot a variety of humidity and the vegetation conditions are involved to generate the t v scatter plot e g dry soil saturated soil healthy and stressed vegetation as a result the apparent corners and edges of the trapezoidal shape are properly formed and hence we could manage to find out the dry and wet edges based on the simple technique proposed by merlin et al 2012 which does not require any auxiliary data according to merlin et al 2012 the annual wet edge is regarded as the line that passes through 1 tv min while at the same time all pixels with ndvi 0 5 are located above it in this case tv min is the minimum value of the temperature factor in the plot similarly the annual dry edge is described as a line that passes through 1 tv max when pixels with ndvi 0 5 are all located below that line tv max is however the temperature factor of a vegetated pixel with the highest water stress a temperature albedo scatter plot is used to find this pixel according to merlin et al 2012 initially the pixel temperature which has the highest albedo is selected as tv max next the ndvi of the selected pixel is checked if the ndvi of this pixel is greater than 0 5 the selection is approved otherwise tv max is alternatively set to tv min obviously the determination of tv min and tv max in the temperature vegetation scatter plots can affect the final results since tv min has a firm method of estimation an uncertainty in isee determination is likely to happen according to the possible variations in the estimation of tv max this uncertainty is more serious for those points close to the dry edge and is limited to 0 5 b a where b and a shows the distances of a hypothetical point to the wet edge and dry edge respectively fig 2 a shows in blue the locus of points with equal values of the soil evaporation efficiency index isee in our method the iso lines with identical isee index are curved lines in contrast to most of the previous methods that leaded to direct iso lines in the t v scatter plot this curvature of iso lines is caused by the nonlinear relationship between seei min and seemax in eq 12 curvatures of iso lines imply that the value of the evapotranspiration index changes nonlinearly from the point a with minimum evapotranspiration to the point b with maximum evapotranspiration along the ab line see fig 2 a in other words along the ab line isee index will increase slowly for low ndvi and more rapidly for high ndvi this assumption is introduced and applied to calculate φ by stisen et al 2008 smc index as the last step of our proposed method we need to devise a soil moisture index driven from the soil evaporation efficiency index isee hereinafter we call this index as smisee for this reason we have adopted the equation from noilhan and planton 1989 as the relationship between smc and evaporative fraction index and devised eq 13 which comprises the soil evaporation efficiency index isee 13 s m isee a r cos 1 2 i s e e it must be noted that a variety of linear or nonlinear relationship between these two parameter has been developed and analyzed in many previous literatures noilhan and planton 1989 merlin et al 2010 rahimzadeh bajgiran et al 2013 carlson and petropoulos 2019 of major works covering this issue one could point out to merlin et al 2010 which put forward the claim that over some conditions where soil properties are not available eq 13 is more efficient for retrieving soil moisture fig 2 b shows the smisee curves in the t v scatter plot in contrast to isee fig 2 a these curves are no longer distanced equally in fact the loci of points with equal soil moisture index are curves with different distances which are in contrast to the equal distanced linear shapes assumed in most previous indices reported in the literature fig 3 summarizes the general procedure for determining our proposed soil moisture index smisee using modis products and other in situ parameters the lst products of modis mod11a1 with 1 km spatial resolution for 1 year intervals were downloaded and those images with more than 20 cloudy pixels were excluded from the whole procedure in these products cloudy pixels were masked out using modis quality flags data after selecting non cloudy days ti images including t1 t2 and t3 were then produced using the lst day the lst night and the air temperature for the remaining non cloudy days for non cloudy days ndvi images were produced from the reflectance of the red and nir bands of the modis products mod09a1 with 0 5 km spatial resolution which had already been re sampled to a 1 km spatial resolution the ndvi images were then obtained using eq 5 modis albedo products mod43b3 with 463 m resolution were also used in a first step to locate and exclude snowy pixels as those with an albedo value larger than 0 5 in addition these products were used alongside t and ndvi data in later steps to select vegetation pixels with maximum water stress the mcd43a3 product provides both hemispherical and bi hemispherical reflectance in this study bi hemispherical reflectance shortwave white sky albedo was applied the annual t v scatter plot was then produced using non cloudy images and non snowy pixels tv min and tv max annual wet and dry edges as well as the ab line were all determined using the produced t v scatter plot air temperature of all days used to calculate the δ δ γ value of each day and then to calculate the seemax value for points on the wet edge finally for each point in t v scatter plot isee and smisee are calculated from eqs 12 and 13 as mentioned earlier the extraction of smc indices from the t v scatter plot is grounded on the assumption that all other parameters affecting soil temperature and vegetation index are equal for all points it must be kept in mind that despite the modeling of many atmospheric parameters excluding the damaged pixels from the proposed method and shrinking of the study area to reduce the atmospheric and underlying surface changes this assumption could not be generalized as a result the accuracy of the proposed method might be affected by some uncertainties sources such as cloud shadows soil wetness in deeper layers non modeling effects of atmospheric conditions dependency of the vegetation and temperature factor on the soil and vegetation type and etc in this paper the correlation coefficient r was used to measure the existing correlation between the proposed smisee index and the ground soil moisture data in addition the p value was used to show the significance of the results this measure declares the strength of a statistical claim or null hypothesis results with higher values of correlation coefficient as close as possible to one and a lower p value as close as possible to zero are more statistical relevant 3 study area and in situ data 3 1 spanish study area one of the study areas of this paper is part of the remedhus network this network is located in the duero basin in spain 5 13 5 63 w 41 14 41 48 n and contains 23 soil moisture estimation stations among which 19 were exploited fig 4 shows the spatial extent of the study area that encompasses 19 in situ stations of remedhus network and also 40 30 pixels of modis image with 1 km spatial resolution the remedhus network is located in an area with various soil texture characteristics different percentage of sand clay and silt at different stations diverse land cover rained cereals in the rainy season in winter and spring and irrigated crops such as sugar beet corn and potatoes in summer and various smc situations at 1 year intervals leng et al 2015 these features along with easy access to the temperature and soil moisture measurements of the stations in the network make it useful for many studies sánchez et al 2010 sánchez ruiz et al 2014 in the remedhus stations the surface soil moisture is measured using stevens hydra probe sensors located 5 cm underground in hydra probe sensors an oscillator produces and radiates an electromagnetic signal of 50 mhz and a receiver measures the reflected signal this reflected signal depends on the real dielectric constant which increases with humidity mcnairn et al 2015 in this study we employed surface soil moisture and soil temperature data measured at the 0 5 cm depth for the year 2010 during that year only 19 stations were actively recording data it is worth noting that among all of the available hourly data we only applied the average recorded between 10 am and 11 am modis ascending overpass time and 10 pm and 11 pm modis descending overpass time in addition to the data from the remedhus network we also employed the existing information on air temperature that was measured at a nearby meteorological station in spain 41 72 n 5 30 w at the satellite overpass time 10 30 am for modis terra daytime and 10 30 pm for modis terra nighttime since the region of interest is rather flat with a slope of 10 12 the effect of topographic changes on air temperature was ignored zhang et al 2014 3 2 canadian study area the second study area is the site of the smapvex12 fields located in the canadian red river watershed in southern manitoba canada 97 7 98 5 w 49 40 50 n djamai et al 2016 the smapvex12 network contains 55 agricultural fields utilized by agriculture and agri food canada aafc manitoba agriculture food and rural development mafrd and the united states department of agriculture usda mcnairn et al 2015 fig 5 shows the spatial extent of the study area where encompasses all of the smapvex12 fields and also 90 70 pixels of modis image with 1 km spatial resolution in this part of canada agricultural fields with different types of soil from clay in the east to loam in the west are covered with various crops including cereals 23 4 of the area soybeans 18 5 corn 9 1 canola 16 0 and grassland and pasture 14 6 mcnairn et al 2015 the vegetation cover of this study area is quite massive so the average ndvi obtained from the modis data was approximately 0 7 during the study period this feature along with variations in the range of soil type makes it possible to study the effect of full vegetation cover and different soil type on the proposed method the smc of these fields was measured between june 6 and july 17 2012 using stevens water hydra and delta theta probes at the soil surface 0 5 cm and at depths of 5 cm 20 cm 50 cm 100 cm and 150 cm mcnairn et al 2015 in each of the smapvex12 fields the soil moisture content is measured in 16 stations in two rows at each station three measurements are performed every half hour to ensure the accuracy of the measurement and the mean of these measurements was introduced as the smc of the fields rowlandson et al 2013 as in the remedhus network the volumetric surface soil moisture at the 0 5 cm depth measured at 10 30 am and 10 30 pm are applied to validate the proposed method also the air temperature measured at the ascending and descending overpass time was downloaded for the year 2012 given that the region has a maximum topographic gradient of 2 this air temperature can be considered to be the same across the entire study area hosseini and mcnairn 2017 4 results and discussion 4 1 a visual inspection of t v scatter plots daily vs annual as mentioned earlier a major challenge in the estimation of the smc index in t v methods results from the ambiguities in the identification of the daily dry and wet edges which are mainly due to the non comprehensive temperature and vegetation conditions liu and yue 2018 yang and zhang 2019 to investigate this issue t v scatter plots of the smapvex12 network belong to various days in 2012 are shown and visually inspected in fig 6 a g in these scatter plots the horizontal axis is the ndvi and the vertical axis stands for t1 eq 6 according to fig 6 a g the ideal trapezoidal diagram in the t v scatter plot was not correctly formed on any of the days because all the required humidity and vegetation conditions did not occur together in one image on some days such as 181 215 2012 when vegetation is prominent and there is no bare soil pixel in the image the chart was not formed at all see fig 6 d e this makes it impossible to utilize the temperature vegetation scatter plot to estimate the smc index for these days zhang and zhou 2016 further on some days such as 147 2012 if the daily wet and dry edges are determined using previous methods the two parallel edges will be extracted that will not formed ideal triangular or trapezoidal shape these conditions compelled us to collect some extra parameters and implement more difficult methods to find out the wet and dry edges zhang et al 2014 however when the scatter plot consists of pixels of images belonging to all non cloudy and non snowy days during the 1 year interval fig 6 h the ideal trapezoidal shape mentioned by merlin et al 2012 and trustworthy edges can be clearly identified the lines shown in fig 6 h are the isee curves along which the evapotranspiration has the same value it is worth noting that 1 day scatter plots shown in fig 6 a g are not similar as each one refers to a different day they are also very different from the 1 year scatter plot in fig 6 h since none of them is made up of the comprehensive conditions of the 1 year scatter plot similar results for the remedhus area can be found in fig 7 which shows the scatter plots of the remedhus network for some selected days of 2010 fig 7 a g on the daily scatter plots of this region not only the ideal scattering space not developed but also the density of the points on the scatter plot was very low which makes it difficult to determine the apparent wet and dry edges the reason for this situation is that in some areas such as the remedhus neighborhood where the topographic changes are high the area of the image needs to be shrunk to reduce the topographic changes ran et al 2005 this shrinking of the image diminishes the number of pixels in the image and also the number and density of the points in the scatter plot as seen in fig 7 a g there is no day in which a well shaped trapezoidal chart is obtained and this is the consequence of the small number of pixels this limitation is however addressed for the 1 year case see fig 7 h furthermore one can point to the different shapes of the 1 year t v scatter plots in the two regions although in both regions these 1 year period triangles are much more similar to the ideal trapezoidal shape than those in the 1 day charts they are obviously different the reason for this can be traced to the different annual vegetation cover and soil characteristics of these regions piles et al 2011 as mentioned earlier the vegetation fraction and its changes in the smapvex12 network are much higher than those of the remedhus network this makes the diagram created for the smapvex12 closer to the theoretical triangular shape in nearly the same way one can conclude that the annual smc condition of the study area along with annual vegetation cover can affect the performance of the proposed scatter plot as indicated previously the basic premise of the 1 year scatter plot argument is the existence of pixels with comprehensive humidity conditions over a one year interval as a result in some specific annual humidity situations such as long term droughts or continuous rainfall the ideal trapezoidal diagram in the t v scatter plot may not be correctly formed in cases that these specific conditions are likely to happen it is preferable to extend the 1 year to longer periods to assure the formation of a comprehensive scatter plot meanwhile the investigation of this issue which requires a wide range of in situ smc data over extreme humidity situations is recommended for future studies 4 2 investigating the effects of different temperature factors fig 8 shows the t v scatter plot formed by the 1 year interval data for the remedhus top row and the smapvex12 areas bottom row with different temperature factors including lstday t1 ls t day t a day 10 30 a m t2 ls t night t a night 10 30 p m as well as t3 ls t day l s t night fig 8 a g clearly shows that when using the lstday the plot and its graphs are far from the desired theoretical trapezoidal shape see fig 1 c this can be explained by the fact that the average surface temperature varies on different days mainly due to factors such as air temperature wind speed and different amounts of solar radiation this issue simply violates the assumption of having an equal radiation situation for those pixels that participate in the formation of the temperature vegetation scatter plot this inspection suggests gathering several dates in a single t v scatter plot without normalizing for atmospheric forcing is improper an attempt was made to compare the other three temperature factors t1 t2 and t3 for that matter the soil moisture indices were computed using all of these three factors and were evaluated through correlation coefficient analysis for both study area table 1 in table 1 n1 represents the total number of days during the year that was used to construct the scatter plot n2 is the number of days on which the ground references were available and thus were applied for the validation of the results the correlation coefficient and its p value were estimated for each individual station 19 stations in remedhus and 50 stations in smapvex12 sites using the smisee and the in situ smc values of all n2 days these values were then averaged over the stations and were reported in the last columns of table 1 it must be noted that the performance of temperature factors t1 and t2 in calculating smc indices are investigated by in situ smc values at modis ascending overpass time smc10 30am and modis descending overpass time smc10 30pm respectively on the other hand daily average smc smc10 30am smc10 30pm 2 is applied to evaluate the soil moisture indices computed using temperature factor t3 according to table 1 the temperature vegetation approach in the spanish region has better performance than in the canadian region as stated by garcia et al 2014 this is likely because of that the temperature vegetation approach is more suitable for the water limited region than the radiation limited region garcia et al 2014 on the other hand this is perhaps due to the different vegetation covers in these two study areas where vegetation in the smapvex12 has twice the density of that in the remedhus area see table 1 in fact optical and thermal data such as the modis data is less sensitive to soil parameters including moisture content in dense vegetation cover leng et al 2014 petropoulos et al 2015 however despite the average ndvi of 0 68 in the smapvex12 region there is still a promising correlation between the soil moisture measurements and the proposed index table 1 also shows that in both regions t2 lstnight tanight 10 30 pm is the least appropriate temperature index since it yielded the lowest correlation coefficient and the largest p value more than 0 01 compared to the two other temperature factors on the other hand t1 lstday taday 10 30 am appears especially appealing with the largest correlation coefficient and a p value close to zero in order to deep the comparison between t1 and the other two temperature factors t2 and t3 a correlation study was conducted for both study regions the results which are presented in fig 9 indicate a weak correlation between t1 and t2 in spite of the fact that both of these factors represent the sensible heat fluxes see section 2 2 this lack of correlation between t1 and t2 can explain inappropriate performance of t2 in estimating smc index the presumption of using the residual method lst ta in the t v scatter plot is that the air vegetation and near surface soil are in thermal equilibrium temperature equilibrium is achieved when vertical profile of soil temperature is uniform and the difference between canopy and soil temperature is minimized that usually happens at 6 00 am or times close to 6 00 am like 10 00 am this is the reason that daytime lst ta t1 can be an appropriate temperature factor in t v scatter plot temperature equilibrium condition does not exist at 10 00 pm therefore using lstnight tanight 10 30 pm as a near surface soil and canopy temperature factor in t v scatter plot increases the error of soil moisture retrieval on the other hand notwithstanding the physical difference in t1 and t3 show a stronger correlation implying that these two temperature factors could be exchanged and both make a suitable temperature factor in t v scatter plot using the t1 factor is more advantageous compared to t3 since cloud conditions during night does not have to be considered hence more satellite images are available for processing as an example there were 64 cloudless days in the smapvex12 area among which only 24 also had cloudless night conditions see table 1 the propriety of t1 as a measure of temperature implicitly suggests that this factor is a good representative of in situ land surface temperature this temperature factor however requires field information on air temperature which is not always available station based observations are sparsely distributed and may not be representative of the satellite observation scene this leads to uncertainties in ta values to have a measure of this uncertainty we performed a sensitivity analysis and realized a degrading effect of 2 per 1 uncertainties in ta though corresponding uncertainty is negligible we suggest more research on deriving the t v scatter plot based on remote sensing data only according to the above mentioned advantages of t1 in the remaining analysis of this paper t1 was applied as the temperature factor for constructing the t v scatter plots 4 3 an analysis on the optimum period to form the t v scatter plot in this section next question will be tackled what is the impact of the used time span for constructing the t v scatter plot on the performance of the method to estimate smc a first step is the comparison between daily and annual scatter plots in so doing four cloud free days in the year 2010 in the remedhus network which have the most difference in the average smc were selected average smc values which are expressed in third column of table 2 are derived from the soil moisture of the 19 in situ stations for each day two distinct approaches were taken for the estimation of the smisee index 1 using the scatter plot produced from all cloudless days in the year 2010 i e 106 days and 2 using the scatter plot generated only from the pixels of a specific date i e a one day scatter plot the first case implies that the annual dry and wet edges are extracted from the 1 year scatter plot blue curves in fig 10 while in the second case the apparent edges of 1 day scatter plot red curves in fig 10 are used to calculate smisee these apparent edges are selected as two upper and lower isee curves in such a way as to contain all the pixels with ndvi 0 5 in the corresponding image of that day merlin et al 2012 the equation of these wet and dry edges are used to calculate ti max ti min isee and smisee fig 10 shows the selected edges for both cases according to fig 10 the daily apparent edges are very different from their equivalent ones in the 1 year scatter plot leading to different values of calculated soil moisture indices the average values of the calculated index computed over 19 image pixel containing the 19 stations of the remedhus network are presented in the last columns of table 2 one can easily observe a greater consistency between the average smc and the computed average smisee when using the annual scatter plot this conclusion can also be drawn from fig 11 in which the histogram of smc indices are provided for both cases using daily and annual scatter plots the histograms in fig 11 a which are based on the 1 year t v scatter plot are better able to make distinction between the different smc values at their corresponding dates in contrast fig 11 b shows the overlapping histograms which are made up of smc indices driven from daily edges these overlapping histograms take all the values in the range between 0 and 1 while we know that none of these four dates contain pixels with comprehensive soil moisture conditions in addition one can conclude that even if the daily t v scatter plots are sufficiently comprehensive to provide appropriate wet and dry edges the driven smc indices maps of different days are not necessarily comparable because they are extracted from different t v scatter plots another comparison was made at each remedhus station between in situ soil moisture data and remote sensing soil moisture index calculated from 1 the annual edges of 1 year scatter plot and 2 the edges of 1 day scatter plot see fig 10 the results are shown in the fig 12 this figure depicts a promising agreement between the 1 year smisee indices and their corresponding in situ soil moisture data in terms of correlation coefficient while the 1 day index leads to less favorable results the worst cases occurred for the stations i06 and h07 where no meaningful correlation was observed previous investigation has demonstrated that unlike the 1 day scatter plot the proposed scatter plot is able to monitor the changes in moisture condition of stations that have different texture and soil moisture sánchez et al 2010 the next question is whether the whole year period is essential for the scatter plot generation or if one can achieve similar results with only partial year intervals to answer this question ten different periods of the year were selected to provide the data required for scatter plot generation these time intervals and the obtained results for each are summarized in table 3 and fig 13 it can be seen from table 3 and fig 13 that the quality of the smisee index is directly influenced by the time period and the number of days applied to form the t v scatter plot however the time period appears to be more effective than the number of days for instance july 1 to december 30 a six month duration with 38 days exhibits better results than april 1 to june 30 a three month period with 42 days the reason is that the 38 days of the six month period contain more varying vegetation states and temperature conditions to form the corners of t v scatter plot if any general rule may be drawn it is perhaps that the greater the time duration for the t v scatter plot generation the better the results it should be note that one of the main contributions of suggesting a long term scatter plot is to simplify the temperature vegetation method by reducing the axillary in situ data which is required to estimate the daily wet and dry edges and to compare the index maps obtained on different days however applying very long time series data longer than one year interval which requires downloading and processing a large amount of satellite data is in contrast to the provided simplicity of the proposed method on the other hand since the 1 year period provides almost all comprehensive information about the occurrence of humidity and the vegetation conditions e g dry soil saturated soil healthy vegetation and stressed vegetation it seems that a very long time series data could not provide new information however some other t v scatter plot based on a long time series spanning several years may suggest for future studies 4 4 investigating the effect of soil texture and vegetation cover on the accuracy of the methodology remote sensing indexes are typically designed to represent a specific environmental parameter e g the smisee as an index of smc a serious issue of an index could be its dependence on other environmental factors the purpose of this section is to investigate the possible correlation between the smisee and two important soil characteristics namely soil texture and the percentage of vegetation cover to verify the impact of soil texture all the stations in both the smapvex12 and the remedhus networks were considered these stations cover different soil texture conditions which make them a good case for the analysis sánchez et al 2010 djamai et al 2016 the estimated smisee values for all above mentioned stations were analyzed during the whole year and their correlation coefficients with the ground measured smcs were determined to examine any probable relationship between the performance of the proposed smc index and the soil texture conditions these estimated r values were plotted against the percentage of sand silt and clay as shown in fig 14 a c at the first investigation of these results it seems that there is no clear relationship between the proposed smisee index and the soil texture parameters however more researches on richer data sets are required to draw any firm conclusions about these statistical relationships next we investigate the possible relationship between the proposed smisee index and the percentage of vegetation cover which is a serious concern in all soil moisture content indexes the average and standard deviation of the ndvi as a vegetation density index on the different days of the study periods in the 55 smapvex12 and 19 remedhus stations show a large diversity of ndvi for both regions while the smapvex12 region has a higher vegetation density see section 4 2 the correlation coefficient of the smisee index and the smc in all the existing stations of the networks were determined for each day an attempt was then made to investigate the possible relationship between these r values and the average ndvi of the days the result is presented fig 15 which provides evidence that there is almost no clear meaningful statistical relationship while most of the previous indices are not applicable in dense vegetated areas zhang and zhou 2016 hosseini and mcnairn 2017 zhu et al 2017 the proposed smisee index proved to be insensitive to the vegetation cover since it could achieve to satisfactory results in almost all vegetation covers 4 5 general evaluation of smisee and its comparison to the some recent alternatives in this section we first follow a spatial correlation analysis between in situ smc of each pixels and the proposed smisee index the results are then compared with some successful alternatives recently proposed in the literature to this end smapvex12 network data is applied as it contains more stations 49 nun forests stations for smapvex12 vs 19 stations for remedhus and obviously leading to more reliable correlation coefficients fig 16 shows the obtained results of spatial correlation analyses performed between the estimated smisee data and their corresponding field measurements at the depth of 0 5 cm in 10 days of the year 2012 each of which are shown in an individual chart in these charts each point represents an image pixel containing at least one smc monitoring station for pixels in which more than one station exists the average of measurements of those stations is considered as ground measurement according to fig 16 for each day estimated smc index obtained from 1 year scatter plot generally had correlation coefficients better than 0 5 with in situ smc meanwhile coefficient of determination r2 is 0 5 in most cases to the best of our knowledge there is no standard guideline to determine the level of predictive acceptance for r2 as a rule of thumb henseler et al 2009 suggests that 0 25 r2 0 5 can be regarded as a moderate and acceptable results on the other hand linear correlations between smisee index and in situ smc which are in ranging from 0 51 to 0 77 behave not the same since different linear relations are obtained this suggests more research to convert smisee index to smc which usually requires some extra remote sensing data such as microwave images in the reminder of this section the use of the smisee index for monitoring the soil moisture content is compared with some of the common previously used indices which are introduced in table 4 these alternative indices are dissimilar to the proposed smisee index in two respects 1 they use different equations and 2 in contrast to the smisee which is obtained from a 1 year scatter plot they are driven from daily scatter plots to investigate the effect of each of these factors alternative indices were computed not only from the original one day scatter plot but also from our proposed 1 year scatter plot the obtained results are presented in table 5 for both the smapvex12 and the remedhus networks from the findings shown in table 5 one can conclude that 1 using our proposed 1 year scatter plot improves the performance of previous smc herein the see the non linear φ and the itvdi in the both region of interest and 2 the proposed smisee outperforms other smc indices noted in the literature which explains the suitability of non linear relationship between the location of the points in t v scatter plot and their soil moisture index 5 conclusion soil moisture content is an important environmental parameter that is most commonly extracted from remote sensing images via temperature vegetation relationships these techniques however suffer from being inaccurate in areas of dense vegetation and they provide daily scaled indices that are not necessarily consistent when driven from different days this paper proposes a long term scatter plot herein a nine month to 1 year period which is accompanied by a novel soil moisture index that can properly address both of the above mentioned limitations the proposed long term scatter plot allows for a comprehensive plot in which more humidity and vegetation situation are involved in this kind of plot the pixels related to days with dry soil conditions happen at the top of the trapezoid and yield to the definition of a reliable annual dry edge on the other hand pixels that represent wet soils are mostly placed at the bottom of the chart leading to a well defined annual wet edge three different temperature factors namely lstday taday lstnight tanight and lstday lstnight were used as the temperature factors i e the vertical axis in the proposed 1 year scatter plot the results demonstrated that lstday taday is the most appropriate choice in addition the proposed index of soil moisture content defines a non linear relation herein a cosine one between the position of a point in the t v scatter plot and its corresponding soil effective evaporation a detailed analysis of the challenges as well as the capability of the proposed method to deal with them was conducted across ground truth samples from two different networks including the smapvex12 network in canada and the remedhus network in spain generally the comparison between soil moisture indices regarded in 2 cases i temporal comparison and ii spatial comparison in the case of temporal comparison smc indices associated to a specific location are compared for different dates according to the results shown in table2 figs 11 and 12 smc indices map of different days extracted from daily t v scatter plot and calculated by different daily dry and wet edge are not necessarily comparable while the reliable and long term annual dry and wet edges allow us to compare the humidity condition of a specific point in a specific day with not only other points in that day but also all points in a one year interval in the case of spatial comparison for a specific day moisture indices associated to different locations are compared the results of fig 16 demonstrate that there exist significant linear correlations between smisee index and in situ smc for all 10 days in smapvex12 site while these linear relations are not the same for all days and show their daily normalization changes from date to date actually in different days our soil moisture index is related to the true soil moisture values with different gain and offset parameters this suggests more research to convert smisee index to smc by combining t v indices with some other remote sensing soil moisture products such as microwave images furthermore the proposed method was compared to three other well known indices the see the itvdi and the φ the results were compared in terms of the correlation coefficient between the index value and the corresponding soil moisture content with very promising correlation coefficients of 0 74 and 0 65 for the remedhus and the smapvex12 networks respectively demonstrating the suitability of the proposed methodology in addition it was realized that the long term t v scatter plot could improve the accuracy of the other indices reported in the literature although the best performance to date is achieved by the proposed smisee index based on recent explanations one can conclude that our proposed method has two obvious advantages over recent t v scatter plot methods firstly our proposed method makes it impossible to utilize the temperature vegetation scatter plot to estimate the smc index even on those days when the one day t v scatter plot is not formed at all secondly this method allows us to compare the index maps obtained on different days and to monitor the smc conditions for any desired long term period without the requirement of any auxiliary data moreover outperforms the other smc indices mentioned in the literature in light of the multiple uses of the remote sensing optical and thermal data for improving the spatial resolution of passive microwave soil moisture products further validations could be conducted to assess the validity and utility of the smisee index in downscaling of microwave remote sensing

5926,specific storage which represents the aquifer s capacity to release water from or take into storage when water level changes is an important aquifer property required for transient groundwater modeling and water resources management this review synthesizes the published literature on using different methods to estimate field specific storage of aquifers the field methods include pumping tests slug tests and analyses of sea tides atmospheric loading and earth tides and seismic waves the present state of knowledge concerning the analytical and numerical models and parameter estimating procedures are presented and applications of these models are discussed specific storage values from 182 different field sites are collected covering a wide range of aquifer materials including unconsolidated deposits and rocks the geometric mean of specific storage for unconsolidated deposits mainly range from 10 5 to 10 4 m 1 the geometric mean of specific storage for different types of rocks mainly range from 10 7 to 10 6 m 1 the corresponding hydraulic conductivity shows a wider range of variation than the specific storage there is not a clear relationship between specific storage and hydraulic conductivity for all the data but a positive correlation can be found for some types of aquifer materials specific storage is positively correlated with porosity of the aquifer a comparison of the different field methods is presented and future research directions are recommended keywords specific storage groundwater aquifer hydraulic conductivity pumping test 1 introduction determination of specific storage is always involved in quantitative studies of transient groundwater flow problems specific storage is also an important parameter for transient groundwater modeling an accurate value of specific storage is very important for a transient groundwater flow model to produce reliable results an accurate estimation of aquifer specific storage is also essential for proper groundwater resource evaluation and management folnagy et al 2013 however specific storage varies by orders of magnitude and there are significant uncertainties in the estimated values rau et al 2018 uncertainties in specific storage are greater than those of specific yield scanlon et al 2003 furthermore researchers found that estimations of storativity from pumping test data are much less reliable than those of transmissivity mishra and guyonnet 1992 singh 2008 analysis of pumping test data show that estimations of transmissivity from each observation well at a field site is very similar to each other however the corresponding storativity values span a broad range meier et al 1998 for example the specific storage values determined by different methods at one field site can span 7 orders of magnitude quinn et al 2016 similar results can be found in slug test analysis audouin and bodin 2008 found that the estimated specific storage varies over 5 orders of magnitude at a site while the estimated hydraulic conductivity only varies over 2 orders of magnitude similarly shapiro and hsieh 1998 found that the estimated specific storage varies over 8 orders of magnitude at a site while the estimated hydraulic conductivity only varies over 4 orders of magnitude the purpose of this paper is to present a review of field methods to estimate specific storage and synthesize field specific storage values of different aquifer materials determined by these methods field methods to estimate specific storage for confined unconfined and leaky aquifers are reviewed the first part of this paper is focused on the theoretical concept of specific storage the second part is focused on the various field methods including pumping test slug test sea tides atmospheric loading and earth tides and seismic waves the third part is focused on the field specific storage data and the relationships between specific storage and other aquifer hydraulic properties 2 theoretical concept

storage generally there are five field methods frequently used to estimate in situ specific storage in aquifers the methods involve analyses of pumping test data slug test data sea tides atmospheric loading and earth tides and seismic waves 3 1 pumping test pumping test is the most commonly used in situ test to estimate aquifer hydraulic parameters the analysis of drawdowns induced by pumping from a well to estimate aquifer hydraulic properties has become a basic tool of hydrogeology black and kipp 1977 pumping tests are usually performed with one pumping well and several observation wells drawdown in the pumping well and the observation wells are recorded during pumping drawdown data obtained during a pumping test are used in combination with the analytical solutions or numerical models to estimate aquifer parameters including specific storage comprehensive reviews on pumping test analysis are given by dawson and istok 1991 and batu 1998 generally there are two approaches to estimate aquifer hydraulic parameters from a pumping test the first approach is using analytical solutions with curve matching and the second one is using numerical models to simulate the pumping test data overall the first method is more widely used only models for constant rate pumping test analysis in aquifers with field applications are reviewed in these models s s is assumed to be a constant throughout the pumping tests pumping tests in heterogeneous aquifers pumping rate variation and scaling effects are beyond the scope of this study 3 1 1 pumping tests in confined aquifers theis 1935 proposed the first method to estimate aquifer parameters from transient pumping test in a confined aquifer theis 1935 derived an analytical solution for flow to a well pumping at a constant rate from a homogeneous confined aquifer of infinite lateral extents the theis type curve method is based on the theis 1935 solution to estimate aquifer hydraulic parameters the type curve method is a curve matching process in which four steps are included jacob 1940 firstly the type curve based on the theis 1935 solution is plotted on a logarithmic tracing paper secondly observed drawdowns are plotted on a logarithmic tracing paper to the same scale as that used for the type curve thirdly drawdown plot is superimposed on the graph of type curve to achieve the best fit between the two curves lastly select a match point and calculate aquifer hydraulic parameters transmissivity t and storativity s from match point coordinates jacob 1940 if the aquifer thickness b is known then specific storage can be calculated by s s s b a description of the theis type curve method can also be found in wenzel 1942 cooper and jacob 1946 developed an approximation of the theis 1935 solution and proposed the straight line method to estimate aquifer hydraulic parameters based on the approximation the straight line method does not require type curve matching and is applicable for large times of pumping and small values of radial distance from the pumping well the semi logarithmic plot of the observed drawdowns fall on a straight line and aquifer hydraulic parameters t and s are determined based on the straight line chapuis 1992b used the cooper jacob approximation cooper and jacob 1946 to account for pumping well storage effects in a confined aquifer and estimated aquifer t and s from a field pumping test details on the type curve method using the theis 1935 solution and the straight line method can also be found in many groundwater books e g freeze and cherry 1979 dawson and istok 1991 batu 1998 domenico and schwartz 1998 fetter 2001 there are numerous field applications of the thies 1935 model in the literature jacob 1940 cooper and jacob 1946 boulton 1954 pinder and bredehoeft 1968 grisak and cherry 1975 rushton and booth 1976 chander et al 1981 randolph et al 1985 rushton and weller 1985 şen 1986 robson and banta 1990 schad and teutsch 1994 jiao 1996 trefry and johnston

shen et al 2015 quinn et al 2016 the theis 1935 solution has become a benchmark for pumping test analysis in confined aquifers furthermore many field applications of the cooper and jacob 1946 method can also be readily found jacob 1950 neuman and witherspoon 1972 grisak and cherry 1975 grimestad 1995 meier et al 1998 lee and lee 1999 van tonder et al 2001 leng and yeh 2003 stober and bucher 2005 stober and bucher 2007 ni et al 2011 stober 2011 shaver 2012 quinn et al 2016 based on the theis 1935 model chow 1952 also proposed a graphical method to estimate t and s of a confined aquifer from pumping test data field applications of the chow 1952 method can also be found in the literature chander et al 1981 şen 1986 in addition to the graphical methods such as the type curve method and the straight line method researchers also proposed different methods to identify confined aquifer hydraulic parameters from pumping test data the nonlinear least squares method has frequently been used to estimate aquifer hydraulic parameters in confined aquifers in this method the squares of residuals between observed and calculated drawdowns are minimized saleem 1970 chander et al 1981 there are many applications of the nonlinear least squares method to estimate confined aquifer parameters using the theis 1935 equation saleem 1970 mcelwee 1980 chander et al 1981 yeh 1987 jiao 1996 trefry and johnston 1998 wen et al 2010 there are also many other methods based on the theis 1935 equation to identify confined aquifer hydraulic parameters from pumping test data such as the newton s method grimestad 1981 the minimum integral square error method das gupta and joshi 1984 the finite difference approximation method rai 1985 and the slope matching method şen 1986 leng and yeh 2003 proposed an method using the extended kalman filter and cubic spline to estimate aquifer hydraulic parameters based on the theis 1935 solution in a confined aquifer researchers also used the linear least squares method based on the cooper and jacob 1946 equation to estimate confined aquifer parameters rayner 1980 mukhopadhyay 1985 analytical or semi analytical solutions have been developed to modify the theis 1935 model or include different conditions black and kipp 1977 provided a modified theis equation accounted for observation well response time and used the new type curves to estimate aquifer hydraulic parameters from a pumping test fenske 1977 presented an extension of the theis 1935 equation to account for pumping well and observation well storage gringarten and ramey 1973

butler 2001 coupled with a nonlinear least squares estimation of hydraulic parameters to model a single well interference slug test in a heterogeneous and anisotropic aquifer 3 2 2 slug tests in unconfined aquifers there are several models which can be used to analyze slug test data in unconfined aquifers the kgs model hyder et al 1994 is a frequently used model in analyzing slug test data aquifer hydraulic parameter estimations using the kgs model can either through type curve analysis butler 1998 belitz and dripps 1999 choi et al 2008 sun 2016 or automated well test analysis package hyder and butler 1995 detailed procedures on estimating aquifer hydraulic conductivity k and specific storage s s using the kgs model type curve method can be found in butler 1998 on the basis of the work of peres et al 1989 spane et al 1996 presented procedures for generating unconfined aquifer slug interference test type curves and used the trial and error curve fitting procedures to estimate aquifer t and s sun 2016 developed a semi analytical solution considering vertical unsaturated flow for analyzing slug test data in an unconfined aquifer and applied the solution to analyze data of three slug test wells malama et al 2016 developed a semi analytical model to analyze cross hole slug test data in an unconfined aquifer and the non linear optimization software pest doherty 2010 was used to estimate s s values 3 3 sea tides the value of specific storage can also be estimated by investigating the response of an aquifer to sea tides as shown by jacob 1950 an analytical solution was derived for the response of hydraulic head in a homogeneous confined aquifer to sinusoidal tidal oscillations generally this analytical solution has been used to estimate hydraulic parameters of coastal aquifers on the basis of this solution aquifer hydraulic diffusivity t s can be calculated erskine 1991 if the transmissivity t of the aquifer is known then the storativity s can be calculated specific storage s s of the aquifer can then be calculated using the aquifer thickness b by s s s b when calculating t s the time lag and tidal efficiency should be obtained base on the measured data the time lag is defined as the time difference between the peaks in the tide data and the piezometer data erskine 1991 the tidal efficiency is defined as the ratio of the amplitude of the tidal fluctuation in potentiometric head in the aquifer to that in the sea carr and van der kamp 1969 transmissivity t of the aquifer are determined by other methods for example pumping tests erskine 1991 storativity s can be determined either from the time lag or the tidal efficiency there are several applications of the analytical solution of jacob 1950 to estimate aquifer s s value when both the tidal efficiency and the time lag are used erskine 1991 zhou 2008 zhou et al 2015 erskine 1991 used both the tidal efficiency and the time lag to calculate s s of a coastal unconfined aquifer with t determined by pumping tests zhou 2008 also used both the tidal efficiency and the time lag to calculate s s of a coastal confined aquifer with multiple observation wells zhou et al 2015 calculated s s of a coastal confined aquifer with one observation well or two observation wells specific storage can also be calculated by combining its definition and the tidal efficiency gregg 1966 carr and van der kamp 1969 carr 1971 gregg 1966 calculated s s of a confined aquifer using the tidal efficiency on the basis of the analytical solution by jacob 1950 and tidal measurements both s s and k of the aquifer can be estimated when s s of the confined aquifer is obtained then k can be calculated based on the s s and time lag carr and van der kamp 1969 carr 1971 used harmonic analysis of tidal fluctuations to estimate k and s s of an confined aquifer near the sea in addition to the analytical solution developed by jacob 1950 a numerical model has also been used to estimate aquifer k and s s by the tidal oscillations elad et al 2017 used a numerical model to simulate the response of groundwater level to sea tides in a coastal unconfined aquifer the tidal effects on groundwater level fluctuations are simulated by a two dimensional vertical cross section model and aquifer k and s s are estimated by calibrating the model 3 4 atmospheric loading and earth tides specific storage can be calculated from the responses of a confined aquifer to changes in atmospheric pressure earth tide can be defined as the solid earth tidal dilatation caused by the lunar and solar tidal forces rhoads and robinson 1979 acworth and brain 2008 water levels in wells fluctuate in response to changes in atmospheric pressure and earth tides the ratio of change in hydraulic head in a well to the change in atmospheric pressure is defined as the barometric efficiency jacob 1940 aquifer s s can be calculated from the barometric efficiency if porosity and pore water compressibility are known jacob 1940 robson and banta 1990 bergelson et al 1998 acworth and brain 2008 burbey et al 2012 acworth et al 2016 2017 cook et al 2017 david et al 2017 the effect of earth tides on water level fluctuations should be removed in the calculation of s s acworth et al 2016 developed a frequency domain method for calculation of barometric efficiency acworth et al 2017 applied the method developed by acworth et al 2016 to calculate aquifer barometric efficiency over depth desbarats et al 1999 developed a dual porosity model for analysis of water level fluctuations induced by atmospheric loading in a fractured rock aquifer and estimated s s values specific storage can also be calculated from the response of a confined aquifer to earth tides specific storage s s is determined from the interaction of stress and fluid pressures in a homogeneous confined aquifer there are several frequently used models in the literature to calculate s s bredehoeft 1967 presented an analytical study on water level changes in response to earth tides and found that s s of a confined aquifer can be computed if poisson s ration of the aquifer is known many studies used the equation derived by bredehoeft 1967 to calculate s s of confined aquifers e g marine 1975 cutillo and bredehoeft 2011 darner and sheets 2012 merritt 2004 presented an approximate equation to the bredehoeft 1967 equation van der kamp and gale 1983 developed equations for analysis of earth tide and atmospheric loading in homogeneous aquifers with compressible solids applications of the van der kamp and gale 1983 model can also be found in fuentes arreazola et al 2018 rojstaczer and agnew 1989 presented equations to compute s s from static confined response of a well to atmospheric loading and earth tides applications of this model to estimate s s of confined aquifers can also be found in the literature lai et al 2013 fuentes arreazola et al 2018 hsieh et al 1987 developed an analytical solution for earth tides response of a confined laterally infinite homogeneous and isotropic aquifer xue et al 2016 used the horizontal flow model hsieh et al 1987 1988 to estimate aquifer permeability and specific storage in a fractured aquifer wang 2000 developed a vertical flow model for water level changes induced by earth tides in a half space applications of the wang 2000 model in field sites can be found in the literature allègre et al 2016 xue et al 2016 several studies used the spectral analysis method and other methods to estimate aquifer s s from the responses of confined aquifers to earth tides narasimhan et al 1984 applied the spectral analysis method to investigate the responses of deep confined aquifers to earth tides and derived an equation for the ratio of s s to porosity ϕ on the basis of the narasimhan et al 1984 equation aquifer s s can be determined if the porosity ϕ is known beavan et al 1991 used the cross spectral analysis method to estimate confined aquifer s s from fluctuations of water levels in wells in response to earth tides and atmospheric loading shih 2018b derived equations for calculating s s of confined aquifers and used the spectral analysis method to interpret the observed water level changes induced by earth tides and atmospheric loading on the basis of the equation given by de wiest 1966 robinson and bell 1971 calculated s s of confined aquifers based on earth tides and atmospheric loading observations rhoads and robinson 1979 developed an equation to calculate s s of an confined aquifer of infinite extent by considering the tidal dilatation of an idealized well aquifer system 3 5 seismic waves analysis of the response of a confined aquifer to seismic waves can also lead to estimations of s s values water levels in open wells fluctuate in response to seismic waves the fluctuations in water levels depends partly on s s of the aquifer cooper et al 1965 many studies used the models derived from earth tide analysis to estimate aquifer s s values the equation provided by bredehoeft 1967 have been used to calculate s s of confined aquifers from the response of the aquifers to seismic waves shi and wang 2014 sun et al 2015 on the basis of the hsieh et al 1987 model yan et al 2016 investigated changes in s s values within a fault damage zone due to earthquakes brodsky et al 2003 used the hsieh et al 1988 model to calculate s s of a confined aquifer shalev et al 2016a used the equation provided by wang 2000 to calculate s s rau et al 2018 used the van der kamp and gale 1983 equation the wang 2000 equation and the acworth et al 2017 equation to calculate s s of a confined aquifer researchers also developed other models to calculate s s from the response of confined aquifers to seismic waves shih 2009 presented a method to estimate s s of a confined aquifer based on spectral analysis of groundwater response to seismic rayleigh waves shih 2009 2017 applied this method to estimate s s in field confined aquifers folnagy et al 2013 proposed a method to estimate specific storage s s from sparse water level measurements during the passage of rayleigh waves and applied the method to a field aquifer 4 field data on specific storage 4 1 summary of observations specific storage data determined by the aforementioned field methods reported in the literature were collected a total of 182 specific storage values were collected including 108 values from pumping tests 13 values from slug tests 6 values from sea tide analysis 12 values from atmospheric loading analysis 33 values from earth tide analysis and 10 values from seismic wave analysis hydraulic conductivity values were collected if available in addition aquifer thickness and porosity of the aquifer were also collected to analyze the relationships between specific storage and these properties the aquifer types include confined aquifer unconfined aquifer leaky aquifer and multilayered aquifer system there are totally 15 types of aquifer materials including 7 types of unconsolidated deposits and 8 types of rocks the classification of unconsolidated deposits and rocks is based on freeze and cherry 1979 in which the aquifer materials are classified as unconsolidated deposits and rocks when summarizing range of hydraulic conductivity values the unconsolidated deposits include a wide variety of materials from gravel to glacial till the rocks also represent a wide variety of materials from shale to basalt details of all the data aquifer materials and corresponding method of data interpretation are provided in the supporting information the model used for estimating each s s value is also given in the supporting information for pumping test analysis if there are two or more observation wells and corresponding specific storage s s and hydraulic conductivity k values are provided then the specific storage s s and hydraulic conductivity k of the aquifer are taken as the geometric mean of the data from all observation wells 4 2 field specific storage values the collected specific storage values show a wide range of variety for each type of aquifer material fig 1 each type of aquifer material was assigned an integer identifier as shown in table 1 each integer in the y axis of fig 1 represents one type of the aquifer material for all types of aquifer materials most of the specific storage s s values are in the range of 10 7 10 3 m 1 generally the s s values of rocks are smaller than those of the unconsolidated deposits there are two extremely low s s values 10 8 m 1 the two extremely low s s values are obtained by the slug test method fig 1 the corresponding aquifer materials are granite and limestone and dolomite supporting information for the two types of aquifer materials the majority of the s s values are higher than 10 7 m 1 specific storage estimated by the slug test method has been found to have high uncertainty because of the small region affected by the test and the insensitivity of the type curves to s s values for some types of aquifer materials there are many s s values reported in the literature such as sand sand and gravel and sandstone on the other hand only several s s values can be found in the literature for some types of aquifer materials such as gravel chalk shale and basalt as can be seen from fig 1 and table 1 the s s values for each type of aquifer material ranges over 1 6 orders of magnitude if we do not include s s values higher than 10 3 m 1 and lower than 10 8 m 1 then the s s values for each type of aquifer material range over about 3 orders of magnitude it can also be seen from fig 1 that for sand and sand and gravel most of s s values are located between 10 6 and 10 3 m 1 table 1 also shows the minimum the maximum and the geometric mean s s values of each type of aquifer material it should be noted that the mean s s of sand sand and gravel sand and cobbles and gravel are close to each other and on the same order of magnitude the geometric mean s s of unconsolidated deposits vary from 1 39 10 5 to 7 70 10 4 m 1 the geometric mean s s of rocks vary from 2 82 10 7 to 1 04 10 5 m 1 a comparison of the specific storage data estimated by the different methods is shown in fig 2 it can be clearly seen that all the s s values estimated by analysis of sea tides atmospheric loading and earth tides are in the range of 10 7 m 10 5 m 1 the s s data obtained by analyzing of seismic waves are also mostly distributed in this range on the contrary the s s values estimated by pumping test analysis and slug test analysis show a wide range of variety the s s values estimated by pumping test analysis and slug test analysis vary by 6 and 7 orders of magnitude all the extremely high and extremely low s s values are obtained by analyses of pumping tests and slug tests the s s values obtained by the slug test method are scattered ranging from 10 9 m to 10 2 m 1 the s s values obtained by the pumping test method range from 10 8 m to 10 2 m 1 although the s s values obtained by the pumping test method are also scattered most of the data points are distributed in the range of 10 6 m 10 3 m 1 4 3 specific storage and hydraulic conductivity overall hydraulic conductivity shows a wider range of variety than that of specific storage fig 3 some previous studies only reported the s s values and these data points were excluded when drawing fig 3 supporting information thus fig 3 only includes the data points that both s s and k values are available compared with the unconsolidated deposits the k values of the rocks show a wider range of variety table 1 shows that the k values of each type of aquifer material range over 1 9 orders of magnitude the minimum the maximum and the geometric mean k values are also given in table 1 although the variations of k values for most types of aquifer materials are wider than those of s s the variation of k values for sand is narrower than that of s s values for sand and sand and gravel most of the k values are in the range of 10 5 10 3 m s the geometric mean k of unconsolidated deposits vary from 8 67 10 7 to 7 96 10 4 m s the geometric mean k of rocks vary from 4 14 10 8 to 7 55 10 3 m s as the two basic hydraulic parameters of an aquifer the s s and k values do not show a clear relationship between them fig 4 overall the data points are scattered and do not show an obvious trend a closer look at the figure indicates that the data points provided by each of the five method also do not show a clear trend although the data points are scattered it seems that s s tends to increase with k a power function was found and can be expressed as 4 k 0 0225 s s 0 66 r 2 0 181 as can be seen from eq 4 the r 2 value is quite low the relationships between k and s s values for 7 types of aquifer materials are shown in fig 5 these types of aquifer materials were chosen because there are more than 5 data points for each type of them a positive trend can be found for sandstone limestone and dolomite and granite fig 5d f in fig 5e and f the data point given by slug test does not seem to represent the general trend and it was not included in the fitting process the fitted power functions for the three types of aquifer materials are also shown in the figure the power law function between k and s s values of granite shows the highest r 2 value fig 5f if we do not consider the three extremely low k values of sand and gravel then a positive trend can also be found fig 5a however a negative trend can be found for glacial till fig 5c the fitted power function for glacial till and the corresponding r 2 value is also shown in fig 5c for sand and fractured igneous and metamorphic rocks the data points are scattered and a clear relationship cannot be found between s s and k fig 5b and g 4 4 specific storage and porosity generally there is a positive relationship between specific storage s s and porosity ϕ fig 6 the higher the porosity ϕ the higher the specific storage s s fig 6 shows that although a positive trend can be found the data points are relatively scattered a power law relationship was fitted between s s and ϕ which is expressed as 5 s s 1 23 10 5 ϕ 0 982 r 2 0 273 it can be seen that the power is very close to 1 and eq 5 should be very close to a linear relationship as can be seen from eq 3 s s and ϕ are positively related theoretically the function fitted from the field data confirms the theoretical relationship between s s and ϕ there are only 50 data points that have both s s and ϕ values among these 50 data points 27 of them are presented by earth tide studies for earth tide analysis both s s and ϕ are estimated at most times although there are 108 data points from pumping test analysis only 9 of them provided ϕ values at the same time it should be noted that the data points provided by sea tide analysis show a negative relationship between s s and ϕ a more clear relationship between s s and ϕ will be found if more data are available especially with more data points from pumping test analysis 4 5 specific storage and aquifer thickness there is a weak negative relationship between specific storage s s and aquifer thickness b fig 7 the larger the aquifer thickness the lower the s s value there are 149 data points in fig 7 most of them are provided by pumping test analysis the majority of the studies on pumping tests provided both s s and aquifer thickness b some studies estimated s and b then s s was calculated from the relationship s s s b on the basis of this relationship there should be a significant negative relationship between s s and b however fig 7 shows that the relationship is not so significant and the data points are relatively scattered a power function was fitted between s s and b which can be written as 6 s s 0 0008 b 1 195 r 2 0 373 the s s values obtained by pumping tests show a great range of variety for a specified aquifer thickness the s s values obtained by slug tests show similar characteristics fig 7 also shows that most of the aquifers have thickness b less than 100 m the results for thick aquifers are mainly presented by pumping test analysis and earth tide studies the relationship between s s and b use the data from analyses of atmospheric loading earth tides and seismic waves is shown in fig 8 this figure only includes the data points that obtained s s independently without using the aquifer thickness b the s s values obtained from the three methods coincide with each other very well a negative relationship can also be seen from fig 8 and a power function was fitted as 7 s s 1 97 10 5 b 0 552 r 2 0 250 the negative relationship indicates that the s s values obtained from the three field methods are significantly affected by the aquifer thickness when the aquifer is thick the s s value estimated using the methods will be low the power function eq 6 is also included in the figure 4 6 specific storage and aquifer type fig 9 shows the frequency distributions of s s values for confined and unconfined aquifers there are 125 data points for confined aquifers and 53 data points for unconfined aquifers this figure clearly shows how the field s s values are distributed based on aquifer types for confined aquifers most of the s s values are distributed in the range of 10 7 10 4 m 1 for unconfined aquifers most of the s s values are distributed in the range of 10 5 10 3 m 1 the interval with the highest frequency for confined aquifers is 10 6 10 5 m 1 the interval with the highest frequency for unconfined aquifers is 10 5 10 4 m 1 the interval with the highest frequency for confined aquifers is one order of magnitude higher than that of the unconfined aquifers it seems that the s s values of unconfined aquifers are relatively higher than those of confined aquifers a comparison of s s values for different aquifer types for three kinds of aquifer materials is shown in fig 10 the aquifers are divided into three types namely confined aquifer unconfined aquifer and leaky aquifer three typical aquifer materials sand and gravel sand and granite are chosen due to the fact that there are many data points for each of them fig 1 there are also many data points for sandstone and fractured igneous and metamorphic rocks fig 1 however there is only one data point for unconfined aquifer for both materials supporting information for sandstone the one data point obtained from unconfined aquifer is very close to the geometric mean s s in table 1 fig 10 shows that there are no significant differences in s s values obtained from confined and unconfined aquifers for a certain type of aquifer material for sand and gravel fig 10a the s s values estimated from confined aquifer and unconfined aquifer are distributed in the same range the data point obtained from leaky aquifer is close to the geometric mean of the s s for sand fig 10b and granite fig 10c most s s values obtained from confined and unconfined aquifers are also distributed in the same range the s s value estimated from leaky aquifer for sand is also close to the geometric mean s s value of sand in table 1 as a result the s s values of a certain aquifer material estimated from different types of aquifers will be similar to each other such a pattern indicates that the s s values are possibly independent of aquifer type and are more closely related to types of aquifer materials this also indicates that s s is a hydraulic property of an aquifer material although the s s values for different aquifers types are distributed almost in the same range the interval with most s s values distributed for unconfined aquifers is higher than that of confined aquifers fig 10a and b this is similar to the result given by fig 9 5 comparison of different field methods the hydraulic properties quantified by different field methods are different from each other a comparison of the hydraulic properties obtained by the field methods is shown in table 2 for pumping test analysis some models estimate s but others estimate s s the aquifer hydraulic properties estimated by pumping test analysis are either t and s or k and s s slug test analysis and sea tide analysis can lead to estimation of the same kind of parameters as those of pumping test analysis the analyses of atmospheric loading earth tides and seismic waves lead to estimation of s s only the s s values obtained from different field methods may show different degree of uncertainty or reliability table 2 the reliability of s s data obtained from pumping test analysis should be high more than a half of the data points in fig 1 are provided by analysis of pumping test data meanwhile most very high s s values are provided by pumping test analysis the reliability of s s values obtained from slug test analysis should be improved the s s values can vary 7 orders of magnitude for different aquifer materials as shown in figs 1 and 2 as a result the s s values obtained from slug test analysis show the greatest degree of variety the reliability of s s data obtained by sea tide analysis using analytical solutions are high because the data points agree well with those obtained by other methods fig 2 however one data point for sand obtained by numerical modeling seems to be too low fig 1 as a result the overall reliability of this method is regarded as medium as shown in table 2 the reliability of s s values obtained from analyses of atmospheric loading and earth tides and seismic waves are high due to the fact that these data points agree well with pumping test data this study provides the first comprehensive analysis on aquifer s s values on the basis of this study a rough estimation of the s s value of a certain type of aquifer material can be obtained without using field tests the easiest way to estimate the s s value of a certain type of aquifer material is using the geometric mean value provided in table 1 for pumping test analysis the analytical and numerical studies listed will help to choose the appropriate analytical or numerical model to analyze the pumping test data the analytical models listed for other methods will also help to choose the most appropriate method for a specific field study for limestone and dolomite and granite aquifers good relationships are found between k and s s fig 5e and f so an relatively accurate s s value can be estimated based on the k value for analyses of atmospheric loading earth tides and seismic waves an approximate s s value can be made based on the aquifer thickness for pumping test analysis in unconfined aquifers the recently developed analytical solutions accounted for the unsaturated zone tartakovsky and neuman 2007 mishra and neuman 2010 2011 seem to provide reasonable s s values the s s values estimated by these studies are mostly distributed in the range of 10 5 10 4 m 1 the corresponding specific yield s y values range from 0 10 to 0 39 with an average of 0 25 the estimated s y value is about 4 orders of magnitude higher than s s which can also be found in other studies e g endres et al 2007 moench 2008 the s s value collected can be used as an initial estimation in transient groundwater flow and solute transport models they can also be used as a reference for groundwater flow and solute transport model calibrations with this study one can get a more accurate estimation of s s value of a certain type of aquifer material than before this is important for the groundwater flow and solute transport models to produce more reliable results it is also important for proper groundwater resources evaluation and management as quantitative transient groundwater studies all need to determine s s the s s values presented are of general importance 6 future research five field methods to estimate s s were reviewed and the number of studies on each method is different among these methods pumping test analyses have been used most frequently because of their broad applicability in various types of aquifers table 2 pumping tests can be performed in a confined aquifer unconfined aquifer leaky aquifer and multilayered aquifer system numerous analytical and numerical models have been developed for pumping test analyses although numerous models have been developed the most frequently used model for confined aquifer pumping test analysis is the theis 1935 model and for unconfined aquifer pumping test analysis is the neuman 1972 1974 models compared with the models for the confined aquifer and unconfined aquifer pumping test analyses models for pumping tests analysis under other conditions are much less more analytical or numerical models should be developed for pumping test analysis under these conditions especially for leaky aquifers multi aquifer systems constant head tests and oscillatory pumping tests pumping rate variation is common during filed pumping tests the classical models for constant rate pumping test analysis cannot be applied to analyze the variable rate pumping test data previous studies have also developed analytical models to analyze such variable rate pumping tests e g abu zied and scott 1963 butt and mcelwee 1985 sen and altunkaynak 2004 mishra et al 2012 zhang 2013 zhuang et al 2019 however field applications of the analytical models are limited sen and altunkaynak 2004 the existing studies are for confined aquifers and the theis 1935 model has often been used as the basis for analysis compared with constant rate pumping test analysis studies on variable rate pumping test analysis are limited more analytical or numerical models are needed to analyze the variable rate pumping test data meanwhile more field applications are also needed to estimate aquifer hydraulic parameters including specific storage in addition models should also be developed to analyze variable rate pumping tests in unconfined aquifers there are also numerous studies on slug test analysis however models can be used to obtain s s of the aquifer are limited for confined aquifer with a fully penetrating well the most frequently used model is the cooper et al 1967 model for confined aquifer with a partially penetrating well the kgs model has generally been used for unconfined aquifers the model frequently used is also the kgs model the s s values available in the literature are also limited and only 13 s s values were obtained as a result more studies or more applications of the models to analyze slug test data may be conducted in the future to improve the reliability of s s obtained from slug test analysis one should improve the sensitivity of the type curves to changes in s s values perhaps new analytical solutions or new data interpretation methods should be developed to increase the reliability of the estimated s s values compared to models for pumping test analysis models for sea tide analysis atmospheric loading and earth tide analysis and seismic wave analysis are much less studies on using sea tides to estimate s s of coastal aquifers are limited and only 6 s s values were collected from the literature more analytical or numerical models should be developed in the future to analyze sea tides to estimate coastal aquifer s s values more applications of the models should also be performed to estimate s s of coastal aquifers there should also be more studies on estimating aquifer s s values from seismic wave analysis furthermore the s s values estimated by seismic wave analysis and earth tide analysis are for confined aquifers only more data are needed for a comprehensive analysis of these field methods for some field methods only about ten s s values can be found there should be more data on s s using these methods including slug test analysis sea tide analysis atmospheric loading analysis and seismic wave analysis furthermore more porosity data should be found or be obtained to build a more clear relationship between s s and porosity ϕ although most earth tide analyses provided porosity values most pumping test analyses do not provide porosity ϕ values among the 108 pumping test studies only 9 of them provided ϕ values concerning the importance of pumping test analysis in estimating s s values more porosity ϕ values should be provided in the future 7 conclusions a review of field methods to estimate aquifer specific storage is conducted and specific storage values presented by these studies are collected and analyzed the present state of knowledge on five field methods frequently used to estimate in situ specific storage in aquifers is presented the five methods include analyses of pumping test data slug test data sea tides atmospheric loading and earth tides and seismic waves both analytical and numerical models are summarized for each of the methods among the five methods the most frequently used and most extensively studied is the pumping test analysis slug test analysis is also a frequently used method to estimate s s of an aquifer compared with pumping test analysis and slug test analysis the other three methods are relatively less studied specific storage values estimated from the five field methods are classified into 15 types these 15 types of specific storage values are corresponding to 15 types of aquifer materials representative specific storage values for each type of aquifer material is obtained and their geometric mean value is also calculated the s s values estimated by slug test analysis show the largest variance followed by pumping test analysis the s s values obtained by other methods coincide with each other very well the field s s values obtained from unconfined aquifers seem to be higher than those of confined aquifers with the representative s s values an approximate estimation of the s s value of a certain type of aquifer material can be made the relationships between specific storage and hydraulic conductivity porosity and aquifer thickness are analyzed there is not a clear relationship between specific storage and hydraulic conductivity only a few types of aquifer materials show a positive relationship between specific storage and hydraulic conductivity there is a positive correlation between specific storage and porosity of the aquifer a negative correlation between specific storage and aquifer thickness can be found based on the current data the relationships between s s and these parameters are not significant a simple relationship cannot be found to estimate s s from neither of these parameters on the basis of this study one can make a rough estimation of specific storage of various types of aquifer materials without using field methods to calculate the specific storage the specific storage values collected can be used as an initial estimation in transient groundwater flow models and in transient solute transport models these values can also be used as a reference for groundwater flow and solute transport models calibration purposes the synthesized s s values will help the groundwater flow and solute transport models produce more reliable results and improve groundwater resources evaluation and management the s s data presented will also provide a

5926,specific storage which represents the aquifer s capacity to release water from or take into storage when water level changes is an important aquifer property required for transient groundwater modeling and water resources management this review synthesizes the published literature on using different methods to estimate field specific storage of aquifers the field methods include pumping tests slug tests and analyses of sea tides atmospheric loading and earth tides and seismic waves the present state of knowledge concerning the analytical and numerical models and parameter estimating procedures are presented and applications of these models are discussed specific storage values from 182 different field sites are collected covering a wide range of aquifer materials including unconsolidated deposits and rocks the geometric mean of specific storage for unconsolidated deposits mainly range from 10 5 to 10 4 m 1 the geometric mean of specific storage for different types of rocks mainly range from 10 7 to 10 6 m 1 the corresponding hydraulic conductivity shows a wider range of variation than the specific storage there is not a clear relationship between specific storage

determination of specific storage is always involved in quantitative studies of transient groundwater flow problems specific storage is also an important parameter for transient groundwater modeling an accurate value of specific storage is very important for a transient groundwater flow model to produce reliable results an accurate estimation of aquifer specific storage is also essential for proper groundwater resource evaluation and management folnagy et al 2013 however specific storage varies by orders of magnitude and there are significant uncertainties in the estimated values rau et al 2018 uncertainties in specific storage are greater than those of specific yield scanlon et al 2003 furthermore researchers found that estimations of storativity from pumping test data are much less reliable than those of transmissivity mishra and guyonnet 1992 singh 2008 analysis of pumping test data show that estimations of transmissivity from each observation well at a field site is very similar to each other however the corresponding storativity values span a broad range meier et al 1998 for example the specific storage values determined by different methods at one field site can span 7 orders of magnitude quinn et al 2016 similar results can be found in slug test analysis audouin and bodin 2008 found that the estimated specific storage varies over 5 orders of magnitude at a site while the estimated hydraulic conductivity only varies over 2 orders of magnitude similarly shapiro and hsieh 1998 found that the estimated specific storage varies over 8 orders of magnitude at a site while the estimated hydraulic conductivity only varies over 4 orders of magnitude the purpose of this paper is to present a review of field methods to estimate specific storage and synthesize field specific storage values of different aquifer materials determined by these methods field methods to estimate specific storage for confined unconfined and leaky aquifers are reviewed the first part of this paper is focused on the theoretical concept of specific storage the second part is focused on the various field methods including pumping test slug test sea tides atmospheric loading and earth tides and seismic waves the third part is focused on the field specific storage data and the relationships between specific storage and other aquifer hydraulic properties 2 theoretical concept

storage generally there are five field methods frequently used to estimate in situ specific storage in aquifers the methods involve analyses of pumping test data slug test data sea tides atmospheric loading and earth tides and seismic waves 3 1 pumping test pumping test is the most commonly used in situ test to estimate aquifer hydraulic parameters the analysis of drawdowns induced by pumping from a well to estimate aquifer hydraulic properties has become a basic tool of hydrogeology black and kipp 1977 pumping tests are usually performed with one pumping well and several observation wells drawdown in the pumping well and the observation wells are recorded during pumping drawdown data obtained during a pumping test are used in combination with the analytical solutions or numerical models to estimate aquifer parameters including specific storage comprehensive reviews on pumping test analysis are given by dawson and istok 1991 and batu 1998 generally there are two approaches to estimate aquifer hydraulic parameters from a pumping test the first approach is using analytical solutions with curve matching and the second one is using numerical models to simulate the pumping test data overall the first method is more widely used only models for constant rate pumping test analysis in aquifers with field applications are reviewed in these models s s is assumed to be a constant throughout the pumping tests pumping tests in heterogeneous aquifers pumping rate variation and scaling effects are beyond the scope of this study 3 1 1 pumping tests in confined aquifers theis 1935 proposed the first method to estimate aquifer parameters from transient pumping test in a confined aquifer theis 1935 derived an analytical solution for flow to a well pumping at a constant rate from a homogeneous confined aquifer of infinite lateral extents the theis type curve method is based on the theis 1935 solution to estimate aquifer hydraulic parameters the type curve method is a curve matching process in which four steps are included jacob 1940 firstly the type curve based on the theis 1935 solution is plotted on a logarithmic tracing paper secondly observed drawdowns are plotted on a logarithmic tracing paper to the same scale as that used for the type curve thirdly drawdown plot is superimposed on the graph of type curve to achieve the best fit between the two curves lastly select a match point and calculate aquifer hydraulic parameters transmissivity t and storativity s from match point coordinates jacob 1940 if the aquifer thickness b is known then specific storage can be calculated by s s s b a description of the theis type curve method can also be found in wenzel 1942 cooper and jacob 1946 developed an approximation of the theis 1935 solution and proposed the straight line method to estimate aquifer hydraulic parameters based on the approximation the straight line method does not require type curve matching and is applicable for large times of pumping and small values of radial distance from the pumping well the semi logarithmic plot of the observed drawdowns fall on a straight line and aquifer hydraulic parameters t and s are determined based on the straight line chapuis 1992b used the cooper jacob approximation cooper and jacob 1946 to account for pumping well storage effects in a confined aquifer and estimated aquifer t and s from a field pumping test details on the type curve method using the theis 1935 solution and the straight line method can also be found in many groundwater books e g freeze and cherry 1979 dawson and istok 1991 batu 1998 domenico and schwartz 1998 fetter 2001 there are numerous field applications of the thies 1935 model in the literature jacob 1940 cooper and jacob 1946 boulton 1954 pinder and bredehoeft

pumping test data field applications of the chow 1952 method can also be found in the literature chander et al 1981 şen 1986 in addition to the graphical methods such as the type curve method and the straight line method researchers also proposed different methods to identify confined aquifer hydraulic parameters from pumping test data the nonlinear least squares method has frequently been used to estimate aquifer hydraulic parameters in confined aquifers in this method the squares of residuals between observed and calculated drawdowns are minimized saleem 1970 chander et al 1981 there are many applications of the nonlinear least squares method to estimate confined aquifer parameters using the theis 1935 equation saleem 1970 mcelwee 1980 chander et al 1981 yeh 1987 jiao 1996 trefry and johnston 1998 wen et al 2010 there are also many other methods based on the theis 1935 equation to identify confined aquifer hydraulic parameters from pumping test data such as the newton s method grimestad 1981 the minimum integral square error method das gupta and joshi 1984 the finite difference approximation method rai 1985 and the slope matching method şen 1986 leng and yeh 2003 proposed an method using the extended kalman filter and cubic spline to estimate aquifer hydraulic parameters based on the theis 1935 solution in a confined aquifer researchers also used the linear least squares method based on the cooper and jacob 1946 equation to estimate confined aquifer parameters rayner 1980 mukhopadhyay 1985 analytical or semi analytical solutions have been developed to modify

maas 1987 developed a solution by laplace transform and numerical laplace inversion for drawdown in leaky and confined multi aquifer systems pumping at a constant rate sahoo and jha 2017 used the model developed by hemker and maas 1987 to analyze the pumping test data in a multi aquifer system hemker 1999 developed a hybrid analytical numerical solution for transient radial and vertical flow to a well in a layered aquifer székely et al 2015 applied the method of hemker 1999 to analyze pumping test data in layered rhyolitic volcanic formations aquifer hydraulic properties are first estimated by the traditional method and then calibrated by a numerical model miyake et al 2008 conducted pumping tests in a multi aquifer system and estimated aquifer hydraulic parameters using the cooper jacob method cooper and jacob 1946 and calibrated the estimated parameters using a finite element numerical model for multilayered leaky aquifer systems researchers also used numerical methods to simulate pumping tests and estimate aquifer hydraulic parameters bredehoeft and pinder 1970 presented a quasi three dimensional coupled finite difference model for the response of multilayered aquifer system to pumping in which flow was assumed horizontal in aquifers and vertical in confining layers fujinawa 1977 developed a coupled finite element model accounted for one dimensional vertical flow through the aquitard and two dimensional horizontal flow in aquifers to analyze quasi three dimensional groundwater flow chen and jiao 1999 applied the fujinawa 1977 method to analyze a pumping test in a multilayered aquifer system székely 1992 presented a numerical method and the software test to estimate drawdown and flow rate in a multiple leaky aquifer system székely 1995 used the test code székely 1992 to analyze pumping test data obtained from an aquifer system with three layers halford 1997 used an optimization routine coupled to vs2dt healy 1990 to estimate aquifer hydraulic parameters in a aquifer system consists of three aquifers separated by two leaky confining units aquifer hydraulic parameters are estimated by minimizing the differences between simulated and measured drawdowns 3 1 5 pumping tests in large diameter wells in a large diameter well water stored in the well cannot be neglected when conducting pumping tests large diameter wells are well suited for aquifers with low transmissivity t or hard rock aquifers singh 2008 papadopulos and cooper 1967 presented an analytical solution for flow to a large diameter fully penetrating well pumping at a constant rate from a homogeneous isotropic confined aquifer which also accounted for water stored within the well type curves were presented for estimating aquifer parameters from drawdown data the type curve method has been widely used to estimate aquifer hydraulic parameters t and s based on the papadopulos and cooper 1967 solution singh and gupta 1986 1988 sakthivadivel and rushton 1989 chapuis 1992b moharir et al 2017 in addition wikramaratna 1985 proposed a new set of type curves to analyze pumping test data based on the papadopulos and cooper 1967 solution basically there are two methods to estimate aquifer hydraulic parameters from pumping tests in large diameter wells one is the curve matching method based on analytical solutions i e type curve method and the other is the use of a numerical model to simulate the pumping test the curve matching method is to superimpose the field drawdown time data on the type curve and find the best fit for the numerical method simulated drawdown time curves are matched to the measured drawdown time curves and parameters are determined from the best fit in addition to the analytical solution developed by papadopulos and cooper 1967 many other analytical solutions have also been developed by researchers to analyze pumping test data in large diameter wells boulton and streltsova 1976 presented an analytical solution for flow to a large diameter partially penetrating well pumping at a constant rate in a homogeneous anisotropic unconfined aquifer tables of values of the drawdown function for selected values of parameters and type curves from the drawdown function are presented boulton and streltsova 1976 used the type curve method to determine aquifer hydraulic parameters t and s from this solution moench 1985 derived analytical solutions for transient flow to a large diameter well with well bore skin as the papadopulos and cooper 1967 solution is applicable in linear radial flow şen 1990 developed an analytical solution and presented type curves accounted for nonlinear flow to a large diameter fully penetrating well in a confined aquifer butler and zhan 2004 developed a semi analytical solution for flow to a well in a highly permeable confined aquifer many numerical models have also been constructed to simulate pumping tests in large diameter wells rushton and holt 1981 presented a numerical method using implicit finite difference to simulate pumping tests in large diameter wells rushton and singh 1983 adapted the numerical model of rushton and holt 1981 to analyze pumping test data in large diameter wells with pumping rate decreases with drawdown singh and gupta 1986 presented a numerical model for analyzing pumping test data in a large diameter well later singh and gupta 1988 presented a numerical method to analyze pumping test data for a large diameter well situated near a hydrogeological boundary the aquifer hydraulic parameters estimated by the singh and gupta 1986 and singh and gupta 1988 models are transmissivity t and storativity s sakthivadivel and rushton 1989 proposed a numerical model for estimating aquifer hydraulic conductivity and storativity from pumping tests in large diameter wells taking into account the seepage face aquifer hydraulic conductivity k and storativity s were first estimated using the type curves of papadopulos and cooper 1967 then the parameter values were modified by the trial and error method until a satisfactory agreement is obtained between measured and simulated drawdowns sakthivadivel and rushton 1989 singh 2008 proposed an optimization method for estimating t and s from drawdowns in large diameter wells due to unsteady pumping the optimization process is realized by minimizing the integral squared error between the simulated and measured drawdowns in the well if the aquifer thickness b is known then specific storage s s can be calculated 3 1 6 constant head tests in addition to the constant rate pumping tests stated above researchers also developed theories for well flow and data analysis of constant head tests in a constant head test water level in the pumping well is maintained constant and the pumping rate is monitored during the test generally it is a method used to estimate aquifer hydraulic parameters when the test aquifer is of low permeability jacob and lohman 1952 presented an analytical solution for constant drawdown test analysis in confined aquifers and provided graphical method to estimate t and s from pumping tests data mishra and guyonnet 1992 developed approximate solutions for analysis of observation well responses during constant head tests in a confined homogeneous and isotropic aquifer of infinite lateral extent procedures to estimate t and s from observation well drawdown data are also presented mishra and guyonnet 1992 the mishra and guyonnet 1992 method was also applied to analyze the constant head test data in a confined aquifer hiller and levy 1994 chen and chang 2002 used cumulative volume of constant head injection test to estimate t and s of a confined aquifer and applied the method to analyze data from a field example chen and chang 2003 presented an analytical solution for constant head pumping test analysis in an homogeneous and anisotropic unconfined aquifer type curve method is used by chen and chang 2003 to estimate aquifer hydraulic parameters including hydraulic conductivity k and specific storage s s lin et al 2017 proposed an analytical model for analyzing constant head pumping tests in a leaky unconfined aquifer system and applied the solution to a field test in addition to the analytical studies jones 1993 used numerical models to estimate k and s s of unweathered glacial till 3 1 7 oscillatory pumping tests oscillatory pumping test is an alternative method for aquifer testing different to the traditional constant rate pumping tests water is pumped and injected into the aquifer periodically and pressures are recorded at observation points during a oscillatory pumping test aquifer parameter estimation is performed by matching the measured amplitudes and phases with analytical solutions of a confined aquifer or unconfined aquifer rabinovich et al 2015 various analytical solutions have been derived for this purpose black and kipp 1981 rasmussen et al 2003 dagan and rabinovich 2014 the aquifer hydraulic parameters estimated are hydraulic conductivity k specific storage s s and specific yield s y although oscillatory pumping tests have several advantages for aquifer characterization they are not widely used in practice cardiff and barrash 2015 cardiff and sayler 2016 currently there are only a few field applications of oscillatory pumping tests in the literature rasmussen et al 2003 renner and messar 2006 maineult et al 2008 rabinovich et al 2015 fischer et al 2018 researchers also presented methods for design and analysis of oscillatory pumping tests cardiff et al 2013 bakhos et al 2014 cardiff and barrash 2015 in addition cardiff and sayler 2016 presented an analytical formula that can be used to avoid phase wrapping issues in oscillatory pumping tests 3 2 slug test 3 2 1 slug tests in confined aquifers slug test is also a commonly used technique to estimate aquifer hydraulic parameters including hydraulic conductivity k and specific storage s s similar to pumping test analysis slug test data are also generally analyzed using analytical solutions in slug tests performed in wells fully penetrating confined aquifers the data are generally analyzed using the cooper et al 1967 model the cooper et al 1967 model was developed for the analysis of slug test data in a homogeneous isotropic confined aquifer of uniform thickness with a fully penetrating well there are many field applications of the cooper et al 1967 model to interpret slug test data black 1985 melville et al 1991 hinsby et al 1992 guyonnet et al 1993 jones 1993 butler and hyder 1994 mcelwee et al 1995a 1995b butler et al 1996 butler 1998 chapuis 1998 shapiro and hsieh 1998 belitz and dripps 1999 doan et al 2006 audouin and bodin 2007 koussis and akylas 2012 ostendorf et al 2015b chirindja et al 2017 martos rosillo et al 2018 there are several methods to estimate aquifer hydraulic parameters based on the cooper et al 1967 solution one of the frequently used method to estimate aquifer transmissivity t and storativity s is the type curve method a family of type curves and a graphical solution technique was presented by cooper et al 1967 detailed procedures of the type curve method can also be found in the literature dawson and istok 1991 batu 1998 butler 1998 rozos et al 2015 estimation of t and s are also made by minimizing the sum of the squared residuals between the measured data and the cooper et al 1967 solution guyonnet et al 1993 shapiro and hsieh 1998 paradis and lefebvre 2013 the automated well test analysis program suprpump bohling and mcelwee 1992 was also applied to perform the model fitting butler and hyder 1994 mcelwee et al 1995b in partially penetrating wells hyder et al 1994 derived a semi analytical solution for describing flow of groundwater in response to a slug test accounted for partial penetration anisotropy elastic storativity and well skin this model is referred to as the kgs model in the literature the kgs model can be used to interpret slug tests in both confined and unconfined aquifers generally the type curve method is used for aquifer parameter estimation based on the kgs model detailed procedures on the type curve method can be found in butler 1998 the aquifer hydraulic parameters estimated are k and s s field applications of the kgs model with the type curve method for aquifer hydraulic parameter estimations can be found butler 1998 butler et al 2002 paradis and lefebvre 2013 other models for slug test analysis have also been developed ramey et al 1975 provided semilog type curves for the analysis of slug test data from fully penetrating wells the ramey et al 1975 method is the most common approach for analyzing slug test data with well skin effect butler 1998 chakrabarty and enachescu 1997 applied the deconvolution approach peres et al 1989 to remove wellbore storage effects in analyzing slug test data in this approach slug test data is transformed into equivalent drawdown data that induced by a constant rate pumping test without wellbore storage effects the ramey et al 1975 method was also applied by chakrabarty and enachescu 1997 to obtain aquifer t and s butler and zhan 2004 developed a semi analytical solution for analysis of slug test data in highly permeable aquifers koussis and akylas 2012 developed a complete quasi steady flow model for analyzing of slug tests performed in wells fully penetrating homogeneous confined aquifers the type curve method was used to estimate radial hydraulic conductivity and specific storage s s rozos et al 2015 coupled the koussis and akylas 2012 model with an optimization method to automate the estimation of hydraulic conductivity and specific storage audouin and bodin 2008 developed a semi analytical solution for analyzing of cross hole slug tests in fractured aquifers the solution includes inertial effects at both test and observation wells and couples an automatic inversion algorithm for estimating aquifer hydraulic parameters from field data liu et al 2015 developed a double porosity model for slug test analysis in a sloping fracture zone paradis and lefebvre 2013 used the two dimensional finite difference flow model lr2dinv bohling and butler 2001 coupled with a nonlinear least squares estimation of hydraulic parameters to model a single well interference slug test in a heterogeneous and anisotropic aquifer 3 2 2 slug tests in unconfined aquifers there are several models which can be used to analyze slug test data in unconfined aquifers the kgs model hyder et al 1994 is a frequently used model in analyzing slug test data aquifer hydraulic parameter estimations using the kgs model can either through type curve analysis butler 1998 belitz and dripps 1999 choi et al 2008 sun 2016 or automated well test analysis package hyder and butler 1995 detailed procedures on estimating aquifer hydraulic conductivity k and specific storage s s using the kgs model type curve method can be found in butler 1998 on the basis of the work of peres et al 1989 spane et al 1996 presented procedures for generating unconfined aquifer slug interference test type curves and used the trial and error curve fitting procedures to estimate aquifer t and s sun 2016 developed a semi analytical solution considering vertical unsaturated flow for analyzing slug test data in an unconfined aquifer and applied the solution to analyze data of three slug test wells malama et al 2016 developed a semi analytical model to analyze cross hole slug test data in an unconfined aquifer and the non linear optimization software pest doherty 2010 was used to estimate s s values 3 3 sea tides the value of specific storage can also be estimated by investigating the response of an aquifer to sea tides as shown by jacob 1950 an analytical solution was derived for the response of hydraulic head in a homogeneous confined aquifer to sinusoidal tidal oscillations generally this analytical solution has been used to estimate hydraulic parameters of coastal aquifers on the basis of this solution aquifer hydraulic diffusivity t s can be calculated erskine 1991 if the transmissivity t of the aquifer is known then the storativity s can be calculated specific storage s s of the aquifer can then be calculated using the aquifer thickness b by s s s b when calculating t s the time lag and tidal efficiency should be obtained base on the measured data the time lag is defined as the time difference between the peaks in the tide data and the piezometer data erskine 1991 the tidal efficiency is defined as the ratio of the amplitude of the tidal fluctuation in potentiometric head in the aquifer to that in the sea carr and van der kamp 1969 transmissivity t of the aquifer are determined by other methods for example pumping tests erskine 1991 storativity s can be determined either from the time lag or the tidal efficiency there are several applications of the analytical solution of jacob 1950 to estimate aquifer s s value when both the tidal efficiency and the time lag are used erskine 1991 zhou 2008 zhou et al 2015 erskine 1991 used both the tidal efficiency and the time lag to calculate s s of a coastal unconfined aquifer with t determined by pumping tests zhou 2008 also used both the tidal efficiency and the time lag to calculate s s of a coastal confined aquifer with multiple observation wells zhou et al 2015 calculated s s of a coastal confined aquifer with one observation well or two observation wells specific storage can also be calculated by combining its definition and the tidal efficiency gregg 1966 carr and van der kamp 1969 carr 1971 gregg 1966 calculated s s of a confined aquifer using the tidal efficiency on the basis of the analytical solution by jacob 1950 and tidal measurements both s s and k of the aquifer can be estimated when s s of the confined aquifer is obtained then k can be calculated based on the s s and time lag carr and van der kamp 1969 carr 1971 used harmonic analysis of tidal fluctuations to estimate k and s s of an confined aquifer near the sea in addition to the analytical solution developed by jacob 1950 a numerical model has also been used to estimate aquifer k and s s by the tidal oscillations elad et al 2017 used a numerical model to simulate the response of groundwater level to sea tides in a coastal unconfined aquifer the tidal effects on groundwater level fluctuations are simulated by a two dimensional vertical cross section model and aquifer k and s s are estimated by calibrating the model 3 4 atmospheric loading and earth tides specific storage can be calculated from the responses of a confined aquifer to changes in atmospheric pressure earth tide can be defined as the solid earth tidal dilatation caused by the lunar and solar tidal forces rhoads and robinson 1979 acworth and brain 2008 water levels in wells fluctuate in response to changes in atmospheric pressure and earth tides the ratio of change in hydraulic head in a well to the change in atmospheric pressure is defined as the barometric efficiency jacob 1940 aquifer s s can be calculated from the barometric efficiency if porosity and pore water compressibility are known jacob 1940 robson and banta 1990 bergelson et al 1998 acworth and brain 2008 burbey et al 2012 acworth et al 2016 2017 cook et al 2017 david et al 2017 the effect of earth tides on water level fluctuations should be removed in the calculation of s s acworth et al 2016 developed a frequency domain method for calculation of barometric efficiency acworth et al 2017 applied the method developed by acworth et al 2016 to calculate aquifer barometric efficiency over depth desbarats et al 1999 developed a dual porosity model for analysis of water level fluctuations induced by atmospheric loading in a fractured rock aquifer and estimated s s values specific storage can also be calculated from the response of a confined aquifer to earth tides specific storage s s is determined from the interaction of stress and fluid pressures in a homogeneous confined aquifer there are several frequently used models in the literature to calculate s s bredehoeft 1967 presented an analytical study on water level changes in response to earth tides and found that s s of a confined aquifer can be computed if poisson s ration of the aquifer is known many studies used the equation derived by bredehoeft 1967 to calculate s s of confined aquifers e g marine 1975 cutillo and bredehoeft 2011 darner and sheets 2012 merritt 2004 presented an approximate equation to the bredehoeft 1967 equation van der kamp and gale 1983 developed equations for analysis of earth tide and atmospheric loading in homogeneous aquifers with compressible solids applications of the van der kamp and gale 1983 model can also be found in fuentes arreazola et al 2018 rojstaczer and agnew 1989 presented equations to compute s s from static confined response of a well to atmospheric loading and earth tides applications of this model to estimate s s of confined aquifers can also be found in the literature lai et al 2013 fuentes arreazola et al 2018 hsieh et al 1987 developed an analytical solution for earth tides response of a confined laterally infinite homogeneous and isotropic aquifer xue et al 2016 used the horizontal flow model hsieh et al 1987 1988 to estimate aquifer permeability and specific storage in a fractured aquifer wang 2000 developed a vertical flow model for water level changes induced by earth tides in a half space applications of the wang 2000 model in field sites can be found in the literature allègre et al 2016 xue et al 2016 several studies used the spectral analysis method and other methods to estimate aquifer s s from the responses of confined aquifers to earth tides narasimhan et al 1984 applied the spectral analysis method to investigate the responses of deep confined aquifers to earth tides and derived an equation for the ratio of s s to porosity ϕ on the basis of the narasimhan et al 1984 equation aquifer s s can be determined if the porosity ϕ is known beavan et al 1991 used the cross spectral analysis method to estimate confined aquifer s s from fluctuations of water levels in wells in response to earth tides and atmospheric loading shih 2018b derived equations for calculating s s of confined aquifers and used the spectral analysis method to interpret the observed water level changes induced by earth tides and atmospheric loading on the basis of the equation given by de wiest 1966 robinson and bell 1971 calculated s s of confined aquifers based on earth tides and atmospheric loading observations rhoads and robinson 1979 developed an equation to calculate s s of an confined aquifer of infinite extent by considering the tidal dilatation of an idealized well aquifer system 3 5 seismic waves analysis of the response of a confined aquifer to seismic waves can also lead to estimations of s s values water levels in open wells fluctuate in response to seismic waves the fluctuations in water levels depends partly on s s of the aquifer cooper et al 1965 many studies used the models derived from earth tide analysis to estimate aquifer s s values the equation provided by bredehoeft 1967 have been used to calculate s s of confined aquifers from the response of the aquifers to seismic waves shi and wang 2014 sun et al 2015 on the basis of the hsieh et al 1987 model yan et al 2016 investigated changes in s s values within a fault damage zone due to earthquakes brodsky et al 2003 used the hsieh et al 1988 model to calculate s s of a confined aquifer shalev et al 2016a used the equation provided by wang 2000 to calculate s s rau et al 2018 used the van der kamp and gale 1983 equation the wang 2000 equation and the acworth et al 2017 equation to calculate s s of a confined aquifer researchers also developed other models to calculate s s from the response of confined aquifers to seismic waves shih 2009 presented a method to estimate s s of a confined aquifer based on spectral analysis of groundwater response to seismic rayleigh waves shih 2009 2017 applied this method to estimate s s in field confined aquifers folnagy et al 2013 proposed a method to estimate specific storage s s from sparse water level measurements during the passage of rayleigh waves and applied the method to a field aquifer 4 field data on specific storage 4 1 summary of observations specific storage data determined by the aforementioned field methods reported in the literature were collected a total of 182 specific storage values were collected including 108 values from pumping tests 13 values from slug tests 6 values from sea tide analysis 12 values from atmospheric loading analysis 33 values from earth tide analysis and 10 values from seismic wave analysis hydraulic conductivity values were collected if available in addition aquifer thickness and porosity of the aquifer were also collected to analyze the relationships between specific storage and these properties the aquifer types include confined aquifer unconfined aquifer leaky aquifer and multilayered aquifer system there are totally 15 types of aquifer materials including 7 types of unconsolidated deposits and 8 types of rocks the classification of unconsolidated deposits and rocks is based on freeze and cherry 1979 in which the aquifer materials are classified as unconsolidated deposits and rocks when summarizing range of hydraulic conductivity values the unconsolidated deposits include a wide variety of materials from gravel to glacial till the rocks also represent a wide variety of materials from shale to basalt details of all the data aquifer materials and corresponding method of data interpretation are provided in the supporting information the model used for estimating each s s value is also given in the supporting information for pumping test analysis if there are two or more observation wells and corresponding specific storage s s and hydraulic conductivity k values are provided then the specific storage s s and hydraulic conductivity k of the aquifer are taken as the geometric mean of the data from all observation wells 4 2 field specific storage values the collected specific storage values show a wide range of variety for each type of aquifer material fig 1 each type of aquifer material was assigned an integer identifier as shown in table 1 each integer in the y axis of fig 1 represents one type of the aquifer material for all types of aquifer materials most of the specific storage s s values are in the range of 10 7 10 3 m 1 generally the s s values of rocks are smaller than those of the unconsolidated deposits there are two extremely low s s values 10 8 m 1 the two extremely low s s values are obtained by the slug test method fig 1 the corresponding aquifer materials are granite and limestone and dolomite supporting information for the two types of aquifer materials the majority of the s s values are higher than 10 7 m 1 specific storage estimated by the slug test method has been found to have high uncertainty because of the small region affected by the test and the insensitivity of the type curves to s s values for some types of aquifer materials there are many s s values reported in the literature such as sand sand and gravel and sandstone on the other hand only several s s values can be found in the literature for some types of aquifer materials such as gravel chalk shale and basalt as can be seen from fig 1 and table 1 the s s values for each type of aquifer material ranges over 1 6 orders of magnitude if we do not include s s values higher than 10 3 m 1 and lower than 10 8 m 1 then the s s values for each type of aquifer material range over about 3 orders of magnitude it can also be seen from fig 1 that for sand and sand and gravel most of s s values are located between 10 6 and 10 3 m 1 table 1 also shows the minimum the maximum and the geometric mean s s values of each type of aquifer material it should be noted that the mean s s of sand sand and gravel sand and cobbles and gravel are close to each other and on the same order of magnitude the geometric mean s s of unconsolidated deposits vary from 1 39 10 5 to 7 70 10 4 m 1 the geometric mean s s of rocks vary from 2 82 10 7 to 1 04 10 5 m 1 a comparison of the specific storage data estimated by the different methods is shown in fig 2 it can be clearly seen that all the s s values estimated by analysis of sea tides atmospheric loading and earth tides are in the range of 10 7 m 10 5 m 1 the s s data obtained by analyzing of seismic waves are also mostly distributed in this range on the contrary the s s values estimated by pumping test analysis and slug test analysis show a wide range of variety the s s values estimated by pumping test analysis and slug test analysis vary by 6 and 7 orders of magnitude all the extremely high and extremely low s s values are obtained by analyses of pumping tests and slug tests the s s values obtained by the slug test method are scattered ranging from 10 9 m to 10 2 m 1 the s s values obtained by the pumping test method range from 10 8 m to 10 2 m 1 although the s s values obtained by the pumping test method are also scattered most of the data points are distributed in the range of 10 6 m 10 3 m 1 4 3 specific storage and hydraulic conductivity overall hydraulic conductivity shows a wider range of variety than that of specific storage fig 3 some previous studies only reported the s s values and these data points were excluded when drawing fig 3 supporting information thus fig 3 only includes the data points that both s s and k values are available compared with the unconsolidated deposits the k values of the rocks show a wider range of variety table 1 shows that the k values of each type of aquifer material range over 1 9 orders of magnitude the minimum the maximum and the geometric mean k values are also given in table 1 although the variations of k values for most types of aquifer materials are wider than those of s s the variation of k values for sand is narrower than that of s s values for sand and sand and gravel most of the k values are in the range of 10 5 10 3 m s the geometric mean k of unconsolidated deposits vary from 8 67 10 7 to 7 96 10 4 m s the geometric mean k of rocks vary from 4 14 10 8 to 7 55 10 3 m s as the two basic hydraulic parameters of an aquifer the s s and k values do not show a clear relationship between them fig 4 overall the data points are scattered and do not show an obvious trend a closer look at the figure indicates that the data points provided by each of the five method also do not show a clear trend although the data points are scattered it seems that s s tends to increase with k a power function was found and can be expressed as 4 k 0 0225 s s 0 66 r 2 0 181 as can be seen from eq 4 the r 2 value is quite low the relationships between k and s s values for 7 types of aquifer materials are shown in fig 5 these types of aquifer materials were chosen because there are more than 5 data points for each type of them a positive trend can be found for sandstone limestone and dolomite and granite fig 5d f in fig 5e and f the data point given by slug test does not seem to represent the general trend and it was not included in the fitting process the fitted power functions for the three types of aquifer materials are also shown in the figure the power law function between k and s s values of granite shows the highest r 2 value fig 5f if we do not consider the three extremely low k values of sand and gravel then a positive trend can also be found fig 5a however a negative trend can be found for glacial till fig 5c the fitted power function for glacial till and the corresponding r 2 value is also shown in fig 5c for sand and fractured igneous and metamorphic rocks the data points are scattered and a clear relationship cannot be found between s s and k fig 5b and g 4 4 specific storage and porosity generally there is a positive relationship between specific storage s s and porosity ϕ fig 6 the higher the porosity ϕ the higher the specific storage s s fig 6 shows that although a positive trend can be found the data points are relatively scattered a power law relationship was fitted between s s and ϕ which is expressed as 5 s s 1 23 10 5 ϕ 0 982 r 2 0 273 it can be seen that the power is very close to 1 and eq 5 should be very close to a linear relationship as can be seen from eq 3 s s and ϕ are positively related theoretically the function fitted from the field data confirms the theoretical relationship between s s and ϕ there are only 50 data points that have both s s and ϕ values among these 50 data points 27 of them are presented by earth tide studies for earth tide analysis both s s and ϕ are estimated at most times although there are 108 data points from pumping test analysis only 9 of them provided ϕ values at the same time it should be noted that the data points provided by sea tide analysis show a negative relationship between s s and ϕ a more clear relationship between s s and ϕ will be found if more data are available especially with more data points from pumping test analysis 4 5 specific storage and aquifer thickness there is a weak negative relationship between specific storage s s and aquifer thickness b fig 7 the larger the aquifer thickness the lower the s s value there are 149 data points in fig 7 most of them are provided by pumping test analysis the majority of the studies on pumping tests provided both s s and aquifer thickness b some studies estimated s and b then s s was calculated from the relationship s s s b on the basis of this relationship there should be a significant negative relationship between s s and b however fig 7 shows that the relationship is not so significant and the data points are relatively scattered a power function was fitted between s s and b which can be written as 6 s s 0 0008 b 1 195 r 2 0 373 the s s values obtained by pumping tests show a great range of variety for a specified aquifer thickness the s s values obtained by slug tests show similar characteristics fig 7 also shows that most of the aquifers have thickness b less than 100 m the results for thick aquifers are mainly presented by pumping test analysis and earth tide studies the relationship between s s and b use the data from analyses of atmospheric loading earth tides and seismic waves is shown in fig 8 this figure only includes the data points that obtained s s independently without using the aquifer thickness b the s s values obtained from the three methods coincide with each other very well a negative relationship can also be seen from fig 8 and a power function was fitted as 7 s s 1 97 10 5 b 0 552 r 2 0 250 the negative relationship indicates that the s s values obtained from the three field methods are significantly affected by the aquifer thickness when the aquifer is thick the s s value estimated using the methods will be low the power function eq 6 is also included in the figure 4 6 specific storage and aquifer type fig 9 shows the frequency distributions of s s values for confined and unconfined aquifers there are 125 data points for confined aquifers and 53 data points for unconfined aquifers this figure clearly shows how the field s s values are distributed based on aquifer types for confined aquifers most of the s s values are distributed in the range of 10 7 10 4 m 1 for unconfined aquifers most of the s s values are distributed in the range of 10 5 10 3 m 1 the interval with the highest frequency for confined aquifers is 10 6 10 5 m 1 the interval with the highest frequency for unconfined aquifers is 10 5 10 4 m 1 the interval with the highest frequency for confined aquifers is one order of magnitude higher than that of the unconfined aquifers it seems that the s s values of unconfined aquifers are relatively higher than those of confined aquifers a comparison of s s values for different aquifer types for three kinds of aquifer materials is shown in fig 10 the aquifers are divided into three types namely confined aquifer unconfined aquifer and leaky aquifer three typical aquifer materials sand and gravel sand and granite are chosen due to the fact that there are many data points for each of them fig 1 there are also many data points for sandstone and fractured igneous and metamorphic rocks fig 1 however there is only one data point for unconfined aquifer for both materials supporting information for sandstone the one data point obtained from unconfined aquifer is very close to the geometric mean s s in table 1 fig 10 shows that there are no significant differences in s s values obtained from confined and unconfined aquifers for a certain type of aquifer material for sand and gravel fig 10a the s s values estimated from confined aquifer and unconfined aquifer are distributed in the same range the data point obtained from leaky aquifer is close to the geometric mean of the s s for sand fig 10b and granite fig 10c most s s values obtained from confined and unconfined aquifers are also distributed in the same range the s s value estimated from leaky aquifer for sand is also close to the geometric mean s s value of sand in table 1 as a result the s s values of a certain aquifer material estimated from different types of aquifers will be similar to each other such a pattern indicates that the s s values are possibly independent of aquifer type and are more closely related to types of aquifer materials this also indicates that s s is a hydraulic property of an aquifer material although the s s values for different aquifers types are distributed almost in the same range the interval with most s s values distributed for unconfined aquifers is higher than that of confined aquifers fig 10a and b this is similar to the result given by fig 9 5 comparison of different field methods the hydraulic properties quantified by different field methods are different from each other a comparison of the hydraulic properties obtained by the field methods is shown in table 2 for pumping test analysis some models estimate s but others estimate s s the aquifer hydraulic properties estimated by pumping test analysis are either t and s or k and s s slug test analysis and sea tide analysis can lead to estimation of the same kind of parameters as those of pumping test analysis the analyses of atmospheric loading earth tides and seismic waves lead to estimation of s s only the s s values obtained from different field methods may show different degree of uncertainty or reliability table 2 the reliability of s s data obtained from pumping test analysis should be high more than a half of the data points in fig 1 are provided by analysis of pumping test data meanwhile most very high s s values are provided by pumping test analysis the reliability of s s values obtained from slug test analysis should be improved the s s values can vary 7 orders of magnitude for different aquifer materials as shown in figs 1 and 2 as a result the s s values obtained from slug test analysis show the greatest degree of variety the reliability of s s data obtained by sea tide analysis using analytical solutions are high because the data points agree well with those obtained by other methods fig 2 however one data point for sand obtained by numerical modeling seems to be too low fig 1 as a result the overall reliability of this method is regarded as medium as shown in table 2 the reliability of s s values obtained from analyses of atmospheric loading and earth tides and seismic waves are high due to the fact that these data points agree well with pumping test data this study provides the first comprehensive analysis on aquifer s s values on the basis of this study a rough estimation of the s s value of a certain type of aquifer material can be obtained without using field tests the easiest way to estimate the s s value of a certain type of aquifer material is using the geometric mean value provided in table 1 for pumping test analysis the analytical and numerical studies listed will help to choose the appropriate analytical or numerical model to analyze the pumping test data the analytical models listed for other methods will also help to choose the most appropriate method for a specific field study for limestone and dolomite and granite aquifers good relationships are found between k and s s fig 5e and f so an relatively accurate s s value can be estimated based on the k value for analyses of atmospheric loading earth tides and seismic waves an approximate s s value can be made based on the aquifer thickness for pumping test analysis in unconfined aquifers the recently developed analytical solutions accounted for the unsaturated zone tartakovsky and neuman 2007 mishra and neuman 2010 2011 seem to provide reasonable s s values the s s values estimated by these studies are mostly distributed in the range of 10 5 10 4 m 1 the corresponding specific yield s y values range from 0 10 to 0 39 with an average of 0 25 the estimated s y value is about 4 orders of magnitude higher than s s which can also be found in other studies e g endres et al 2007 moench 2008 the s s value collected can be used as an initial estimation in transient groundwater flow and solute transport models they can also be used as a reference for groundwater flow and solute transport model calibrations with this study one can get a more accurate estimation of s s value of a certain type of aquifer material than before this is important for the groundwater flow and solute transport models to produce more reliable results it is also important for proper groundwater resources evaluation and management as quantitative transient groundwater studies all need to determine s s the s s values presented are of general importance 6 future research five field methods to estimate s s were reviewed and the number of studies on each method is different among these methods pumping test analyses have been used most frequently because of their broad applicability in various types of aquifers table 2 pumping tests can be performed in a confined aquifer unconfined aquifer leaky aquifer and multilayered aquifer system numerous analytical and numerical models have been developed for pumping test analyses although numerous models have been developed the most frequently used model for confined aquifer pumping test analysis is the theis 1935 model and for unconfined aquifer pumping test analysis is the neuman 1972 1974 models compared with the models for the confined aquifer and unconfined aquifer pumping test analyses models for pumping tests analysis under other conditions are much less more analytical or numerical models should be developed for pumping test analysis under these conditions especially for leaky aquifers multi aquifer systems constant head tests and oscillatory pumping tests pumping rate variation is common during filed pumping tests the classical models for constant rate pumping test analysis cannot be applied to analyze the variable rate pumping test data previous studies have also developed analytical models to analyze such variable rate pumping tests e g abu zied and scott 1963 butt and mcelwee 1985 sen and altunkaynak 2004 mishra et al 2012 zhang 2013 zhuang et al 2019 however field applications of the analytical models are limited sen and altunkaynak 2004 the existing studies are for confined aquifers and the theis 1935 model has often been used as the basis for analysis compared with constant rate pumping test analysis studies on variable rate pumping test analysis are limited more analytical or numerical models are needed to analyze the variable rate pumping test data meanwhile more field applications are also needed to estimate aquifer hydraulic parameters including specific storage in addition models should also be developed to analyze variable rate pumping tests in unconfined aquifers there are also numerous studies on slug test analysis however models can be used to obtain s s of the aquifer are limited for confined aquifer with a fully penetrating well the most frequently used model is the cooper et al 1967 model for confined aquifer with a partially penetrating well the kgs model has generally been used for unconfined aquifers the model frequently used is also the kgs model the s s values available in the literature are also limited and only 13 s s values were obtained as a result more studies or more applications of the models to analyze slug test data may be conducted in the future to improve the reliability of s s obtained from slug test analysis one should improve the sensitivity of the type curves to changes in s s values perhaps new analytical solutions or new data interpretation methods should be developed to increase the reliability of the estimated s s values compared to models for pumping test analysis models for sea tide analysis atmospheric loading and earth tide analysis and seismic wave analysis are much less studies on using sea tides to estimate s s of coastal aquifers are limited and only 6 s s values were collected from the literature more analytical or numerical models should be developed in the future to analyze sea tides to estimate coastal aquifer s s values more applications of the models should also be performed to estimate s s of coastal aquifers there should also be more studies on estimating aquifer s s values from seismic wave analysis furthermore the s s values estimated by seismic wave analysis and earth tide analysis are for confined aquifers only more data are needed for a comprehensive analysis of these field methods for some field methods only about ten s s values can be found there should be more data on s s using these methods including slug test analysis sea tide analysis atmospheric loading analysis and seismic wave analysis furthermore more porosity data should be found or be obtained to build a more clear relationship between s s and porosity ϕ although most earth tide analyses provided porosity values most pumping test analyses do not provide porosity ϕ values among the 108 pumping test studies only 9 of them provided ϕ values concerning the importance of pumping test analysis in estimating s s values more porosity ϕ values should be provided in the future 7 conclusions a review of field methods to estimate aquifer specific storage is conducted and specific storage values presented by these studies are collected and analyzed the present state of knowledge on five field methods frequently used to estimate in situ specific storage in aquifers is presented the five methods include analyses of pumping test data slug test data sea tides atmospheric loading and earth tides and seismic waves both analytical and numerical models are summarized for each of the methods among the five methods the most frequently used and most extensively studied is the pumping test analysis slug test analysis is also a frequently used method to estimate s s of an aquifer compared with pumping test analysis and slug test analysis the other three methods are relatively less studied specific storage values estimated from the five field methods are classified into 15 types these 15 types of specific storage values are corresponding to 15 types of aquifer materials representative specific storage values for each type of aquifer material is obtained and their geometric mean value is also calculated the s s values estimated by slug test analysis show the largest variance followed by pumping test analysis the s s values obtained by other methods coincide with each other very well the field s s values obtained from unconfined aquifers seem to be higher than those of confined aquifers with the representative s s values an approximate estimation of the s s value of a certain type of aquifer material can be made the relationships between specific storage and hydraulic conductivity porosity and aquifer thickness are analyzed there is not a clear relationship between specific storage and hydraulic conductivity only a few types of aquifer materials show a positive relationship between specific storage and hydraulic conductivity there is a positive correlation between specific storage and porosity of the aquifer a negative correlation between specific storage and aquifer thickness can be found based on the current data the relationships between s s and these parameters are not significant a simple relationship cannot be found to estimate s s from neither of these parameters on the basis of this study one can make a rough estimation of specific storage of various types of aquifer materials without using field methods to calculate the specific storage the specific storage values collected can be used as an initial estimation in transient groundwater flow models and in transient solute transport models these values can also be used as a reference for groundwater flow and solute transport models calibration purposes the synthesized s s values will help the groundwater flow and solute transport models produce more reliable results and improve groundwater resources evaluation and management the s s data presented will also provide a

5927,apart from extreme hydrological events such as droughts and floods large water bodies and land use patterns can significantly influence the water cycle dynamics in river basins assessment of cumulative effects of extreme events water bodies and land use pattern on the hydrological cycle is not available in most parts of the world periyar river basin draining the southern western ghats is recently been subjected to severe drought 2016 and devastating flood 2018 each leading to huge economic and ecological loss this study uses stable isotopes δ2h and δ18o to understand the water cycle dynamics in periyar river basin in relation to drought and reservoirs the variable d excess and lc excess have been analyzed to understand the evaporative controls in determining the water cycle mechanism during drier seasons the seasonality of isotopic imprints in different hydrologic compartments revealed higher variability in the rainwater during northeast monsoon nem and pre monsoon prem owing to the presence of cyclonic circulations and evaporative fractionation the higher rates of depletion in precipitation did not bring any subsequent depletion in the accumulated surface and groundwater rather it produces enrichments due to the evaporative loss of heavier isotopes owing to the drier weather conditions the physiography of the basin has significantly influenced the distribution of δ2h and δ18o in the surface and groundwater indicating a higher rate of mixing in the middle stretch midland suggesting an altitudinal control in the basin shallow dug wells situated close to the reservoirs inherited the evaporation and isotopic signatures specific to the recharge source the present study highlights the impact of drought on the water cycle dynamics of southwest india through increased evaporation signals more negative lc excess reduced effects of elevation altitude effect and distance continental effect along the basin the evaporation signals are more conspicuous over reservoirs and exhibit a significant role in recharging the shallow dug wells in their proximity the lc excess reveals that northeast side of the basin receives significant amount of recirculated moisture from the windward side of western ghats as observed in an earlier study over the drier tamil nadu state the present study thus underlines the effective use of stable isotopes in studying the impact of weather fluctuations as extreme events in the hydrological circulation which is not yet been utilized in many parts of the world keywords isotopes water cycle reservoirs drought western ghats 1 introduction the stable isotopes si of water δ18o and δ2h have been widely used to investigate various meteorological and catchment scale processes this include identifying different moisture sources midhun et al 2013 rahul and ghosh 2018 saranya et al 2018 quantifying recycled moisture fraction rahul et al 2018 2016 estimating groundwater recharge sources joshi et al 2018 wan et al 2018 to study groundwater flow paths rodgers et al 2005a 2005b and to understand surface water groundwater interaction kendall and coplen 2001 martinez et al 2015 the equilibrium and kinetic fractionation processes during phase transition of water allows the differential distribution of δ18o and δ2h across different hydrological compartments aggarwal et al 2005 the si of water have also been used for evaluating the hydrological processes under extreme conditions such as drought chiogna et al 2018 wu et al 2018 and flood adame et al 2016 recent studies have utilized the application of stable isotopes to elucidate the changes in river water cycle owing to the impoundment of water in the reservoirs deng et al 2016 jiang et al 2018 craig 1961 developed the linear relationship between δ18o and δ2h for global precipitation as δ2h 8xδ18o 10 and termed as global meteoric water line gmwl a secondary parameter derived from gmwl deuterium excess d excess provides information regarding the weather conditions at the oceanic source and its modification by the local secondary processes such as evaporation and moisture recycling dansgaard 1964 however it is essential to use the local meteoric water line lmwl to understand the changes in local precipitation thus evaporated water samples plot below the lmwl indicating kinetic fractionation gibson and edwards 2002 gibson and reid 2010 estimation of evaporation sources using stable isotope techniques δ2h δ18o are gaining fast momentum sprenger et al 2017 2016 evaporation from surface water changes the isotopic composition by stimulating kinetic fractionation of the residual water and further changing the d excess value in addition to streams and rivers stagnant water bodies such as reservoirs deng et al 2016 lakes kumar and nachiappan 1999 and shallow dug wells are also prominent sources of evaporation as the d excess is derived from the gmwl it often does not include the variations in local precipitation hence landwehr and coplen 2006 introduced the concept of line conditioned excess lc excess addressing the offset between a lmwl and surface water samples the pioneer studies in the stable isotopes realm have well documented the factors that control the geographic distribution of stable isotopes in precipitation dansgaard 1964 friedman and redfield 1964 the collective influence of various factors i e amount of precipitation temperature altitude distance of source continental effect season and latitude are primarily responsible for the spatial and temporal variation of stable isotopes in precipitation dansgaard 1964 gat 1996 siegenthaler and oeschger 1980 bowen 2008 and thus in other hydrological compartments as well a detailed characterization of si in surface water sources across river basins is significant for comprehending the water circulation mechanism based on precipitation input darling and talbot 2003 hence for obtaining the continuous long term measurements from river water international atomic energy agency iaea has established a network of monitoring stations known as global network of isotopes in river gnir halder et al 2015 though this network includes many monitoring stations over europe and u s a the δ18o records from indian rivers are sparse from india the published studies are mostly from himalayan rivers kumar et al 2019 rai et al 2019 ramesh and sarin 1992 sharma et al 2017 and are largely focused on estimating glacier melt composition in catchments most of the mentioned studies have limited spatial and temporal resolution of si measurements the vast spatial coverage influence of different orographic systems himalayas and western ghats allows india to experience rainfall during different seasons and thus the river discharge the indian subcontinent has been subjected to many extreme events such as drought bhuiyan et al 2006 parthasarathy 1987 shah and mishra 2014 and flood in the recent years roxy et al 2017 sudheer et al 2019 the western ghats physiography in the southern india is responsible for generating significant amount of orographic rainfall tawde 2013 and the intense vegetation cover also supplies moisture to the rain shadow region paul et al 2018 available studies for southern india have reported that there is no or insignificant amount effect during the dominant rainfall season i e south west monsoon swm lekshmy et al 2015 2014 rahul et al 2016 though many studies have pointed out the significance of studying altitude and continental effects along mountainous terrains bruijnzeel et al 2011 gonfiantini et al 2001 rhodes et al 2011 windhorst et al 2013 these aspects are poorly understood along the western ghats deshpande et al 2003 resmi et al 2016 tripti et al 2019 the major objectives of the present study are therefore to understand the impact of i drought ii impoundment of reservoirs and iii the altitude and continental effect exerted by the western ghats on the water circulation mechanism of periyar river basin of southern western ghats through study of stable isotopes of water 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area western ghats a north south oriented mountain range running parallel to the west coast of peninsular india receives high monsoon rainfall as compared to other parts of the country this mountain range along the arabian sea as lengthens 1600 km with the highest elevation reaching up to 2600 m above mean sea level amsl the moisture laden monsoon winds from the as gets lifted up as they cross over the western ghats and cools adiabatically generating significant amount of orographic rainfall the rainfall rapidly decreases towards the eastern side of the mountain range due to the sinking of air mass over the rain shadow region western ghats receives the maximum rainfall in the higher altitude zones patwardhan and asnani 2000 and are the hottest biodiversity hot spot myers et al 2000 for many diverse and endemic vegetation including thick evergreen to semi evergreen semi closed evergreen stunted evergreen forests semi evergreen moist deciduous dry deciduous and savanna utkarsh et al 1998 this wide vegetation cover provides evapotranspiration et loadings to the atmospheric moisture budget and further contributes to 25 40 of the rainfall over the drier tamil nadu paul et al 2018 western ghats mountain range forms source for many large and small important rivers of india which drains about 40 of the country many of them flow westwards debouching into the as and others flow eastwards to bay of bengal bob the east flowing rivers gets more attention as they drain large area as compared to the west flowing rivers however west flowing rivers contributes significantly to the hydrological needs of the population and vegetation cover residing between western ghats and as the periyar river lifeline of the kerala state is the longest river and hosts the maximum number of reservoirs in the state rainfall in the basin is dual monsoon dependent south west monsoon swm june to september and north east monsoon nem october to december though the annual rainfall in the basin is largely swm dependent nem rainfall is also significant as observed for southern peninsular states and sri lanka rajeevan et al 2012 the isotopic signatures δ2h δ18o of swm and nem follow the trends of respective moisture sources as being enriched and bob depleted unnikrishnan warrier et al 2010 periyar river basin with a catchment area of about 5398 km2 rises in the forests of western ghats at an elevation of 2438 m amsl and traverses about 244 km before debouching into the as abe and erinjery joseph 2015 the physiography consists of the rugged and undulating highlands midland comprising hills and valleys falling between highlands and lowlands while the lowlands are characterized by densely populated coastal region fig 1 the average rainfall of the basin is 3000 mm and about 60 of which is received during the swm and 25 during the nem the basin has 17 reservoirs constructed and used for hydropower generation which significantly regulates the flow regime in the basin the recent extreme flood event of 2018 that resulted in heavy losses to life and property was worsened by the sudden discharge of water from these reservoirs that were above 90 of its total capacity mishra et al 2018 the recurring extreme weather events droughts and flood mishra et al 2018 have adversely impacted the water cycle dynamics of the basin here we investigate the hydrological cycle changes in the periyar river basin during 2016 and 2017 the year 2016 was an extreme drought year with about 34 and 32 reduction in rainfall respectively during swm and nem 2 2 sampling procedure surface water groundwater waterfall and spring water samples were collected during the four sampling campaigns covering the swm season august of 2016 and 2017 nem december 2016 and pre monsoon april 2017 sampling locations were fixed following the rationales before after the confluence of important tributaries settlements and or zones of important productive activities but logistical criteria i e site accessibility is also taken into consideration the groundwater samples consisted of shallow dug wells deeper bore wells and springs and the surface water samples included the river stream reservoir and lake water fig 1 shows the sampling locations and three rain gauge stations in the basin all the water samples were collected into 10 ml polypropylene bottles with minimum head space and sealed using parafilm tapes the samples were stored in a refrigerator for avoiding evaporation fractionation before transporting to the laboratory for further analysis precipitation samples used for the development of local meteoric water line lmwl for the present study were collected from three rain gauges installed at different elevations in the basin fig 1 six samples were collected from different locations of each reservoir by traversing in a boat 2 3 measurement of stable isotopes the stable isotope measurements of precipitation samples δ2h δ18o were carried out at national institute of hydrology nih roorkee india using a dual inlet isotope ratio mass spectrometer di irms the analysis was performed by pt h2 and co2 equilibration methods respectively for δ2h and δ18o brenninkmeijer and morrison 1987 epstein and mayeda 1953 the measurements are expressed as δ values in concentrations per mil representing the relative difference in the heavy to light isotope ratio in relation to vienna mean standard ocean water vsmow analytical precision for δ18o and δ2h is 0 1 and 1 0 respectively 2 4 calculation of d excess and lc excess and their relevance rain falling onto the ground surface is prone to evaporation loss and this can leave heavier isotopes δ18o and δ2h down thus enriching the left over water this process is known as kinetic fractionation however kinetic fractionation is almost negligible for equilibrium processes resulting in good correlation of δ18o and δ2h in precipitation consequently water undergoing kinetic fractionation deviates from the meteoric water line and plot below the line this deviation of water samples from gmwl was defined as deuterium excess d excess eq 1 dansgaard 1964 1 d e x c e s s δ 2 h 8 x δ 18 o however this offset from the gmwl may not always be useful for samples where the local precipitation deviates from the gmwl hence landwehr and coplen 2006 defined another parameter the line conditioned excess lc excess eq 2 to accommodate the characteristic deviation from local precipitation 2 lc e x c e s s δ 2 h a x δ 18 o b here a and b are the slope and intercept of the lmwl for evaporation fractionated water samples the lc excess would be negative and will plot below the local meteoric water line lmwl the uncertainty in the lc excess values is estimated as 1 0 based on the precision of the isotope analysis and the slope of lmwl 3 results and discussion 3 1 seasonality in precipitation the seasonal variations in δ18o values of precipitation surface and groundwater in the periyar basin are represented in fig 2 a the oppositely oriented wind fields south west and north east related with the swm and nem transport moistures from two characteristically distinct oceanic sources as and bob even though the seasonal rainfall amount being more during the swm krishnakumar et al 2009 the spread in the δ18o values was less the most depleted records corresponds to the nem and the enriched in pre monsoon prem and swm season this depletion during nem season is often attributed to the presence of more number of cyclones during the season lekshmy et al 2015 and cyclones gives rise to depleted δ18o signals lawrence 1998 saranya et al 2018 similar observation was also made previously by unnikrishnan warrier et al 2010 unnikrishnan warrier and praveen babu 2011 shahul hameed et al 2016 lekshmy et al 2018 the seasonal variations of δ18o in rainfall can be attributed to 1 the changes in the circulation patterns associated with the swm and nem 2 the variation in the dominant moisture sources as and bob the δ18o of as and bob are different with bob being slightly depleted than as duplessy 1982 rahul et al 2016 3 rain drop evaporation during its fall 4 the contribution of re circulated moisture in precipitation and 5 convective activities lekshmy et al 2014 and cyclonic circulations in the bob as fig 2b shows that the inter quartile range of d excess is lower during swm than nem season interestingly earlier studies have not reported any negative d excess signature over kerala region during nem unnikrishnan warrier et al 2010 unnikrishnan warrier and praveen babu 2011 the present study observed some negative signatures in d excess indicating lower humidity conditions owing to the dry weather during the 2016 drought since the mentioned previous studies focused on monthly composite precipitation samples and have thus missed this phenomenon 3 2 effects of seasonality on surface water groundwater δ18o the δ18o in precipitation of different seasons is likely to produce variation in δ18o of surface water the box and whisker diagrams shows more spread in δ18o of precipitation and surface water during nem and prem seasons as compared to swm fig 2a the spread in precipitation is due to relatively depleted precipitation during nem and in surface water due to the kinetic fractionation of δ18o this suggests that the dominant processes governing the spread in rain and surface water are different as the seasonal depletion in rain does not produce any subsequent depletion in surface water the δ18o values in surface water during swm season are clustered indicating rapid mixing of water during the season fig 2a seasonally the δ18o dynamics of groundwater was less varying compared to those of river water gupta et al 2005 the surface water exhibited seasonally fluctuating d excess signatures with lower values during drier seasons i e nem and prem fig 2b this is due to the elevated levels of evaporation during these seasons and the left over surface water experiencing more kinetic fractionation craig et al 1963 the cross plot of δ18o and δ2h isotopes indicates that both the surface and groundwater in the periyar basin are of meteoric in origin as the corresponding samples lie on or close to the lmwl fig 3 a some samples fall below the lmwl especially surface water prominently during nem and prem seasons indicating that though the surface water is recharged from rainfall it experienced certain extend of evaporative fractionation hao et al 2019 joshi et al 2018 most of the surface water samples during swm season fall above the lmwl indicating that the indian summer monsoon ism rainfall in the basin includes recycled water through the supply of evaporated moisture from local water bodies and also from the saturated soils pathak et al 2017 wassenaar et al 2011 the d excess values also firmly support this observation with higher values during swm the cross plot for surface water can be partitioned into four different sections with evaporated coastal and reservoir water on the top followed by slightly enriched lowland water during nem and prem mixing zone with moderately depleted moderately enriched water and the maximum depleted highland water the groundwater inherited similar distribution as surface water with shallow dug wells in the top corner of the dual isotope plot followed by a mixing zone and depleted deep bore wells the depleted groundwater mostly belong to upper stretch of the basin thus indicating the catchment effect kumar et al 2019 which is the inheritance of isotopic characteristics of water from higher elevation watershed these results further point towards the influence of western ghats topography on the water cycle mechanism of the basin in order to understand this aspect in detail the cross plot of isotopes is replotted with samples categorized based on the physiography of the region based on broad geomorphic surfaces and altitudinal characteristics the study area is divided into 3 distinct regions i e highland midland and lowlands this sort of characterization and the corresponding δ18o signatures can provide information regarding the altitudinal control the orographic uplift of air masses and the subsequent depletion in the δ18o and δ2h values the distribution of δ18o and δ2h across the basin showed clear physiographic evidence by plotting depleted samples along highland enriched along lowland and mixed ones along midland regions fig 4 a and b this could be due to the altitude effect dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1993 of the western ghats orographic barrier resmi et al 2016 this is in accordance with rayleigh fractionation model which says that when an air mass traverses along increasing topography the heavier isotopes are favorably removed dansgaard 1964 many of the groundwater and surface water samples exhibited enriched isotopic records despite belonging to highland and midland regions these enriched samples represented shallow groundwater and evaporated surface water located right to the lmwl highland ground waters of this category were spatially located close to reservoirs and lake indicating recharge from these sources the concurrent δ18o and δ2h enrichment in water of these reservoirs and lakes water support this observation additionally all shallow dug well stations of the highland region were located within 5 km range of reservoirs or lakes justifying their enriched δ18o and δ2h signals fig 5 however groundwater samples plotted above the lmwl indicating the additional role of recirculated moisture probably sourced from the direct recharge of recycled precipitation to check the effect of evaporation in the groundwater the lc excess values are calculated a small number 7 out of 80 of groundwater samples have low lc excess values less than zero indicating their evaporation during the recharge process or the recharge of evaporated water this evaporative fractionation was visible only in shallow dug wells which confirms that the exposure of open well water lead to the lower lc excess when subsurface flow is activated due to non fractionated precipitation input evaporation fractionation in deep groundwater is reduced positive lc excess owing to the better hydrological connectivity in the basin sprenger et al 2016 3 3 influence of reservoirs on the water cycle dynamics the cross plot of δ18o and δ2h shows the crowding of a large number of groundwater samples around the lmwl fig 3c this indicates the direct recharge of groundwater via local precipitation the δ18o records in shallow dug wells suggest important recharge from the nearby reservoirs and lake with relatable δ18o records especially during prem season fig 5 for a detailed analysis of the influence of reservoirs and the water cycle dynamics we have divided the basin into four zones a zone i lowland region area encompassing the coastal region b zone ii midland region c zone iii highland region 1 encompassing the north east portion of the basin in highland region and d zone iv highland region 2 south east portion of the highland region prem season is chosen for understanding the role of reservoirs to nullify the effect of precipitation the δ18o signature in shallow dug wells from zone i show depleted values up to middle of the zone compared to the surface water fig 6 a revealing the recharge from higher altitudes however remaining dug well recorded relatively enriched signature matching with the δ18o of the river water and reservoir water meaning the recharge from surface water and reservoir additionally the reservoir water δ18o in this zone matched with the river water indicating its common sources the corresponding lc excess though lc excess values are not presented here values of these particular stations are negative showing evaporation signal though they produced positive values during the remaining seasons the δ18o records of surface water and dug well in middle of zone i to mid of zone ii fig 6b show less variation though the bore well exhibited depleted signature with positive lc excess in zone iii the surface water δ18o exhibited most depleted records in the central eastern side of the basin fig 6c the reservoir situated in this region do not show negative lc excess fig 7 similar phenomena has been observed in stream and dug well water located in this region however the stream and reservoir water draining central northern branch exhibited positive lc excess this contrasting response of kinetic fractionation supports the presence of different moisture sources the swm dominated end of the basin exhibited ve lc excess and the nem end exhibited ve lc excess the two waterfalls located along these ends are directly derived from the local precipitation hence we considered them as the primary inputs over these ends of the zone further variation of lc excess in succeeding samples well corresponded to the input in these waterfalls fig 7 these differences in the two ends of the zone iii can be explained with the higher rates of evapo transpiration over the kerala side of the zone and lower rates over the tamil nadu side of the zone goroshi et al 2017 also the positive lc excess in the tamil nadu side can be a result of the kinetically fractionated recirculated precipitation deshpande et al 2003 paul et al 2018 shallow dug wells located close to stream channel in zone iv matched well with the δ18o of streams dug well located away from the channel exhibited depleted signal probably inherited from the highlands a particular surface water sample exhibited enriched δ18o 0 4 than the other samples collected from this region this belonged to a narrow channel prior to its confluence with the main channel this channel had a travel history through tea plantations and excess water abstraction by the farms would have resulted into the observed enriched record 3 4 fractionation signals in surface water and groundwater the linear relationship between δ18o vs δ2h in precipitation collected across the globe is δ2h 8δ18o 10 craig 1961 however this equation is not applicable for closed basins and lakes that are influenced by kinetic fractionation due to evaporation hence the local relation between δ18o vs δ2h during equilibrium fractionation ie precipitation is derived as eq 3 it has to be noted that the lmwl exhibited a close relationship with the gmwl showing least influence of kinetic fractionation while calculating the surface water line swl coastal samples close to estuary are omitted in order to avoid the influence of seawater the surface water line swl eq 4 yielded a regression line with slope and intercept less than gmwl and lmwl this indicates that surface waters in the basin are affected by kinetic fractionation as a result of evaporation froehlich et al 2008 producing lower slope for the residual water the seasonal variations in the swl show lowest slopes and intercepts during nem and prem season the drier seasons the mean precipitation during nem and prem seasons in the study area is 235 and 419 mm respectively against the 1569 mm of 2016 swm and 2038 mm of 2017 swm we infer that the low precipitation amount and relative humidity during these seasons increase the evaporation rate thus producing lower slopes and intercepts additionally the swm of 2016 also had a lower slope and intercept despite being the dominant rainfall season table 1 the season rainfall during 2016 recorded a 31 deficiency to the normal in the basin which led to low flow and drought conditions this reveals that drought in the basin has affected the δ18o and δ2h chiogna et al 2018 values due to the kinetic fractionation resulted from excess evaporation the ground water line gwl eq 5 had least difference with the lmwl compared to the swl and lmwl however it exhibited seasonal variation though the evaporation effect was less this is because of the longer residence time of groundwater with lower chances of evaporation and consequently the groundwater signatures match with the isotopic signature of mean precipitation in the catchment chiogna et al 2018 the linear regression results are powerful in describing the influence of weather changes on the surface water δ18o values 3 δ 2 h 8 02 0 14 x δ 18 o 9 11 0 53 r 2 0 93 n 254 lmwl 4 δ 2 h 5 81 0 20 x δ 18 o 4 65 0 53 r 2 0 88 n 117 swl 5 δ 2 h 7 59 0 39 x δ 18 o 9 86 1 23 r 2 0 84 n 68 gwl 3 5 altitude and continental effects the dual isotope plots with respect to the highland midland and lowland locations have already revealed the role of physiography in δ18o across the basin here we explore the altitude and continental effect in controlling the distribution of surface water and groundwater δ18o in periyar basin as in fig 8 the δ18o records in the surface water were almost steady up to 90 km from sea and up to an elevation of 1000 m amsl though there were occasional enrichments even in some of the inland regions along high altitude ranges these enrichments were close to the reservoirs lakes and streams draining agricultural catchments the groundwater had a different behavior with gradual enrichments up to 60 km from the sea this was evident up to 50 m amsl beyond this point gradual depletion was observed in the δ18o of groundwater intermittent enrichments were observed in shallow wells dug wells few four samples collected during nem 2016 outside the basin exhibited a seemingly continental variation with δ18o ranging up to 5 5 these locations are situated northeast to the basin close to the tamil nadu uplands which imply that the observation is not driven by the altitude effect but due to the variation in the prevailing moisture source deshpande et al 2003 compared to other sampling locations these locations are dry and the rainfall along these regions is foremost supplied by the nem winds it is already examined that the nem is depleted than the swm owing to the δ18o depleted nature of bob than as and the difference in rainout pattern this shows that the observed variation is due to the spatial limit between swm and nem and the maximum eastward extent of the as moisture as the relative role of swm beyond the western ghats is small deshpande et al 2003 the spatial variability of surface water δ18o discrete 3 regions in the basin 1 coastal region with relatively enriched δ18o 2 region located towards the northeast part of the basin exhibiting depleted δ18o 3 the region falling in between the above two regions with gradual δ18o depletion since the first and second category of regions can mask the exact altitude and continental effect in the basin we have omitted these samples along with reservoir samples while doing the regression analysis for understanding the altitude effect the linear regression lines between physiographic variables and δ18o values during different seasons are shown in table 2 the regression coefficients for the respective analysis displayed seasonal variation though the coefficients varied seasonally it was more pronounced during swm season and maximum correlation is observed during swm of 2017 which was a normal rainfall year for surface water the deficient year 2016 δ18o values exhibited comparatively lower values of correlation coefficients with distance 0 64 and elevation 0 61 during the nem season the correlation coefficient values decreased to 0 45 and 0 54 respectively for elevation and distance this could be due to the changes in air circulation as the wind pattern changes from southwesterly to northeast the orographic uplift of moisture laden winds reverses thus reducing the altitude effect though staying significant p 0 05 the respective p values have also showed an increase from swm to the drier nem the δ18o has not reflected any significant correlation with any of these parameters during the prem season precipitation during this season is often interpreted as derived from continental local sources unnikrishnan warrier et al 2010 hence the lack of progressive depletion in δ18o on the basis of continental altitude effect is rational among the continental and altitude effects the continental effect is the more pronounced driver in depleting the heavier isotopes during rainout on a maximum the continental effect produced about 1 91 100 km 1 swm 17 though the average continental effect was 1 13 100 km 1 the case with groundwater also exhibited maximum continental and altitude effects during swm season of the normal year 2017 additionally swm of 2016 did not show any statistically significant distance effect displaying elevation dependent groundwater recharge during drier period however for groundwater the seasonal inheritance of elevation and distance effects are rather uncertain since the groundwater residence time from west of western ghats is not explored by any studies so far as per the literature available 3 6 wider implications the variability in monsoon circulation has triggered extreme weather conditions causing stress situations in many parts of the globe as well as in indian region dash et al 2009 roxy et al 2017 further inducing hydrological cycle changes the present study demonstrated the possibility of employing stable isotopes for investigating the hydrological cycle processes owing to the weather changes and the impact of drought especially when evaporation data is absent lc excess can provide micro scale information detailing the influence of different moisture sources thus over mountainous terrains spatial extend of the influence of orography can be delineated with the help of high spatial resolution lc excess data since no literature is available that demonstrates the use of lc excess values to study hydrological cycle dynamics in indian region the present study is first of its kind in the country although daily precipitation amount effect is not significant in many parts of the country as well as in southwestern india the present study shows an important role of weather fluctuations on the isotopic elevation effect most recent study revealing significant local amount effect in the seasonal rainwater lekshmy et al 2019 further supports this observation the mentioned aspect is significant for interpreting the results of paleoarchives especially for paleoelevation reconstruction studies of tropical regions with very few gnip stations over southern india and no gnir station the present study is a contribution to the global data base additionally the present study reiterate the need for future isotopic investigations focusing on the importance of moisture generated over the windward region in meeting the hydrological requirements of the drier leeward slopes 4 conclusion this is the first methodical stable isotope study in the periyar river basin of southern western ghats daily rain seasonal surface water and groundwater were sampled during the swm of 2016 to swm of 2017 the year 2016 was a drought year for the basin as well as for most parts of the country isotopic study suggested that the surface water and groundwater in the basin is of meteoric origin though a good number of samples exhibited evaporation fractionation signatures with negative lc excess values the shallow dug wells and surface water located close to reservoirs took over the δ18o and lc excess signatures from them evaporation signatures were dominant during the dry seasons nem and prem these negative lc excess records largely belonged to coastal reservoir and streams with flow tracks through agricultural fields a clear physiographic variation was observed in δ18o in surface water and groundwater exhibiting depleted signatures along highland region the stations located in north eastern end of highland region zone iii depicted negative lc excess inherited from the local precipitation waterfall while the same in the eastern side reveal positive lc excess following the trend of the local precipitation of the area this depicts the geographical extent of the transport of bob and as moisture the linear regressions between δ18o vs δ2h exhibited low slope and intercept along with less correlation during the drought period the effect of drought has influenced the altitude and continental effect in the basin by reducing the δ18o depletion owing to the excess evaporation fractionation present study suggests the further monitoring of evaporation fractionation from the remaining reservoirs of the basin which may have significant influence on rainfall distribution in the rain shadow region eastern side of western ghats declaration of competing interest the authors

5927,apart from extreme hydrological events such as droughts and floods large water bodies and land use patterns can significantly influence the water cycle dynamics in river basins assessment of cumulative effects of extreme events water bodies and land use pattern on the hydrological cycle is not available in most parts of the world periyar river basin draining the southern western ghats is recently been subjected to severe drought 2016 and devastating flood 2018 each leading to huge economic and ecological loss this study uses stable isotopes δ2h and δ18o to understand the water cycle dynamics in periyar river basin in relation to drought and reservoirs the variable d excess and lc excess have been analyzed to understand the evaporative controls in determining the water cycle mechanism during drier seasons the seasonality of isotopic imprints in different hydrologic compartments revealed higher variability in the rainwater during northeast monsoon nem and pre monsoon prem owing to the presence of cyclonic circulations and evaporative fractionation the higher rates of depletion in precipitation did not bring any subsequent depletion in the accumulated surface and groundwater rather it produces enrichments due to the evaporative loss of heavier isotopes owing to the drier weather conditions the physiography of the basin has significantly influenced the distribution of δ2h and δ18o in the surface and groundwater indicating a higher rate of mixing in the middle stretch midland suggesting an altitudinal control in the basin shallow dug wells situated close to the reservoirs inherited the evaporation and isotopic signatures specific to the recharge source the present study highlights the impact of drought on the water cycle dynamics of southwest india through increased evaporation signals more negative lc excess reduced effects of elevation altitude effect and distance continental effect along the basin the evaporation signals are more conspicuous over reservoirs and exhibit a significant role in recharging the shallow dug wells in their proximity the lc excess reveals that northeast side of the basin receives significant amount of recirculated moisture from the windward side of western ghats as observed in an earlier study over the drier tamil nadu state the present study thus underlines the effective use of stable isotopes in studying the impact of weather fluctuations as extreme events in the hydrological circulation which is not yet been utilized in many parts of the world keywords isotopes water cycle reservoirs drought western ghats 1 introduction the stable isotopes si of water δ18o and δ2h have been widely used to investigate various meteorological and catchment scale processes this include identifying different moisture sources midhun et al 2013 rahul and ghosh 2018 saranya et al 2018 quantifying recycled moisture fraction rahul et al 2018 2016 estimating groundwater recharge sources joshi et al 2018 wan et al 2018 to study groundwater flow paths rodgers et al 2005a 2005b and to understand surface water groundwater interaction kendall and coplen 2001 martinez et al 2015 the equilibrium and kinetic fractionation processes during phase transition of water allows the differential distribution of δ18o and δ2h across different hydrological compartments aggarwal et al 2005 the si of water have also been used for evaluating the hydrological processes under extreme conditions such as drought chiogna et al 2018 wu et al 2018 and flood adame et al 2016 recent studies have utilized the application of stable isotopes to elucidate the changes in river water cycle owing to the impoundment of water in the reservoirs deng et al 2016 jiang et al 2018 craig 1961 developed the linear relationship between δ18o and δ2h for global precipitation as δ2h 8xδ18o 10 and termed as global meteoric water line gmwl a secondary parameter derived from gmwl deuterium excess d excess provides information regarding the weather conditions at the oceanic source and its modification by the local secondary processes such as evaporation and moisture recycling dansgaard 1964 however it is essential to use the local meteoric water line lmwl to understand the changes in local precipitation thus evaporated water samples plot below the lmwl indicating kinetic fractionation gibson and edwards 2002 gibson and reid 2010 estimation of evaporation sources using stable isotope techniques δ2h δ18o are gaining fast momentum sprenger et al 2017 2016 evaporation from surface water changes the isotopic composition by stimulating kinetic fractionation of the residual water and further changing the d excess value in addition to streams and rivers stagnant water bodies such as reservoirs deng et al 2016 lakes kumar and nachiappan 1999 and shallow dug wells are also prominent sources of evaporation as the d excess is derived from the gmwl it often does not include the variations in local precipitation hence landwehr and coplen 2006 introduced the concept of line conditioned excess lc excess addressing the offset between a lmwl and surface water samples the pioneer studies in the stable isotopes realm have well documented the factors that control the geographic distribution of stable isotopes in precipitation dansgaard 1964 friedman and redfield 1964 the collective influence of various factors i e amount of precipitation temperature altitude distance of source continental effect season and latitude are primarily responsible for the spatial and temporal variation of stable isotopes in precipitation dansgaard 1964 gat 1996 siegenthaler and oeschger 1980 bowen 2008 and thus in other hydrological compartments as well a detailed characterization of si in surface water sources across river basins is significant for comprehending the water circulation mechanism based on precipitation input darling and talbot 2003 hence for obtaining the continuous long term measurements from river water international atomic energy agency iaea has established a network of monitoring stations known as global network of isotopes in river gnir halder et al 2015 though this network includes many monitoring stations over europe and u s a the δ18o records from indian rivers are sparse from india the published studies are mostly from himalayan rivers kumar et al 2019 rai et al 2019 ramesh and sarin 1992 sharma et al 2017 and are largely focused on estimating glacier melt composition in catchments most of the mentioned studies have limited spatial and temporal resolution of si measurements the vast spatial coverage influence of different orographic systems himalayas and western ghats allows india to experience rainfall during different seasons and thus the river discharge the indian subcontinent has been subjected to many extreme events such as drought bhuiyan et al 2006 parthasarathy 1987 shah and mishra 2014 and flood in the recent years roxy et al 2017 sudheer et al 2019 the western ghats physiography in the southern india is responsible for generating significant amount of orographic rainfall tawde 2013 and the intense vegetation cover also supplies moisture to the rain shadow region paul et al 2018 available studies for southern india have reported that there is no or insignificant amount effect during the dominant rainfall season i e south west monsoon swm lekshmy et al 2015 2014 rahul et al 2016 though many studies have pointed out the significance of studying altitude and continental effects along mountainous terrains bruijnzeel et al 2011 gonfiantini et al 2001 rhodes et al 2011 windhorst et al 2013 these aspects are poorly understood along the western ghats deshpande et al 2003 resmi et al 2016 tripti et al 2019 the major objectives of the present study are therefore to understand the impact of i drought ii impoundment of reservoirs and iii the altitude and continental effect exerted by the western ghats on the water circulation mechanism of periyar river basin of southern western ghats through study of stable isotopes of water 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area western ghats a north south oriented mountain range running parallel to the west coast of peninsular india receives high monsoon rainfall as compared to other parts of the country this mountain range along the arabian sea as lengthens 1600 km with the highest elevation reaching up to 2600 m above mean sea level amsl the moisture laden monsoon winds from the as gets lifted up as they cross over the western ghats and cools adiabatically generating significant amount of orographic rainfall the rainfall rapidly decreases towards the eastern side of the mountain range due to the sinking of air mass over the rain shadow region western ghats receives the maximum rainfall in the higher altitude zones patwardhan and asnani 2000 and are the hottest biodiversity hot spot myers et al 2000 for many diverse and endemic vegetation including thick evergreen to semi evergreen semi closed evergreen stunted evergreen forests semi evergreen moist deciduous dry deciduous and savanna utkarsh et al 1998 this wide vegetation cover provides evapotranspiration et loadings to the atmospheric moisture budget and further contributes to 25 40 of the rainfall over the drier tamil nadu paul et al 2018 western ghats mountain range forms source for many large and small important rivers of india which drains about 40 of the country many of them flow westwards debouching into the as and others flow eastwards to bay of bengal bob the east flowing rivers gets more attention as they drain large area as compared to the west flowing rivers however west flowing rivers contributes significantly to the hydrological needs of the population and vegetation cover residing between western ghats and as the periyar river lifeline of the kerala state is the longest river and hosts the maximum number of reservoirs in the state rainfall in the basin is dual monsoon dependent south west monsoon swm june to september and north east monsoon nem october to december though the annual rainfall in the basin is largely swm dependent nem rainfall is also significant as observed for southern peninsular states and sri lanka rajeevan et al 2012 the isotopic signatures δ2h δ18o of swm and nem follow the trends of respective moisture sources as being enriched and bob depleted unnikrishnan warrier et al 2010 periyar river basin with a catchment area of about 5398 km2 rises in the forests of western ghats at an elevation of 2438 m amsl and traverses about 244 km before debouching into the as abe and erinjery joseph 2015 the physiography consists of the rugged and undulating highlands midland comprising hills and valleys falling between highlands and lowlands while the lowlands are characterized by densely populated coastal region fig 1 the average rainfall of the basin is 3000 mm and about 60 of which is received during the swm and 25 during the nem the basin has 17 reservoirs constructed and used for hydropower generation which significantly regulates the flow regime in the basin the recent extreme flood event of 2018 that resulted in heavy losses to life and property was worsened by the sudden discharge of water from these reservoirs that were above 90 of its total capacity mishra et al 2018 the recurring extreme weather events droughts and flood mishra et al 2018 have adversely impacted the water cycle dynamics of the basin here we investigate the hydrological cycle changes in the periyar river basin during 2016 and 2017 the year 2016 was an extreme drought year with about 34 and 32 reduction in rainfall respectively during swm and nem 2 2 sampling procedure surface water groundwater waterfall and spring water samples were collected during the four sampling campaigns covering the swm season august of 2016 and 2017 nem december 2016 and pre monsoon april 2017 sampling locations were fixed following the rationales before after the confluence of important tributaries settlements and or zones of important productive activities but logistical criteria i e site accessibility is also taken into consideration the groundwater samples consisted of shallow dug wells deeper bore wells and springs and the surface water samples included the river stream reservoir and lake water fig 1 shows the sampling locations and three rain gauge stations in the basin all the water samples were collected into 10 ml polypropylene bottles with minimum head space and sealed using parafilm tapes the samples were stored in a refrigerator for avoiding evaporation fractionation before transporting to the laboratory for further analysis precipitation samples used for the development of local meteoric water line lmwl for the present study were collected from three rain gauges installed at different elevations in the basin fig 1 six samples were collected from different locations of each reservoir by traversing in a boat 2 3 measurement of stable isotopes the stable isotope measurements of precipitation samples δ2h δ18o were carried out at national institute of hydrology nih roorkee india using a dual inlet isotope ratio mass spectrometer di irms the analysis was performed by pt h2 and co2 equilibration methods respectively for δ2h and δ18o brenninkmeijer and morrison 1987 epstein and mayeda 1953 the measurements are expressed as δ values in concentrations per mil representing the relative difference in the heavy to light isotope ratio in relation to vienna mean standard ocean water vsmow analytical precision for δ18o and δ2h is 0 1 and 1 0 respectively 2 4 calculation of d excess and lc excess and their relevance rain falling onto the ground surface is prone to evaporation loss and this can leave heavier isotopes δ18o and δ2h down thus enriching the left over water this process is known as kinetic fractionation however kinetic fractionation is almost negligible for equilibrium processes resulting in good correlation of δ18o and δ2h in precipitation consequently water undergoing kinetic fractionation deviates from the meteoric water line and plot below the line this deviation of water samples from gmwl was defined as deuterium excess d excess eq 1 dansgaard 1964 1 d e x c e s s δ 2 h 8 x δ 18 o however this offset from the gmwl may not always be useful for samples where the local precipitation deviates from the gmwl hence landwehr and coplen 2006 defined another parameter the line conditioned excess lc excess eq 2 to accommodate the characteristic deviation from local precipitation 2 lc e x c e s s δ 2 h a x δ 18 o b here a and b are the slope and intercept of the lmwl for evaporation fractionated water samples the lc excess would be negative and will plot below the local meteoric water line lmwl the uncertainty in the lc excess values is estimated as 1 0 based on the precision of the isotope analysis and the slope of lmwl 3 results and discussion 3 1 seasonality in precipitation the seasonal variations in δ18o values of precipitation surface and groundwater in the periyar basin are represented in fig 2 a the oppositely oriented wind fields south west and north east related with the swm and nem transport moistures from two characteristically distinct oceanic sources as and bob even though the seasonal rainfall amount being more during the swm krishnakumar et al 2009 the spread in the δ18o values was less the most depleted records corresponds to the nem and the enriched in pre monsoon prem and swm season this depletion during nem season is often attributed to the presence of more number of cyclones during the season lekshmy et al 2015 and cyclones gives rise to depleted δ18o signals lawrence 1998 saranya et al 2018 similar observation was also made previously by unnikrishnan warrier et al 2010 unnikrishnan warrier and praveen babu 2011 shahul hameed et al 2016 lekshmy et al 2018 the seasonal variations of δ18o in rainfall can be attributed to 1 the changes in the circulation patterns associated with the swm and nem 2 the variation in the dominant moisture sources as and bob the δ18o of as and bob are different with bob being slightly depleted than as duplessy 1982 rahul et al 2016 3 rain drop evaporation during its fall 4 the contribution of re circulated moisture in precipitation and 5 convective activities lekshmy et al 2014 and cyclonic circulations in the bob as fig 2b shows that the inter quartile range of d excess is lower during swm than nem season interestingly earlier studies have not reported any negative d excess signature over kerala region during nem unnikrishnan warrier et al 2010 unnikrishnan warrier and praveen babu 2011 the present study observed some negative signatures in d excess indicating lower humidity conditions owing to the dry weather during the 2016 drought since the mentioned previous studies focused on monthly composite precipitation samples and have thus missed this phenomenon 3 2 effects of seasonality on surface water groundwater δ18o the δ18o in precipitation of different seasons is likely to produce variation in δ18o of surface water the box and whisker diagrams shows more spread in δ18o of precipitation and surface water during nem and prem seasons as compared to swm fig 2a the spread in precipitation is due to relatively depleted precipitation during nem and in surface water due to the kinetic fractionation of δ18o this suggests that the dominant processes governing the spread in rain and surface water are different as the seasonal depletion in rain does not produce any subsequent depletion in surface water the δ18o values in surface water during swm season are clustered indicating rapid mixing of water during the season fig 2a seasonally the δ18o dynamics of groundwater was less varying compared to those of river water gupta et al 2005 the surface water exhibited seasonally fluctuating d excess signatures with lower values during drier seasons i e nem and prem fig 2b this is due to the elevated levels of evaporation during these seasons and the left over surface water experiencing more kinetic fractionation craig et al 1963 the cross plot of δ18o and δ2h isotopes indicates that both the surface and groundwater in the periyar basin are of meteoric in origin as the corresponding samples lie on or close to the lmwl fig 3 a some samples fall below the lmwl especially surface water prominently during nem and prem seasons indicating that though the surface water is recharged from rainfall it experienced certain extend of evaporative fractionation hao et al 2019 joshi et al 2018 most of the surface water samples during swm season fall above the lmwl indicating that the indian summer monsoon ism rainfall in the basin includes recycled water through the supply of evaporated moisture from local water bodies and also from the saturated soils pathak et al 2017 wassenaar et al 2011 the d excess values also firmly support this observation with higher values during swm the cross plot for surface water can be partitioned into four different sections with evaporated coastal and reservoir water on the top followed by slightly enriched lowland water during nem and prem mixing zone with moderately depleted moderately enriched water and the maximum depleted highland water the groundwater inherited similar distribution as surface water with shallow dug wells in the top corner of the dual isotope plot followed by a mixing zone and depleted deep bore wells the depleted groundwater mostly belong to upper stretch of the basin thus indicating the catchment effect kumar et al 2019 which is the inheritance of isotopic characteristics of water from higher elevation watershed these results further point towards the influence of western ghats topography on the water cycle mechanism of the basin in order to understand this aspect in detail the cross plot of isotopes is replotted with samples categorized based on the physiography of the region based on broad geomorphic surfaces and altitudinal characteristics the study area is divided into 3 distinct regions i e highland midland and lowlands this sort of characterization and the corresponding δ18o signatures can provide information regarding the altitudinal control the orographic uplift of air masses and the subsequent depletion in the δ18o and δ2h values the distribution of δ18o and δ2h across the basin showed clear physiographic evidence by plotting depleted samples along highland enriched along lowland and mixed ones along midland regions fig 4 a and b this could be due to the altitude effect dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1993 of the western ghats orographic barrier resmi et al 2016 this is in accordance with rayleigh fractionation model which says that when an air mass traverses along increasing topography the heavier isotopes are favorably removed dansgaard 1964 many of the groundwater and surface water samples exhibited enriched isotopic records despite belonging to highland and midland regions these enriched samples represented shallow groundwater and evaporated surface water located right to the lmwl highland ground waters of this category were spatially located close to reservoirs and lake indicating recharge from these sources the concurrent δ18o and δ2h enrichment in water of these reservoirs and lakes water support this observation additionally all shallow dug well stations of the highland region were located within 5 km range of reservoirs or lakes justifying their enriched δ18o and δ2h signals fig 5 however groundwater samples plotted above the lmwl indicating the additional role of recirculated moisture probably sourced from the direct recharge of recycled precipitation to check the effect of evaporation in the groundwater the lc excess values are calculated a small number 7 out of 80 of groundwater samples have low lc excess values less than zero indicating their evaporation during the recharge process or the recharge of evaporated water this evaporative fractionation was visible only in shallow dug wells which confirms that the exposure of open well water lead to the lower lc excess when subsurface flow is activated due to non fractionated precipitation input evaporation fractionation in deep groundwater is reduced positive lc excess owing to the better hydrological connectivity in the basin sprenger et al 2016 3 3 influence of reservoirs on the water cycle dynamics the cross plot of δ18o and δ2h shows the crowding of a large number of groundwater samples around the lmwl fig 3c this indicates the direct recharge of groundwater via local precipitation the δ18o records in shallow dug wells suggest important recharge from the nearby reservoirs and lake with relatable δ18o records especially during prem season fig 5 for a detailed analysis of the influence of reservoirs and the water cycle dynamics we have divided the basin into four zones a zone i lowland region area encompassing the coastal region b zone ii midland region c zone iii highland region 1 encompassing the north east portion of the basin in highland region and d zone iv highland region 2 south east portion of the highland region prem season is chosen for understanding the role of reservoirs to nullify the effect of precipitation the δ18o signature in shallow dug wells from zone i show depleted values up to middle of the zone compared to the surface water fig 6 a revealing the recharge from higher altitudes however remaining dug well recorded relatively enriched signature matching with the δ18o of the river water and reservoir water meaning the recharge from surface water and reservoir additionally the reservoir water δ18o in this zone matched with the river water indicating its common sources the corresponding lc excess though lc excess values are not presented here values of these particular stations are negative showing evaporation signal though they produced positive values during the remaining seasons the δ18o records of surface water and dug well in middle of zone i to mid of zone ii fig 6b show less variation though the bore well exhibited depleted signature with positive lc excess in zone iii the surface water δ18o exhibited most depleted records in the central eastern side of the basin fig 6c the reservoir situated in this region do not show negative lc excess fig 7 similar phenomena has been observed in stream and dug well water located in this region however the stream and reservoir water draining central northern branch exhibited positive lc excess this contrasting response of kinetic fractionation supports the presence of different moisture sources the swm dominated end of the basin exhibited ve lc excess and the nem end exhibited ve lc excess the two waterfalls located along these ends are directly derived from the local precipitation hence we considered them as the primary inputs over these ends of the zone further variation of lc excess in succeeding samples well corresponded to the input in these waterfalls fig 7 these differences in the two ends of the zone iii can be explained with the higher rates of evapo transpiration over the kerala side of the zone and lower rates over the tamil nadu side of the zone goroshi et al 2017 also the positive lc excess in the tamil nadu side can be a result of the kinetically fractionated recirculated precipitation deshpande et al 2003 paul et al 2018 shallow dug wells located close to stream channel in zone iv matched well with the δ18o of streams dug well located away from the channel exhibited depleted signal probably inherited from the highlands a particular surface water sample exhibited enriched δ18o 0 4 than the other samples collected from this region this belonged to a narrow channel prior to its confluence with the main channel this channel had a travel history through tea plantations and excess water abstraction by the farms would have resulted into the observed enriched record 3 4 fractionation signals in surface water and groundwater the linear relationship between δ18o vs δ2h in precipitation collected across the globe is δ2h 8δ18o 10 craig 1961 however this equation is not applicable for closed basins and lakes that are influenced by kinetic fractionation due to evaporation hence the local relation between δ18o vs δ2h during equilibrium fractionation ie precipitation is derived as eq 3 it has to be noted that the lmwl exhibited a close relationship with the gmwl showing least influence of kinetic fractionation while calculating the surface water line swl coastal samples close to estuary are omitted in order to avoid the influence of seawater the surface water line swl eq 4 yielded a regression line with slope and intercept less than gmwl and lmwl this indicates that surface waters in the basin are affected by kinetic fractionation as a result of evaporation froehlich et al 2008 producing lower slope for the residual water the seasonal variations in the swl show lowest slopes and intercepts during nem and prem season the drier seasons the mean precipitation during nem and prem seasons in the study area is 235 and 419 mm respectively against the 1569 mm of 2016 swm and 2038 mm of 2017 swm we infer that the low precipitation amount and relative humidity during these seasons increase the evaporation rate thus producing lower slopes and intercepts additionally the swm of 2016 also had a lower slope and intercept despite being the dominant rainfall season table 1 the season rainfall during 2016 recorded a 31 deficiency to the normal in the basin which led to low flow and drought conditions this reveals that drought in the basin has affected the δ18o and δ2h chiogna et al 2018 values due to the kinetic fractionation resulted from excess evaporation the ground water line gwl eq 5 had least difference with the lmwl compared to the swl and lmwl however it exhibited seasonal variation though the evaporation effect was less this is because of the longer residence time of groundwater with lower chances of evaporation and consequently the groundwater signatures match with the isotopic signature of mean precipitation in the catchment chiogna et al 2018 the linear regression results are powerful in describing the influence of weather changes on the surface water δ18o values 3 δ 2 h 8 02 0 14 x δ 18 o 9 11 0 53 r 2 0 93 n 254 lmwl 4 δ 2 h 5 81 0 20 x δ 18 o 4 65 0 53 r 2 0 88 n 117 swl 5 δ 2 h 7 59 0 39 x δ 18 o 9 86 1 23 r 2 0 84 n 68 gwl 3 5 altitude and continental effects the dual isotope plots with respect to the highland midland and lowland locations have already revealed the role of physiography in δ18o across the basin here we explore the altitude and continental effect in controlling the distribution of surface water and groundwater δ18o in periyar basin as in fig 8 the δ18o records in the surface water were almost steady up to 90 km from sea and up to an elevation of 1000 m amsl though there were occasional enrichments even in some of the inland regions along high altitude ranges these enrichments were close to the reservoirs lakes and streams draining agricultural catchments the groundwater had a different behavior with gradual enrichments up to 60 km from the sea this was evident up to 50 m amsl beyond this point gradual depletion was observed in the δ18o of groundwater intermittent enrichments were observed in shallow wells dug wells few four samples collected during nem 2016 outside the basin exhibited a seemingly continental variation with δ18o ranging up to 5 5 these locations are situated northeast to the basin close to the tamil nadu uplands which imply that the observation is not driven by the altitude effect but due to the variation in the prevailing moisture source deshpande et al 2003 compared to other sampling locations these locations are dry and the rainfall along these regions is foremost supplied by the nem winds it is already examined that the nem is depleted than the swm owing to the δ18o depleted nature of bob than as and the difference in rainout pattern this shows that the observed variation is due to the spatial limit between swm and nem and the maximum eastward extent of the as moisture as the relative role of swm beyond the western ghats is small deshpande et al 2003 the spatial variability of surface water δ18o discrete 3 regions in the basin 1 coastal region with relatively enriched δ18o 2 region located towards the northeast part of the basin exhibiting depleted δ18o 3 the region falling in between the above two regions with gradual δ18o depletion since the first and second category of regions can mask the exact altitude and continental effect in the basin we have omitted these samples along with reservoir samples while doing the regression analysis for understanding the altitude effect the linear regression lines between physiographic variables and δ18o values during different seasons are shown in table 2 the regression coefficients for the respective analysis displayed seasonal variation though the coefficients varied seasonally it was more pronounced during swm season and maximum correlation is observed during swm of 2017 which was a normal rainfall year for surface water the deficient year 2016 δ18o values exhibited comparatively lower values of correlation coefficients with distance 0 64 and elevation 0 61 during the nem season the correlation coefficient values decreased to 0 45 and 0 54 respectively for elevation and distance this could be due to the changes in air circulation as the wind pattern changes from southwesterly to northeast the orographic uplift of moisture laden winds reverses thus reducing the altitude effect though staying significant p 0 05 the respective p values have also showed an increase from swm to the drier nem the δ18o has not reflected any significant correlation with any of these parameters during the prem season precipitation during this season is often interpreted as derived from continental local sources unnikrishnan warrier et al 2010 hence the lack of progressive depletion in δ18o on the basis of continental altitude effect is rational among the continental and altitude effects the continental effect is the more pronounced driver in depleting the heavier isotopes during rainout on a maximum the continental effect produced about 1 91 100 km 1 swm 17 though the average continental effect was 1 13 100 km 1 the case with groundwater also exhibited maximum continental and altitude effects during swm season of the normal year 2017 additionally swm of 2016 did not show any statistically significant distance effect displaying elevation dependent groundwater recharge during drier period however for groundwater the seasonal inheritance of elevation and distance effects are rather uncertain since the groundwater residence time from west of western ghats is not explored by any studies so far as per the literature available 3 6 wider implications the variability in monsoon circulation has triggered extreme weather conditions causing stress situations in many parts of the globe as well as in indian region dash et al 2009 roxy et al 2017 further inducing hydrological cycle changes the present study demonstrated the possibility of employing stable isotopes for investigating the hydrological cycle processes owing to the weather changes and the impact of drought especially when evaporation data is absent lc excess can provide micro scale information detailing the influence of different moisture sources thus over mountainous terrains spatial extend of the influence of orography can be delineated with the help of high spatial resolution lc excess data since no literature is available that demonstrates the use of lc excess values to study hydrological cycle dynamics in indian region the present study is first of its kind in the country although daily precipitation amount effect is not significant in many parts of the country as well as in southwestern india the present study shows an important role of weather fluctuations on the isotopic elevation effect most recent study revealing significant local amount effect in the seasonal rainwater lekshmy et al 2019 further supports this observation the mentioned aspect is significant for interpreting the results of paleoarchives especially for paleoelevation reconstruction studies of tropical regions with very few gnip stations over southern india and no gnir station the present study is a contribution to the global data base additionally the present study reiterate the need for future isotopic investigations focusing on the importance of moisture generated over the windward region in meeting the hydrological requirements of the drier leeward slopes 4 conclusion this is the first methodical stable isotope study in the periyar river basin of southern western ghats daily rain seasonal surface water and groundwater were sampled during the swm of 2016 to swm of 2017 the year 2016 was a drought year for the basin as well as for most parts of the country isotopic study suggested that the surface water and groundwater in the basin is of meteoric origin though a good number of samples exhibited evaporation fractionation signatures with negative lc excess values the shallow dug wells and surface water located close to reservoirs took over the δ18o and lc excess signatures from them evaporation signatures were dominant during the dry seasons nem and prem these negative lc excess records largely belonged to coastal reservoir and streams with flow tracks through agricultural fields a clear physiographic variation was observed in δ18o in surface water and groundwater exhibiting depleted signatures along highland region the stations located in north eastern end of highland region zone iii depicted negative lc excess inherited from the local precipitation waterfall while the same in the eastern side reveal positive lc excess following the trend of the local precipitation of the area this depicts the geographical extent of the transport of bob and as moisture the linear regressions between δ18o vs δ2h exhibited low slope and intercept along with less correlation during the drought period the effect of drought has influenced the altitude and continental effect in the basin by reducing the δ18o depletion owing to the excess evaporation fractionation present study suggests the further monitoring of evaporation fractionation from the remaining reservoirs of the basin which may have significant influence on rainfall distribution in the rain shadow region eastern side of western ghats declaration of competing interest the authors

5928,this study links the changing hydrology in the lower mekong river basin lmrb caused by accelerated dam construction to a dietary shift from fish to land animal meat meat hereafter as a primary source of protein a shift toward a westernized diet in the lmrb countries i e cambodia lao pdr thailand and vietnam has been observed in the recent past however neither the hydrological changes from dam construction as a cause for the dietary shift nor the effects of increasing shift from fish to meat on virtual water have been adequately studied here we derive a univariate relationship between fish catch and flooded areas by using a hydrodynamic model and yearly fish catch data we find a strong correlation between catch per capita and yearly flood occurrence in the lmrb results suggest that fish catch in the tonlé sap lake region may reduce by 8 under a scenario of altered flood occurrence caused by potential reduction in peak flow in the main stem mekong by 50 the same reduction in peak flow could however lead to an increase in catch within a larger lmrb sub region but such increase would be marginal next based on the historical production and consumption of meat we find an increase in meat production and consumption per capita over time further analysis of land use change suggests a 2 cropland expansion mainly due to an increase in meat production finally from the virtual water trade vwt network we find that the total vwt of the lmrb tripled from 1988 to 2016 due to a significant rise in trade partners keywords mekong river basin dams hydrological modeling fish catch virtual water trade 1 introduction dam construction driven by regional socio economic growth and rising energy demands is causing a radical shift in the natural hydrologic regime of the lower mekong river basin lmrb which in turn is adversely affecting fish productivity diversity and catch there is growing evidence that some of the existing dams have modified the flood dynamics and impacted livelihoods through changes in fisheries arias et al 2014 baran et al 2015 baran and myschowoda 2009 brownell et al 2017 dugan et al 2010 kondolf et al 2014 kummu and sarkkula 2008 lu and siew 2006 wild et al 2019 xue et al 2011 concomitantly rapid population growth and strong social reforms have led the diet of the lmrb nations i e cambodia lao pdr thailand and vietnam to gravitate toward water intensive sources of protein orr et al 2012a pittock et al 2017 further the region is expected to add a significant number of additional large dams 16 in the main stem and 110 in the tributaries in the foreseeable future pokhrel et al 2018a it is expected that these new dams would cause widespread alterations of flood pulse dynamics and loss in fish productivity and diversity grumbine and xu 2011 keskinen et al 2012 lauri et al 2012 stone 2011 winemiller et al 2016 ziv et al 2012 in the past two decades the mekong river underwentfaed significant changes due to the construction of dams arias et al 2014 baran et al 2015 baran and myschowoda 2009 brownell et al 2017 dugan et al 2010 kondolf et al 2014 kummu and sarkkula 2008 lu and siew 2006 wild et al 2019 xue et al 2011 the 53 000 mw potential hydropower generation in the main stem of the river and an additional 35 000 mw in its tributaries has attracted significant international attention toward harnessing this vast potential by building large scale hydropower dams grumbine and xu 2011 icem 2010 keskinen et al 2012 lauri et al 2012 pokhrel et al 2018a stone 2011 winemiller et al 2016 ziv et al 2012 this is bound to disrupt the river s natural hydrology and hinder fish reproduction by changing the natural hydrologic regime and blocking migratory pathways pokhrel et al 2018b for example studies have found unprecedented and unpredictable flow fluctuations during dry and wet seasons in the region caused by the yali falls dam in the sesan river which caused severe damages to downstream crops livestock fisheries and thus livelihoods pearse smith 2012 wyatt and baird 2007 in addition dam construction has impacted the region s ecology for instance a drop in migratory fish biomass by up to 51 3 was recorded in 2012 ziv et al 2012 as a result 100 fish species were suggested to have joined the critically endangered list ziv et al 2012 drastic physical manipulations of river flow contribute to a decline in fish populations as well especially that of migratory fish which account for 71 of the fisheries yield in the lmrb barlow et al 2008 for instance a strong association between fish catch and water level during 1998 2001 period was reported for the tonlé sap lake tsl which captures the importance of flood variation and its effect on fish catch and migration patterns van zalinge et al 2003 another study by mcintyre et al 2016 suggested a relationship between river discharge and fish catch which they used to downscale fish catch over the major global river basins and study freshwater fishery sabo et al 2017 took a different approach deriving a multivariate relationship between fish population and flood anomalies of the mekong river suggesting a strong dependence between the two however the impacts of dams on hydrology and in turn on fish catch have not yet been adequately studied there have been some studies e g sabo et al 2017 ziv et al 2012 but they have only considered the effects of dams as physical barriers on fish migration or hydrological anomalies on fish populations separately thus given that significant number of dams are planned to be constructed in the lmrb it is critical to understand how fish catch will be impacted directly from the flood pattern alterations today the livelihoods of 80 of the 60 million inhabitants of the lmrb is reliant on fisheries and agriculture that depend heavily on seasonal rainfall and flood patterns baran and myschowoda 2009 icem 2010 the hydrological regime of the mekong river is characterized by a seasonal flood pulse producing a strong unimodal flow pattern junk et al 1989 which secures the reproduction of most migratory fish icem 2010 such flood pulse pattern can be largely modified by dams that alter the magnitude timing and flow amounts delgado et al 2012 haddeland et al 2006 hanasaki et al 2006 lauri et al 2012 pokhrel et al 2016 2012 sabo et al 2017 shin et al 2019 veldkamp et al 2017 using observed river discharge data a study has shown that cascade dams in the upper mekong i e the lancang river in china have already caused significant changes in river flow patterns causing 29 36 dampening and 34 155 increase in seasonal flows during the wet and dry seasons respectively räsänen and kummu 2013 additionally pokhrel et al 2018b investigated the potential impacts of dam construction on the flood pulse dynamics of the lmrb by considering varying flow regulation scenarios that typically result from reservoir operation they showed that a dampening of peak flow in the main stem mekong by 10 50 would cause a change in flow reversal by 11 80 and 15 88 at the outlet of tsl and the prek kdam station in the tonlé sap river respectively flood pulse reduction is an important factor to be considered when examining fish population decline however physical barriers created by dams is another heavily studied variable such barriers prevent spawning of migratory species which are of biological and economic importance dugan et al 2010 the large number of proposed dams could add further stress and significantly impact the flood pulse pattern affecting the magnitude duration and timing of flooding in the lmrb such changes will affect the fishery as noted above however none of the mentioned changes deal with fish population response as a direct result of hydrological changes from dam construction this calls for a critical need for robust and thorough examination of the likely impact of changing flooding patterns on fish catch in the lmrb especially the flooded area around tsl and mekong delta annual fish catch is affected by hydrologic changes caused by dams and climate change however additional factors also play important roles for example local demand consumption and market conditions trade can have implications for dietary patterns which in turn affect fish catch also a dietary shift of protein from fish to meat e g cattle chicken pig sheep goat and horse in the lmrb nations has been widely reported orr et al 2012a pittock et al 2017 which puts water resources surrounding ecosystems and biodiversity under increasing pressure meat as opposed to fish is predominantly a water intensive product hence the concept of virtual water trade vwt which is the total amount of transported water embedded in the production of a commodity also known as water footprint has been employed as a tool for measuring the quantity of water involved in trade chapagain and hoekstra 2008 since the water footprint of meat protein surpasses that of fish a suggested effort to reduce fresh water use globally is optimizing vwt dalin et al 2012 balancing water use through food production is crucial because it is the highest freshwater consuming process taking up to 80 of the world s water resources rost et al 2008 thus the concept of water savings ws which is described as the difference in water use during the production of a commodity between specific geographical locations is used to derive a balanced approach to the production of meat commodities chapagain et al 2006 vwt and ws have been studied at different spatial and temporal scales liu et al 2019 however these concepts have not yet been applied in the lmrb region given the above background here we present the first study that examines the connection between potential hydrological variations stemming from dam construction and changes in fish catch in the lmrb and constructs a 28 year historical vwt network for the region our study is driven by the following science questions is there a relationship between fish catch and potential hydrological variations induced by dam construction in the lmrb what is the impact of a dietary shift from fish to livestock products on vwt between the lmrb and the rest of the world row how might we optimize ws by balancing meat production between the lmrb and the row we pursue the following specific objectives to address these science questions 1 develop a univariate relationship between fish catch and flooded areas to downscale fish catch data using results from a hydrological model and examine fish catch temporal variability 2 construct a vwt network using virtual water content vwc of meat commodities and trade data to study the impacts of adopting a higher meat based diet and 3 compare the estimated effects of domestic i e within lmrb countries and internationally i e the row produced meat commodities in terms of ws to determine optimal production locations for each commodity these science questions and objectives are addressed by using results from a hydrodynamic model along with data on international trade production and consumption of fish and meat the impacts of operational dams on hydrology and fish catch are analyzed through downscaling historical catch data and distributing these data to the lmrb the potential impacts of future dams are estimated by combining hydrological results from pokhrel et al 2018b and the distribution principles of the catch next the ramifications of multifaceted processes that channel a dietary shift in the lmrb such as land use and land cover lulc hereafter change and increased water usage for agriculture that the new protein source pattern brings to the lmrb nations are explored specifically lulc changes are analyzed for a 24 year period additionally we examine meat commodities in terms of vwt by constructing a vwt network 2 study area the study area is the lmrb fig 1 located in southeast asia which has a total area of 606 000 km2 covering 76 of the entire mekong river basin with a total area of 795 000 km2 frenken 2012 the lmrb is shared by four countries cambodia lao pdr thailand and vietnam area contribution summarized in table s1 the mekong river s mean annual water discharge is approximately 475 km3 year or 15 000 m3 s making it the 10th largest river in the world in terms of annual flow at its mouth mrc 2005 it flows through 2600 km of channels from the golden triangle to the south china sea at the mekong delta mrc 2010 2005 the lmrb is characterized by flat fertile lands that stretch over long distances and by strong climatic gradients human development and a plethora of managed ecosystems are co evolving in the basin resulting in rapidly emerging global issues such as land cover change river flow regulation and habitat loss pokhrel et al 2018a compared to other major river basins of the world the mekong river basin mrb remains relatively unaltered by dams grumbine and xu 2011 nilsson et al 2005 despite having many dams constructed over the past few decades the effects on the main stem mekong are still relatively small because most existing dams are located in the tributaries fig 1 and capture only a small portion of the annual flow volume grumbine and xu 2011 winemiller et al 2016 the river system at hand still manifests distinctive wet and dry seasons as direct outcomes of the seasonal variability in precipitation which supports highly productive riverine ecological systems and agriculture food production in the lmrb is heavily reliant on timely rainfall that modulates the seasonal flood pulse fredén 2011 these hydro climatic characteristics allow the lmrb to house an important ecosystem responsible for the largest inland fishery which feeds local inhabitants as well as a significant fraction of rest of the world ziv et al 2012 to put this into perspective last decade s estimate of 2 2 mega tonnes mt of wild fish harvest from the mekong was worth between 2 2 3 9 billion at first scale and 4 3 7 8 billion on retail markets hortle 2009 3 methods data and model 3 1 production and consumption of commodities the production and consumption of commodities specifically fish and meat are analyzed using the data from the u n food and agricultural organization fao production and consumption of meat for each of the lmrb countries individually and the total for all nations is analyzed for the 1988 2013 period the same process is followed for fish this study then investigates important points in time by calculating statistical changepoints for each category 3 2 fish catch downscale fish catch is downscaled by using the flooded areas simulated by the hydrodynamic model cama flood pokhrel et al 2018b results of cama flood model for the lmrb have been extensively validated in previous studies including our own pokhrel et al 2018b yamazaki et al 2014 2011 here for completeness we revisit the validation of the simulated river discharge fig s1 in the supplementary materials which is a primary determinant of the simulated flooded areas as seen in this figure river discharge is well simulated by the model over the entire lmrb except for some locations in the delta region due to the lack of tidal effects in the model an exponential function that describes the relationship between flooded area and catch is developed by comparing nationwide historical catch data to the results of flooded areas from the cama flood model see section 3 6 for model details the data are transformed to a logarithmic function and through linear regression a univariate model is derived following the approach used by mcintyre et al 2016 the newly derived function is expressed as c 0 6604afl 1 071 see fig s2 where c is potential fish catch tonnes year and afl is annual flooded area m2 next we use the model results to calculate potential fish catch in the lmrb in particular we use the simulated flooded areas and flood depth from cama flood at 10 km grid resolution with simulation settings identical to that in pokhrel et al 2018b any grid cell with an average water depth under 20 cm is excluded since the reported catch data from fao is only reported by large fisheries that target deeper areas next flooded areas for 1981 2010 period are run through the univariate model which yields yearly raster data of potential catch these values are then used to apportion the reported annual catch data from fao using a weighted average approach expressed as ci cp i cactual σcp i where ci is the observational fish catch distributed to grid cell i cp i is potential fish catch of grid cell i cactual is the observational fish catch of the country in which the grid cell is located and σcp i is the total potential fish catch over the given country then we analyze the downscaled fish catch for wet and dry years since the effects of flow regulation on flood patterns vary significantly during years with low discharge and precipitation dry years and years with high discharge and precipitation wet years the wet years i e 2000 2001 2006 2007 were chosen from an analysis of the total yearly flooded area in the lmrb from 1981 to 2010 likewise the dry years i e 1998 2003 2004 2005 were selected from the same analysis by choosing those years with the least flooding we choose only the most extreme years from the decade between 1998 and 2008 in an attempt to avoid the highest fish catch growth years which can be attributed to fishing technological advances from the 1990s sverdrup jensen 2002 the wet and dry year analysis of catch data is normalized by computing catch per capita before carrying out the spatial distribution to reduce the effect of demand increase stemming from population growth here the goal is to analyze the isolated effects of changes in flooded areas these results are distributed following the same procedure described above 3 3 change in fish catch potential changes in fish catch due to flow regime change is estimated using the aforementioned univariate fish catch model of flooded area c 0 6604afl 1 071 for in depth analysis we specify two domains the lower mekong sub region and the tsl region see section 4 2 to represent the potential effects of upstream flow regulation and climate change on flooded areas in those regions we set scenarios where the magnitude of peak flow based on the average daily hydrograph for 1981 2010 period at the inlet of those regions near stung treng yellow star in fig 1 is reduced by 10 20 30 40 and 50 the daily hydrograph is then adjusted to preserve annual water balance pokhrel et al 2018b the flow is altered at this particular location because fish migration from the mekong delta and tsl region generally occurs up to this point which is under khone falls the majority of known spawning and nursing grounds of different fish species are downstream of this location cowx et al 2015 poulsen et al 2002 the location is also near the most downstream dam of the among planned and commissioned dams in the mekong river i e sambor dam for each scenario the monthly flooded areas of those two regions are calculated and the monthly potential change in fish catch is accordingly estimated for details of model setup readers may refer to pokhrel et al 2018b 3 4 virtual water understanding the quantity of virtual water that flows in and out of nations is crucial when optimizing water use at regional and global or even local levels a complete analysis of this concept includes the calculation of virtual water exports as well as virtual water imports in section 4 4 we summarize the virtual water flows of each lmrb country as well as the total for all nations important fluctuations over the study period are analyzed by calculating changepoints using the r changepoint package killick and eckley 2014 the rise in water use that compensates for elevated meat consumption is examined by constructing a meat vwt network from 1988 to 2016 the vwc which is the amount of water required to produce a given commodity of each commodity considered was retrieved from chapagain and hoekstra 2003 for greater details on how virtual water content from feed is calculated the reader is referred to hoekstra 2003 vwt export values are estimated by multiplying the trade data from faostat fao statistics by its corresponding vwc using the following equation vwt i j x lmb vwc i x t i j x lmb where vwt i j x lmb is the local virtual water trade in volume k g water of commodity x exported from a lmrb country i to a row country j through trade vwc i x is the virtual water content k g water kg product of commodity produced in country i t i j x lmb is the volume of commodity k g product produced in the lmrb and exported from i to j similarly vwt for the importing values are estimated using the following equation vwt i j x for vwc row x t i j x for where vwt i j x for is the foreign from row countries virtual water trade in volume k g water of commodity x exported from an lmrb country i to a row country j through trade vwc i r o w is the virtual water content k g water kg product of commodity produced in foreign country i t i j x lmb is the volume of commodity k g product produced in the row and exported from i to j 3 5 data to downscale fish catch we use the following datasets the historical 1981 2010 annual fish catch data from fao fishstat http www fao org

values are retrieved from chapagain and hoekstra 2003 3 6 model the model used in this study is the global hydrodynamic model named cama flood yamazaki et al 2014 2011 cama flood is selected for this study because it simulates the channel bifurcation process which is important in the lmrb yamazaki et al 2014 and because it has been validated for the mrb yamazaki et al 2014 pokhrel et al 2018a b details can be found in yamazaki et al 2014 2011 here we highlight key features of the model for completeness version 3 6 of the model simulates river floodplain hydrodynamics by solving the shallow water equation for open channel flow cama flood was set up at a 10 km resolution with regional level settings for the mrb yamazaki et al 2014 relevant output variables used in this study from cama flood including inundated area and water level are diagnosed from water storage from each unit catchment river discharge is calculated using the shallow water equation all simulation settings and parameters are identical to those in pokhrel et al 2018b 4 results and discussion 4 1 downscaled fish catch fig 2 a presents the downscaled fish catch for the 1981 2010 period these results suggest a monotonous growth in total fish catch over time this is apparent throughout the domain fig 2a however the areas of highest concentration e g the tsl show the most obvious increase in fish catch which is likely because the primary driver of increased fish catch is market demand which is driven by population and economic growth thus to minimize the effect of population we normalize the yearly data which allows for a per capita based downscaling facilitating a more appropriate catch comparison with hydrology by eliminating the large fluctuations caused by population growth the downscaled data at the country level are provided in supplementary tables s2 and s3 fig 2b shows the distribution of fish catch per capita for four historically dry years it is found that most of the fish catch is distributed in the tsl and the mekong delta regions year 1998 is by far the driest year section 3 2 coinciding with the lowest fish catch density the fish catch of cambodia the country in which tsl fish production occurs shows a sudden growth spurt in 1998 fig s4 when the asian financial crisis ended and better fishing technology was adopted following many years of low fish production and consumption costales 2004 the growth in fish catch in tsl is evident even through the dry years fig 2b further 1998 coincides with calculated changepoints for cambodia laos and the lmrb overall and continuous and stable growth can be seen through 2005 fig s4 hence the years chosen for analysis fall within this range further although the results show growth in fish production until 2005 fig s4 fig 2b shows lower fish catch in thailand in 2005 than in 2003 and 2004 which is especially evident in regions north of tsl between latitude 14 n and 17 n this is in congruence with the decline in fish consumption in thailand fig s4 conversely in vietnam the highest catch can be seen between latitude 15 n and 20 n in 2005 out of all the dry years fig 2 this is again in congruence with the growth in fish production fig s4 other historically dry years i e 2003 2004 show small levels of consumption and production which is consistent with our correlation between flooded areas and catch fig 2c shows the fish catch per capita distributed for four historically wet years a generally denser distribution of fish in the lmrb and the outer basin compared to that in the dry years fig 2b is readily discernable in fig 2c this is especially noticeable between latitude 12 n and 13 n in thailand and inside the lmrb with the exception of the tsl the barely discernible differences in the tsl are expected as this water body is a suitable location for fishing for a wide range of water levels because of its large size and ability to remain filled for a significant portion of the year overall it is found that fish catch is strongly impacted by the abundance or lack of flooded areas in the lmrb year 2000 shows the highest density of fish catch compared to years 2001 2006 and 2007 further suggesting a strong correlation between flooded area and catch this is highlighted between latitudes 17 n and 20 n at the border between laos and thailand again wet years i e 2006 2007 show rapid growth fig s4 in overall fish production and consumption 4 2 change in fish catch fig 3 shows how potential fish catch within the lmrb sub region including the mekong delta and tsl blue and orange boxes respectively in fig 3c could be affected by the potential changes in flood dynamics due to upstream flow alteration by dams results shown are for the baseline unaltered flow and five flow alteration scenarios see section 3 3 for more details and are arranged according to areas flooded for a given number of months in a year for the lower mekong sub domain fig 3a results suggest that fish catch could decrease due to flow alteration in areas that are flooded for 1 to 5 months per year and the impact proportionately increases with the degree of peak flow reduction the opposite is true for areas flooded for 6 to 12 months on an annual basis changes in catch are both positive and negative under different flow alteration scenarios table s4 but the magnitudes are rather small with an increase by 0 23 under the highest flow alteration scenario this increase is caused by an overall increase in permanently flooded 12 month flood occurrence areas which shows how the compensation of the newly flooded areas created by the dampened seasonal flood pulse may benefit potential catch similar results fig 3b are found for the tsl region orange rectangle in fig 3c those areas with short flood occurrence in the tsl region flooded for 1 to 6 months show a decreased fish catch potential under increased flow alteration scenarios conversely the areas with relatively long flood occurrence flooded for 7 to 12 months show progressively higher potential fish catch with increase in the degree of flow alteration on an annual basis fish catch could potentially decline in this region under all flow alteration scenarios table s5 with the highest reduction by 8 under the 50 alteration scenario the tsl results table s5 highlight how fish catch in one of the most productive areas in the lmrb could be directly impacted by potential hydrological alterations by dams however these results should be interpreted with caution for various reasons first the study does not account for the physical barriers that the future dams will impose on the migratory species as this information is not available second the study does not account for changes in habitat and actual fish population losses because this is a multifaceted process which falls outside the scope and capacity of our modeling framework third and last potential fish catch variations do not account for the response of different species i e migratory non migratory to the hydrological variations of the mekong river undoubtedly these potential changes in fish catch would be devastating to livelihoods in the surrounding lmrb communities it is known that this is starting to occur and a major dietary shift has already been taking place in the lmrb countries orr et al 2012b pittock et al 2017 4 3 land use and land cover change next we examine a 24 year lulc change in the lmrb in an effort to relate these changes to observed dietary shift in the region fig 4 depicts historical transitions in lulc categories in the lmrb results indicate a two percent increase in cropland as well as mosaic tree and shrub herbaceous cover between 1992 and 2015 fig 4 the majority of the increase in cropland areas and other land use types comes from a drop in tree cover area which is estimated at 4 in 24 years to put that into perspective a one percent change in land use is equivalent to 60 600 km2 meaning that a total of 242 400 km2 of tree cover was lost in the past two decades the majority of the region s cropland is used to grow crops such as maize and soy and literature suggests these crops are used primarily for livestock feed in the united states for example 87 of maize yields are evenly split between animal feed and ethanol production leaving only 13 for human consumption ranum et al 2014 an fao report estimated that at least 50 of grain production globally is fed to livestock fao 2004 regarding land use this translates to 75 of all agricultural land including crop and pasture being dedicated to animal production foley et al 2011 that is of the 121 200 km2 of cropland added in the past 2 5 decades fig 4 90 900 km2 is indirectly caused by increases in meat production as fish consumption per capita declines in the lmrb countries the loss of protein is expected to be replaced eventually by land based animal protein local production of meat in the lmrb countries continues to rise fig s5 requiring more feed and grazing land for livestock to understand how dietary habits are changing over time in the lmrb countries we next discuss the dynamics of meat exports and imports in terms of water use i e virtual water 4 4 virtual water flows fig 5 summarizes vwf of meat products including cattle pig sheep goat chicken and horse the vwf of the lmrb countries during 1988 2005 period was largely dominated by trade fluctuations in thailand thailand produces more meat products than it consumes fig s5 thus the gap between production and consumption is equal to the quantity of meat products exported i e virtual water outflow the same is true for the three smaller economies except that in their case consumption grows at a higher rate than production meaning that these nations import a significant amount of virtual water in the form of meat the statistically calculated changepoint corresponding to vwf exports falls in year 2003 this is the same year that the poultry industry in thailand was affected by the highly pathogenic asian avian influenza hpai outbreak resulting in plummeting chicken production and trade naranong 2007 this serves as an independent confirmation for the validity of the observational trade data as well as the methodology used for vwf calculations the second calculated changepoint corresponds to inflow and it falls in year 2009 which is in line with spikes observed in meat consumption in vietnam and cambodia fig s5 a rise in the flow of virtual water into laos for this same year can be observed however this is not in congruence with the reported production and consumption of meat products where an equivalent production and consumption fluctuation is observed an expected near zero inflow of virtual water to thailand can be from 1988 to 2013 fig 5 presumably some of the meat products imported to thailand are not part of their main production commodities the year 2014 shows a recuperation in thailand s virtual water outflow combined with a drop in virtual water inflow meaning that local production is picking after the hpai outbreak and the country is able to sustain the local and global demand for meat products the virtual water outflow of thailand stands out the most as it follows a strong increase in meat exports until 2003 when it drops dramatically only recovering a decade later i e in 2013 while this drop is consistent with the decline in production results fig s5 indicate a recovery in three years 2004 2006 the vwf however shows a 10 year recovery period fig 5 which is because chicken was the most affected yet is also the main export product and also one of the most water intensive meat products costales 2004 as previously mentioned the literature points to the hpai outbreak as the main cause for the drop in vwf outflow from chicken however there are limited studies on why the recovery process took ten years we identified three plausible explanations first lost business relationships with partnering nations second extended contracts being formed between former partner nations and the replacement of suppliers and third the inability of the meat industry to overcome the financial burden of losing such massive amounts of products in the case of cambodia an expected near zero inflow of virtual water can be seen from 1988 to 2007 from 2007 to 2016 an accelerated rate of meat imports is observed which coincides with the inflow changepoint of 2008 for the lmrb fig 5 this is the same period specifically 2007 2013 during which consumption exceeds production fig s5 additionally virtual water outflow results are only available for the years 2005 2011 2014 and 2015 fig 5 thus 2005 and 2011 are the only years where the production of meat products exceeded consumption fig s5 this again acts as an independent validation of the methodology behind the vwt calculations and the trade data retrieved similarly this is the case for vietnam with near zero inflow and outflow reported until 2007 when meat consumption increased at a faster rate than production opening an import gap the observed rise in meat imports also coincides with the changepoint for virtual water inflow in the lmrb fig 5 the inflow of vietnam peaks by 2011 and then drops which coincides with the years when a gap between meat consumption and production decreases in that country as consumption was slightly higher than production between 1998 and 2006 fig s5 only a small quantity of virtual water inflow can be seen in fig 5 similar to cambodia between the years 2007 and 2013 vietnam consumed more meat than it produced fig s5 and this is precisely the period when the virtual water inflow of meat rises significantly finally for the outflow of virtual water of laos 1990 1993 2000 2001 2002 and 2015 are the only years with reported exports of meat out of all of these instances none of the datapoints shows a noticeable difference between production and consumption fig s5 the years with reported outflow fig 5 have very small values so it is likely that the difference between production and consumption is simply not visible conversely inflows were small until 2009 when the export of virtual water tripled it is important to note however that the scale at which laos experienced this growth is still small relative to that of thailand and vietnam nonetheless individually speaking the vwf and production and consumption behaviors are not in perfect harmony which points to some reliability issues and limitations of the reported data for laos to further investigate the vwt of meat commodities in the lmrb countries a vwt network is constructed and presented in the following section this will highlight the trade dynamics of the lmrb countries with the row and provide an in depth understanding of the effects of a dietary shift in the four nations on the row 4 5 virtual water trade network the magnitude and direction of virtual water flows embedded in meat products e g cattle chicken pig sheep goat and horse is presented in fig 6 as a vwt circle plot it is obvious from fig 6a that the majority of the virtual water outflow in 1998 came from thailand green and was destined for the rest of asia i e the remaining asian countries excluding thailand cambodia vietnam and laos red it is also apparent that none of the other regions traded meat products however due to the nature of these plots the thickness of the arrows represents the magnitude of flow transferred from one region to the other compared to that of the remaining transfer regions that is thailand s exports were so large compared to that of the other regions that the trade among the row becomes negligible thus very narrow in fig 6a further the production and consumption of meat commodities match e g between 1988 and 2003 for vietnam fig s5 suggesting almost no international trade of these products despite the presence of growth fig 6a c f show noticeably large interactions between thailand and the rest of asia because historically japan has been the main importer of poultry from thailand costales 2004 additionally this has been mainly attributed to the introduction of evaporative cooling and to poultry taking over the livestock market share of thailand in early years 1998 2001 rising from 30 to 53 costales 2004 moving forward to 1995 fig 6b shows a dramatic increase in intercontinental virtual water flows when vietnam became a large importer from the rest of asia the americas and europe this does not mean that thailand reduced its exports to japan it merely suggests that the other regions with higher export bands became larger virtual water exporters than thailand in 2004 fig 6c thailand s chicken export declined to such a significant extent that its virtual water export became on par with that of vietnam this is a result of the hpai outbreak which resulted in a ban by most importers of frozen broiler meat from thailand in 2004 naranong 2007 on the flip side in 2005 following large economic growth vietnam displays a boom in meat consumption despite local underproduction of the commodity hansen 2018 this is corroborated by the calculated consumption changepoint in 2005 fig s4 by 2008 thailand can be seen to be recovering by beginning to export meat products to neighboring nations where its largest trade partner becomes vietnam this explains why thailand does not show any signs of recovery fig 5 while production levels still rise fig s5 fig 6d highlights the growth in meat consumption of vietnam as it becomes the highest lmrb importer of virtual water the first noticeable trade interaction for laos can be seen in 2012 fig 6e when it becomes thailand s largest virtual water importer thailand also shows signs of economic recovery by branching out its trade to regions such as africa and europe fig 6f indicates that thailand recovered and surpassed its trading capacity to that of 1988 fig 6a overall the lmrb countries show significant changes in trade dynamics during the period studied 1988 2016 more importantly however the overall growth and addition of all of the trading partners from 1988 to 2016 tripled the total magnitude of vwt in the lmrb table s6 in other words water demand from a dietary shift towards meat increased three fold 5 conclusions this paper investigates two overarching topics the first is an exploration of fish catch dynamics in the lmrb and the second is a construction of a vwt system for meat products in the lmrb countries the newly devised relationship between fish catch and flooded areas suggests that there is a strong correlation between the two this relationship is studied by normalizing the catch data by removing population growth from the observable trend to estimate catch per capita and comparing it to flooded area in dry and wet years results indicate that if future dams restrict the peak flow in the main stem mekong by 50 the effects on flood dynamics could be responsible for 8 fish catch loss in the tsl region in a larger lower mekong sub region that includes the mekong delta flow alteration could increase fish catch as a result of increased permanently flooded areas but such an increase in catch is found to be marginal next to examine the impact of dietary shifts in the lmrb on land use lulc types are mapped for four separate years between 1992 and 2016 results indicate an area of 242 400 km2 of tree cover loss and a gain in 121 200 km2 of cropland area in the past two and a half decades as most of the cropland is used to grow crops for feed this is one of the measured impacts from the dietary protein shift which is exacerbated by population and economic growth in the region the impact of the dietary shift on water resources is further studied by constructing yearly vwt networks from 1988 to 2016 these results indicate that the total vwt of the lmrb tripled from 1988 to 2016 due to a significant increase in number of trade partners fig 6 and table s6 there are several limitations of this study first the effects of fish catch derived from our model do not take into consideration fish species population and habitat which could all be affected by altered streamflow and flooding patterns future studies could address this issue second our catch model does not consider migratory fish movement blockage by dams even though the location used to modify the flow is around the uppermost point where fish migration from the tonlé sap lake and mekong delta regions generally stop cowx et al 2015 poulsen et al 2002 third this study uses potential flow alteration scenarios without considering the planned or proposed dams in the lmrb because significant uncertainties remain about the actual size location and timing of the planned dams these issues will be addressed in our future studies that will simulate the effects of individual dams fourth future studies could also consider accounting for uncertainties behind the vwt computations as this is an area that remains understudied lastly the concept of water savings should be explored in this context since it would provide insights on improved water resource management for the production and supply of meat commodities future studies should focus on these issues in order to further the discussion and aid policy makers in making the right decisions

5928,this study links the changing hydrology in the lower mekong river basin lmrb caused by accelerated dam construction to a dietary shift from fish to land animal meat meat hereafter as a primary source of protein a shift toward a westernized diet in the lmrb countries i e cambodia lao pdr thailand and vietnam has been observed in the recent past however neither the hydrological changes from dam construction as a cause for the dietary shift nor the effects of increasing shift from fish to meat on virtual water have been adequately studied here we derive a univariate relationship between fish catch and flooded areas by using a hydrodynamic model and yearly fish catch data we find a strong correlation between catch per capita and yearly flood occurrence in the lmrb results suggest that fish catch in the tonlé sap lake region may reduce by 8 under a scenario of altered flood occurrence caused by potential reduction in peak flow in the main stem mekong by 50 the same reduction in peak flow could however lead to an increase in catch within a larger lmrb sub region but such increase would be marginal next based on the historical production and consumption of meat we find an increase in meat production and consumption per capita over time further analysis of land use change suggests a 2 cropland expansion mainly due to an increase in meat production finally from the virtual water trade vwt network we find that the total vwt of the lmrb tripled from 1988 to 2016 due to a significant rise in trade partners keywords mekong river basin dams hydrological modeling fish catch virtual water trade 1 introduction dam construction driven by regional socio economic growth and rising energy demands is causing a radical shift in the natural hydrologic regime of the lower mekong river basin lmrb which in turn is adversely affecting fish productivity diversity and catch there is growing evidence that some of the existing dams have modified the flood dynamics and impacted livelihoods through changes in fisheries arias et al 2014 baran et al 2015 baran and myschowoda 2009 brownell et al 2017 dugan et al 2010 kondolf et al 2014 kummu and sarkkula 2008 lu and siew 2006 wild et al 2019 xue et al 2011 concomitantly rapid population growth and strong social reforms have led the diet of the lmrb nations i e cambodia lao pdr thailand and vietnam to gravitate toward water intensive sources of protein orr et al 2012a pittock et al 2017 further the region is expected to add a significant number of additional large dams 16 in the main stem and 110 in the tributaries in the foreseeable future pokhrel et al 2018a it is expected that these new dams would cause widespread alterations of flood pulse dynamics and loss in fish productivity and diversity grumbine and xu 2011 keskinen et al 2012 lauri et al 2012 stone 2011 winemiller et al 2016 ziv et al 2012 in the past two decades the mekong river underwentfaed significant changes due to the construction of dams arias et al 2014 baran et al 2015 baran and myschowoda 2009 brownell et al 2017 dugan et al 2010 kondolf et al 2014 kummu and sarkkula 2008 lu and siew 2006 wild et al 2019 xue et al 2011 the 53 000 mw potential hydropower generation in the main stem of the river and an additional 35 000 mw in its tributaries has attracted significant international attention toward harnessing this vast potential by building large scale hydropower dams grumbine and xu 2011 icem 2010 keskinen et al 2012 lauri et al 2012 pokhrel et al 2018a stone 2011 winemiller et al 2016 ziv et al 2012 this is bound to disrupt the river s natural hydrology and hinder fish reproduction by changing the natural hydrologic regime and blocking migratory pathways pokhrel et al 2018b for example studies have found unprecedented and unpredictable flow fluctuations during dry and wet seasons in the region caused by the yali falls dam in the sesan river which caused severe damages to downstream crops livestock fisheries and thus livelihoods pearse smith 2012 wyatt and baird 2007 in addition dam construction has impacted the region s ecology for instance a drop in migratory fish biomass by up to 51 3 was recorded in 2012 ziv et al 2012 as a result 100 fish species were suggested to have joined the critically endangered list ziv et al 2012 drastic physical manipulations of river flow contribute to a decline in fish populations as well especially that of migratory fish which account for 71 of the fisheries yield in the lmrb barlow et al 2008 for instance a strong association between fish catch and water level during 1998 2001 period was reported for the tonlé sap lake tsl which captures the importance of flood variation and its effect on fish catch and migration patterns van zalinge et al 2003 another study by mcintyre et al 2016 suggested a relationship between river discharge and fish catch which they used to downscale fish catch over the major global river basins and study freshwater fishery sabo et al 2017 took a different approach deriving a multivariate relationship between fish population and flood anomalies of the mekong river suggesting a strong dependence between the two however the impacts of dams on hydrology and in turn on fish catch have not yet been adequately studied there have been some studies e g sabo et al 2017 ziv et al 2012 but they have only considered the effects of dams as physical barriers on fish migration or hydrological anomalies on fish populations separately thus given that significant number of dams are planned to be constructed in the lmrb it is critical to understand how fish catch will be impacted directly from the flood pattern alterations today the livelihoods of 80 of the 60 million inhabitants of the lmrb is reliant on fisheries and agriculture that depend heavily on seasonal rainfall and flood patterns baran and myschowoda 2009 icem 2010 the hydrological regime of the mekong river is characterized by a seasonal flood pulse producing a strong unimodal flow pattern junk et al 1989 which secures the reproduction of most migratory fish icem 2010 such flood pulse pattern can be largely modified by dams that alter the magnitude timing and flow amounts delgado et al 2012 haddeland et al 2006 hanasaki et al 2006 lauri et al 2012 pokhrel et al 2016 2012 sabo et al 2017 shin et al 2019 veldkamp et al 2017 using observed river discharge data a study has shown that cascade dams in the upper mekong i e the lancang river in china have already caused significant changes in river flow patterns causing 29 36 dampening and 34 155 increase in seasonal flows during the wet and dry seasons respectively räsänen and kummu 2013 additionally pokhrel et al 2018b investigated the potential impacts of dam construction on the flood pulse dynamics of the lmrb by considering varying flow regulation scenarios that typically result from reservoir operation they showed that a dampening of peak flow in the main stem mekong by 10 50 would cause a change in flow reversal by 11 80 and 15 88 at the outlet of tsl and the prek kdam station in the tonlé sap river respectively flood pulse reduction is an important factor to be considered when examining fish population decline however physical barriers created by dams is another heavily studied variable such barriers prevent spawning of migratory species which are of biological and economic importance dugan et al 2010 the large number of proposed dams could add further stress and significantly impact the flood pulse pattern affecting the magnitude duration and timing of flooding in the lmrb such changes will affect the fishery as noted above however none of the mentioned changes deal with fish population response as a direct result of hydrological changes from dam construction this calls for a critical need for robust and thorough examination of the likely impact of changing flooding patterns on fish catch in the lmrb especially the flooded area around tsl and mekong delta annual fish catch is affected by hydrologic changes caused by dams and climate change however additional factors also play important roles for example local demand consumption and market conditions trade can have implications for dietary patterns which in turn affect fish catch also a dietary shift of protein from fish to meat e g cattle chicken pig sheep goat and horse in the lmrb nations has been widely reported orr et al 2012a pittock et al 2017 which puts water resources surrounding ecosystems and biodiversity under increasing pressure meat as opposed to fish is predominantly a water intensive product hence the concept of virtual water trade vwt which is the total amount of transported water embedded in the production of a commodity also known as water footprint has been employed as a tool for measuring the quantity of water involved in trade chapagain and hoekstra 2008 since the water footprint of meat protein surpasses that of fish a suggested effort to reduce fresh water use globally is optimizing vwt dalin et al 2012 balancing water use through food production is crucial because it is the highest freshwater consuming process taking up to 80 of the world s water resources rost et al 2008 thus the concept of water savings ws which is described as the difference in water use during the production of a commodity between specific geographical locations is used to derive a balanced approach to the production of meat commodities chapagain et al 2006 vwt and ws have been studied at different spatial and temporal scales liu et al 2019 however these concepts have not yet been applied in the lmrb region given the above background here we present the first study that examines the connection between potential hydrological variations stemming from dam construction and changes in fish catch in the lmrb and constructs a 28 year historical vwt network for the region our study is driven by the following science questions is there a relationship between fish catch and potential hydrological variations induced by dam construction in the lmrb what is the impact of a dietary shift from fish to livestock products on vwt between the lmrb and the rest of the world row how might we optimize ws by balancing meat production between the lmrb and the row we pursue the following specific objectives to address these science questions 1 develop a univariate relationship between fish catch and flooded areas to downscale fish catch data using results from a hydrological model and examine fish catch temporal variability 2 construct a vwt network using virtual water content vwc of meat commodities and trade data to study the impacts of adopting a higher meat based diet and 3 compare the estimated effects of domestic i e within lmrb countries and internationally i e the row produced meat commodities in terms of ws to determine optimal production locations for each commodity these science questions and objectives are addressed by using results from a hydrodynamic model along with data on international trade production and consumption of fish and meat the impacts of operational dams on hydrology and fish catch are analyzed through downscaling historical catch data and distributing these data to the lmrb the potential impacts of future dams are estimated by combining hydrological results from pokhrel et al 2018b and the distribution principles of the catch next the ramifications of multifaceted processes that channel a dietary shift in the lmrb such as land use and land cover lulc hereafter change and increased water usage for agriculture that the new protein source pattern brings to the lmrb nations are explored specifically lulc changes are analyzed for a 24 year period additionally we examine meat commodities in terms of vwt by constructing a vwt network 2 study area the study area is the lmrb fig 1 located in southeast asia which has a total area of 606 000 km2 covering 76 of the entire mekong river basin with a total area of 795 000 km2 frenken 2012 the lmrb is shared by four countries cambodia lao pdr thailand and vietnam area contribution summarized in table s1 the mekong river s mean annual water discharge is approximately 475 km3 year or 15 000 m3 s making it the 10th largest river in the world in terms of annual flow at its mouth mrc 2005 it flows through 2600 km of channels from the golden triangle to the south china sea at the mekong delta mrc 2010 2005 the lmrb is characterized by flat fertile lands that stretch over long distances and by strong climatic gradients human development and a plethora of managed ecosystems are co evolving in the basin resulting in rapidly emerging global issues such as land cover change river flow regulation and habitat loss pokhrel et al 2018a compared to other major river basins of the world the mekong river basin mrb remains relatively unaltered by dams grumbine and xu 2011 nilsson et al 2005 despite having many dams constructed over the past few decades the effects on the main stem mekong are still relatively small because most existing dams are located in the tributaries fig 1 and capture only a small portion of the annual flow volume grumbine and xu 2011 winemiller et al 2016 the river system at hand still manifests distinctive wet and dry seasons as direct outcomes of the seasonal variability in precipitation which supports highly productive riverine ecological systems and agriculture food production in the lmrb is heavily reliant on timely rainfall that modulates the seasonal flood pulse fredén 2011 these hydro climatic characteristics allow the lmrb to house an important ecosystem responsible for the largest inland fishery which feeds local inhabitants as well as a significant fraction of rest of the world ziv et al 2012 to put this into perspective last decade s estimate of 2 2 mega tonnes mt of wild fish harvest from the mekong was worth between 2 2 3 9 billion at first scale and 4 3 7 8 billion on retail markets hortle 2009 3 methods data and model 3 1 production and consumption of commodities the production and consumption of commodities specifically fish and meat are analyzed using the data from the u n food and agricultural organization fao production and consumption of meat for each of the lmrb countries individually and the total for all nations is analyzed for the 1988 2013 period the same process is followed for fish this study then investigates important points in time by calculating statistical changepoints for each category 3 2 fish catch downscale fish catch is downscaled by using the flooded areas simulated by the hydrodynamic model cama flood pokhrel et al 2018b results of cama flood model for the lmrb have been extensively validated in previous studies including our own pokhrel et al 2018b yamazaki et al 2014 2011 here for completeness we revisit the validation of the simulated river discharge fig s1 in the supplementary materials which is a primary determinant of the simulated flooded areas as seen in this figure river discharge is well simulated by the model over the entire lmrb except for some locations in the delta region due to the lack of tidal effects in the model an exponential function that describes the relationship between flooded area and catch is developed by comparing nationwide historical catch data to the results of flooded areas from the cama flood model see section 3 6 for model details the data are transformed to a logarithmic function and through linear regression a univariate model is derived following the approach used by mcintyre et al 2016 the newly derived function is expressed as c 0 6604afl 1 071 see fig s2 where c is potential fish catch tonnes year and afl is annual flooded area m2 next we use the model results to calculate potential fish catch in the lmrb in particular we use the simulated flooded areas and flood depth from cama flood at 10 km grid resolution with simulation settings identical to that in pokhrel et al 2018b any grid cell with an average water depth under 20 cm is excluded since the reported catch data from fao is only reported by large fisheries that target deeper areas next flooded areas for 1981 2010 period are run through the univariate model which yields yearly raster data of potential catch these values are then used to apportion the reported annual catch data from fao using a weighted average approach expressed as ci cp i cactual σcp i where ci is the observational fish catch distributed to grid cell i cp i is potential fish catch of grid cell i cactual is the observational fish catch of the country in which the grid cell is located and σcp i is the total potential fish catch over the given country then we analyze the downscaled fish catch for wet and dry years since the effects of flow regulation on flood patterns vary significantly during years with low discharge and precipitation dry years and years with high discharge and precipitation wet years the wet years i e 2000 2001 2006 2007 were chosen from an analysis of the total yearly flooded area in the lmrb from 1981 to 2010 likewise the dry years i e 1998 2003 2004 2005 were selected from the same analysis by choosing those years with the least flooding we choose only the most extreme years from the decade between 1998 and 2008 in an attempt to avoid the highest fish catch growth years which can be attributed to fishing technological advances from the 1990s sverdrup jensen 2002 the wet and dry year analysis of catch data is normalized by computing catch per capita before carrying out the spatial distribution to reduce the effect of demand increase stemming from population growth here the goal is to analyze the isolated effects of changes in flooded areas these results are distributed following the same procedure described above 3 3 change in fish catch potential changes in fish catch due to flow regime change is estimated using the aforementioned univariate fish catch model of flooded area c 0 6604afl 1 071 for in depth analysis we specify two domains the lower mekong sub region and the tsl region see section 4 2 to represent the potential effects of upstream flow regulation and climate change on flooded areas in those regions we set scenarios where the magnitude of peak flow based on the average daily hydrograph for 1981 2010 period at the inlet of those regions near stung treng yellow star in fig 1 is reduced by 10 20 30 40 and 50 the daily hydrograph is then adjusted to preserve annual water balance pokhrel et al 2018b the flow is altered at this particular location because fish migration from the mekong delta and tsl region generally occurs up to this point which is under khone falls the majority of known spawning and nursing grounds of different fish species are downstream of this location cowx et al 2015 poulsen et al 2002 the location is also near the most downstream dam of the among planned and commissioned dams in the mekong river i e sambor dam for each scenario the monthly flooded areas of those two regions are calculated and the monthly potential change in fish catch is accordingly estimated for details of model setup readers may refer to pokhrel et al 2018b 3 4 virtual water understanding the quantity of virtual water that flows in and out of nations is crucial when optimizing water use at regional and global or even local levels a complete analysis of this concept includes the calculation of virtual water exports as well as virtual water imports in section 4 4 we summarize the virtual water flows of each lmrb country as well as the total for all nations important fluctuations over the study period are analyzed by calculating changepoints using the r changepoint package killick and eckley 2014 the rise in water use that compensates for elevated meat consumption is examined by constructing a meat vwt network from 1988 to 2016 the vwc which is the amount of water required to produce a given commodity of each commodity considered was retrieved from chapagain and hoekstra 2003 for greater details on how virtual water content from feed is calculated the reader is referred to hoekstra 2003 vwt export values are estimated by multiplying the trade data from faostat fao statistics by its corresponding vwc using the following equation vwt i j x lmb vwc i x t i j x lmb where vwt i j x lmb is the local virtual water trade in volume k g water of commodity x exported from a lmrb country i to a row country j through trade vwc i x is the virtual water content k g water kg product of commodity produced in country i t i j x lmb is the volume of commodity k g product produced in the lmrb and exported from i to j similarly vwt for the importing values are estimated using the following equation vwt i j x for vwc row x t i j x for where vwt i j x for is the foreign from row countries virtual water trade in volume k g water of commodity x exported from an lmrb country i to a row country j through trade vwc i r o w is the virtual water content k g water kg product of commodity produced in foreign country i t i j x lmb is the volume of commodity k g product produced in the row and exported from i to j 3 5 data to downscale fish catch we use the following datasets the historical 1981 2010 annual fish catch data from fao fishstat http www fao org

values are retrieved from chapagain and hoekstra 2003 3 6 model the model used in this study is the global hydrodynamic model named cama flood yamazaki et al 2014 2011 cama flood is selected for this study because it simulates the channel bifurcation process which is important in the lmrb yamazaki et al 2014 and because it has been validated for the mrb yamazaki et al 2014 pokhrel et al 2018a b details can be found in yamazaki et al 2014 2011 here we highlight key features of the model for completeness version 3 6 of the model simulates river floodplain hydrodynamics by solving the shallow water equation for open channel flow cama flood was set up at a 10 km resolution with regional level settings for the mrb yamazaki et al 2014 relevant output variables used in this study from cama flood including inundated area and water level are diagnosed from water storage from each unit catchment river discharge is calculated using the shallow water equation all simulation settings and parameters are identical to those in pokhrel et al 2018b 4 results and discussion 4 1 downscaled fish catch fig 2 a presents the downscaled fish catch for the 1981 2010 period these results suggest a monotonous growth in total fish catch over time this is apparent throughout the domain fig 2a however the areas of highest concentration e g the tsl show the most obvious increase in fish catch which is likely because the primary driver of increased fish catch is market demand which is driven by population and economic growth thus to minimize the effect of population we normalize the yearly data which allows for a per capita based downscaling facilitating a more appropriate catch comparison with hydrology by eliminating the large fluctuations caused by population growth the downscaled data at the country level are provided in supplementary tables s2 and s3 fig 2b shows the distribution of fish catch per capita for four historically dry years it is found that most of the fish catch is distributed in the tsl and the mekong delta regions year 1998 is by far the driest year section 3 2 coinciding with the lowest fish catch density the fish catch of cambodia the country in which tsl fish production occurs shows a sudden growth spurt in 1998 fig s4 when the asian financial crisis ended and better fishing technology was adopted following many years of low fish production and consumption costales 2004 the growth in fish catch in tsl is evident even through the dry years fig 2b further 1998 coincides with calculated changepoints for cambodia laos and the lmrb overall and continuous and stable growth can be seen through 2005 fig s4 hence the years chosen for analysis fall within this range further although the results show growth in fish production until 2005 fig s4 fig 2b shows lower fish catch in thailand in 2005 than in 2003 and 2004 which is especially evident in regions north of tsl between latitude 14 n and 17 n this is in congruence with the decline in fish consumption in thailand fig s4 conversely in vietnam the highest catch can be seen between latitude 15 n and 20 n in 2005 out of all the dry years fig 2 this is again in congruence with the growth in fish production fig s4 other historically dry years i e 2003 2004 show small levels of consumption and production which is consistent with our correlation between flooded areas and catch fig 2c shows the fish catch per capita distributed for four historically wet years a generally denser distribution of fish in the lmrb and the outer basin compared to that in the dry years fig 2b is readily discernable in fig 2c this is especially noticeable between latitude 12 n and 13 n in thailand and inside the lmrb with the exception of the tsl the barely discernible differences in the tsl are expected as this water body is a suitable location for fishing for a wide range of water levels because of its large size and ability to remain filled for a significant portion of the year overall it is found that fish catch is strongly impacted by the abundance or lack of flooded areas in the lmrb year 2000 shows the highest density of fish catch compared to years 2001 2006 and 2007 further suggesting a strong correlation between flooded area and catch this is highlighted between latitudes 17 n and 20 n at the border between laos and thailand again wet years i e 2006 2007 show rapid growth fig s4 in overall fish production and consumption 4 2 change in fish catch fig 3 shows how potential fish catch within the lmrb sub region including the mekong delta and tsl blue and orange boxes respectively in fig 3c could be affected by the potential changes in flood dynamics due to upstream flow alteration by dams results shown are for the baseline unaltered flow and five flow alteration scenarios see section 3 3 for more details and are arranged according to areas flooded for a given number of months in a year for the lower mekong sub domain fig 3a results suggest that fish catch could decrease due to flow alteration in areas that are flooded for 1 to 5 months per year and the impact proportionately increases with the degree of peak flow reduction the opposite is true for areas flooded for 6 to 12 months on an annual basis changes in catch are both positive and negative under different flow alteration scenarios table s4 but the magnitudes are rather small with an increase by 0 23 under the highest flow alteration scenario this increase is caused by an overall increase in permanently flooded 12 month flood occurrence areas which shows how the compensation of the newly flooded areas created by the dampened seasonal flood pulse may benefit potential catch similar results fig 3b are found for the tsl region orange rectangle in fig 3c those areas with short flood occurrence in the tsl region flooded for 1 to 6 months show a decreased fish catch potential under increased flow alteration scenarios conversely the areas with relatively long flood occurrence flooded for 7 to 12 months show progressively higher potential fish catch with increase in the degree of flow alteration on an annual basis fish catch could potentially decline in this region under all flow alteration scenarios table s5 with the highest reduction by 8 under the 50 alteration scenario the tsl results table s5 highlight how fish catch in one of the most productive areas in the lmrb could be directly impacted by potential hydrological alterations by dams however these results should be interpreted with caution for various reasons first the study does not account for the physical barriers that the future dams will impose on the migratory species as this information is not available second the study does not account for changes in habitat and actual fish population losses because this is a multifaceted process which falls outside the scope and capacity of our modeling framework third and last potential fish catch variations do not account for the response of different species i e migratory non migratory to the hydrological variations of the mekong river undoubtedly these potential changes in fish catch would be devastating to livelihoods in the surrounding lmrb communities it is known that this is starting to occur and a major dietary shift has already been taking place in the lmrb countries orr et al 2012b pittock et al 2017 4 3 land use and land cover change next we examine a 24 year lulc change in the lmrb in an effort to relate these changes to observed dietary shift in the region fig 4 depicts historical transitions in lulc categories in the lmrb results indicate a two percent increase in cropland as well as mosaic tree and shrub herbaceous cover between 1992 and 2015 fig 4 the majority of the increase in cropland areas and other land use types comes from a drop in tree cover area which is estimated at 4 in 24 years to put that into perspective a one percent change in land use is equivalent to 60 600 km2 meaning that a total of 242 400 km2 of tree cover was lost in the past two decades the majority of the region s cropland is used to grow crops such as maize and soy and literature suggests these crops are used primarily for livestock feed in the united states for example 87 of maize yields are evenly split between animal feed and ethanol production leaving only 13 for human consumption ranum et al 2014 an fao report estimated that at least 50 of grain production globally is fed to livestock fao 2004 regarding land use this translates to 75 of all agricultural land including crop and pasture being dedicated to animal production foley et al 2011 that is of the 121 200 km2 of cropland added in the past 2 5 decades fig 4 90 900 km2 is indirectly caused by increases in meat production as fish consumption per capita declines in the lmrb countries the loss of protein is expected to be replaced eventually by land based animal protein local production of meat in the lmrb countries continues to rise fig s5 requiring more feed and grazing land for livestock to understand how dietary habits are changing over time in the lmrb countries we next discuss the dynamics of meat exports and imports in terms of water use i e virtual water 4 4 virtual water flows fig 5 summarizes vwf of meat products including cattle pig sheep goat chicken and horse the vwf of the lmrb countries during 1988 2005 period was largely dominated by trade fluctuations in thailand thailand produces more meat products than it consumes fig s5 thus the gap between production and consumption is equal to the quantity of meat products exported i e virtual water outflow the same is true for the three smaller economies except that in their case consumption grows at a higher rate than production meaning that these nations import a significant amount of virtual water in the form of meat the statistically calculated changepoint corresponding to vwf exports falls in year 2003 this is the same year that the poultry industry in thailand was affected by the highly pathogenic asian avian influenza hpai outbreak resulting in plummeting chicken production and trade naranong 2007 this serves as an independent confirmation for the validity of the observational trade data as well as the methodology used for vwf calculations the second calculated changepoint corresponds to inflow and it falls in year 2009 which is in line with spikes observed in meat consumption in vietnam and cambodia fig s5 a rise in the flow of virtual water into laos for this same year can be observed however this is not in congruence with the reported production and consumption of meat products where an equivalent production and consumption fluctuation is observed an expected near zero inflow of virtual water to thailand can be from 1988 to 2013 fig 5 presumably some of the meat products imported to thailand are not part of their main production commodities the year 2014 shows a recuperation in thailand s virtual water outflow combined with a drop in virtual water inflow meaning that local production is picking after the hpai outbreak and the country is able to sustain the local and global demand for meat products the virtual water outflow of thailand stands out the most as it follows a strong increase in meat exports until 2003 when it drops dramatically only recovering a decade later i e in 2013 while this drop is consistent with the decline in production results fig s5 indicate a recovery in three years 2004 2006 the vwf however shows a 10 year recovery period fig 5 which is because chicken was the most affected yet is also the main export product and also one of the most water intensive meat products costales 2004 as previously mentioned the literature points to the hpai outbreak as the main cause for the drop in vwf outflow from chicken however there are limited studies on why the recovery process took ten years we identified three plausible explanations first lost business relationships with partnering nations second extended contracts being formed between former partner nations and the replacement of suppliers and third the inability of the meat industry to overcome the financial burden of losing such massive amounts of products in the case of cambodia an expected near zero inflow of virtual water can be seen from 1988 to 2007 from 2007 to 2016 an accelerated rate of meat imports is observed which coincides with the inflow changepoint of 2008 for the lmrb fig 5 this is the same period specifically 2007 2013 during which consumption exceeds production fig s5 additionally virtual water outflow results are only available for the years 2005 2011 2014 and 2015 fig 5 thus 2005 and 2011 are the only years where the production of meat products exceeded consumption fig s5 this again acts as an independent validation of the methodology behind the vwt calculations and the trade data retrieved similarly this is the case for vietnam with near zero inflow and outflow reported until 2007 when meat consumption increased at a faster rate than production opening an import gap the observed rise in meat imports also coincides with the changepoint for virtual water inflow in the lmrb fig 5 the inflow of vietnam peaks by 2011 and then drops which coincides with the years when a gap between meat consumption and production decreases in that country as consumption was slightly higher than production between 1998 and 2006 fig s5 only a small quantity of virtual water inflow can be seen in fig 5 similar to cambodia between the years 2007 and 2013 vietnam consumed more meat than it produced fig s5 and this is precisely the period when the virtual water inflow of meat rises significantly finally for the outflow of virtual water of laos 1990 1993 2000 2001 2002 and 2015 are the only years with reported exports of meat out of all of these instances none of the datapoints shows a noticeable difference between production and consumption fig s5 the years with reported outflow fig 5 have very small values so it is likely that the difference between production and consumption is simply not visible conversely inflows were small until 2009 when the export of virtual water tripled it is important to note however that the scale at which laos experienced this growth is still small relative to that of thailand and vietnam nonetheless individually speaking the vwf and production and consumption behaviors are not in perfect harmony which points to some reliability issues and limitations of the reported data for laos to further investigate the vwt of meat commodities in the lmrb countries a vwt network is constructed and presented in the following section this will highlight the trade dynamics of the lmrb countries with the row and provide an in depth understanding of the effects of a dietary shift in the four nations on the row 4 5 virtual water trade network the magnitude and direction of virtual water flows embedded in meat products e g cattle chicken pig sheep goat and horse is presented in fig 6 as a vwt circle plot it is obvious from fig 6a that the majority of the virtual water outflow in 1998 came from thailand green and was destined for the rest of asia i e the remaining asian countries excluding thailand cambodia vietnam and laos red it is also apparent that none of the other regions traded meat products however due to the nature of these plots the thickness of the arrows represents the magnitude of flow transferred from one region to the other compared to that of the remaining transfer regions that is thailand s exports were so large compared to that of the other regions that the trade among the row becomes negligible thus very narrow in fig 6a further the production and consumption of meat commodities match e g between 1988 and 2003 for vietnam fig s5 suggesting almost no international trade of these products despite the presence of growth fig 6a c f show noticeably large interactions between thailand and the rest of asia because historically japan has been the main importer of poultry from thailand costales 2004 additionally this has been mainly attributed to the introduction of evaporative cooling and to poultry taking over the livestock market share of thailand in early years 1998 2001 rising from 30 to 53 costales 2004 moving forward to 1995 fig 6b shows a dramatic increase in intercontinental virtual water flows when vietnam became a large importer from the rest of asia the americas and europe this does not mean that thailand reduced its exports to japan it merely suggests that the other regions with higher export bands became larger virtual water exporters than thailand in 2004 fig 6c thailand s chicken export declined to such a significant extent that its virtual water export became on par with that of vietnam this is a result of the hpai outbreak which resulted in a ban by most importers of frozen broiler meat from thailand in 2004 naranong 2007 on the flip side in 2005 following large economic growth vietnam displays a boom in meat consumption despite local underproduction of the commodity hansen 2018 this is corroborated by the calculated consumption changepoint in 2005 fig s4 by 2008 thailand can be seen to be recovering by beginning to export meat products to neighboring nations where its largest trade partner becomes vietnam this explains why thailand does not show any signs of recovery fig 5 while production levels still rise fig s5 fig 6d highlights the growth in meat consumption of vietnam as it becomes the highest lmrb importer of virtual water the first noticeable trade interaction for laos can be seen in 2012 fig 6e when it becomes thailand s largest virtual water importer thailand also shows signs of economic recovery by branching out its trade to regions such as africa and europe fig 6f indicates that thailand recovered and surpassed its trading capacity to that of 1988 fig 6a overall the lmrb countries show significant changes in trade dynamics during the period studied 1988 2016 more importantly however the overall growth and addition of all of the trading partners from 1988 to 2016 tripled the total magnitude of vwt in the lmrb table s6 in other words water demand from a dietary shift towards meat increased three fold 5 conclusions this paper investigates two overarching topics the first is an exploration of fish catch dynamics in the lmrb and the second is a construction of a vwt system for meat products in the lmrb countries the newly devised relationship between fish catch and flooded areas suggests that there is a strong correlation between the two this relationship is studied by normalizing the catch data by removing population growth from the observable trend to estimate catch per capita and comparing it to flooded area in dry and wet years results indicate that if future dams restrict the peak flow in the main stem mekong by 50 the effects on flood dynamics could be responsible for 8 fish catch loss in the tsl region in a larger lower mekong sub region that includes the mekong delta flow alteration could increase fish catch as a result of increased permanently flooded areas but such an increase in catch is found to be marginal next to examine the impact of dietary shifts in the lmrb on land use lulc types are mapped for four separate years between 1992 and 2016 results indicate an area of 242 400 km2 of tree cover loss and a gain in 121 200 km2 of cropland area in the past two and a half decades as most of the cropland is used to grow crops for feed this is one of the measured impacts from the dietary protein shift which is exacerbated by population and economic growth in the region the impact of the dietary shift on water resources is further studied by constructing yearly vwt networks from 1988 to 2016 these results indicate that the total vwt of the lmrb tripled from 1988 to 2016 due to a significant increase in number of trade partners fig 6 and table s6 there are several limitations of this study first the effects of fish catch derived from our model do not take into consideration fish species population and habitat which could all be affected by altered streamflow and flooding patterns future studies could address this issue second our catch model does not consider migratory fish movement blockage by dams even though the location used to modify the flow is around the uppermost point where fish migration from the tonlé sap lake and mekong delta regions generally stop cowx et al 2015 poulsen et al 2002 third this study uses potential flow alteration scenarios without considering the planned or proposed dams in the lmrb because significant uncertainties remain about the actual size location and timing of the planned dams these issues will be addressed in our future studies that will simulate the effects of individual dams fourth future studies could also consider accounting for uncertainties behind the vwt computations as this is an area that remains understudied lastly the concept of water savings should be explored in this context since it would provide insights on improved water resource management for the production and supply of meat commodities future studies should focus on these issues in order to further the discussion and aid policy makers in making the right decisions

5929,simulation methods for design flood estimations in dam safety studies require fine scale precipitation data to provide quality input for hydrological models especially for extrapolation to extreme events this leads to use statistical models such as stochastic weather generators the aim here is to develop a stochastic model adaptable on mountainous catchments in france and accounting for spatial and temporal dependencies in daily precipitation fields to achieve this goal the framework of spatial random processes is adopted here the novelty of the model developed in this study resides in the combination of an autoregressive meta gaussian process accounting for the spatio temporal dependencies and weather pattern sub sampling discriminating the different rainfall intensity classes the model is tested from rain gauges in the ardèche catchment located in south of france the model estimation is performed in four steps dealing respectively with i the at site marginal distribution ii the mapping of the marginal distribution parameters at the target resolution iii the at site temporal correlation and iv the spatial covariance function the model simulations are evaluated in terms of marginal distribution inter site dependence and areal rainfall properties and compared to the observations at calibration stations and also on a set of independent validation stations regarding all these aspects the model shows good abilities to reproduce the observed statistics and presents really small discrepancies compared to the stations data the sub sampling is particularly efficient to reproduce the seasonal variations and the marginal mapping procedure induces very small differences in terms of daily rain amounts and daily occurrence probabilities keywords latent gaussian process weather pattern rainfield generation 2010 msc 00 01 99 00 1 introduction stochastic methods embedding rainfall runoff simulation are now commonly used for extreme flood estimation like the schadex method paquet et al 2013 or the sefm method schaefer and barker 2002 lumped hydrological models can be considered in this context but a more detailed representation of hydrological processes varying in space or the need of information within the catchment and not only at the outlet require the implementation of distributed rainfall runoff models in a stochastic process being continuous or event based such models have to be fed by either a multi site or a rain field simulation model the presented model is dedicated to this context and more precisely to future applications to dam safety studies a large variety of models has been developed to answer the need for spatially coherent rainfall simulation the main difficulty lies in the intermittent nature of precipitation thus the modelling has to deal with two different processes the occurrence and the intensity in hydro climatology the panel of stochastic weather generators is extremely wide each model reproduces the different spatio temporal properties of precipitation with its own benefits or drawbacks models available in the literature can be divided into two families random resampling models the principle is to rearrange past observations in order to get new time series these models do not allow to generate unobserved values and in particular the extreme ones needed in dam safety analyses random generator models the principle is to fit distributions from which new times series can be generated these models can generate unobserved values in this family mainly two types of model are available multi site models these models are able to generate rainfall only at the stations on which they have been calibrated this type of model allows to prescribe the observed spatial dependence for each pair of stations random fields models these models are able to generate rainfall on a regular grid of a chosen resolution whether or not there is stations in the grid cells thanks to a covariance function however the rain gauge network has to be dense enough to be able to learn the spatial properties of the rain field these models are often used in two simulation context 1 observation based models in this family the models only aim at mimicking the statistical properties of the observations among them there are resampling models using for instance k nearest neighbours algorithm knn e g buishand and brandsma 2001 leander and buishand 2009 there are also rainfall generators mainly based on an underlying gaussian process these models rely on the transformation of the non gaussian marginals into gaussian ones they are hereafter referred to as meta gaussian many multi site or rain field simulators are based on this principle for the rain field simulators a covariance function has to be estimated additionally in order to cope with rain intermittency and rain intensity two strategies are possible one consists in using a single underlying gaussian process which is on the one hand truncated for the rain occurrence and on the other hand transformed for rain intensity bàrdossy and pegram 2009 and rasmussen 2013 have developed a multi site model based on a multivariate latent autoregressive gaussian process to model rain occurrence and rain intensity processes at the same time similarly sparks et al 2018 have recently provided a multi site multivariate model for minimum maximum temperature and precipitation based on a single latent autoregressive gaussian process many rain field simulation strategies over an entire region are also possible from at site estimated rain distribution and covariance function a variety of meta gaussian models with a single field for occurrence and intensity can be found in the literature e g sigrist et al 2012 baxevani and lennartson 2015 for instance simulations can be performed over a regular grid by considering the same at site distribution for all gauges with unconditional simulations guillot 1999 guillot and lebel 1999 or conditional ones vischel et al 2009 a kriging can be done over marginal distribution parameters estimated at each station in order to get spatially varying marginals at a desired target resolution these marginals are combined with a meta gaussian rain field simulator to generate daily rain fields bennett et al 2018 another way is to use two distinct processes to model the occurrence and the intensity multi site models based on that principle are available wilks 1998 evin et al 2018 based on the same idea rain fields are also simulated by combining marginal parameters kriging with two distinct processes e g kleiber et al 2012 verdin et al 2015 based on meta gaussian process models for high spatio temporal resolution accounting for the advection of the rain process have also been developed leblois and creutin 2013 paschalis et al 2013 peleg et al 2017 benoit et al 2018 event based modelling can also be adopted instead of using a fixed time scale daily for instance e g onof et al 2000 leonard et al 2008 burton et al 2010 2 exogenous variables constrained models in this family the models explicitly use exogenous variables as covariates or predictors these are the so called downscaling models cf ayar et al 2016 gutiérrez et al 2018 for intercomparisons the principle is to statistically link observations with synoptic information at coarse resolution extracted for instance from climate models in order to simulate precipitation part of the climate non stationarity carried by the synoptic variable is by construction taken into account in the stochastic model these models can be used to reconstruct past events perform short term predictions or climate projections from future climate simulations of global circulation model resampling models can be based on atmospheric analog yiou 2014 or on non parametric geostatistical methods jha et al 2015 many generators are based on generalised linear models glm to link the predictors with the observations many examples of meta gaussian multi sites models have been also proposed cf wilks 2010 wilks 2012 for a review for instance chandler 2002 has proposed a rain field simulator with two distinct processes for rain occurrence and intensity but only applied in a multi site context two other studies conducted by yang et al 2005 et ambrosino et al 2014 have applied a modified version of this model estimated from a gridded dataset serinaldi and kilsby 2014 have used a single latent gaussian process to simulate rain field at the observations resolution hybrid models many models that can be described as hybrid this family gathers the models using components from both aforementioned families these models combine resampling multi sites or random fields approaches and a synoptic information through a discrete variable atmospheric circulation patterns are summarised and discretised into different classes if these classes are established directly from the precipitation or from synoptic variables these are respectively referred to as precipitation types pts or weather types wts precipitations are generated conditionally to this discrete variable it is possible to perform resampling conditionally to wts or pts i e the resampling is only performed within a class for instance a hidden markov model hmm used to generate pts sequence steinschneider and brown 2013 or a wts classification caraway et al 2014 can be combined with a knn method a simple multi site modelling consists in considering the stations as spatially and temporally independent given a wt which can be modelled by a hmm zucchini and guttorp 1991 hughes and guttorp 1994 bellone et al 2000 or defined explicitly vrac et al 2007 bellone et al 2000 and vrac et al 2007 estimate the transition probabilities from one wt to another as functions of synoptic variables by glm thompson et al 2007 consider a multisite daily rainfall generator in which rainfall spatial dependence conditionally to station specific pts ailliot et al 2009 modify this model by first considering regional pts and second adopting a rain field generator instead of a multi site generator a wide range of statistical models conditioned by wts are suggested in the literature cf wilks 2010 wilks 2012 ailliot et al 2015 for reviews based on the same idea event based models accounting for the advection and for sub daily data have also been developed e g peleg and morin 2014 using pts or wts are both valid options to define rain intensity classes pts define rather catchment specific classes since they are defined from observations on the contrary wts are defined over larger areas being defined by synoptic variables and are not specific to one catchment wts defined over france mountainous regions have been proved to be efficient for rainfall distribution modelling over france garavaglia et al 2010 garavaglia et al 2011 evin et al 2016 blanchet et al 2019 the present paper investigates the added value of these wts in the context of rainfall spatial modelling over mountainous regions in france in this study an hybrid model of daily rain field is developed the model further presented is closely related to the model of ailliot et al 2009 their approach lies on the combination of a hmm for the pts generation and a rain field simulator which covariance function is estimated conditionally to a pts our model departs from the latter on three points 1 pts are replaced by wts which are not specific to a given catchment wts sequence is not modelled instead a long observed sequence is played as many times as needed e g if 1000 years long rainfall sequence is needed the observed wt sequence of 40 years is repeated 25 times 2 temporal dependence is not implicitly ensured by the sequence of wts but is explicitly modelled conditionally to transitions from a wt to another 3 the model is not only used in a multi site contexte simulations are not only generated at calibration stations this model allows to generate rainfall at any location of the catchment or to upscale at a target spatial resolution to generate fields 1 km 2 for instance the novelty lies in the development of an hybrid random rain field simulator that is fed by daily rain gauge data only and in which all the model components namely the marginal distributions and the spatio temporal dependence structure are conditioned by synoptic wts this has to our knowledge never been proposed before the aim is to get a model adaptable to different mountainous catchments covering several thousands square kilometre a daily time step is relevant in these cases as well for the dynamic of the hydrological processes to be modelled as for the availability of the rainfall data a special attention is paid to the ability of the model to simulate the high quantiles and to the good representation of the day to day correlation of wet sequences in order to model coherent hydrographs section 2 presents the study area and the data section 3 describes the model the simulations are evaluated in section 4 and section 5 gives the conclusions discusses the results and presents some perspectives of the proposed work 2 study area and data to assess the model ability to meet the previously stated objectives an application to the ardèche catchment 2260 km2 located in the south east of france cf fig 1 is made indeed despite its size this catchment presents important orographic and climatic disparities this region partly includes the south eastern slope of the massif central where the highest summits are located about 1700 m a s l and bordered by the rhône valley down to 40 m a s l in the east this region is prone to extreme precipitations causing intense floods delrieu et al 2005 nuissier et al 2008 these events are mainly triggered by the advection of humid air mass of the lower layer of the atmosphere flown from the mediterranean sea and forming meso scale convective and quasi stationary systems due to the specific topography these systems can stay over the same area for several hours and are responsible for heavy rainfall nuissier et al 2008 the hymex field campaign ducrocq et al 2014 drobinski et al 2014 gives a thorough insight into the large variety of blocking situation generating heavy rainfall systems over the region data from rain gauge networks operated by électricité de france and météo france are used forty seven stations are available inside and outside the catchment with 15 to 40 years of daily data between january 1 1969 and december 31 2008 fig 15 a shows the data availability throughout the period for each station the proposed stochastic model aims at generating rain fields at a given resolution to provide rainfall scenarios in order to simulate flood events thanks to a rainfall runoff model this study only describes and evaluates the rainfall generator model among the 47 stations n 41 stations black stations in fig 1 are used to calibrate the model and to evaluate it from simulations performed at these stations in order to evaluate the potential errors or biases that will be faced when simulating fields six leave out or validation stations are kept red stations in fig 1 the performance of the model is evaluated at these stations in order to enlighten the potential errors in non monitored areas in the next sections the simulator structure and its application over the ardèche catchment are presented the modelling choices are driven by the will to combine wts with a gaussian process and are not specific to the ardèche catchment in order to illustrate the adaptability of the model framework to different catchment the model is also tested over the durance catchment this question is discussed in section 4 4 and all the results for this catchment are available in the supplementary material 3 spatial simulator in this section the different components of the model are described the simulator is based on a single meta gaussian process to model both rain occurrence and intensity this approach is privileged in order to reduce the number of estimated parameters and simulated gaussian fields especially in the case of high resolution random fields and to maintain the spatio temporal coherence between rain occurrence and intensity let x x 1 x n be the vector of length n of station locations according to guillot 1999 the vector of precipitation y x at stations x is linked to the latent gaussian vector z x by the following relationship 1 y x ψ z x if z x c x 0 if z x c x where ψ is a monotonic non decreasing function further described in eqs 2 and 3 from which rain intensity is retrieved by transforming z values above c c is a threshold which prescribes the rain intermittency given the fact that the rain generating processes can have different nature e g stratiform or convective or evolve seasonally heavier rain intensity in autumn are observed over the region the seasonal and wt based sub sampling proposed by garavaglia et al 2010 is adopted indeed a split in s 2 seasons is set with a low risk season lo from december to august and a high risk season hi from september to november however instead of the eight wts identified at the western european scale by garavaglia et al 2010 those are grouped into k 3 groups of weather types gt based on the correlogram characterising the spatial correlation of the rain fields the same gt as defined in blanchet et al 2019 gts frequencies between 1969 and 2008 are given in table 1 gt1 mainly regroups mediterranean circulations bringing the heavy rain events over the study region gt2 rather regroups oceanic atlantic circulations based rainfall and gt3 gathers anticyclonic days with really sparse or no rainfall the rainfall intensity correlation range decreases from gt1 to gt3 cf table 1 and blanchet et al 2019 the distinction between convective and stratiform rainfall is mainly taken into account by the seasonal gt sub sampling in the following each day t 1 t is thus associated to a sub set j 1 s k 6 in the following sections the at site marginal model and the parameters mapping are presented in section 3 1 the spatio temporal dependence in section 3 2 and all the parameters estimations are presented in section 3 3 the model steps are summarised in fig 2 and the notations are reminded in table 2 3 1 marginal distribution one of the model ability is to generate rainfall at any location of the domain or on a regular grid to this end marginal distribution parameters have to be mapped based on the rain gauge observations given the density of the stations and the daily time scale of study a 1 1 km2 interpolation grid is considered interpolation is achieved for each sub set j in a two step procedure put in place by blanchet et al 2019 and illustrated for the same catchment the marginal distribution at station x relies on the sub sampling into seasons and gts for a given day in sub set j the rainfall cdf is given by 2 p y j x y h y j x y p j 0 x 1 p j 0 x f y j x y where y j x is the random variable of daily zero and non zero rainfall amount for a day in sub set j at x p j 0 x is the dry day fraction at station x within sub set j following the two step estimation procedure developed in blanchet et al 2019 first the at site distribution parameters are estimated then these parameters are mapped at the wanted resolution the interpolated values can be interpreted as estimates of the local values at the center of the 1 1 km2 grid points in blanchet et al 2019 the interpolated values are validated at the stations as if the latter were all located at the center of the grid points they belong to blanchet et al 2019 conclude that for this study area the best marginal model is the mixture of gamma distribution i e f y j x is a gamma distribution specific for each sub set j blanchet et al 2019 also found that over this domain the best mapping model is a bivariate thin plate spline model with drift in smoothed elevation it is shown in the following that the interpolation is statistically quite robust to depict several rainfall characteristics at the station locations 3 2 spatio temporal model since the marginal distribution only describes the rainfall behaviour at a given site the spatial and temporal dependences have to be modelled if y t x were real valued then 3 z t x φ 1 h y j x y t x would be a gaussian process with marginals n 0 1 φ being the standard gaussian however since rainfall amounts are non negative y t x 0 z t x defined above is a censored gaussian process it can be written as z t x max c j x g t x where c j x φ 1 p j 0 x is the censoring threshold and g t x is a mutivariate gaussian with margins n 0 1 and covariance matrix σ t referring to eq 1 ψ is equal to h y j x 1 φ the spatio temporal dependence among the n stations is modelled by the zero mean latent multivariate gaussian variable g g t x i i 1 n t 1 t n 0 ω with ω the nt nt covariance matrix for the n sites and t days it is assumed to be a multivariate markov autoregressive process of order 1 mar 1 mar 1 has been used in several studies to describe spatio temporal dependence of rainfall e g rasmussen 2013 bennett et al 2018 thus g t x is defined as follows 4 g t x a t t 1 g t 1 x e t x where a t t 1 is a n n matrix of autoregressive parameters and e t x is a gaussian noise vector of length n the e t x s t 1 t are independent of each other and e t x is independent of g t x for t t this ensures the markovian property then e t x has zero mean and covariance matrix σ t a t t 1 2 σ t 1 the matrix a t t 1 is assumed to be diagonal e g evin et al 2018 bennett et al 2018 this means that only the spatial covariance and the at site autocorrelation are explicitly modelled 3 2 1 spatial dependence rain field simulation based on gaussian processes requires to calculate the correlation between every couple of points of a domain in order to achieve that the covariance matrix σ t is represented by a covariance function ρ j τ for a day t in sub set season gt j τ is the inter site distance the powered exponential correlation function is used here ρ j τ exp τ λ j ν j where λ j 0 is the range parameter and ν j 0 2 is the power term in the literature anisotropic covariance functions are commonly used to introduce a preferential dependence axis e g baxevani and lennartson 2015 blanchet and creutin 2017 this can be easily done by using a distance accounting for the directionality such as the mahalanobis distance τ x u x v x u x v t π 1 x u x v π is positive definite matrix with π id n the identity matrix it gives the euclidean distance introducing the anisotropy π is usually written as π 1 m t m and m is parametrised as following m cos ψ sin ψ b sin ψ b cos ψ with b 1 the elongation coefficient and ψ π 2 π 2 the angle with this parametrisation for a given site x all the points with equal covariance with x form an ellipse centred at x with ψ the angle between the horizontal and the major axis of the ellipse and b the ratio between the major and minor axes 3 2 2 temporal dependence as previously mentioned only the at site autocorrelation is modelled here since a is a diagonal matrix another approximation is made on matrix a t t 1 by considering the autocorrelation as constant over the region thus a t t 1 is of the form a t t 1 a t t 1 id n this also simplifies the covariance of e t which becomes σ t a t t 1 2 σ t 1 in the following the a t t 1 only depends on transitions among gts within a season this coefficient is assumed to be constant within a season and for each transition from one gt to another from gt1 to gt1 gt1 to gt2 gt2 to gt1 etc for t and t 1 in a season s and a couple of gts k l a k l s is defined as the autocorrelation coefficient for the transitions from j t 1 s k to j t s l in total 18 coefficients have to be estimated 3 3 parameters estimation 3 3 1 marginal distribution parameters the probability p j 0 x is the dry day fraction at station x in sub set j the empirical probability p j 0 x is considered as a good estimate of p j 0 x at each station x and for each sub set j the parameters of the gamma distribution modelling positive rainfall are estimated by a probability weighted moments method pwm cf blanchet et al 2019 for more details from the estimated h y j x the precipitations y j x are transformed into z j x used for the estimation of the covariance function see section 3 3 2 the marginal model parameters are mapped by a bivariate thin plate spline estimated by a penalised least square method for more details see blanchet et al 2019 a marginal distribution h y j x can now be obtained at each point of the domain for each sub set j from the mapped parameters the marginal distribution at the six validation stations are computed according this method 3 3 2 mar 1 model parameters from the estimated marginal distributions h y j x realisations of z t x at station x for a day t in sub set j s k z t x φ 1 h y j x i y t x i are computed from this the autoregressive parameters a k l s and the covariance function ρ j of g t for t in sub set j are estimated the authors remind that the latent process g n 0 ω is not observed but only a censored version z the use of a censored likelihood is then required one can write this likelihood for the gaussian process g described by the eq 4 nevertheless it represents a numerical challenge to optimise indeed not only the number of parameters to optimise at a time would be too large but also it would mean to invert a n t 1 n t 1 size matrix which is completely unrealistic to avoid this the estimation is performed in two steps first the 18 autocorrelation coefficients for each station are estimated for all t 1 t such as j t 1 s k j t s l eq 4 written for a station x gives g t x a k l s g t 1 x e t x where e t x is gaussian noise with zero mean and variance 1 a k l s x 2 and a k l s x is the autocorrelation at station x thanks to a composite censored likelihood each a k l s is estimated at each station x l c a k l s x t t 1 l t t 1 c a k l s x where t t 1 such that j t s l j t 1 s k and l t t 1 c a k l s x 5 f 2 g t x g t 1 x if g t x c j t x g t 1 x c j t 1 x p g t x c j t x g t 1 x c j t 1 x if g t x c j t x g t 1 x c j t 1 x f 1 g t 1 x p g t x c j t x g t 1 x g t 1 x if g t x c j t x g t 1 x c j t 1 x f 1 g t x p g t 1 x c j t 1 x g t x g t x if g t x c j t x g t 1 x c j t 1 x where f 2 a bivariate gaussian density with zero mean unit variance and covariance a k l s x and p g t x c j t x g t 1 x c j t 1 x is computed from the associated cdf f 1 is the standard gaussian density and the conditional probabilities above p g t x c j t x g t 1 x g t 1 x and p g t 1 x c j t 1 x g t x g t x are respectively computed from the cdf n a k l s x g t 1 x 1 a k l s x 2 and n a k l s x g t x 1 a k l s x 2 the two latter distributions are obtained from the formulation given in b for the n variate case applied to the bivariate case in fig 3 the boxplots of the estimated parameters a k l s x for each season and transitions are represented in our model these coefficients are assumed to be constant over the region to this end the regional median of the estimated coefficients a k l s x is taken second the parameters of the covariance function ρ j τ for each sub set j are separately estimated from the censored data z t x max c j x g t x for t in sub set j in order to account for the temporal dependence between g t and g t 1 in its estimation spatial dependence is estimated from the gaussian error e t realisation of e t are given by t x g t x a k l s g t 1 x separate estimation of each ρ j needs one more simplification indeed for t in sub set j the covariance e t is cov e t σ t a k l s 2 σ t 1 here the covariance is approximated by cov e t 1 a k l s 2 ρ j by considering σ t 1 σ t t is censored whenever g t or g t 1 is for a given day t in j t let e t o x g t x c j t x and g t 1 x c j t 1 x be the ensemble of observed x and e t c x g t x c j t x and or g t 1 x c j t 1 x the ensemble of censored x e t is defined as the vector of censoring thresholds of t x and β j are the parameters of ρ j for e t several cases of censoring threshold e t x and hence of censoring intervals i t c x are possible it depends on the sign of a k l s and whether or not g t x or g t 1 x are censored all the cases are given the c and their proportion are given in table 3 for a given day t in j t i t c i t c x is ensemble of censoring intervals of e t according to pesonen et al 2015 for each sub set j since the e 1 e t are independent the censored likelihood of β j given the t x x e t o is 6 l j c β j t j l t c β j for a given day t in sub set j the l t c β j can be written as following if all the t x i are observed l t c β j f n t x 1 t x n β j f n t x β j f n is multivariate gaussian density of dimension n if at least one station is censored 7 l t c β j f o t o p e t c i t c e t o t o β j f o t o is multivariate gaussian density of dimension cardinal of e j t o of zero mean and covariance 1 a k l s 2 ρ j when j t 1 s k and j t s l successive days in different seasons are omitted for simplicity the probability in the right part of above equation is a gaussian cdf since e t c e t o t o is gaussian whose conditional mean and covariance formulation are given in b if all the stations are censored l t c β j p e t i t c β j this probability is the cdf of a n variate gaussian process with zero mean and covariance 1 a k l s 2 ρ j note that the estimation of β 1 β 6 by eq 6 is only based on 59 of the observations according to c indeed stations with consecutive dry days case 1b have no contributions to the likelihood of eq 6 thus an alternative is suggested which consist in inferring the β j directly from the g t and independently of the temporal dependence naturally censoring cases still happen but the entire data set is used the l t c β j written for g t take the following formulations ϕ n g t x β j if no station is censored ϕ o g t o p g t c c j t g t o g t o β j if at least one station is censored p g t c j t β j if all stations are censored where ϕ o g t o and ϕ n g t x are the multivariate gaussian distribution associated to g t in that case the a k l s are obviously omitted in the estimation of the β j table 3 gives the proportion of censored cases for this version hence two versions of the model are compared when ρ j is estimated from either t taking into account the temporal correlation or g t independently from the temporal correlation both alternatives are compared to the observations data 3 4 spatio temporal rainfall simulations the purpose of the study is to evaluate the ability of both versions of the model to reproduce the rainfall spatio temporal properties given a gt thus the objective is to compare the simulated rainfall density to the rainfall density of the past observation therefore transitions between gts are not modelled even if gt sequences can easily be generated thanks to a markov model e g vrac et al 2007 ailliot et al 2009 the simulations are performed using the observed sequence of gts between 1969 and 2008 which is assumed to be long enough to contain a representative variety of transitions the model applies for t 2 only for each day t 1 if t 1 g 1 x is randomly drawn from n n 0 σ 1 2 if t 1 e t x is randomly drawn from n n 0 1 a k l s σ t and g t x is set to a k l s g t 1 x e t x the simulations of the e t x are performed by eigenvalue decomposition of the covariance matrix from the simulated g t x the y t x are retrieved from the inverse transformation of eq 3 note that in order to remove the initialisation effect a warm up is realised the first year of simulation is discarded 4 simulations evaluation the model is evaluated in terms of precipitation intermittency intensity and extreme properties using different indices the evaluation is made from three points of view marginal spatial and regional or areal i e for aggregated rainfall over the catchment hundred simulations over 40 years 1969 2008 at the 47 stations 41 stations of the calibration set and 6 stations from the validation set are performed for the two following versions of the model ar1 p exp mar 1 model with powered exponential correlation function ar1 p expi mar 1 model with powered exponential correlation function with independent estimation of the a k l s and ρ j the simulations are confronted to the observed statistics 4 1 marginals properties in this section two aspects of the model are evaluated first the marginal distributions h estimated from the data at the calibration stations and second the marginal distributions h obtained at the validation stations from the parameter mapping procedure the evaluation is mostly made on the validation stations in order to assess the quality of the marginal parameters mapping an article fully dedicated to the parameters mapping methodology used in this study is available in blanchet et al 2019 only the results for ar1 pexp are shown here but the same conclusions are drawn for ar1 pexpi as expected since the two versions differ only by the spatial correlation estimation fig 4 gives for both seasons and gt1 the daily mean mean the wet day mean mean 0 a day is considered wet at 0 1 mm and the rainy day fraction p1 for all stations calibration set in grey and validation set in red little biases are only observed over the validation stations isolated stations situated on the edge of the domain and outside the catchment show the largest biases e g saint julien de peyrolas or pont saint esprit the geographical situation of these stations makes the interpolation more delicate due to the spatial extrapolation they require similar results are found for the other gts however no systematic positive or negative biases are noticed this is something expected since the mapping model has been selected in blanchet et al 2019 as the best compromise over the entire domain this is why the interpolated parameters may not perfectly coincide with the at site values but the differences remain low fig 5 displays the monthly mean for the six validation stations for the ar1 pexp model note that unlike the daily mean of fig 4 the monthly mean also evaluates the temporal correlation the precipitation seasonal aspect is important in terms of hydrological responses e g grouillet et al 2016 in our model precipitation seasonality is partly ensured by the frequency of the gts this modelling option combining the gt and the two really contrasted season correctly reproduces the seasonal cycle for the four validation stations below 212 m the seasonal cycle is relatively well reproduced despite the biases noticed in fig 4 for the two other stations it seems to be more difficult during summer months similar behaviour to sablières is observed for few calibration stations not shown located on the north western part of the domain at higher altitudes or in peculiar topographic area e g a narrow valley even though these few stations the use of gts to condition the autocorrelation seems to be a good alternative with lower number of parameters than the classical monthly modelling e g bennett et al 2018 or lower constrain than the use of sine cosine functions e g kleiber et al 2012 baxevani and lennartson 2015 stationary spatial models usually lack variability in annual precipitation totals e g wilks and wilby 1999 mehrotra and sharma 2007 bennett et al 2018 the mean and the standard deviation of annual totals for each station are given in fig 6 annual total averages are well reproduced and the year to year variations of gt occurrence frequencies is enough to correctly reproduce the variability of the annual totals validation stations show little overestimations or underestimations of the annual totals caused by the interpolated marginal distributions as already stated for fig 4 some calibration stations underestimate the observed interannual variability as previously gt frequencies are not enough to represent all local year to year variations in particular for these sites very high annual total values can be observed some years which can highly increase the standard variation of the observation the stationary hypothesis of our model prevents to reproduce those peaks the presented model does not represent rain occurrence and rain persistence as specific parameters but implicitly by the censoring and the temporal autocorrelation of the latent gaussian process dry and wet days persistences spells statistics are evaluated fig 7 represents the distributions of dry fig 7a and wet fig 7b spell duration in days for the six validation stations both persistences are well reproduced with some underestimations and overestimations caused by the regionally constant a k l s by doing so the model compromises on all stations which can induce a little too much or too low temporal correlation depending on the stations long duration spells 10 days representing less than 2 seem to present larger overestimations but this is a visual artifact introduced by the logarithmic scale the ability of the model to correctly represent the extremes is now assessed fig 8 shows the relative differences between the observation based and simulation based estimates of the 5 10 50 and 100 year return levels of daily and 3 day cumulated rainfall 3 day rainfall allows to examine the temporal autocorrelation and it is relevant from an hydrological point of view paquet et al 2013 show for a quite similar catchment in terms size topography and hydrological response that all significant floods are generated by 3 day sequences of intense precipitation in order to have robust estimations of the return levels quantile the return levels of fig 8 are estimated by fitting the gamma mixture of eq 2 over the simulations and observations of daily and 3 day rainfall in order to apply the mixture to the 3 day rainfall a gt has to be affected to them the this end the most frequent gt during 3 days is affected to corresponding sequence when three different gts are observed during 3 days the gt of the maximum during the sequence is affected to the sequence for the daily rainfall return levels the relative differences are centred on 0 for the calibration stations positive biases are mostly observed for the validation stations up to 30 probably induced by the marginal parameters interpolation the 3 day return level differences are larger around 10 with both underestimations mainly for the largest estimated quantiles and overestimations mainly for the smallest estimated quantiles the validation stations present the largest overestimations but close to the calibration stations merely a little above 20 spatially uniform a k l s coefficients probably induce too much or too low temporal correlation depending on the stations 4 2 spatial properties in this part the ability of the model to correctly reproduce the inter site dependence is evaluated in all the following figures the closer to the first bisector the model is the better the model performs in this section and in the following ones the two methods for estimating the spatial dependence are confronted fig 9 shows the kendall rank correlation τ k computed considering only the couples of positive rain amounts the boxplots of the number of pair of stations simultaneously wet for each sub set are shown in the first line this number tends to be slightly underestimated for the ar1 p exp version compared to the observations this aspect is improved for the ar1 p expi version the model satisfyingly reproduces the correlation for the different sub sets in particular it respects the decreasing spatial correlation from gt1 to gt3 the independent estimation ar p expi considerably improves the correlation despite a slight underestimation larger underestimation in the correlation of the ar1 p exp version is partly caused by the approximation that σ t 1 σ t in the estimation of the spatial dependence see section 3 3 2 which may bias the estimation recall that in the ar1 p exp model more than 41 of the censored cases fall in censored case 1b which has no influence on the covariance function estimation since the contribution of the corresponding terms in the censored likelihood is constant see c for more details thus estimation of the spatial dependence in ar1 p exp is actually based on much less data than for ar1 p expi in both versions of the model one can notice that the correlation of simulations is almost constant for all pairs of stations for gt3 this sub set mainly regroups very localised rain events which can explain the difficulty for the model to correctly estimate its spatial correlation besides the number of jointly wet pairs is much lower for gt3 which introduces uncertainty in the computation of τ k and makes its interpretation difficult validation stations red segments show similar behaviour to the calibration stations the spatial dependence of high quantiles is also investigated by computing the conditional probability of exceeding high quantile q for two stations x i and x j this probability is defined as p 1 1 p y x i q i y x j q j the p 1 1 associated to the 95th percentile are represented in fig 10 the conclusions are similar to those drawn for τ k with better performance for p 1 1 than for τ k although a larger variability can be noted for the simulations for gt2 and gt3 the probabilities are better reproduced by ar1 p expi while ar1 p exp tends to underestimate those probabilities likewise for τ k for gt1 the probabilities are partly overestimated by ar1 p expi while ar1 p exp underestimates those of the lo season and better reproduces those of the hi season 4 3 areal properties the model performance is analysed in terms of areal properties based on aggregated precipitation over the region i e all station precipitations are cumulated these are only computed over the calibration stations the validation stations are excluded to avoid mixing with the potential error induced by the marginal mapping procedure the dry and wet spells distribution of the aggregated rainfall are represented in fig 11 for both versions of the model wet and dry spells are very well reproduced by the ar1 p expi version while ar1 p exp slightly overestimates or underestimates the spell duration note that the spells are not explicitly prescribed in the model but rather induced by day to day correlation and the gt sequence spells are also investigated in some other studies using quite close modelling frameworks e g kleiber et al 2012 serinaldi and kilsby 2014 in those articles the models show some difficulties to reproduce areal dry spells however these studies consider wider areas 65 to 370 times larger than our study area which can make this aspect more difficult to represent fig 12 represents the distribution of jointly wet sites among the calibration stations this shows the ability of the model to generate daily rain fields with the right size and at the right frequency this criteria has been computed from the simulated data removing the values corresponding to missing value in the observations globally ar1 p expi performs better ar1 p exp underestimates the frequency of the largest events and the frequency of the dry days while it overestimates the frequency of the intermediate size events similar results are obtained by baxevani and lennartson 2015 the independent estimation reduces the bias in the largest and intermediate size events but it slightly overestimates the frequency of the small size events 5 stations and the frequency of dry days now the size of the events generating daily annual maxima is studied fig 13 shows for a given threshold the 90 range of areas number of stations experiencing rainfall no smaller than that threshold during the annual maximum events the upper bound resp lower bound of the envelope corresponds to the widest smallest area covered by a given magnitude or more for both models and sub sets the lower bounds of the simulations match very well the observations thus the least extended events are very well represented the most extended events for a given magnitude upper envelope tend to be overestimated in size in gt1 during the hi season while they tend to be underestimated in size in all the other subsets the ar1 p expi model slightly reduces the underestimation but slightly increases the overestimation in gt1 hi note that the gts were defined in blanchet et al 2019 according to the spatial correlation of the wts with gt1 corresponding to the largest range of correlation followed by gt2 and gt3 fig 13 shows that the simulations correctly reproduce this aspect 4 4 model adaptability the adaptability of the model to different catchments is a genuine issue in order to illustrate the generality of the modelling framework the exact same model as implemented for ardèche is applied to a much bigger catchment within a different climatic region the durance catchment at cadarache located in the southern french alps is chosen 14 000 km2 see fig s1 of the supplementary material the altitude of the region ranges up to 4000 m a s l while the ardèche catchment reaches around 1700 m a s l fifty four stations with data from january 1 1975 to december 31 2014 are selected for data availability see fig sa1 of the supplementary material table s1 of the supplementary gives the minimum median and maximum of the annual and seasonal averages of daily non zero rainfall of the 54 stations the daily average of rain intensity over the durance catchment is half to 2 3 of the daily average of rain intensity over the ardèche gt1 and gt2 have almost the same rain intensity while it is more contrasted for ardèche no validation stations are considered for this catchment since the generality of the selection framework of the marginal distribution and the parameter interpolation is thoroughly discussed in blanchet et al 2019 the same seasons gts based on the spatial correlation of rain amount over the ardèche and the best model version ar1 p expi used for the ardèche are adopted figs 3 13 are reproduced for the durance catchment and given in the supplementary material figs s2 s12 between the two catchments only few differences of performance are observed in terms of marginal properties in particular there are differences in the standard deviation of annual totals the wet spells duration and 3 days return levels respectively figs s5 s6 and s7 of the supplementary material the variability of annual totals seems to be mostly slightly overestimated while there are over and underestimations for ardèche the frequency of the large wet spells 5 days they represent less than 2 are a little overestimated for almost all stations while there are over and under estimations for ardèche similarly the 3 day return levels are systematically overestimated up to a little above 20 for the durance catchment the conclusions for all the other marginal properties the spatial properties and areal properties figures s2 to s4 and s8 to s12 are the same for both catchments the differences in the model performance between the two catchment may probably be linked to the sub sampling in seasons gts the sub sampling for the ardèche catchment may not be totally suited to the durance catchment it is quite remarkable that the performance of the model over such different catchments is globally similar this proves that the proposed model combining weather pattern with a latent gaussian field is general enough to be applied to any region although some modelling choices sub sampling marginal distribution spatial and temporal correlation may need to be tailored for some regions 5 conclusions discussions and perspectives 5 1 conclusions the aim of this study is to develop a high resolution spatial rainfall model from station data in order to generate spatially distributed rainfall scenarios for hydrological applications based on a distributed rainfall runoff model to this end the modelling strategy relies on weather types sub sampling conditionally on which a first order markovian autoregressive model is calibrated an application of the model is performed over the ardèche catchment situated in south of france given the complex terrain nature and the strong variability of the rainfall this catchment constitutes a challenging candidate to test the model the added value of combining sub sampling with spatial modelling is evaluated with regards to the observations two versions of the model are compared considering three aspects the marginal spatial and areal properties the at site behaviour is assessed in terms of daily occurrence rainfall intensity at daily monthly and annual scale persistence and extremes results are globally satisfying for both calibration and validation stations indeed the marginal distribution parameters interpolation seems to be efficient and shows little discrepancies the discrepancies of the marginal properties have mainly three sources i the interpolated margins illustrated by the biases on the validation stations figs 4 and 8 ii the constant temporal correlation over the region can induce local scale autocorrelation discrepancies see for instance the return levels of 3 day cumulated rainfall for large return periods fig 8 and iii the sub sampling in two seasons and three weather types is not always enough to represent the seasonality or the year to year variability figs 5 and 6 as mentioned in blanchet et al 2019 the mapping process of the margins is still perfectible for instance in order to take into account complex orography or climate non stationarity covariates characterising the terrain nature carreau et al 2013 or atmospheric circulation serinaldi and kilsby 2014 can be introduced this could improve the quality of the model in terms of seasonality and variability however this would imply an heavier parametrisation and a substantial work is needed to adapt the parameter mapping procedure in a temporal non stationary context the reproduction of inter site dependence is also studied two versions of the model are confronted one in which the spatial dependence is estimated conditionally on temporal correlation ar1 p exp and the other one in which the spatial and temporal correlation are estimated independently ar1 p expi the dependence is modelled by a powered exponential correlation function the dependence is examined with respect to daily rainfall and high quantiles results show that ar1 p expi reproduces better the inter site dependence despite a slight tendency to underestimation the better performance of ar1 p expi is probably because its estimation involves actually more data than ar1 p exp the areal aspect of the aggregated precipitation over the area is assessed the model shows good performance with even better results for the ar1 p expi version and finally the hybrid model developed in this study present the advantage to work for different catchment within different climatic regions with very little alterations rain fields generated over a regular grid of one square kilometre spatial resolution for the ardèche catchment are given in an animated plot supplied in the supplementary material 5 2 discussions and perspectives despite the good performance of the ar1 p expi version it slightly underestimates the spatial correlation this can have four causes 1 the data sub sampling into two seasons and three gts might be relevant for the rain intensity over the region but not necessarily optimal for the spatial dependence indeed gts are obtained by grouping the wts according to the spatial correlation the wts are based on the clustering of the geopotential heights which has proved itself to be relevant for rain intensity garavaglia et al 2010 but these have not been validated for the spatial dependence 2 the use of the meta gaussian framework causes potential correlation reduction when the marginals are transformed from gaussian to rainfall marginals this theoretical aspect has been proven by kendall et al 1979 and matheron 1989 some solutions have been proposed to inflate the gaussian correlation in order to compensate the correlation reduction li and hammond 1975 is one of the first study addressing this issue in the case of rainfall guillot 1999 leblois and creutin 2013 used a polynomial expansion while papalexiou 2018 proposed a simpler parametric transformation to inflate the correlation however in our case it represents a huge numerical effort for unguaranteed improvements and new developments are still needed to fit our purposes 3 the simplification of the covariance of the noise term e t in order to estimate the correlation function independently for each sub set the considered simplification σ t σ t 1 is only true 70 of the times which probably biases the estimation relaxing this hypothesis would be theoretically possible but the estimation would be a burden 4 the use of a latent gaussian process which is radially symmetric this means that in the case of a gaussian process g with zero mean and covariance matrix σ and for any vector u u 1 u n 0 1 n we have p g 1 φ 1 u 1 g n φ 1 u n p g 1 φ 1 1 u 1 g n φ 1 1 u n this last point is empirically illustrated in fig 14 for u k p j 0 x k in sub set j corresponding to the high risk season and gt1 which is the sub set containing the most stations x k x l with p j 0 0 5 for each pair of stations the joint empirical probability of non exceedance nep kl p y x k 0 y x l 0 and exceedance ep kl p y x k h y j x k 1 1 p j 0 x k y x l h y j x l 1 1 p j 0 x l are computed fig 14 represents the differences ep ij nep ij for the model ar1 p expi versus the observations for the observations ep nep is mostly positive and depends on the pair of stations this means that the bivariate cdf of precipitation is mainly right skewed and the asymmetry is spatially non stationary on the contrary for the simulations ep nep is constant around zero which is prescribed by the gaussian process in order to introduce asymmetry other spatial dependence structure can be considered for instance the chi square copula introduced by bàrdossy 2006 and recently explored by quessy et al 2016 allows to prescribe the asymmetry favre et al 2018 have proposed a generalisation of this copula allowing for upper tail dependence however their use in a spatial rather than multivariate context poses some difficulties in particular with regards to the estimation of the correlation function cf nelsen 2007 joe 2014 for more details exploring the added value of different copulas prescribing asymmetry would be relevant concerning the estimation of the spatio temporal dependence simplifications have been made to the mar 1 the first simplification states that the temporal correlation is constant over the region in principle a k l s can vary in space but this complicates the estimation procedure first if the matrix a t t 1 has different coefficients on its diagonal the matrix id n a t t 1 2 σ j t is not symmetrical thus additional constraints on the a k l s have to be set to make the matrix id n a t t 1 2 σ j t symmetric this can be easily done for 41 stations but it is not realistic for high resolution fields due to computational time and numerical problems second in the view of generating rain fields with spatially varying a these parameters have to be mapped similarly to the marginal parameters blanchet et al 2019 however spatial patterns are not obvious for all transitions not shown and a tricky interpolation is avoided by taking it to be spatially uniform to summarize the use of diagonal matrix a t t 1 reproduces only the lag 0 spatial correlation and lag 1 autocorrelation this modelling choice does not reproduce the rain fields advection or movement which may be necessary for hourly data but is less important for daily data and is omitted here for computational reasons the second simplification is to consider separately the temporal and the spatial dependence spatio temporal correlation function can be used to simultaneously estimate both dependencies cf cressie and wikle 2011 bourotte et al 2016 for example however in that case the use of a censored likelihood is not realistic most of the times a pairwise composite likelihood or a method of moment is used e g baxevani and lennartson 2015 bourotte et al 2016 concerning the weather pattern based sub sampling instead of using synoptic wt a direct clustering of days with similar spatial correlation could improve the model performance a solution would be to cluster days based not only on synoptic variables but also including indices of the spatial variability of rainfall the rainfall variability can be assessed through indicators such as the number of wet stations where the rainfalls are located on the foothills the ridge or the plateau or the rain field orientation a methodology inspired from studies conducted over radar data could be adapted in our case e g benoit et al 2018 an additional model deserves to be added to simulate long wt sequences instead of repeating the observed 40 year sequences as it is done in the article for hydrological applications it should be able to model the correct frequency of occurrence of each gt within each month of the year and also the correct distribution of wt spells a first order markov with covariates accounting for monthly variations of gts occurrence may be a relevant option to achieve this last but not least considering the relatively small size and the strong orographic orientation of our study catchment there is no evidence of non stationary spatial dependence however if larger domains are considered non stationarity can be suspected in the spatial dependence many ways are possible to introduce non stationarity cf risser 2015 for a review a promising way for mountain catchments with complex topography e g in the alps would be to use a non stationary covariance function paciorek and schervish 2006 give a formulation for a gaussian process allowing to derive a non stationary

5929,simulation methods for design flood estimations in dam safety studies require fine scale precipitation data to provide quality input for hydrological models especially for extrapolation to extreme events this leads to use statistical models such as stochastic weather generators the aim here is to develop a stochastic model adaptable on mountainous catchments in france and accounting for spatial and temporal dependencies in daily precipitation fields to achieve this goal the framework of spatial random processes is adopted here the novelty of the model developed in this study resides in the combination of an autoregressive meta gaussian process accounting for the spatio temporal dependencies and weather pattern sub sampling discriminating the different rainfall intensity classes the model is tested from rain gauges in the ardèche catchment located in south of france the model estimation is performed in four steps dealing respectively with i the at site marginal distribution ii the mapping of the marginal distribution parameters at the target resolution iii the at site temporal correlation and iv the spatial covariance function the model simulations are evaluated in terms of marginal distribution inter site dependence and areal rainfall properties and compared to the observations at calibration stations and also on a set of independent validation stations regarding all these aspects the model shows good abilities to reproduce the observed statistics and presents really small discrepancies compared to the stations data the sub sampling is particularly efficient to reproduce the seasonal variations and the marginal mapping procedure induces very small differences in terms of daily rain amounts and daily occurrence probabilities keywords latent gaussian process weather pattern rainfield generation 2010 msc 00 01 99 00 1 introduction stochastic methods embedding rainfall runoff simulation are now commonly used for extreme flood estimation like the schadex method paquet et al 2013 or the sefm method schaefer and barker 2002 lumped hydrological models can be considered in this context but a more detailed representation of hydrological processes varying in space or the need of information within the catchment and not only at the outlet require the implementation of distributed rainfall runoff models in a stochastic process being continuous or event based such models have to be fed by either a multi site or a rain field simulation model the presented model is dedicated to this context and more precisely to future applications to dam safety studies a large variety of models has been developed to answer the need for spatially coherent rainfall simulation the main difficulty lies in the intermittent nature of precipitation thus the modelling has to deal with two different processes the occurrence and the intensity in hydro climatology the panel of stochastic weather generators is extremely wide each model reproduces the different spatio temporal properties of precipitation with its own benefits or drawbacks models available in the literature can be divided into two families random resampling models the principle is to rearrange past observations in order to get new time series these models do not allow to generate unobserved values and in particular the extreme ones needed in dam safety analyses random generator models the principle is to fit distributions from which new times series can be generated these models can generate unobserved values in this family mainly two types of model are available multi site models these models are able to generate rainfall only at the stations on which they have been calibrated this type of model allows to prescribe the observed spatial dependence for each pair of stations random fields models these models are able to generate rainfall on a regular grid of a chosen resolution whether or not there is stations in the grid cells thanks to a covariance function however the rain gauge network has to be dense enough to be able to learn the spatial properties of the rain field these models are often used in two simulation context 1 observation based models in this family the models only aim at mimicking the statistical properties of the observations among them there are resampling models using for instance k nearest neighbours algorithm knn e g buishand and brandsma 2001 leander and buishand 2009 there are also rainfall generators mainly based on an underlying gaussian process these models rely on the transformation of the non gaussian marginals into gaussian ones they are hereafter referred to as meta gaussian many multi site or rain field simulators are based on this principle for the rain field simulators a covariance function has to be estimated additionally in order to cope with rain intermittency and rain intensity two strategies are possible one consists in using a single underlying gaussian process which is on the one hand truncated for the rain occurrence and on the other hand transformed for rain intensity bàrdossy and pegram 2009 and rasmussen 2013 have developed a multi site model based on a multivariate latent autoregressive gaussian process to model rain occurrence and rain intensity processes at the same time similarly sparks et al 2018 have recently provided a multi site multivariate model for minimum maximum temperature and precipitation based on a single latent autoregressive gaussian process many rain field simulation strategies over an entire region are also possible from at site estimated rain distribution and covariance function a variety of meta gaussian models with a single field for occurrence and intensity can be found in the literature e g sigrist et al 2012 baxevani and lennartson 2015 for instance simulations can be performed over a regular grid by considering the same at site distribution for all gauges with unconditional simulations guillot 1999 guillot and lebel 1999 or conditional ones vischel et al 2009 a kriging can be done over marginal distribution parameters estimated at each station in order to get spatially varying marginals at a desired target resolution these marginals are combined with a meta gaussian rain field simulator to generate daily rain fields bennett et al 2018 another way is to use two distinct processes to model the occurrence and the intensity multi site models based on that principle are available wilks 1998 evin et al 2018 based on the same idea rain fields are also simulated by combining marginal parameters kriging with two distinct processes e g kleiber et al 2012 verdin et al 2015 based on meta gaussian process models for high spatio temporal resolution accounting for the advection of the rain process have also been developed leblois and creutin 2013 paschalis et al 2013 peleg et al 2017 benoit et al 2018 event based modelling can also be adopted instead of using a fixed time scale daily for instance e g onof et al 2000 leonard et al 2008 burton et al 2010 2 exogenous variables constrained models in this family the models explicitly use exogenous variables as covariates or predictors these are the so called downscaling models cf ayar et al 2016 gutiérrez et al 2018 for intercomparisons the principle is to statistically link observations with synoptic information at coarse resolution extracted for instance from climate models in order to simulate precipitation part of the climate non stationarity carried by the synoptic variable is by construction taken into account in the stochastic model these models can be used to reconstruct past events perform short term predictions or climate projections from future climate simulations of global circulation model resampling models can be based on atmospheric analog yiou 2014 or on non parametric geostatistical methods jha et al 2015 many generators are based on generalised linear models glm to link the predictors with the observations many examples of meta gaussian multi sites models have been also proposed cf wilks 2010 wilks 2012 for a review for instance chandler 2002 has proposed a rain field simulator with two distinct processes for rain occurrence and intensity but only applied in a multi site context two other studies conducted by yang et al 2005 et ambrosino et al 2014 have applied a modified version of this model estimated from a gridded dataset serinaldi and kilsby 2014 have used a single latent gaussian process to simulate rain field at the observations resolution hybrid models many models that can be described as hybrid this family gathers the models using components from both aforementioned families these models combine resampling multi sites or random fields approaches and a synoptic information through a discrete variable atmospheric circulation patterns are summarised and discretised into different classes if these classes are established directly from the precipitation or from synoptic variables these are respectively referred to as precipitation types pts or weather types wts precipitations are generated conditionally to this discrete variable it is possible to perform resampling conditionally to wts or pts i e the resampling is only performed within a class for instance a hidden markov model hmm used to generate pts sequence steinschneider and brown 2013 or a wts classification caraway et al 2014 can be combined with a knn method a simple multi site modelling consists in considering the stations as spatially and temporally independent given a wt which can be modelled by a hmm zucchini and guttorp 1991 hughes and guttorp 1994 bellone et al 2000 or defined explicitly vrac et al 2007 bellone et al 2000 and vrac et al 2007 estimate the transition probabilities from one wt to another as functions of synoptic variables by glm thompson et al 2007 consider a multisite daily rainfall generator in which rainfall spatial dependence conditionally to station specific pts ailliot et al 2009 modify this model by first considering regional pts and second adopting a rain field generator instead of a multi site generator a wide range of statistical models conditioned by wts are suggested in the literature cf wilks 2010 wilks 2012 ailliot et al 2015 for reviews based on the same idea event based models accounting for the advection and for sub daily data have also been developed e g peleg and morin 2014 using pts or wts are both valid options to define rain intensity classes pts define rather catchment specific classes since they are defined from observations on the contrary wts are defined over larger areas being defined by synoptic variables and are not specific to one catchment wts defined over france mountainous regions have been proved to be efficient for rainfall distribution modelling over france garavaglia et al 2010 garavaglia et al 2011 evin et al 2016 blanchet et al 2019 the present paper investigates the added value of these wts in the context of rainfall spatial modelling over mountainous regions in france in this study an hybrid model of daily rain field is developed the model further presented is closely related to the model of ailliot et al 2009 their approach lies on the combination of a hmm for the pts generation and a rain field simulator which covariance function is estimated conditionally to a pts our model departs from the latter on three points 1 pts are replaced by wts which are not specific to a given catchment wts sequence is not modelled instead a long observed sequence is played as many times as needed e g if 1000 years long rainfall sequence is needed the observed wt sequence of 40 years is repeated 25 times 2 temporal dependence is not implicitly ensured by the sequence of wts but is explicitly modelled conditionally to transitions from a wt to another 3 the model is not only used in a multi site contexte simulations are not only generated at calibration stations this model allows to generate rainfall at any location of the catchment or to upscale at a target spatial resolution to generate fields 1 km 2 for instance the novelty lies in the development of an hybrid random rain field simulator that is fed by daily rain gauge data only and in which all the model components namely the marginal distributions and the spatio temporal dependence structure are conditioned by synoptic wts this has to our knowledge never been proposed before the aim is to get a model adaptable to different mountainous catchments covering several thousands square kilometre a daily time step is relevant in these cases as well for the dynamic of the hydrological processes to be modelled as for the availability of the rainfall data a special attention is paid to the ability of the model to simulate the high quantiles and to the good representation of the day to day correlation of wet sequences in order to model coherent hydrographs section 2 presents the study area and the data section 3 describes the model the simulations are evaluated in section 4 and section 5 gives the conclusions discusses the results and presents some perspectives of the proposed work 2 study area and data to assess the model ability to meet the previously stated objectives an application to the ardèche catchment 2260 km2 located in the south east of france cf fig 1 is made indeed despite its size this catchment presents important orographic and climatic disparities this region partly includes the south eastern slope of the massif central where the highest summits are located about 1700 m a s l and bordered by the rhône valley down to 40 m a s l in the east this region is prone to extreme precipitations causing intense floods delrieu et al 2005 nuissier et al 2008 these events are mainly triggered by the advection of humid air mass of the lower layer of the atmosphere flown from the mediterranean sea and forming meso scale convective and quasi stationary systems due to the specific topography these systems can stay over the same area for several hours and are responsible for heavy rainfall nuissier et al 2008 the hymex field campaign ducrocq et al 2014 drobinski et al 2014 gives a thorough insight into the large variety of blocking situation generating heavy rainfall systems over the region data from rain gauge networks operated by électricité de france and météo france are used forty seven stations are available inside and outside the catchment with 15 to 40 years of daily data between january 1 1969 and december 31 2008 fig 15 a shows the data availability throughout the period for each station the proposed stochastic model aims at generating rain fields at a given resolution to provide rainfall scenarios in order to simulate flood events thanks to a rainfall runoff model this study only describes and evaluates the rainfall generator model among the 47 stations n 41 stations black stations in fig 1 are used to calibrate the model and to evaluate it from simulations performed at these stations in order to evaluate the potential errors or biases that will be faced when simulating fields six leave out or validation stations are kept red stations in fig 1 the performance of the model is evaluated at these stations in order to enlighten the potential errors in non monitored areas in the next sections the simulator structure and its application over the ardèche catchment are presented the modelling choices are driven by the will to combine wts with a gaussian process and are not specific to the ardèche catchment in order to illustrate the adaptability of the model framework to different catchment the model is also tested over the durance catchment this question is discussed in section 4 4 and all the results for this catchment are available in the supplementary material 3 spatial simulator in this section the different components of the model are described the simulator is based on a single meta gaussian process to model both rain occurrence and intensity this approach is privileged in order to reduce the number of estimated parameters and simulated gaussian fields especially in the case of high resolution random fields and to maintain the spatio temporal coherence between rain occurrence and intensity let x x 1 x n be the vector of length n of station locations according to guillot 1999 the vector of precipitation y x at stations x is linked to the latent gaussian vector z x by the following relationship 1 y x ψ z x if z x c x 0 if z x c x where ψ is a monotonic non decreasing function further described in eqs 2 and 3 from which rain intensity is retrieved by transforming z values above c c is a threshold which prescribes the rain intermittency given the fact that the rain generating processes can have different nature e g stratiform or convective or evolve seasonally heavier rain intensity in autumn are observed over the region the seasonal and wt based sub sampling proposed by garavaglia et al 2010 is adopted indeed a split in s 2 seasons is set with a low risk season lo from december to august and a high risk season hi from september to november however instead of the eight wts identified at the western european scale by garavaglia et al 2010 those are grouped into k 3 groups of weather types gt based on the correlogram characterising the spatial correlation of the rain fields the same gt as defined in blanchet et al 2019 gts frequencies between 1969 and 2008 are given in table 1 gt1 mainly regroups mediterranean circulations bringing the heavy rain events over the study region gt2 rather regroups oceanic atlantic circulations based rainfall and gt3 gathers anticyclonic days with really sparse or no rainfall the rainfall intensity correlation range decreases from gt1 to gt3 cf table 1 and blanchet et al 2019 the distinction between convective and stratiform rainfall is mainly taken into account by the seasonal gt sub sampling in the following each day t 1 t is thus associated to a sub set j 1 s k 6 in the following sections the at site marginal model and the parameters mapping are presented in section 3 1 the spatio temporal dependence in section 3 2 and all the parameters estimations are presented in section 3 3 the model steps are summarised in fig 2 and the notations are reminded in table 2 3 1 marginal distribution one of the model ability is to generate rainfall at any location of the domain or on a regular grid to this end marginal distribution parameters have to be mapped based on the rain gauge observations given the density of the stations and the daily time scale of study a 1 1 km2 interpolation grid is considered interpolation is achieved for each sub set j in a two step procedure put in place by blanchet et al 2019 and illustrated for the same catchment the marginal distribution at station x relies on the sub sampling into seasons and gts for a given day in sub set j the rainfall cdf is given by 2 p y j x y h y j x y p j 0 x 1 p j 0 x f y j x y where y j x is the random variable of daily zero and non zero rainfall amount for a day in sub set j at x p j 0 x is the dry day fraction at station x within sub set j following the two step estimation procedure developed in blanchet et al 2019 first the at site distribution parameters are estimated then these parameters are mapped at the wanted resolution the interpolated values can be interpreted as estimates of the local values at the center of the 1 1 km2 grid points in blanchet et al 2019 the interpolated values are validated at the stations as if the latter were all located at the center of the grid points they belong to blanchet et al 2019 conclude that for this study area the best marginal model is the mixture of gamma distribution i e f y j x is a gamma distribution specific for each sub set j blanchet et al 2019 also found that over this domain the best mapping model is a bivariate thin plate spline model with drift in smoothed elevation it is shown in the following that the interpolation is statistically quite robust to depict several rainfall characteristics at the station locations 3 2 spatio temporal model since the marginal distribution only describes the rainfall behaviour at a given site the spatial and temporal dependences have to be modelled if y t x were real valued then 3 z t x φ 1 h y j x y t x would be a gaussian process with marginals n 0 1 φ being the standard gaussian however since rainfall amounts are non negative y t x 0 z t x defined above is a censored gaussian process it can be written as z t x max c j x g t x where c j x φ 1 p j 0 x is the censoring threshold and g t x is a mutivariate gaussian with margins n 0 1 and covariance matrix σ t referring to eq 1 ψ is equal to h y j x 1 φ the spatio temporal dependence among the n stations is modelled by the zero mean latent multivariate gaussian variable g g t x i i 1 n t 1 t n 0 ω with ω the nt nt covariance matrix for the n sites and t days it is assumed to be a multivariate markov autoregressive process of order 1 mar 1 mar 1 has been used in several studies to describe spatio temporal dependence of rainfall e g rasmussen 2013 bennett et al 2018 thus g t x is defined as follows 4 g t x a t t 1 g t 1 x e t x where a t t 1 is a n n matrix of autoregressive parameters and e t x is a gaussian noise vector of length n the e t x s t 1 t are independent of each other and e t x is independent of g t x for t t this ensures the markovian property then e t x has zero mean and covariance matrix σ t a t t 1 2 σ t 1 the matrix a t t 1 is assumed to be diagonal e g evin et al 2018 bennett et al 2018 this means that only the spatial covariance and the at site autocorrelation are explicitly modelled 3 2 1 spatial dependence rain field simulation based on gaussian processes requires to calculate the correlation between every couple of points of a domain in order to achieve that the covariance matrix σ t is represented by a covariance function ρ j τ for a day t in sub set season gt j τ is the inter site distance the powered exponential correlation function is used here ρ j τ exp τ λ j ν j where λ j 0 is the range parameter and ν j 0 2 is the power term in the literature anisotropic covariance functions are commonly used to introduce a preferential dependence axis e g baxevani and lennartson 2015 blanchet and creutin 2017 this can be easily done by using a distance accounting for the directionality such as the mahalanobis distance τ x u x v x u x v t π 1 x u x v π is positive definite matrix with π id n the identity matrix it gives the euclidean distance introducing the anisotropy π is usually written as π 1 m t m and m is parametrised as following m cos ψ sin ψ b sin ψ b cos ψ with b 1 the elongation coefficient and ψ π 2 π 2 the angle with this parametrisation for a given site x all the points with equal covariance with x form an ellipse centred at x with ψ the angle between the horizontal and the major axis of the ellipse and b the ratio between the major and minor axes 3 2 2 temporal dependence as previously mentioned only the at site autocorrelation is modelled here since a is a diagonal matrix another approximation is made on matrix a t t 1 by considering the autocorrelation as constant over the region thus a t t 1 is of the form a t t 1 a t t 1 id n this also simplifies the covariance of e t which becomes σ t a t t 1 2 σ t 1 in the following the a t t 1 only depends on transitions among gts within a season this coefficient is assumed to be constant within a season and for each transition from one gt to another from gt1 to gt1 gt1 to gt2 gt2 to gt1 etc for t and t 1 in a season s and a couple of gts k l a k l s is defined as the autocorrelation coefficient for the transitions from j t 1 s k to j t s l in total 18 coefficients have to be estimated 3 3 parameters estimation 3 3 1 marginal distribution parameters the probability p j 0 x is the dry day fraction at station x in sub set j the empirical probability p j 0 x is considered as a good estimate of p j 0 x at each station x and for each sub set j the parameters of the gamma distribution modelling positive rainfall are estimated by a probability weighted moments method pwm cf blanchet et al 2019 for more details from the estimated h y j x the precipitations y j x are transformed into z j x used for the estimation of the covariance function see section 3 3 2 the marginal model parameters are mapped by a bivariate thin plate spline estimated by a penalised least square method for more details see blanchet et al 2019 a marginal distribution h y j x can now be obtained at each point of the domain for each sub set j from the mapped parameters the marginal distribution at the six validation stations are computed according this method 3 3 2 mar 1 model parameters from the estimated marginal distributions h y j x realisations of z t x at station x for a day t in sub set j s k z t x φ 1 h y j x i y t x i are computed from this the autoregressive parameters a k l s and the covariance function ρ j of g t for t in sub set j are estimated the authors remind that the latent process g n 0 ω is not observed but only a censored version z the use of a censored likelihood is then required one can write this likelihood for the gaussian process g described by the eq 4 nevertheless it represents a numerical challenge to optimise indeed not only the number of parameters to optimise at a time would be too large but also it would mean to invert a n t 1 n t 1 size matrix which is completely unrealistic to avoid this the estimation is performed in two steps first the 18 autocorrelation coefficients for each station are estimated for all t 1 t such as j t 1 s k j t s l eq 4 written for a station x gives g t x a k l s g t 1 x e t x where e t x is gaussian noise with zero mean and variance 1 a k l s x 2 and a k l s x is the autocorrelation at station x thanks to a composite censored likelihood each a k l s is estimated at each station x l c a k l s x t t 1 l t t 1 c a k l s x where t t 1 such that j t s l j t 1 s k and l t t 1 c a k l s x 5 f 2 g t x g t 1 x if g t x c j t x g t 1 x c j t 1 x p g t

g t 1 x c j t 1 x where f 2 a bivariate gaussian density with zero mean unit variance and covariance a k l s x and p g t x c j t x g t 1 x c j t 1 x is computed from the associated cdf f 1 is the standard gaussian density and the conditional probabilities above p g t x c j t x g t 1 x g t 1 x and p g t 1 x c j t 1 x g t x g t x are respectively computed from the cdf n a k l s x g t 1 x 1 a k l s x 2 and n a k l s x g t x 1 a k l s x 2 the two latter distributions are obtained from the formulation given in b for the n variate case applied to the bivariate case in fig 3 the boxplots of the estimated parameters a k l s x for each season and transitions are represented in our model these coefficients are assumed to be constant over the region to this end the regional median of the estimated coefficients a k l s x is taken second the parameters of the covariance function ρ j τ for each sub set j are separately estimated from the censored data z t x max c j x g t x for t in sub set j in order to account for the temporal dependence between g t and g t 1 in its estimation spatial dependence is estimated from the gaussian error e t realisation of e t are given by t x g t x a k l s g t 1 x separate estimation of each ρ j needs one more simplification indeed for t in sub set j the covariance e t is cov e t σ t a k l s 2 σ t 1 here the covariance is approximated by cov e t 1 a k l s 2 ρ j by considering σ t 1 σ t t is censored whenever g t or g t 1 is for a given day t in j t let e t o x g t x c j t x and g t 1 x c j t 1 x be the ensemble of observed x and e t c x g t x c j t x and or g t 1 x c j t 1 x the ensemble of censored x e t is defined as the vector of censoring thresholds of t x and β j are the parameters of ρ j for e t several cases of censoring threshold e t x and hence of censoring intervals i t c x are possible it depends on the sign of a k l s and whether or not g t x or g t 1 x are censored all the cases are given the c and their proportion are given in table 3 for a given day t in j t i t c i t c x is ensemble of censoring intervals of e t according to pesonen et al 2015 for each sub set j since the e 1 e t are independent the censored likelihood of β j given the t x x e t o is 6 l j c β j t j l t c β j for a given day t in sub set j the l t c β j can be written as following if all the t x i are observed l t c β j f n t x 1 t x n β j f n t x β j f n is multivariate gaussian density of dimension n if at least one station is censored 7 l t c β j f o t o p e t c i t c e t o t o β j f o t o is multivariate gaussian density of dimension cardinal of e j t o of zero mean and covariance 1 a k l s 2 ρ j when j t 1 s k and j t s l successive days in different seasons are omitted for simplicity the probability in the right part of above equation is a gaussian cdf since e t c e t o t o is gaussian whose conditional mean and covariance formulation are given in b if all the stations are censored l t c β j p e t i t c β j this probability is the cdf of a n variate gaussian process with zero mean and covariance 1 a k l s 2 ρ j note that the estimation of β 1 β 6 by eq 6 is only based on 59 of the observations according to c indeed stations with consecutive dry days case 1b have no contributions to the likelihood of eq 6 thus an alternative is suggested which consist in inferring the β j directly from the g t and independently of the temporal dependence naturally censoring cases still happen but the entire data set is used the l t c β j written for g t take the following formulations ϕ n g t x β j if no station is censored ϕ o g t o p g t c c j t g t o g t o β j if at least one station is censored p g t c j t β j if all stations are censored where ϕ o g t o and ϕ n g t x are the multivariate gaussian distribution associated to g t in that case the a k l s are obviously omitted in the estimation of the β j table 3 gives the proportion of censored cases for this version hence two versions of the model are compared when ρ j is estimated from either t taking into account the temporal correlation or g t independently from the temporal correlation both alternatives are compared to the observations data 3 4 spatio temporal rainfall simulations the purpose of the study is to evaluate the ability of both versions of the model to reproduce the rainfall spatio temporal properties given a gt thus the objective is to compare the simulated rainfall density to the rainfall density of the past observation therefore transitions between gts are not modelled even if gt sequences can easily be generated thanks to a markov model e g vrac et al 2007 ailliot et al 2009 the simulations are performed using the observed sequence of gts between 1969 and 2008 which is assumed to be long enough to contain a representative variety of transitions the model applies for t 2 only for each day t 1 if t 1 g 1 x is randomly drawn from n n 0 σ 1 2 if t 1 e t x is randomly drawn from n n 0 1 a k l s σ t and g t x is set to a k l s g t 1 x e t x the simulations of the e t x are performed by eigenvalue decomposition of the covariance matrix from the simulated g t x the y t x are retrieved from the inverse transformation of eq 3 note that in order to remove the initialisation effect a warm up is realised the first year of simulation is discarded 4 simulations evaluation the model is evaluated in terms of precipitation intermittency intensity and extreme properties using different indices the evaluation is made from three points of view marginal spatial and regional or areal i e for aggregated rainfall over the catchment hundred simulations over 40 years 1969 2008 at the 47 stations 41 stations of the calibration set and 6 stations from the validation set are performed for the two following versions of the model ar1 p exp mar 1 model with powered exponential correlation function ar1 p expi mar 1 model with powered exponential correlation function with independent estimation of the a k l s and ρ j the simulations are confronted to the observed statistics 4 1 marginals properties in this section two aspects of the model are evaluated first the marginal distributions h estimated from the data at the calibration stations and second the marginal distributions h obtained at the validation stations from the parameter mapping procedure the evaluation is mostly made on the validation stations in order to assess the quality of the marginal parameters mapping an article fully dedicated to the parameters mapping methodology used in this study is available in blanchet et al 2019 only the results for ar1 pexp are shown here but the same conclusions are drawn for ar1 pexpi as expected since the two versions differ only by the spatial correlation estimation fig 4 gives for both seasons and gt1 the daily mean mean the wet day mean mean 0 a day is considered wet at 0 1 mm and the rainy day fraction p1 for all stations calibration set in grey and validation set in red little biases are only observed over the validation stations isolated stations situated on the edge of the domain and outside the catchment show the largest biases e g saint julien de peyrolas or pont saint esprit the geographical situation of these stations makes the interpolation more delicate due to the spatial extrapolation they require similar results are found for the other gts however no systematic positive or negative biases are noticed this is something expected since the mapping model has been selected in blanchet et al 2019 as the best compromise over the entire domain this is why the interpolated parameters may not perfectly coincide with the at site values but the differences remain low fig 5 displays the monthly mean for the six validation stations for the ar1 pexp model note that unlike the daily mean of fig 4 the monthly mean also evaluates the temporal correlation the precipitation seasonal aspect is important in terms of hydrological responses e g grouillet et al 2016 in our model precipitation seasonality is partly ensured by the frequency of the gts this modelling option combining the gt and the two really contrasted season correctly reproduces the seasonal cycle for the four validation stations below 212 m the seasonal cycle is relatively well reproduced despite the biases noticed in fig 4 for the two other stations it seems to be more difficult during summer months similar behaviour to sablières is observed for few calibration stations not shown located on the north western part of the domain at higher altitudes or in peculiar topographic area e g a narrow valley even though these few stations the use of gts to condition the autocorrelation seems to be a good alternative with lower number of parameters than the classical monthly modelling e g bennett et al 2018 or lower constrain than the use of sine cosine functions e g kleiber et al 2012 baxevani and lennartson 2015 stationary spatial models usually lack variability in annual precipitation totals e g wilks and wilby 1999 mehrotra and sharma 2007 bennett et al 2018 the mean and the standard deviation of annual totals for each station are given in fig 6 annual total averages are well reproduced and the year to year variations of gt occurrence frequencies is enough to correctly reproduce the variability of the annual totals validation stations show little overestimations or underestimations of the annual totals caused by the interpolated marginal distributions as already stated for fig 4 some calibration stations underestimate the observed interannual variability as previously gt frequencies are not enough to represent all local year to year variations in particular for these sites very high annual total values can be observed some years which can highly increase the standard variation of the observation the stationary hypothesis of our model prevents to reproduce those peaks the presented model does not represent rain occurrence and rain persistence as specific parameters but implicitly by the censoring and the temporal autocorrelation of the latent gaussian process dry and wet days persistences spells statistics are evaluated fig 7 represents the distributions of dry fig 7a and wet fig 7b spell duration in days for the six validation stations both persistences are well reproduced with some underestimations and overestimations caused by the regionally constant a k l s by doing so the model compromises on all stations which can induce a little too much or too low temporal correlation depending on the stations long duration spells 10 days representing less than 2 seem to present larger overestimations but this is a visual artifact introduced by the logarithmic scale the ability of the model to correctly represent the extremes is now assessed fig 8 shows the relative differences between the observation based and simulation based estimates of the 5 10 50 and 100 year return levels of daily and 3 day cumulated rainfall 3 day rainfall allows to examine the temporal autocorrelation and it is relevant from an hydrological point of view paquet et al 2013 show for a quite similar catchment in terms size topography and hydrological response that all significant floods are generated by 3 day sequences of intense precipitation in order to have robust estimations of the return levels quantile the return levels of fig 8 are estimated by fitting the gamma mixture of eq 2 over the simulations and observations of daily and 3 day rainfall in order to apply the mixture to the 3 day rainfall a gt has to be affected to them the this end the most frequent gt during 3 days is affected to corresponding sequence when three different gts are observed during 3 days the gt of the maximum during the sequence is affected to the sequence for the daily rainfall return levels the relative differences are centred on 0 for the calibration stations positive biases are mostly observed for the validation stations up to 30 probably induced by the marginal parameters interpolation the 3 day return level differences are larger around 10 with both underestimations mainly for the largest estimated quantiles and overestimations mainly for the smallest estimated quantiles the validation stations present the largest overestimations but close to the calibration stations merely a little above 20 spatially uniform a k l s coefficients probably induce too much or too low temporal correlation depending on the stations 4 2 spatial properties in this part the ability of the model to correctly reproduce the inter site dependence is evaluated in all the following figures the closer to the first bisector the model is the better the model performs in this section and in the following ones the two methods for estimating the spatial dependence are confronted fig 9 shows the kendall rank correlation τ k computed considering only the couples of positive rain amounts the boxplots of the number of pair of stations simultaneously wet for each sub set are shown in the first line this number tends to be slightly underestimated for the ar1 p exp version compared to the observations this aspect is improved for the ar1 p expi version the model satisfyingly reproduces the correlation for the different sub sets in particular it respects the decreasing spatial correlation from gt1 to gt3 the independent estimation ar p expi considerably improves the correlation despite a slight underestimation larger underestimation in the correlation of the ar1 p exp version is partly caused by the approximation that σ t 1 σ t in the estimation of the spatial dependence see section 3 3 2 which may bias the estimation recall that in the ar1 p exp model more than 41 of the censored cases fall in censored case 1b which has no influence on the covariance function estimation since the contribution of the corresponding terms in the censored likelihood is constant see c for more details thus estimation of the spatial dependence in ar1 p exp is actually based on much less data than for ar1 p expi in both versions of the model one can notice that the correlation of simulations is almost constant for all pairs of stations for gt3 this sub set mainly regroups very localised rain events which can explain the difficulty for the model to correctly estimate its spatial correlation besides the number of jointly wet pairs is much lower for gt3 which introduces uncertainty in the computation of τ k and makes its interpretation difficult validation stations red segments show similar behaviour to the calibration stations the spatial dependence of high quantiles is also investigated by computing the conditional probability of exceeding high quantile q for two stations x i and x j this probability is defined as p 1 1 p y x i q i y x j q j the p 1 1 associated to the 95th percentile are represented in fig 10 the conclusions are similar to those drawn for τ k with better performance for p 1 1 than for τ k although a larger variability can be noted for the simulations for gt2 and gt3 the probabilities are better reproduced by ar1 p expi while ar1 p exp tends to underestimate those probabilities likewise for τ k for gt1 the probabilities are partly overestimated by ar1 p expi while ar1 p exp underestimates those of the lo season and better reproduces those of the hi season 4 3 areal properties the model performance is analysed in terms of areal properties based on aggregated precipitation over the region i e all station precipitations are cumulated these are only computed over the calibration stations the validation stations are excluded to avoid mixing with the potential error induced by the marginal mapping procedure the dry and wet spells distribution of the aggregated rainfall are represented in fig 11 for both versions of the model wet and dry spells are very well reproduced by the ar1 p expi version while ar1 p exp slightly overestimates or underestimates the spell duration note that the spells are not explicitly prescribed in the model but rather induced by day to day correlation and the gt sequence spells are also investigated in some other studies using quite close modelling frameworks e g kleiber et al 2012 serinaldi and kilsby 2014 in those articles the models show some difficulties to reproduce areal dry spells however these studies consider wider areas 65 to 370 times larger than our study area which can make this aspect more difficult to represent fig 12 represents the distribution of jointly wet sites among the calibration stations this shows the ability of the model to generate daily rain fields with the right size and at the right frequency this criteria has been computed from the simulated data removing the values corresponding to missing value in the observations globally ar1 p expi performs better ar1 p exp underestimates the frequency of the largest events and the frequency of the dry days while it overestimates the frequency of the intermediate size events similar results are obtained by baxevani and lennartson 2015 the independent estimation reduces the bias in the largest and intermediate size events but it slightly overestimates the frequency of the small size events 5 stations and the frequency of dry days now the size of the events generating daily annual maxima is studied fig 13 shows for a given threshold the 90 range of areas number of stations experiencing rainfall no smaller than that threshold during the annual maximum events the upper bound resp lower bound of the envelope corresponds to the widest smallest area covered by a given magnitude or more for both models and sub sets the lower bounds of the simulations match very well the observations thus the least extended events are very well represented the most extended events for a given magnitude upper envelope tend to be overestimated in size in gt1 during the hi season while they tend to be underestimated in size in all the other subsets the ar1 p expi model slightly reduces the underestimation but slightly increases the overestimation in gt1 hi note that the gts were defined in blanchet et al 2019 according to the spatial correlation of the wts with gt1 corresponding to the largest range of correlation followed by gt2 and gt3 fig 13 shows that the simulations correctly reproduce this aspect 4 4 model adaptability the adaptability of the model to different catchments is a genuine issue in order to illustrate the generality of the modelling framework the exact same model as implemented for ardèche is applied to a much bigger catchment within a different climatic region the durance catchment at cadarache located in the southern french alps is chosen 14 000 km2 see fig s1 of the supplementary material the altitude of the region ranges up to 4000 m a s l while the ardèche catchment reaches around 1700 m a s l fifty four stations with data from january 1 1975 to december 31 2014 are selected for data availability see fig sa1 of the supplementary material table s1 of the supplementary gives the minimum median and maximum of the annual and seasonal averages of daily non zero rainfall of the 54 stations the daily average of rain intensity over the durance catchment is half to 2 3 of the daily average of rain intensity over the ardèche gt1 and gt2 have almost the same rain intensity while it is more contrasted for ardèche no validation stations are considered for this catchment since the generality of the selection framework of the marginal distribution and the parameter interpolation is thoroughly discussed in blanchet et al 2019 the same seasons gts based on the spatial correlation of rain amount over the ardèche and the best model version ar1 p expi used for the ardèche are adopted figs 3 13 are reproduced for the durance catchment and given in the supplementary material figs s2 s12 between the two catchments only few differences of performance are observed in terms of marginal properties in particular there are differences in the standard deviation of annual totals the wet spells duration and 3 days return levels respectively figs s5 s6 and s7 of the supplementary material the variability of annual totals seems to be mostly slightly overestimated while there are over and underestimations for ardèche the frequency of the large wet spells 5 days they represent less than 2 are a little overestimated for almost all stations while there are over and under estimations for ardèche similarly the 3 day return levels are systematically overestimated up to a little above 20 for the durance catchment the conclusions for all the other marginal properties the spatial properties and areal properties figures s2 to s4 and s8 to s12 are the same for both catchments the differences in the model performance between the two catchment may probably be linked to the sub sampling in seasons gts the sub sampling for the ardèche catchment may not be totally suited to the durance catchment it is quite remarkable that the performance of the model over such different catchments is globally similar this proves that the proposed model combining weather pattern with a latent gaussian field is general enough to be applied to any region although some modelling choices sub sampling marginal distribution spatial and temporal correlation may need to be tailored for some regions 5 conclusions discussions and perspectives 5 1 conclusions the aim of this study is to develop a high resolution spatial rainfall model from station data in order to generate spatially distributed rainfall scenarios for hydrological applications based on a distributed rainfall runoff model to this end the modelling strategy relies on weather types sub sampling conditionally on which a first order markovian autoregressive model is calibrated an application of the model is performed over the ardèche catchment situated in south of france given the complex terrain nature and the strong variability of the rainfall this catchment constitutes a challenging candidate to test the model the added value of combining sub sampling with spatial modelling is evaluated with regards to the observations two versions of the model are compared considering three aspects the marginal spatial and areal properties the at site behaviour is assessed in terms of daily occurrence rainfall intensity at daily monthly and annual scale persistence and extremes results are globally satisfying for both calibration and validation stations indeed the marginal distribution parameters interpolation seems to be efficient and shows little discrepancies the discrepancies of the marginal properties have mainly three sources i the interpolated margins illustrated by the biases on the validation stations figs 4 and 8 ii the constant temporal correlation over the region can induce local scale autocorrelation discrepancies see for instance the return levels of 3 day cumulated rainfall for large return periods fig 8 and iii the sub sampling in two seasons and three weather types is not always enough to represent the seasonality or the year to year variability figs 5 and 6 as mentioned in blanchet et al 2019 the mapping process of the margins is still perfectible for instance in order to take into account complex orography or climate non stationarity covariates characterising the terrain nature carreau et al 2013 or atmospheric circulation serinaldi and kilsby 2014 can be introduced this could improve the quality of the model in terms of seasonality and variability however this would imply an heavier parametrisation and a substantial work is needed to adapt the parameter mapping procedure in a temporal non stationary context the reproduction of inter site dependence is also studied two versions of the model are confronted one in which the spatial dependence is estimated conditionally on temporal correlation ar1 p exp and the other one in which the spatial and temporal correlation are estimated independently ar1 p expi the dependence is modelled by a powered exponential correlation function the dependence is examined with respect to daily rainfall and high quantiles results show that ar1 p expi reproduces better the inter site dependence despite a slight tendency to underestimation the better performance of ar1 p expi is probably because its estimation involves actually more data than ar1 p exp the areal aspect of the aggregated precipitation over the area is assessed the model shows good performance with even better results for the ar1 p expi version and finally the hybrid model developed in this study present the advantage to work for different catchment within different climatic regions with very little alterations rain fields generated over a regular grid of one square kilometre spatial resolution for the ardèche catchment are given in an animated plot supplied in the supplementary material 5 2 discussions and perspectives despite the good performance of the ar1 p expi version it slightly underestimates the spatial correlation this can have four causes 1 the data sub sampling into two seasons and three gts might be relevant for the rain intensity over the region but not necessarily optimal for the spatial dependence indeed gts are obtained by grouping the wts according to the spatial correlation the wts are based on the clustering of the geopotential heights which has proved itself to be relevant for rain intensity garavaglia et al 2010 but these have not been validated for the spatial dependence 2 the use of the meta gaussian framework causes potential correlation reduction when the marginals are transformed from gaussian to rainfall marginals this theoretical aspect has been proven by kendall et al 1979 and matheron 1989 some solutions have been proposed to inflate the gaussian correlation in order to compensate the correlation reduction li and hammond 1975 is one of the first study addressing this issue in the case of rainfall guillot 1999 leblois and creutin 2013 used a polynomial expansion while papalexiou 2018 proposed a simpler parametric transformation to inflate the correlation however in our case it represents a huge numerical effort for unguaranteed improvements and new developments are still needed to fit our purposes 3 the simplification of the covariance of the noise term e t in order to estimate the correlation function independently for each sub set the considered simplification σ t σ t 1 is only true 70 of the times which probably biases the estimation relaxing this hypothesis would be theoretically possible but the estimation would be a burden 4 the use of a latent gaussian process which is radially symmetric this means that in the case of a gaussian process g with zero mean and covariance matrix σ and for any vector u u 1 u n 0 1 n we have p g 1 φ 1 u 1 g n φ 1 u n p g 1 φ 1 1 u 1 g n φ 1 1 u n this last point is empirically illustrated in fig 14 for u k p j 0 x k in sub set j corresponding to the high risk season and gt1 which is the sub set containing the most stations x k x l with p j 0 0 5 for each pair of stations the joint empirical probability of non exceedance nep kl p y x k 0 y x l 0 and exceedance ep kl p y x k h y j x k 1 1 p j 0 x k y x l h y j x l 1 1 p j 0 x l are computed fig 14 represents the differences ep ij nep ij for the model ar1 p expi versus the observations for the observations ep nep is mostly positive and depends on the pair of stations this means that the bivariate cdf of precipitation is mainly right skewed and the asymmetry is spatially non stationary on the contrary for the simulations ep nep is constant around zero which is prescribed by the gaussian process in order to introduce asymmetry other spatial dependence structure can be considered for instance the chi square copula introduced by bàrdossy 2006 and recently explored by quessy et al 2016 allows to prescribe the asymmetry favre et al 2018 have proposed a generalisation of this copula allowing for upper tail dependence however their use in a spatial rather than multivariate context poses some difficulties in particular with regards to the estimation of the correlation function cf nelsen 2007 joe 2014 for more details exploring the added value of different copulas prescribing asymmetry would be relevant concerning the estimation of the spatio temporal dependence simplifications have been made to the mar 1 the first simplification states that the temporal correlation is constant over the region in principle a k l s can vary in space but this complicates the estimation procedure first if the matrix a t t 1 has different coefficients on its diagonal the matrix id n a t t 1 2 σ j t is not symmetrical thus additional constraints on the a k l s have to be set to make the matrix id n a t t 1 2 σ j t symmetric this can be easily done for 41 stations but it is not realistic for high resolution fields due to computational time and numerical problems second in the view of generating rain fields with spatially varying a these parameters have to be mapped similarly to the marginal parameters blanchet et al 2019 however spatial patterns are not obvious for all transitions not shown and a tricky interpolation is avoided by taking it to be spatially uniform to summarize the use of diagonal matrix a t t 1 reproduces only the lag 0 spatial correlation and lag 1 autocorrelation this modelling choice does not reproduce the rain fields advection or movement which may be necessary for hourly data but is less important for daily data and is omitted here for computational reasons the second simplification is to consider separately the temporal and the spatial dependence spatio temporal correlation function can be used to simultaneously estimate both dependencies cf cressie and wikle 2011 bourotte et al 2016 for example however in that case the use of a censored likelihood is not realistic most of the times a pairwise composite likelihood or a method of moment is used e g baxevani and lennartson 2015 bourotte et al 2016 concerning the weather pattern based sub sampling instead of using synoptic wt a direct clustering of days with similar spatial correlation could improve the model performance a solution would be to cluster days based not only on synoptic variables but also including indices of the spatial variability of rainfall the rainfall variability can be assessed through indicators such as the number of wet stations where the rainfalls are located on the foothills the ridge or the plateau or the rain field orientation a methodology inspired from studies conducted over radar data could be adapted in our case e g benoit et al 2018 an additional model deserves to be added to simulate long wt sequences instead of repeating the observed 40 year sequences as it is done in the article for hydrological applications it should be able to model the correct frequency of occurrence of each gt within each month of the year and also the correct distribution of wt spells a first order markov with covariates accounting for monthly variations of gts occurrence may be a relevant option to achieve this last but not least considering the relatively small size and the strong orographic orientation of our study catchment there is no evidence of non stationary spatial dependence however if larger domains are considered non stationarity can be suspected in the spatial dependence many ways are possible to introduce non stationarity cf risser 2015 for a review a promising way for mountain catchments with complex topography e g in the alps would be to use a non stationary covariance function paciorek and schervish 2006 give a formulation for a gaussian process allowing to derive a non stationary

for each day t a vector e t e t x with its associated censoring interval is obtained table 3 gives the percentage of each censoring cases that are encountered when ρ j is estimated from t c gives the total percentage of censored cases nc regroups all uncensored cases where it rains everywhere at t and t 1 the main information here is that more than 41 of the t x are in the case 1b corresponding to successive dry days which does not contribute to the likelihood of ρ j the fraction of censored c and uncensored nc stations are also given when ρ j is estimated from g t appendix d supplementary data
