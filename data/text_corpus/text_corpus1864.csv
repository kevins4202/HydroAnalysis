9320,accurate estimation of evapotranspiration et is essential for understanding terrestrial energy water and carbon cycles this study proposes a hybrid model integrating in situ and remote sensing derived soil moisture sm observations and remote sensing leaf area index lai with the noah mp model the ensemble kalman filter enkf approach updates the leaf biomass and specific leaf area sla by assimilating the remotely sensed lai a machine learning ml surrogate model is used to integrate multi site sm profile observations and remote sensing sm products to estimate the three layer sm an iterative coupling of two parts implements the hybrid model optimization of leaf biomass and sla by assimilation of lai in the noah mp model and simulation of three layer sm in the ml surrogate model the performance of the hybrid model is evaluated in the heihe river basin hrb in northwest china the estimated et from the hybrid model is compared with observations from the large aperture scintillometer las at the arou daman and sidaoqiao sites and up scaled watershed et over the hrb the findings indicate that the hybrid model performs well in vegetated areas but underestimates et in extreme arid deserts the three site unbiased root mean squared errors ubrmses of et estimates from the hybrid model are 29 06 42 76 and 50 00 lower than noah mp at the arou daman and sidaoqiao sites respectively the coupling of data assimilation da and ml methods can improve vegetation dynamics and sm transport estimation in the noah mp model the hybrid model can take advantage of da and ml methods and integrate multi source observations to improve the accuracy of et estimation the results also indicate that the et predictions are more sensitive to root zone sm 0 40 cm over croplands grasslands and shrublands while the et simulations are more affected by deeper rooting depths sm 0 100 cm and groundwater over forests keywords hybrid model multi source observations ensemble kalman filter method machine learning method heihe river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is the water vapor flux evaporated from the land surface to the atmosphere fisher et al 2017 zhang et al 2020a accurate estimates of et are required to understand agricultural water management and utilization surface biophysical processes and hydrological cycles fisher et al 2008 zhao et al 2021 in recent years various physical models have been proposed that use meteorological forcing data and land surface variables to estimate et jung et al 2011 martens et al 2017 state of the art physical models e g remote sensing based methods land surface models climate models etc have become fundamental tools for estimating et on regional and global scales kustas and norman 1997 ma et al 2018 niu et al 2011 song et al 2018 xu et al 2019a yang et al 2011 among these models model variables such as leaf area index lai and soil moisture sm are important determinants of energy partitioning and biogeographical vegetation patterns lai is a critical parameter in vegetation dynamics models and controls water energy carbon fluxes on the land surface chen et al 2020 cowling and field 2003 kumar et al 2019 increased lai accelerates water uptake by vegetation roots leading to increased transpiration alfieri et al 2009 kumar et al 2019 sm directly affects soil evaporation and controls stomatal resistance to regulate plant transpiration and photosynthesis yuan et al 2007 therefore sm variations can affect land surface energy and water transport and strongly influence the partitioning of the available energy gentine et al 2011 2012 mladenova et al 2017 zhang et al 2020a effective lai and sm information are essential in oasis irrigated agriculture to avoid waste of water energy and human inputs zhang et al 2020b however the uncertainty of meteorological forcing data model structure and parameters inevitably affect the physical model simulation results thus multi source observations need to be used to optimize the physical processes and key variables that regulate et li et al 2007 2020a xia et al 2019 xu et al 2011 data assimilation da methods merge observations with physical models to retrieve the model state variables state assimilation and parameters parameter inference ultimately improving model prediction accuracy bateni and entekhabi 2012 evensen 2009 li et al 2007 2020a lu et al 2012 2015 xia et al 2019 the land data assimilation system ldas can effectively combine information from land surface models lsms with observations and is a promising technique for improving lsm based estimates of water and energy fluxes huang et al 2008 sawada et al 2015 yang et al 2020 zhao et al 2016 zhao and yang 2018 numerous studies have assimilated remotely sensed lai sm and land surface temperature lst observations into lsms to optimize the model state variables and parameters ultimately estimating water and energy fluxes bateni et al 2014 he et al 2018 2019 2020 huang et al 2008 kumar et al 2019 li et al 2018a ling et al 2019 xie et al 2017 the assimilation of lai improves the estimation of leaf biomass gross primary production and et he et al 2021 kumar et al 2019 xu et al 2021 the assimilation of remote sensing sm retrieval improves the estimation of runoff and et and performs better in dynamic model initialization prediction of atmospheric state variables and extreme events hain et al 2012 han et al 2012 lu et al 2019 seo et al 2021 tian et al 2017 however the da method is limited by the observation data the model variables and parameters cannot be updated when sm observations are missing i e cloud covered areas or unobservable i e deep layer sm he et al 2020 lu et al 2019 salcedo sanz et al 2020 in addition in situ sm measurements are rarely utilized in lsms over regional applications because of their sparse distribution across spaces recently with the successful development of machine learning ml technology it has become possible to use various observations in situ and remote sensing to improve the performance of lsms ml is a data driven method that attempts to learn the relationship between input features and outputs reichstein et al 2019 salcedo sanz et al 2020 yuan et al 2020 compared with da methods ml techniques can accurately capture the nonlinear and complex relationships between the dependent variable and predictors brajard et al 2020 numerous studies have used ml methods based on land surface observations to estimate water and energy variables at regional and global scales jung et al 2011 2020 xu et al 2018 yuan et al 2020 the combination of physical models and ml methods in hybrid models can provide new opportunities for the development of lsms reichstein et al 2019 in most cases ml training leverages in situ observations and or high resolution simulations to replace part or all of the physical models bocquet et al 2020 brajard et al 2020 gentine et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 in addition ml methods are used for model error correction parameterization and uncertainty estimation he et al 2020 jia et al 2020 willard et al 2020 xu et al 2014 yang et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 despite these efforts ml methods were typically combined with simple physical models therefore integrating multi source sm observations into da systems with ml methods is essential to improve regional sm and et estimates a wide variety of approaches have been proposed that use remotely sensed data for the retrieval of et in the hrb hu and jia 2015 ma et al 2018 song et al 2018 xu et al 2019a these studies have mainly focused on the estimation of et based on the statistical and or empirical methods remote sensing models i e surface energy balance equation penman monteith equation and priestley taylor equation and data assimilation approach i e variational data assimilation method hu and jia 2015 ma et al 2018 song et al 2018 tang et al 2010 xu et al 2018 2019a the extensive et research and rich observations conducted in the hrb make it a promising testbed for algorithm development and model evaluation this study proposes a hybrid

lai and update the state variable e g leaf biomass and parameter e g specific leaf area sla in the noah mp the ml based sm surrogate model integrating in situ sm profile observations and remotely sensed sm products is coupled to the noah mp model to estimate the three layer sm the coupling of the da and ml methods is beneficial for optimizing vegetation dynamics and sm transport in lsms the hybrid model is evaluated over the heihe river basin hrb in northwest china the et estimates from the hybrid model are compared with the large aperture scintillometer las and up scaled watershed et in the hrb moreover several tests are performed to assess the effect of vegetation dynamics and three layer sm on et estimates the objectives of our study are to 1 estimate et by integrating remotely

5 concluded the results and discussions 2 methodology 2 1 land surface model the noah mp model provides a multi parameterization framework and expands the noah lsm functions by combining physical capabilities niu et al 2011 yang et al 2011 the physical enhancements in noah mp include 1 an interactive vegetation canopy dickinson et al 1998 2 a short term dynamic vegetation growth model to simulate the carbon budget dickinson et al 1998 3 an unconfined aquifer for groundwater storage with a dynamic water table niu et al 2007 4 a multilayer snowpack yang and niu 2003 and 5 a simple groundwater module with a topmodel based runoff scheme niu et al 2005 2007 noah mp combines a stomatal resistance scheme based on the ball berry model ball et al 1987 with vegetation dynamics dickinson et al 1998 the noah mp model simulates vegetation carbon storage and allocates it to leaves stems wood and roots and is widely used at regional and global scales cai et al 2014a 2014b xia et al 2017 you et al 2020 zheng et al 2014 2015a 2015b in this study the dynamic crop growth model was selected in noah mp to estimate crop dynamics more accurately liu et al 2016b zhang et al 2020b

carbohydrates to different crop components e g leaf stem grain and root mass growing degree days gdd are utilized in crop models to characterize plant growth stages in addition numerous agricultural management data e g planting and harvesting dates are used to constrain crop models the dynamic crop growth model simulates the evolution of vegetation biomass which affects gross primary productivity sm and latent heat fluxes le kumar et al 2019 liu et al 2016b xu et al 2019b 2 2 data assimilation method the ensemble kalman filter enkf algorithm evensen 1994 2003 has been applied extensively in many sequential da studies koster et al 2018 reichle et al 2002 xu et al 2011 yang et al 2007 it calculates the state prediction error covariance based on the monte carlo method this study assimilates remotely sensed lai to update model state variable leaf biomass and parameter sla using the enkf da system let us call x the state vector leaf biomass and sla the state vector ensemble members can be propagated forward via 1 x j n f f x j n 1 f f n α n μ j where x j n 1 f and x j n f are the forecast state denoted by superscript f variables of the jth replicate at times n 1 and n respectively the forward model noah mp is designated by f f n and α n are the model input data and parameters at time n where μ j represents model error with a zero mean and specified variance the observation operator links observations to the state 2 y j n f h x j n f η j where y j n f is the model predicted lai h represents the observation operator between state vectors and the observations in this study the relationship between lai and leaf biomass lfmass lai sla lfmass is described as the observation operator η j is the observation error with a mean of zero and a covariance of r of the jth member the state variable of each ensemble member is then updated by 3 x j n a x j n f k y n o y j n f where x j n a is the analysis state denoted by superscript a variables of the jth replicate at time n y n o is the lai observation at time n and k is the kalman gain matrix which is defined as 4 k p x y p y y r 1 5 p x y 1 n e 1 j 1 n e x j n f x n f h x j n 1 f x n f t 6 p y y 1 n e 1 j 1 n e h x j n f x n f h x j n f x n f t where p xy is the estimated error covariance matrix between the model states and the observations and p yy is the estimated covariance of the observations t represents the transpose matrix and n e is the number of ensembles according to reichle et al 2002 seo et al 2021 and zhao et al 2016 40 ensemble members were used to ensure an accurate approximation of the error covariances while maintaining computational efficiency the model ensembles are perturbed by adding normally distributed random errors zero mean and specified variance to model states and parameters to characterize the error term this study applies additive perturbations with a standard deviation of 10 g m 2 to the modeled leaf biomass kumar et al 2019 the standard deviation of the sla is set to 10 of the value of the a priori parameter xu et al 2021 a standard deviation of 0 1 m2 m 2 is used for remotely sensed lai kumar et al 2019 these standard deviation values are comparable to those used in the previous lai da studies kumar et al 2019 ling et al 2019 rahman et al 2022 2 3 machine learning method six ml algorithms including artificial neural network ann long short term memory lstm gate recurrent unit gru deep belief network dbn random forest rf and extreme gradient boosting xgboost are utilized to construct the sm surrogate model sm is the target variable in the ml method and variables that affect sm variations are used as explanatory variables the ml method trains the model by establishing relationships between explanatory and target variables an ann is a mathematical model that simulates the interconnected neuron network structure of the human brain it includes input hidden and output layers maier and dandy 2000 each layer contains several artificial neurons and the layers are fully connected ann can extract nonlinear feature relationships from large datasets abrahart and see 2007 which is impossible with traditional linear models such as multivariable linear regression models lstm networks capture temporal covariability in time series and have an excellent ability to preserve time series information graves 2012 hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 tai et al 2015 xiang et al 2020 the lstm unit is composed of cells input gates output gates and forget gates to avoid the vanishing gradients typically experienced in recurrent neural networks the unit remembers values in the time series and the three gates control the flow of information in and out of each unit lstm networks are well suited for time series data processing modeling and forecasting because time series data often have temporal information correlations the gru is an improvement over lstm and has an optimized network structure while maintaining the performance of lstm cho et al 2014 li et al 2020c the gru network has only two gate structures an update gate and a reset gate these two gates control bringing in and ignoring information from the previous moment the gru network can solve the training and prediction problems of long interval and long delay time series compared with the lstm unit the gru unit performs better in central processing unit time convergence parameter updates and generalization gruber et al 2020 a dbn was proposed by hinton et al 2006 by building a ml model with multiple hidden layers and a large amount of training data the dbn can learn more useful functions and generate more accurate predictions the dbn consists of a multi layer restricted boltzmann machine rbm and a supervised back propagation bp network layer the weights and biases of the rbm are initialized through a greedy layer by layer unsupervised training and then these weights and bias values are passed through the bp the algorithm is fine tuned to make the model converge to the best value in recent years dbn has been widely used in image processing fields such as speech handwritten font traffic signs and facial recognition lin and fan 2011 savich et al 2011 the rf algorithm is based on the two randomization ideas of bagging and selection of features boulesteix et al 2012 breiman 2001 liaw and wiener 2002 the bagging idea allows the rf to train decision trees and out of bag error estimates in parallel in addition the rf algorithm also has the advantages of preventing overfitting and having better tolerance to outliers xgboost works based on the tree learning algorithm chen and guestrin 2016 torlay et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 the tree learning algorithm does not require linear features or interactions between features therefore it tends to have a better classification function xgboost combines a weak base learning model with a more powerful learner which can be used for regression and classification problems in addition xgboost is a gradient enhancement method it is a new distributed algorithm for tree searching and accelerates the speed of tree construction compared to rf xgboost adds a regularization function to the loss function to improve its performance in this study the normalized soil texture st land cover type lc air temperature t a wind speed u precipitation p relative humidity rh incoming shortwave radiation r s lai and multi source sm observations are used to train and test the ml model 7 s m o b s m l s t l c t a u p r h r s l a i where ml is the machine learning method and smobs is the three layer in situ sm observations and surface layer remote sensing observations st lc t a u p rh r s and lai are the explanatory variables these variables are consistent with the meteorological forcing data of noah mp which is conducive to da and the iterative operation of ml methods the three layer sm observations and explanatory variables are trained separately to construct the ml model the first layer 0 10 cm in situ sm observations and remote sensing sm products are trained to construct the first layer ml model the in situ sm observations in the second 10 40 cm and third 40 100 cm layers are used to train and construct the root zone ml models respectively the global k fold k is set to 10 testing approach is used to evaluate the performance of the ml method in this study sm data is divided into k parts k 1 parts are used for training the ml method and the remaining parts are used as the validation data the cross validation process was repeated k times all the datasets should be trained and validated and the results of the evaluation index were then averaged as the assessing results the k fold testing approach has been widely used to test and optimize several ml methods martí et al 2015 shiri et al 2015 different hyperparameter values are tested to select the optimal parameters to develop the studied ann lstm gru dbn rf and xgboost models for ann and dbn models the multilayer perceptron with three hidden layers and a rectified linear unit activation function was used as it works well for this data set the learning rate and batch size were set to be 0 01 and 72 respectively also the iteration was set to be 500 for lstm and gru models adam optimizer and mean absolute error mae loss function were implemented with a learning rate of 0 01 and batch size of 72 for rf and xgboost models the estimator was set to be 1000 and the maximum depth and learning rate were 10 and 0 01 respectively in general ml models are selected based on the availability of data and their ability to solve the target problem each model has various benefits and drawbacks due to its different structural design however the final behavior of the ml model depends not only on its structural design but also on the training data and the problem being solved abed et al 2021 2 4 hybrid model this study hybridizes the da and ml methods into the physical model noah mp to estimate et the hybrid model is composed of two parts in the first part the enkf method is applied to optimize the state variable leaf biomass and parameter sla in noah mp the second part runs the sm surrogate model based on the ml method to estimate the three layer sm 0 10 cm 10 40 cm and 40 100 cm finally the hybrid model is generated through the iterative coupling of parts one and two through this coupling lai estimates from the enkf method are used in the ml model to estimate sm and sm estimates from the ml model are utilized in the noah mp model to estimate lai and et such coupling makes the da and ml models operate dynamically and consistently the daily optimized lai and estimated sm values are integrated into the noah mp model at 00 00 local time by updating the leaf biomass and three layer sm initialization the optimized sla is directly used in the table file a flowchart of the hybrid model is presented in fig 1 based on the enkf method remotely sensed lai data are assimilated into the noah mp model the assimilation of lai data can effectively control leaf biomass and retrieve lai dynamics more details on the enkf scheme are presented in section 2 2 the in situ sm measurements averaged to 0 10 cm 10 40 cm and 40 100 cm and surface layer remotely sensed sm 0 5 cm are replicated using the sm surrogate model to estimate the three layer sm 0 10 cm 10 40 cm and 40 100 cm based on the optimized ml algorithm more details about the six ml methods are described in section 2 3 the hybrid model simulations are conducted for five months may 1 to september 30 doy 121 273 covering the growing season in 2015 the noah mp model was fully spun up from may 1 2000 to april 30 2015 i e 15 year spin up in this study five numerical tests are conducted to evaluate the effect of lai and three layer sm

the ecological and hydrological wireless sensor network ehwsn in the babao river basin brb and the cosmic ray soil moisture observing system cosmos at the daman site https data tpdc ac cn en the ehwsn the covered area is 2495 km2 is located upstream of the hrb and is mainly covered by grassland fig 2 there are 40 nodes in this network and sm is observed at a depth of 4 10 and 20 cm jin et al 2014 kang et al 2017 the cosmos is located at daman and it can measure the regional sm by counting fast neutrons produced by secondary cosmic ray particles in the soil zreda et al 2008 compared to a single sm node the cosmos can be used to measure area average sm at the hectometer horizontal scale in this study sm observations from ehwsn in the brb and cosmos at the daman site are used as an independent validation to evaluate the sm estimates from the hybrid model half hourly le et measurements are obtained from the las instrument at the arou daman and sidaoqiao sites fig 2 the path lengths of the las are about 1000 3000 m and the area of sensible heat fluxes h can be obtained directly based on the monin obukhov similarity theory the observation of le is calculated using the residual method of the energy balance equation le rn g0 h the four component radiometer measures the net radiation rn and the surface heat flux g0 is obtained by the soil heat flux plates and soil temperature and moisture profiles liu et al 2016a therefore there will be no energy balance closure problem for las observations and the energy balance closure value is 100 allen et al 2011 more detailed information

et al 2016 land cover and soil texture products are used directly in the noah mp model and can be downloaded from the national tibetan plateau data center tpdc https data tpdc ac cn en 4 results and discussions 4 1 the assimilation of lai observations this study assimilates calibrated glass lai data into the noah mp model validation studies show that the glass lai values are much lower than the landsat lai estimates during the growing season in croplands fang et al 2019 ma et al 2017 the higlass lai regional values are averaged for cropland grassland shrubland and forest to calibrate the glass lai values the glass lai values are compared with the higlass lai for the four vegetation types in fig 3 as shown the glass product underestimated the lai in the hrb therefore the glass lai data are calibrated using the higlass lai values in this study the glass lai values are calibrated against the higlass lai values using a logarithmic based regression equation y 3 55 ln x 1 for cropland y 3 04 ln x 1 for grassland y 3 37 ln x 1 for shrubland and y 3 23 ln x 1 for forest with this calibration the r2 values between the calibrated glass and higlass lai are 0 56 0 52 0 65 and 0 45 for cropland grassland shrubland and forest respectively the sample size is 106 and the confidence interval is 95 5 significance level a slight discrepancy is observed between the calibrated glass and higlass lai this happens because of the different data sources i e modis and landsat reflectance datasets and algorithms i e grnn and rf methods from the glass and higlass products jin et al 2019 xiao et al 2014 fig 4 compares the monthly mean lai estimates from noah mp hybrid model and calibrated glass lai over the hrb in 2015 compared to the hybrid model noah mp underestimated lai during the growing season especially in the vegetated areas of the upstream and midstream of the hrb this is primarily due to the inaccurate parameter settings such as the clapp hornberger b parameter saturated sm value maximum rate of carboxylation at 25 c accumulated growing degree days and planting and harvesting dates arsenault et al 2018 cuntz et al 2016 levis et al 2012 li et al 2020b liu et al 2016b zhang et al 2020b the assimilation of calibrated glass lai into the noah mp model improved leaf biomass and sla estimates increased lai during the growing season and moved them toward their true values the largest increase in lai is seen during the summer june august the bias of lai estimates from hybrid model is 0 17 m2 m 2 which is significantly lower than the bias of 0 98 m2 m 2 from noah mp overall the lai estimates from the hybrid model can capture both the spatial and temporal variations of the calibrated glass lai 4 2 the integration of soil moisture observations this study involved six widely used ml methods namely lstm gru ann dbn rf and xgboost to estimate sm in each soil layer layer 1 0 10 cm layer 2 10 40 cm layer 3 40 100 cm daily sm profile observations at 19 awss and smap sm products as the first layer of sm data are used to train and test the ml model fig 5 shows the first layer sm ten fold testing results of the six ml methods the predicted daily first layer sm from all six ml methods agreed well with the sm observations and they are scattered mainly around the 1 1 line the lstm gru ann and dbn methods performed almost identical the xgboost method had lower rmse 0 051 m3 m 3 and mape 16 85 and slightly higher r2 0 84 than lstm gru ann dbn and rf the relatively low rmse and mape values indicate that the xgboost method can estimate the first layer sm accurately over the hrb the statistical boxplots of r2 rmse and mape from the six ml methods are shown in fig 6 the statistical indices r2 rmse and mape from each layer of sm are calculated using ten fold testing results the boxplots present the uncertainty ranges by seven statistics i e the minimum 5th percentile 1st quartile median 3rd quartile 95th percentile and the maximum of the ten fold testing experiments among these methods the rmses and mapes of the first and second layer sm retrievals are smaller than those of the third layer this is because the surface layer sm 0 40 cm is mainly affected by atmospheric state variables i e precipitation radiation and air temperature and land surface conditions i e vegetation cover and soil texture however the deep layer sm 40 100 cm is regulated by underground conditions i e soil particle composition groundwater table and vegetation root distribution fang et al 2016 liu et al 2020 the statistical evaluation metrics i e r2 rmse and mape of the three layer sm estimates from the six ml methods are listed in table 2 the three layer average rmse mape of the sm estimates from xgboost is 0 040 m3 m 3 13 88 which is 6 98 9 34 lower than the rmse mape of 0 043 m3 m 3 15 31 from rf the lower rmse and mae values from the xgboost method indicate that it can estimate the three layer sm more accurately the relative importance of the predictors for the three layer sm in the xgboost method is shown in fig a1 shapley additive explanations shap values are used as feature importance values to evaluate the importance of the input variables of the xgboost method lundberg and lee 2017 surface layer sm estimates from lai have the highest importance while predicting sm at 0 10 cm depth this is followed by lc t a rh r s and u features p and st features have the lowest importance among the predictors the results also indicate that the importance of meteorological features decreases in deep layer sm prediction as shown in fig 7 simulated sm from the noah mp model is remarkably lower than observations during the growing season at daman in addition the noah mp model slightly underestimated sm in the brb this is because the impact of the irrigation scheme is neglected in the noah mp model tian et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 2020b also the noah mp model did not consider the effect of the specific characteristics of alpine meadows such as the existence of dense roots and high soil organic carbon content chen et al 2012 sun et al 2021 yang et al 2009 zheng et al 2015b meanwhile coarse resolution precipitation forcing is underestimated in mountainous areas jiang et al 2021 in contrast the sm predictions from the hybrid model are closer to the measurements than those from noah mp this indicates that the developed hybrid model can exploit the information contained in sm profile observations and smap sm in general multi source sm observations should be integrated into the noah mp model to capture the spatial and temporal variations of sm the spatial distribution of the first layer sm estimates from the noah mp first row and hybrid model second row over the hrb are shown in fig 8 the noah mp model can capture the patterns of sm compared to the hybrid model noah mp underestimates sm in the north and south areas of hrb the hybrid model improves noah mp sm estimates by increasing them in the hrb in addition the spatial patterns of the estimated sm from the hybrid model are consistent with the characteristics of precipitation vegetation cover irrigation events and shallow groundwater table xu et al 2020 sm estimates are higher upstream of hrb due to more precipitation approximately 500 mm in the mountainous areas but they lower downstream because of low precipitation approximately 50 mm sm estimates are also higher in the midstream oasis than downstream due to irrigation approximately 500 mm over the hrb zeng et al 2017 sm values are higher downstream of the hrb due to the shallow groundwater table along the riparian forest xu et al 2020 it is worth mentioning that the uncertainties of sm estimation of mls are affected by the heterogeneity of land surface hydrothermal conditions this is because point scale sm measurements at the 19 awss with heterogeneous land surfaces cannot accurately represent reality and deteriorate the accuracy of the sm surrogate model kang et al 2018 meanwhile uncertainties from the input data and ml methods can affect the estimation of sm xu et al 2018 4 3 estimation of evapotranspiration the time series of the observed and estimated daily et values from the noah mp and hybrid model at the arou daman and sidaoqiao sites are shown in fig 9 et estimates from the noah mp model are remarkably lower than those from the las measurements during the growing season at the arou daman and sidaoqiao sites this is because of the underestimated sm see figs 7 and 8 arou daman and sidaoqiao sites and lai see fig 4 arou and daman sites values from noah mp during july september in 2015 the noah mp model does not consider the effect of dense roots and high soil organic carbon content of alpine meadows arou on et chen et al 2012 sun et al 2021 yang et al 2009 zheng et al 2015b also the impact of irrigation events daman and groundwater table sidaoqiao have not been fully considered in the noah mp model tian et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 2020b at the beginning of the growing season the average groundwater table at the sidaoqiao site is 0 91 m and at the end of the growing season is 2 55 m xu et al 2020 the irrigation scheme in the midstream and the shallow groundwater level in the downstream can affect the sm transport process in contrast the et predictions from the hybrid model are closer to the measurements than those from noah mp this indicates that the developed hybrid model can exploit the lai and three layer sm time series information to ameliorate et estimates fig 9 shows that the outcomes of the hybrid model slightly underestimated et at the daman site mainly because the hybrid model underestimated sm from july to september at the arou daman and sidaoqiao sites et showed a rising trend in the vegetation growing period doys 121 180 and reached its maximum in the middle of july approximately doy 200 after that it decreased as the vegetation senesced table 3 shows the statistical metrics r2 rmse ubrmse and mape of daily et predictions from the noah mp and hybrid model the three site average ubrmse and mape of daily et predictions by noah mp are 1 50 mm day 1 and 71 96 the hybrid model decreased the ubrmse and mape by 42 00 and 55 29 respectively the relatively low ubrmse and mape values indicated that the hybrid model could accurately estimate et over different sites under contrasting environmental conditions although the hybrid model significantly improves the simulation accuracy of et there is still uncertainty in the estimated et the first uncertainty comes from the training data sets the hybrid model is appropriate for regions with abundant in situ observations the ml models build non linear relationships between various input and target variables from a large number of high quality training samples this study used sm data from 19 awss and smap over the hrb to train and verify the hybrid model if the model is applied under extreme weather and future climate scenarios the performance of the hybrid model will decrease as the number of training samples decreases in addition the performance of the hybrid model is related to the heterogeneity of the land surface and the complexity of the hydrological processes as shown in table 3 the rmse and ubrmse of et estimates at sidaoqiao site are higher than that of arou and daman sites this is because the spatial heterogeneity of land surface hydrothermal conditions at the sidaoqiao site was higher than that of arou and daman sites throughout the growing season zhang et al 2020 this higher land surface heterogeneity can affect the training accuracy of the ml method and further affect the performance of the hybrid model at the same time the complexity of the hydrological processes i e shallow groundwater table at sidaoqiao site can lead to increased uncertainty of the ml model this shows that uncertainties in the ml based sm surrogate model negatively and considerably affect et retrieval the three site averaged statistical indices of daily et estimates from the hybrid model are also compared with dtd et monitor hitll and etmap in table 4 as shown the accuracy of et retrievals from the hybrid model are comparable to those of previous studies in the hrb e g hu and jia 2015 ma et al 2018 song et al 2018 xu et al 2018 also etmap and hitll have higher accuracy and are used as reference data in fig 10 the second hybrid model uncertainty is related to the performance of the noah mp model the misfits between the model estimates and observations are primarily because of the inaccurate model parameters simplistic physical assumptions and uncertainties in the meteorological forcing the estimation of et in the noah mp model is sensitive to sm and vegetation dynamics especially in semi arid regions therefore the hybrid model will produce more improvements in dry and sparse vegetated conditions e g daman and sidaoqiao sites compared to the noah mp model the hybrid model generates less improvement in wet and densely vegetated conditions than the noah mp model e g arou site this is because et is mainly affected by the atmospheric state variables i e air temperature specific humidity solar radiation and wind speed in general the improvement of the hybrid model is reduced when the noah mp model is simulated better fig 10 shows the monthly mean et maps from the noah mp first row and hybrid model second row approaches as well as the etmap third row over the hrb during the modeling period may september the spatial patterns of et retrievals from noah mp are highest upstream of the hrb in the south due to higher precipitation and dense vegetation cover but decrease over midstream and downstream of the hrb because of low precipitation and sparse vegetation however et in the artificial oasis in the midstream and the natural oasis in the downstream are affected by irrigation and the groundwater table respectively therefore the et estimates from the noah mp model are seriously underestimating et in the midstream and downstream areas of the hrb the underestimation of et based on the noah mp model has also been reported in previous studies brunsell et al 2020 gan et al 2019 liang et al 2019 the hybrid model improved the et estimates from the noah mp model and patterns in the et estimates can capture those of irrigation and the groundwater table more robustly significantly higher et values are apparent in the oases of the mid and downstream regions with annual et decreasing sharply along a gradient from south to north i e upstream to downstream in general et increases during the vegetation growing period may july with the increase in precipitation and lai and then decreases in the fall august september with the decrease in precipitation and lai in addition the performance of the et estimates from the hybrid model is also compared with etmap third row the variations of et estimates from the hybrid model are consistent with the etmap especially in areas with higher precipitation and denser vegetation cover it is worth noting that et values from the hybrid model are lower than etmap in extreme arid deserts this is probably because the vigorous root systems of desert plants can absorb deep sm and groundwater li et al 2017 this mechanism is not fully considered in the noah mp model the et values from the hybrid model are compared with hitll in the desert fourth row the results also found that et values from the hybrid model are lower than hitll in the desert the spatial distribution of r2 rmse and mape differences of et estimates between the hybrid model and noah mp hybrid model minus the noah mp are shown in fig 11 first row the etmap is used as the reference value for statistical indices the optimized lai and sm positively impact the et estimates with the r2 rmse increasing decreasing in most parts of the hrb especially over grassland cropland forest and shrubland statistical results for cropland grassland forest shrubland and barren land are also shown in fig 11 second row and table 5 the mean of the rmse mape of et estimates from the noah mp model for the five land cover types are 1 54 mm day 1 58 20 the hybrid model decreased the rmse mape by 42 21 34 24 the relatively low rmse and mape values show that the hybrid model accurately estimates et over different land cover types the mean seasonal cycle of et estimates from the noah mp model hybrid model and etmap for the five land cover types during the growing season may september are shown in fig 12 the noah mp model underestimated et over cropland grassland shrubland and forest still the performance of the noah mp model is improved when the da and ml methods are integrated the et values in the hybrid model agreed better with etmap over cropland grassland shrubland and forest compared to the noah mp model the hybrid model has very limited improvement in et estimation on barren land the magnitude of et is larger over cropland and forest than over grassland and shrubland over croplands the noah mp model et simulation has a peak advance compared to the hybrid model according to the results of etmap et peaked in july and august while the noah mp model showed that it peaked in june as mentioned above this is probably due to the misrepresentation of vegetation growth in cropland the hybrid model assimilating lai increased et in late summer and is consistent with etmap in the other three vegetation categories the seasonal dynamics of et are more in phase indicating that natural vegetation growth is the main factor determining et it can be noted that the overall effect of the hybrid model is to increase the et relative to noah mp especially in may several numerical tests are conducted to evaluate the eﬀect of vegetation dynamics and three layer sm estimates separately in test 1 the noah mp model was run alone in test 2 the lai data are assimilated into the noah mp model in test 3 to test 5 based on da the first to third layers of sm are coupled to the noah mp model to test the influence of different layers of sm on et estimation in test 6 the da method and the three layer sm surrogate model estimate et the daily et estimates r2 rmse and mape for the five land cover types from test 1 to test 6 are shown in fig 13 the rmses and mapes of et retrievals from test 2 are smaller than those of test 1 implying that test 2 took advantage of the information in the lai time series assimilation to improve the et estimates under different hydrological and vegetative conditions the optimized first and second layer sm test 3 and test 4 significantly improved the et estimates over cropland grassland shrubland and forest indicating that sequences of the first and second layer sm are vital for et retrievals in addition the et retrievals over forests are more affected by the first to third layer sm test 5 this is because the deeper roots of the forest can uptake deep sm and groundwater leading to a larger et liu et al 2020 xu et al 2019b zheng et al 2015b this shows that assimilation of deep layer sm is necessary to improve et over forests overall in cropland grassland and shrubland sm optimization at a 0 40 cm depth is more effective for et estimation improvement in forests sm optimization at a 0 100 cm depth is more effective for et estimation improvement soil evaporation vegetation transpiration and canopy interception evaporation estimates from six experimental tests are conducted to examine the influence of vegetation dynamics and three layer sm estimates in fig 14 as indicated except for barren land the assimilation of lai test 1 led to increased vegetation transpiration and canopy interception especially over cropland this is because an increase in lai leads to increased canopy coverage decreased net surface radiation and reduced soil evaporation in addition an increase in lai led to increased transpiration and decreased sm of the root zone due to water uptake in the root zone kumar et al 2019 similarly the optimized first to third layer sm test 2 to test 4 increased soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration this is because increased sm wet soil provides conditions suitable for soil evaporation and vegetation uptake of soil water overall the results indicate that the assimilation of lai and optimized three layer sm improved the estimation of et and are closest to etmap red box 5 conclusions in this study a hybrid model based on da and ml methods is proposed to improve the accuracy of et estimation in the land surface model the hybrid model relies on the da method to update the vegetation dynamics of the noah mp model and the ml method to construct a three layer sm surrogate model the da method ensemble kalman filter enkf is applied to optimize the state variable leaf biomass and parameter specific leaf area sla in noah mp to obtain accurate lai estimates the xgboost method integrates in situ sm profile observations and smap sm products to improve the three layer sm estimates the performance of the hybrid model is tested in the hrb located in northwest china and the main results are as follows 1 the hybrid model assimilated lai updated leaf biomass and sla and retrieved the optimal values of lai prediction enkf can capture both lai variations and is closer to the calibrated glass lai than noah mp the xgboost method can improve the sm estimates by integrating in situ sm profile observations and smap sm products the sm estimates from the hybrid model agree well with observations from the daman and brb the spatial patterns of the retrieved sm from the hybrid model consistently resemble the features of rainfall vegetation cover irrigation events and groundwater table 2 the simulated day to day fluctuations of et estimates from the hybrid model agree better with large aperture scintillometer las observations at the arou daman and sidaoqiao sites which reduced the three site average ubrmse of et from 1 50 mm day 1 of noah mp to 0 87 mm day 1 the et estimates from the hybrid model are consistent with the etmap variations especially in areas with higher precipitation and denser vegetation cover the mean rmse mape of et estimates from the noah mp for the five land cover types are 1 54 mm day 1 58 20 the hybrid model decreased the rmse mape by 42 21 34 24 it is worth noting that et values from the hybrid model are lower than etmap and hitll in extreme arid deserts this is probably because plants can uptake deep sm and groundwater in the desert and in the noah mp model these processes are often simplified 3 several tests are conducted to evaluate the effect of vegetation dynamics and three layer sm estimates the results indicate that the assimilation of lai leads to increased vegetation transpiration and canopy interception especially over cropland sm optimization at a depth of 0 40 cm is more effective for et estimation over cropland grassland and shrubland sm optimization at a 0 100 cm depth is more effective for et estimation over forests da and ml methods of hybridization can utilize multi source observations to improve model physical drawbacks the ultimate goal of the proposed hybrid model is to explore how ml can utilize multi source observations and benefit or replace existing sub processes of the da system for example the ml based sm surrogate model is used to replace the initial solution of sm in noah mp to improve the accuracy of et prediction upcoming studies should use multi source lai and sm data to apply the hybrid model over sparse observation domains future studies should focus on multi year simulations using the improved hybrid model improved et estimates from the hybrid model can improve the monitoring and

9320,accurate estimation of evapotranspiration et is essential for understanding terrestrial energy water and carbon cycles this study proposes a hybrid model integrating in situ and remote sensing derived soil moisture sm observations and remote sensing leaf area index lai with the noah mp model the ensemble kalman filter enkf approach updates the leaf biomass and specific leaf area sla by assimilating the remotely sensed lai a machine learning ml surrogate model is used to integrate multi site sm profile observations and remote sensing sm products to estimate the three layer sm an iterative coupling of two parts implements the hybrid model optimization of leaf biomass and sla by assimilation of lai in the noah mp model and simulation of three layer sm in the ml surrogate model the performance of the hybrid model is evaluated in the heihe river basin hrb in northwest china the estimated et from the hybrid model is compared with observations from the large aperture scintillometer las at the arou daman and sidaoqiao sites and up scaled watershed et over the hrb the findings indicate that the hybrid model performs well in vegetated areas but underestimates et in extreme arid deserts the three site unbiased root mean squared errors ubrmses of et estimates from the hybrid model are 29 06 42 76 and 50 00 lower than noah mp at the arou daman and sidaoqiao sites respectively the coupling of data assimilation da and ml methods can improve vegetation dynamics and sm transport estimation in the noah mp model the hybrid model can take advantage of da and ml methods and integrate multi source observations to improve the accuracy of et estimation the results also indicate that the et predictions are more sensitive to root zone sm 0 40 cm over croplands grasslands and shrublands while the et simulations are more affected by deeper rooting depths sm 0 100 cm and groundwater over forests keywords hybrid model multi source observations ensemble kalman filter method machine learning method heihe river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is the water vapor flux evaporated from the land surface to the atmosphere fisher et al 2017 zhang et al 2020a accurate estimates of et are required to understand agricultural water management and utilization surface biophysical processes and hydrological cycles fisher et al 2008 zhao et al 2021 in recent years various physical models have been proposed that use meteorological forcing data and land surface variables to estimate et jung et al 2011 martens et al 2017 state of the art physical models e g remote sensing based methods land surface models climate models etc have become fundamental tools for estimating et on regional and global scales kustas and norman 1997 ma et al 2018 niu et al 2011 song et al 2018 xu et al 2019a yang et al 2011 among these models model variables such as leaf area index lai and soil moisture sm are important determinants of energy partitioning and biogeographical vegetation patterns lai is a critical parameter in vegetation dynamics models and controls water energy carbon fluxes on the land surface chen et al 2020 cowling and field 2003 kumar et al 2019 increased lai accelerates water uptake by vegetation roots leading to increased transpiration alfieri et al 2009 kumar et al 2019 sm directly affects soil evaporation and controls stomatal resistance to regulate plant transpiration and photosynthesis yuan et al 2007 therefore sm variations can affect land surface energy and water transport and strongly influence the partitioning of the available energy gentine et al 2011 2012 mladenova et al 2017 zhang et al 2020a effective lai and sm information are essential in oasis irrigated agriculture to avoid waste of water energy and human inputs zhang et al 2020b however the uncertainty of meteorological forcing data model structure and parameters inevitably affect the physical model simulation results thus multi source observations need to be used to optimize the physical processes and key variables that regulate et li et al 2007 2020a xia et al 2019 xu et al 2011

biomass gross primary production and et he et al 2021 kumar et al 2019 xu et al 2021 the assimilation of remote sensing sm retrieval improves the estimation of runoff and et and performs better in dynamic model initialization prediction of atmospheric state variables and extreme events hain et al 2012 han et al 2012 lu et al 2019 seo et al 2021 tian et al 2017 however the da method is limited by the observation data the model variables and parameters cannot be updated when sm observations are missing i e cloud covered areas or unobservable i e deep layer sm he et al 2020 lu et al 2019 salcedo sanz et al 2020 in addition in situ sm measurements are rarely utilized in lsms over regional applications because of their sparse distribution across spaces recently with the successful development of machine learning ml technology it has become possible to use various observations in situ and remote sensing to improve the performance of lsms ml is a data driven method that attempts to learn the relationship between input features and outputs reichstein et al 2019 salcedo sanz et al 2020 yuan et al 2020 compared with da methods ml techniques can accurately capture the nonlinear and complex relationships between the dependent variable and predictors brajard et al 2020 numerous studies have used ml methods based on land surface observations to estimate water and energy variables at regional and global scales jung et al 2011 2020 xu et al 2018 yuan et al 2020 the combination of physical models and ml methods in hybrid models can provide new opportunities for the development of lsms reichstein et al 2019 in most cases ml training leverages in situ observations and or high resolution simulations to replace part or all of the physical models bocquet et al 2020 brajard et al 2020 gentine et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 in addition ml methods are used for model error correction parameterization and uncertainty estimation he et al 2020 jia et al 2020 willard et al 2020 xu et al 2014 yang et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 despite these efforts ml methods were typically combined with simple physical models therefore integrating multi source sm observations into da systems with ml methods is essential to improve regional sm and et estimates a wide variety of approaches have been proposed that use remotely sensed data for the retrieval of et in the hrb hu and jia 2015 ma et al 2018 song et al 2018 xu et al 2019a these studies have mainly focused on the estimation of et based on the statistical and or empirical methods remote sensing models i e surface energy

hybrid model is evaluated over the heihe river basin hrb in northwest china the et estimates from the hybrid model are compared with the large aperture scintillometer las and up scaled watershed et in the hrb moreover several tests are performed to assess the effect of vegetation dynamics and three layer sm on et estimates the objectives of our study are to 1 estimate et by integrating remotely

capabilities niu et al 2011 yang et al 2011 the physical enhancements in noah mp include 1 an interactive vegetation canopy dickinson et al 1998 2 a short term dynamic vegetation growth model to simulate the carbon budget dickinson et al 1998 3 an unconfined aquifer for groundwater storage with a dynamic water table niu et al 2007 4 a multilayer snowpack yang and niu 2003 and 5 a simple groundwater module with a topmodel based runoff scheme niu et al 2005 2007 noah mp combines a stomatal resistance scheme based on the ball berry model ball et al 1987 with vegetation dynamics dickinson et al 1998 the noah mp model simulates vegetation carbon storage and allocates it to leaves stems wood and roots and is widely used at regional and global scales cai et al 2014a 2014b xia et al 2017 you et al 2020 zheng et al 2014 2015a 2015b in this study the dynamic crop growth model was selected in noah mp to estimate crop dynamics more accurately liu et al 2016b zhang et al 2020b

management data e g planting and harvesting dates are used to constrain crop models the dynamic crop growth model simulates the evolution of vegetation biomass which affects gross primary productivity sm and latent heat fluxes le kumar et al 2019 liu et al 2016b xu et al 2019b 2 2 data assimilation method the ensemble kalman filter enkf algorithm evensen 1994 2003 has been applied extensively in many sequential da studies koster et al 2018 reichle et al 2002 xu et al 2011 yang et al 2007 it calculates the state prediction error covariance based on the monte carlo method this study assimilates remotely sensed lai to update model state variable leaf biomass and parameter sla using the enkf da system let us call x the state vector leaf biomass and sla the state vector ensemble members can be propagated forward via 1 x j n f f x j n 1 f f n α n μ j where x j n 1 f and x j n f are the forecast state denoted by superscript f variables of the jth replicate at times n 1 and n respectively the forward model noah mp is designated by f f n and α n are the model input data and parameters at time n where μ j represents model error with a zero mean and specified variance the observation operator links observations to the state 2 y j n f h x j n f η j where y j n f is the model predicted lai h represents the observation operator between state vectors and the observations in this study the relationship between lai and leaf biomass lfmass lai sla lfmass is described as the observation operator η j is the observation error with a mean of zero and a covariance of r of the jth member the state variable of each ensemble member is then updated by 3 x j n a x j n f k y n o y j n f where x j n a is the analysis state denoted by superscript a variables of the jth replicate at time n y n o is the lai observation at time n and k is the kalman gain matrix which is defined as 4 k p x y p y y r 1 5 p x y 1 n e 1 j 1 n e x j n f x n f h x j n 1 f x n f t 6 p y y 1 n e 1 j 1 n e h x j n f x n f h x j n f x n f t where p xy is the estimated error covariance matrix between the model states and the observations and p yy is the estimated covariance of the observations t represents the transpose matrix and n e is the number of ensembles according to reichle et al 2002 seo et al 2021 and zhao et al 2016 40 ensemble members were used to ensure an accurate approximation of the error covariances while maintaining computational efficiency the model ensembles are perturbed by adding normally distributed random errors zero mean and specified variance to model states and parameters to characterize the error term this study applies additive perturbations with a standard deviation of 10 g m 2 to the modeled leaf biomass kumar et al 2019 the standard deviation of the sla is set to 10 of the value of the a priori parameter xu et al 2021 a standard deviation of 0 1 m2 m 2 is used for remotely sensed lai kumar et al 2019 these standard deviation values are comparable to those used in the previous lai da studies kumar et al 2019 ling et al 2019 rahman et al 2022 2 3 machine learning method six ml algorithms including artificial neural network ann long short term memory lstm gate recurrent unit gru deep belief network dbn random forest rf and extreme gradient boosting xgboost are utilized to construct the sm surrogate model sm is the target variable in the ml method and variables that affect sm variations are used as explanatory variables the ml method trains the model by establishing relationships between explanatory and target variables an ann is a mathematical model that simulates the interconnected neuron network structure of the human brain it includes input hidden and output layers maier and dandy 2000 each layer contains several artificial neurons and the layers are fully connected ann can extract nonlinear feature relationships from large datasets abrahart and see 2007 which is impossible with traditional linear models such as multivariable linear regression models lstm networks capture temporal covariability in time series and have an excellent ability to preserve time series information graves 2012 hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 tai et al 2015 xiang et al 2020 the lstm unit is composed of cells input gates output gates and forget gates to avoid the vanishing gradients typically experienced in recurrent neural networks the unit remembers values in the time series and the three gates control the flow of information in and out of each unit lstm networks are well suited for time series data processing modeling and forecasting because time series data often have temporal information correlations the gru is an improvement over lstm and has an optimized network structure while maintaining the performance of lstm cho et al 2014 li et al 2020c the gru network has only two gate structures an update gate and a reset gate these two gates control bringing in and ignoring information from the previous moment the gru network can solve the training and prediction problems of long interval and long delay time series compared with the lstm unit the gru unit performs better in central processing unit time convergence parameter updates and generalization gruber et al 2020 a dbn was proposed by hinton et al 2006 by building a ml model with multiple hidden layers and a large amount of training data the dbn can learn more useful functions and generate more accurate predictions the dbn consists of a multi layer restricted boltzmann machine rbm and a supervised back propagation bp network layer the weights and biases of the rbm are initialized through a greedy layer by layer unsupervised training and then these weights and bias values are passed through the bp the algorithm is fine tuned to make the model converge to the best value in recent years dbn has been widely used in image processing fields such as speech handwritten font traffic signs and facial recognition lin and fan 2011 savich et al 2011 the rf algorithm is based on the two randomization ideas of bagging and selection of features boulesteix et al 2012 breiman 2001 liaw and wiener 2002 the bagging idea allows the rf to train decision trees and out of bag error estimates in parallel in addition the rf algorithm also has the advantages of preventing overfitting and having better tolerance to outliers xgboost works based on the tree learning algorithm chen and guestrin 2016 torlay et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 the tree learning algorithm does not require linear features or interactions between features therefore it tends to have a better classification function xgboost combines a weak base learning model with a more powerful learner which can be used for regression and classification problems in addition xgboost is a gradient enhancement method it is a new distributed algorithm for tree searching and accelerates the speed of tree construction compared to rf xgboost adds a regularization function to the loss function to

observations and surface layer remote sensing observations st lc t a u p rh r s and lai are the explanatory variables these variables are consistent with the meteorological forcing data of noah mp which is conducive to da and the iterative operation of ml methods the three layer sm observations and explanatory variables are trained separately to construct the ml model the first layer 0 10 cm in situ sm observations and remote sensing sm products are trained to construct the first layer ml model the in situ sm observations in the second 10 40 cm and third 40 100 cm layers are used to train and construct the root zone ml models respectively the global k fold k is set to 10 testing approach is used to evaluate the performance of the ml method in this study sm data is divided into k parts k 1 parts are used for training the ml method and the remaining parts are used as the validation data the cross validation process was repeated k times all the datasets should be trained and validated and the results of the evaluation index were then averaged as the assessing results the k fold testing approach has been widely used to test and optimize several ml methods martí et al 2015 shiri et al 2015 different hyperparameter values are tested to select the optimal parameters to develop the studied ann lstm gru dbn rf and xgboost models for ann and dbn models the multilayer perceptron with three hidden layers and a rectified linear unit activation function was used as it works well for this data set the learning rate and batch size were set to be 0 01 and 72 respectively also the iteration was set to be 500 for lstm and gru models adam optimizer and mean absolute error mae loss function were implemented with a learning rate of 0 01 and batch size of 72 for rf and xgboost models the estimator was set to be 1000 and the maximum depth and learning rate were 10 and 0 01 respectively in general ml models are selected based on the availability of data and their ability to solve the target problem each model has various benefits and drawbacks due to its different structural design however the final behavior of the ml model depends not only on its structural design but also on the training data and the problem being solved abed et al 2021 2 4 hybrid model this study hybridizes the da and ml methods into the physical model noah mp to estimate et the hybrid model is composed of two parts in the first part the enkf method is applied to optimize the state variable leaf biomass and parameter sla in noah mp the second part runs the sm surrogate model based on the ml method to estimate the three layer sm 0 10 cm 10 40 cm and 40 100 cm finally the hybrid model is generated through the iterative coupling of parts one and two through this coupling lai estimates from the enkf method are used in the ml model to estimate sm and sm estimates from the ml model are utilized in the noah mp model to estimate lai and et such coupling makes the da and ml models operate dynamically and consistently the daily optimized lai and estimated sm values are integrated into the noah mp model at 00 00 local time by updating the leaf biomass and three layer sm initialization the optimized sla is directly used in the table file a flowchart of the hybrid model is presented in fig 1 based on the enkf method remotely sensed lai data are assimilated into the noah mp model the assimilation of lai data can effectively control leaf biomass and retrieve lai dynamics more details on the enkf scheme are presented in section 2 2 the in situ sm measurements averaged to 0 10 cm 10 40 cm and 40 100 cm and surface layer remotely sensed sm 0 5 cm are replicated using the sm surrogate model to estimate the three layer sm 0 10 cm 10 40 cm and 40 100 cm based on the optimized ml

kang et al 2017 the cosmos is located at daman and it can measure the regional sm by counting fast neutrons produced by secondary cosmic ray particles in the soil zreda et al 2008 compared to a single

discussions 4 1 the assimilation of lai observations this study assimilates calibrated glass lai data into the noah mp model validation studies show that the glass lai values are much lower than the landsat lai estimates during the growing season in croplands fang et al 2019 ma et al 2017 the higlass lai regional values are averaged for cropland grassland shrubland and forest to calibrate the glass lai values the glass lai values are compared with the higlass lai for the four vegetation types in fig 3 as shown the glass product underestimated the lai in the hrb therefore the glass lai data are calibrated using the higlass lai values in this study the glass lai values are calibrated against the higlass lai values using a logarithmic based regression equation y 3 55 ln x 1 for cropland y 3 04 ln x 1 for grassland y 3 37 ln x 1 for shrubland and y 3 23 ln x 1 for forest with this calibration the r2 values between the calibrated glass and higlass lai are 0 56 0 52 0 65 and 0 45 for cropland grassland shrubland and forest respectively the sample size is 106 and the confidence interval is 95 5 significance level a slight discrepancy is observed between the calibrated glass and higlass lai this happens because of the different data sources i e modis and landsat reflectance datasets and algorithms i e grnn and rf methods from the glass and higlass products jin et al 2019 xiao et al 2014 fig 4 compares the monthly mean lai estimates from noah mp hybrid model and calibrated glass lai over the hrb in 2015 compared to the hybrid model noah mp underestimated lai during the growing season especially in the vegetated areas of the upstream and midstream of the hrb this is primarily due to the inaccurate parameter settings such as the clapp hornberger b parameter saturated sm value maximum rate of carboxylation at 25 c accumulated growing degree days and planting and harvesting dates arsenault et al 2018 cuntz et al 2016 levis et al 2012 li et al 2020b liu et al 2016b zhang et al 2020b the assimilation of calibrated glass lai into the noah mp model improved leaf biomass and sla estimates increased lai during the growing season and moved them toward their true values the largest increase in lai is seen during the summer june august the bias of lai estimates from hybrid model is 0 17 m2 m 2 which is significantly lower than the bias of 0 98 m2 m 2 from noah mp overall the lai estimates from the hybrid model can capture both the spatial and temporal variations of the calibrated glass lai 4 2 the integration of soil moisture observations this study involved six widely used ml methods namely lstm gru ann dbn rf and xgboost to estimate sm in each soil layer layer 1 0 10 cm layer 2 10 40 cm layer 3 40 100 cm daily sm profile observations at 19 awss and smap sm products as the first layer of sm data are used to train and test the ml model fig 5 shows the first layer sm ten fold testing results of the six ml methods the predicted daily first layer sm from all six ml methods agreed well with the sm observations and they are scattered mainly around the 1 1 line the lstm gru ann and dbn methods performed almost identical the xgboost method had lower rmse 0 051 m3 m 3 and mape 16 85 and slightly higher r2 0 84 than lstm gru ann dbn and rf the relatively low rmse and mape values indicate that the xgboost method can estimate the first layer sm accurately over the hrb the statistical boxplots of r2 rmse and mape from the six ml methods are shown in fig 6 the statistical indices r2 rmse and mape from each layer of sm are calculated using ten fold testing results the boxplots present the uncertainty ranges by seven statistics i e the minimum 5th percentile 1st quartile median 3rd quartile 95th percentile and the maximum of the ten fold testing experiments among these methods the rmses and mapes of the first and second layer sm retrievals are smaller than those of the third layer this is because the surface layer sm 0 40 cm is mainly affected by atmospheric state variables i e precipitation radiation and air temperature and land surface conditions i e vegetation cover and soil texture however the deep layer sm 40 100 cm is regulated by underground conditions i e soil particle composition groundwater table and vegetation root distribution fang et al 2016 liu et al 2020 the statistical evaluation metrics i e r2 rmse and mape of the three layer sm estimates from the six ml methods are listed in table 2 the three layer average rmse mape of the sm estimates from xgboost is 0 040 m3 m 3 13 88 which is 6 98 9 34 lower than the rmse mape of 0 043 m3 m 3 15 31 from rf the lower rmse and mae values from the xgboost method indicate that it can estimate the three layer sm more accurately the relative importance of the predictors for the three layer sm in the xgboost method is shown in fig a1 shapley additive explanations shap values are used as feature importance values to evaluate the importance of the input variables of the xgboost method lundberg and lee 2017 surface layer sm estimates from lai have the highest importance while predicting sm at 0 10 cm depth this is followed by lc t a rh r s and u features p and st features have the lowest importance among the predictors the results also indicate that the importance of meteorological features decreases in deep layer sm prediction as shown in fig 7 simulated sm from the noah mp model is remarkably lower than observations during the growing season at daman in addition the noah mp model slightly underestimated sm in the brb this is because the impact of the irrigation scheme is neglected in the noah mp model tian et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 2020b also the noah mp model did not consider the effect of the specific characteristics of alpine meadows such as the existence of dense roots and high soil organic carbon content chen et al 2012 sun et al 2021 yang et al 2009 zheng et al 2015b meanwhile coarse resolution precipitation forcing is underestimated in mountainous areas jiang et al 2021 in contrast the sm predictions from the hybrid model are closer to the measurements than those from noah mp this indicates that the developed hybrid model can exploit the information contained in sm profile observations and smap sm in general multi source sm observations should be integrated into the noah mp model to capture the spatial and temporal variations of sm the spatial distribution of the first layer sm estimates from the noah mp first row and hybrid model second row over the hrb are shown in fig 8 the noah mp model can capture the patterns of sm compared to the hybrid model noah mp underestimates sm in the north and south areas of hrb the hybrid model improves noah mp sm estimates by increasing them in the hrb in addition the spatial patterns of the estimated sm from the hybrid model are consistent with the characteristics of precipitation vegetation cover irrigation events and shallow groundwater table xu et al 2020 sm estimates are higher upstream of hrb due to more precipitation approximately 500 mm in the mountainous areas but they lower downstream because of low precipitation approximately 50 mm sm estimates are also higher in the midstream oasis than downstream due to irrigation approximately 500 mm over the hrb zeng et al 2017 sm values are higher downstream of the hrb due to the shallow groundwater table along the riparian forest xu et al 2020 it is worth mentioning that the uncertainties of sm estimation of mls are affected by the heterogeneity of land surface hydrothermal conditions this is because point scale sm measurements at the 19 awss with heterogeneous land surfaces cannot accurately represent reality and deteriorate the accuracy of the sm surrogate model kang et al 2018 meanwhile uncertainties from the input data and ml methods can affect the estimation of sm xu et al 2018 4 3 estimation of evapotranspiration the time series of the observed and estimated daily et values from the noah mp and hybrid model at the arou daman and sidaoqiao sites are shown in fig 9 et estimates from the noah mp model are remarkably lower than those from the las measurements during the growing season at the arou daman and sidaoqiao sites this is because of the underestimated sm see figs 7 and 8 arou daman and sidaoqiao sites and lai see fig 4 arou and daman sites values from noah mp during july september in 2015 the noah mp model does not consider the effect of dense roots and high soil organic carbon content of alpine meadows arou on et chen et al 2012 sun et al 2021 yang et al 2009 zheng et al 2015b also the impact of irrigation events daman and groundwater table sidaoqiao have not been fully considered in the noah mp model tian et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 2020b at the beginning of the growing season the average groundwater table at the sidaoqiao site is 0 91 m and at the end of the growing season is 2 55 m xu et al 2020 the irrigation scheme in the midstream and the shallow groundwater level in the downstream can affect the sm transport process in contrast the et predictions from the hybrid model are closer to the measurements than those from noah mp this indicates that the developed hybrid model can exploit the lai and three layer sm time series information to ameliorate et estimates fig 9 shows that the outcomes of the hybrid model slightly underestimated et at the daman site mainly because the hybrid model underestimated sm from july to september at the arou daman and sidaoqiao sites et showed a rising trend in the vegetation growing period doys 121 180 and reached its maximum in the middle of july approximately doy 200 after that it decreased as the vegetation senesced table 3 shows the statistical metrics r2 rmse ubrmse and mape of daily et predictions from the noah mp and hybrid model the three site average ubrmse and mape of daily et predictions by noah mp are 1 50 mm day 1 and 71 96 the hybrid model decreased the ubrmse and mape by 42 00 and 55 29 respectively the relatively low ubrmse and mape values indicated that the hybrid model could accurately estimate et over different sites under contrasting environmental conditions although the hybrid model significantly improves the simulation accuracy of et there is still uncertainty in the estimated et the first uncertainty comes from the training data sets the hybrid model is appropriate for regions with abundant in situ observations the ml models build non linear relationships between various input and target variables from a large number of high quality training samples this study used sm data from 19 awss and smap over the hrb to train and verify the hybrid model if the model is applied under extreme weather and future climate scenarios the performance of the hybrid model will decrease as the number of training samples decreases in addition the performance of the hybrid model is related to the heterogeneity of the land surface and the complexity of the hydrological processes as shown in table 3 the rmse and ubrmse of et estimates at sidaoqiao site are higher than that of arou and daman sites this is because the spatial heterogeneity of land surface hydrothermal conditions at the sidaoqiao site was higher than that of arou and daman sites throughout the growing season zhang et al 2020 this higher land surface heterogeneity can affect the training accuracy of the ml method and further affect the performance of the hybrid model at the same time the complexity of the hydrological processes i e shallow groundwater table at sidaoqiao site can lead to increased uncertainty of the ml model this shows that uncertainties in the ml based sm surrogate model negatively and considerably affect et retrieval the three site averaged statistical indices of daily et estimates from the hybrid model are also compared with dtd et monitor hitll and etmap in table 4 as shown the accuracy of et retrievals from the hybrid model are comparable to those of previous studies in the hrb e g hu and jia 2015 ma et al 2018 song et al 2018 xu et al 2018 also etmap and hitll have higher accuracy and are used as reference data in fig 10 the second hybrid model uncertainty is related to the performance of the noah mp model the misfits between the model estimates and observations are primarily because of the inaccurate model parameters simplistic physical assumptions and uncertainties in the meteorological forcing the estimation of et in the noah mp model is sensitive to sm and vegetation dynamics especially in semi arid regions therefore the hybrid model will produce more improvements in dry and sparse vegetated conditions e g daman and sidaoqiao sites compared to the noah mp model the hybrid model generates less improvement in wet and densely vegetated conditions than the noah mp model e g arou site this is because et is mainly affected by the atmospheric state variables i e air temperature specific humidity solar radiation and wind speed in general the improvement of the hybrid model is reduced when the noah mp model is simulated better fig 10 shows the monthly mean et maps from the noah mp first row and hybrid model second row approaches as well as the etmap third row over the hrb during the modeling period may september the spatial patterns of et retrievals from noah mp are highest upstream of the hrb in the south due to higher precipitation and dense vegetation cover but decrease over midstream and downstream of the hrb because of low precipitation and sparse vegetation however et in the artificial oasis in the midstream and the natural oasis in the downstream are affected by irrigation and the groundwater table respectively therefore the et estimates from the noah mp model are seriously underestimating et in the midstream and downstream areas of the hrb the underestimation of et based on the noah mp model has also been reported in previous studies brunsell et al 2020 gan et al 2019 liang et al 2019 the hybrid model improved the et estimates from the noah mp model and patterns in the et estimates can capture those of irrigation and the groundwater table more robustly significantly higher et values are apparent in the oases of the mid and downstream regions with annual et decreasing sharply along a gradient from south to north i e upstream to downstream in general et increases during the vegetation growing period may july with the increase in precipitation and lai and then decreases in the fall august september with the decrease in precipitation and lai in addition the performance of the et estimates from the hybrid model is also compared with etmap third row the variations of et estimates from the hybrid model are consistent with the etmap especially in areas with higher precipitation and denser vegetation cover it is worth noting that et values from the hybrid model are lower than etmap in extreme arid deserts this is probably because the vigorous root systems of desert plants can absorb deep sm and groundwater li et al 2017 this mechanism is not fully considered in the noah mp model the et values from the hybrid model are compared with hitll in the desert fourth row the results also found that et values from the hybrid model are lower than hitll in the desert the spatial distribution of r2 rmse and mape differences of et estimates between the hybrid model and noah mp hybrid model minus the noah mp are shown in fig 11 first row the etmap is used as the reference value for statistical indices the optimized lai and sm positively impact the et estimates with the r2 rmse increasing decreasing in most parts of the hrb especially over grassland cropland forest and shrubland statistical results for cropland grassland forest shrubland and barren land are also shown in fig 11 second row and table 5 the mean of the rmse mape of et estimates from the noah mp model for the five land cover types are 1 54 mm day 1 58 20 the hybrid model decreased the rmse mape by 42 21 34 24 the relatively low rmse and mape values show that the hybrid model accurately estimates et over different land cover types the mean seasonal cycle of et estimates from the noah mp model hybrid model and etmap for the five land cover types during the growing season may september are shown in fig 12 the noah mp model underestimated et over cropland grassland shrubland and forest still the performance of the noah mp model is improved when the da and ml methods are integrated the et values in the hybrid model agreed better with etmap over cropland grassland shrubland and forest compared to the noah mp model the hybrid model has very limited improvement in et estimation on barren land the magnitude of et is larger over cropland and forest than over grassland and shrubland over croplands the noah mp model et simulation has a peak advance compared to the hybrid model according to the results of etmap et peaked in july and august while the noah mp model showed that it peaked in june as mentioned above this is probably due to the misrepresentation of vegetation growth in cropland the hybrid model assimilating lai increased et in late summer and is consistent with etmap in the other three vegetation categories the seasonal dynamics of et are more in phase indicating that natural vegetation growth is the main factor determining et it can be noted that the overall effect of the hybrid model is to increase the et relative to noah mp especially in may several numerical tests are conducted to evaluate the eﬀect of vegetation dynamics and three layer sm estimates separately in test 1 the noah mp model was run alone in test 2 the lai data are assimilated into the noah mp model in test 3 to test 5 based on da the first to third layers of sm are coupled to the noah mp model to test the influence of different layers of sm on et estimation in test 6 the da method and the three layer sm surrogate model estimate et the daily et estimates r2 rmse and mape for the five land cover types from test 1 to test 6 are shown in fig 13 the rmses and mapes of et retrievals from test 2 are smaller than those of test 1 implying that test 2 took advantage of the information in the lai time series assimilation to improve the et estimates under different hydrological and vegetative conditions the optimized first and second layer sm test 3 and test 4 significantly improved the et estimates over cropland grassland shrubland and forest indicating that sequences of the first and second layer sm are vital for et retrievals in addition the et retrievals over forests are more affected by the first to third layer sm test 5 this is because the deeper roots of the forest can uptake deep sm and groundwater leading to a larger et liu et al 2020 xu et al 2019b zheng et al 2015b this shows that assimilation of deep layer sm is necessary to improve et over forests overall in cropland grassland and shrubland sm optimization at a 0 40 cm depth is more effective for et estimation improvement in forests sm optimization at a 0 100 cm depth is more effective for et estimation improvement soil evaporation vegetation transpiration and canopy interception evaporation estimates from six experimental tests are conducted to examine the influence of vegetation dynamics and three layer sm estimates in fig 14 as indicated except for barren land the assimilation of lai test 1 led to increased vegetation transpiration and canopy interception especially over cropland this is because an increase in lai leads to increased canopy coverage decreased net surface radiation and reduced soil evaporation in addition an increase in lai led to increased transpiration and decreased sm of the root zone due to water uptake in the root zone kumar et al 2019 similarly the optimized first to third layer sm test 2 to test 4 increased soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration this is because increased sm wet soil provides conditions suitable for soil evaporation and vegetation uptake of soil water overall the results indicate that the assimilation of lai and optimized three layer sm improved the estimation of et and are closest to etmap red box 5 conclusions in this study a hybrid model based on da and ml methods is proposed to improve the accuracy of et estimation in the land surface model the hybrid model relies on the da method to update the vegetation dynamics of the noah mp model and the ml method to construct a three layer sm surrogate model the da method ensemble kalman filter enkf is applied to optimize the state variable leaf biomass and parameter specific leaf area sla in noah mp to obtain accurate lai estimates the xgboost method integrates in situ sm profile observations and smap sm products to improve the three layer sm estimates the performance of the hybrid model is tested in the hrb located in northwest china and the main results are as follows 1 the hybrid model assimilated lai updated leaf biomass and sla and retrieved the optimal values of lai prediction enkf can capture both lai variations and is closer to the calibrated glass lai than noah mp the xgboost method can improve the sm estimates by integrating in situ sm profile observations and smap sm products the sm estimates from the hybrid model agree well with observations from the daman and brb the spatial patterns of the retrieved sm from the hybrid model consistently resemble the features of rainfall vegetation cover irrigation events and groundwater table 2 the simulated day to day fluctuations of et estimates from the hybrid model agree better with large aperture scintillometer las observations at the arou daman and sidaoqiao sites which reduced the three site average ubrmse of et from 1 50 mm day 1 of noah mp to 0 87 mm day 1 the et estimates from the hybrid model are consistent with the etmap variations especially in areas with higher precipitation and denser vegetation cover the mean rmse mape of et estimates from the noah mp for the five land cover types are 1 54 mm day 1 58 20 the hybrid model decreased the rmse mape by 42 21 34 24 it is worth noting that et values from the hybrid model are lower than etmap and hitll in extreme arid deserts this is probably because plants can uptake deep sm and groundwater in the desert and in the noah mp model these processes are often simplified 3 several tests are conducted to evaluate the effect of vegetation dynamics and three layer sm estimates the results indicate that the assimilation of lai leads to increased vegetation transpiration and canopy interception especially over cropland sm optimization at a depth of 0 40 cm is more effective for et estimation over cropland grassland and shrubland sm optimization at a 0 100 cm depth is more effective for et estimation over forests da and ml methods of hybridization can utilize multi source observations to improve model physical drawbacks the ultimate goal of the proposed hybrid model is to explore how ml can utilize multi source observations and benefit or replace existing sub processes of the da system for example the ml based sm surrogate model is used to replace the initial solution of sm in noah mp to improve the accuracy of et prediction upcoming studies should use multi source lai and sm data to apply the hybrid model over sparse observation domains future studies should focus on multi year simulations using the improved hybrid model improved et estimates from the hybrid model can improve the monitoring and

9321,the loess plateau is a typical dryland agricultural region where water shortages are the primary limiting factor for crop production deep soil moisture plays a crucial role in the regulation of seasonal water shortages however the distribution of soil water and its temporal variation in the deep soil profile i e below 2 0 m are usually unknown in a dryland agricultural field a field study of three cropping systems i e wwc continuous winter wheat smc continuous spring maize and wmr a rotation of winter wheat and spring maize and three tillage practices i e nt no tillage st subsoiling tillage and ct conventional tillage was carried out in a semi arid region and the crop yield vertical distribution patterns and temporal variability of the soil moisture in a 5 0 m soil profile were studied to evaluate the effect of the various management strategies on the soil water sustainability the results indicated that the wmr and smc systems combined with st practice obtained higher crop yield and water use efficiency compared to the wwc system and the time averaged soil moisture for the three cropping systems differed significantly p 0 05 the wwc system can utilize soil water below 2 0 m and caused greater soil water depletion in the 0 5 0 m soil layer however no significant differences in the soil water content were found among the different tillage practices the top soil layer showed a higher index of temporal stability its value for all cropping systems but the its increased with soil depth in the deep soil profile below 3 0 m with the wwc system ultimately the most time stable depth mtsd for estimating the mean soil moisture of the profile was determined to be the 2 0 3 0 soil layer for all three systems based on the its values but the mechanism by which the mtsd was formed differed for the various cropping systems the soil moisture at the mtsd under wmr and smc had high temporal stability and contributed to better soil water sustainability in a dryland agricultural field these findings may provide helpful base references for evaluating the effect of different management strategies on the soil water and the temporal stability parameters of soil moisture as well as their impact on the sustainability of the deep soil moisture in a dryland agricultural field keywords cropping system tillage practices temporal stability soil water sustainability crop yield dryland agriculture data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the loess plateau of china is a typical dryland agricultural region containing about 25 m ha of dryland farming area and accounting for more than 80 of the arable land in this area zhang et al 2014 continuous planting of winter wheat wwc continuous spring maize smc and the rotation of winter wheat and spring maize wmr are common cropping systems in this region sun et al 2018 however due to the variability of the annual precipitation crop productivity varies widely and is sensitive to soil water availability typically approximately 60 or more of the precipitation occurs during the summer but that is not coupled with the critical crop water demand period in this region wang et al 2018 considering the high risk of soil water loss and seasonal shortages crop productivity is extremely dependent on the water stored in the soil huang et al 2003 therefore increasing rainfall infiltration reducing soil evaporation and ensuring a good availability of soil water are essential to prevent water shortages in dryland agriculture recently conservation agricultural practices such as crop rotation conservation tillage and straw mulching have had positive effects on improving the soil structure and increasing the soil water storage syswerda and robertson 2014 wang et al 2018 therefore it is imperative to find appropriate agricultural management practices that will allow the sustainable development of limited water resources the soil water is the main source of the water taken up by plants data on the dynamics of changes in the soil water status is crucial for the efficient utilization of water resources field management and the sustainability of ecosystem productivity soil moisture varies temporally and geographically and is mainly determined by the soil properties topography vegetation type and climate conditions guber et al 2008 baskan et al 2013 misra 2014 zhang et al 2016 under different cropping systems and soil tillage practices soil properties and vegetation are unstable both in space and time and it is reasonable to predict the state of soil moisture fry and guber 2020 however as far as we know most previous studies have focused on the near surface soil moisture brocca et al 2009 coppola et al 2011 baskan et al 2013 sur et al 2013 he et al 2019 only a few studies have taken into account the soil moisture variability in the deep soil layers in agricultural fields celette et al 2008 li and shao 2014 wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 the important role of water in the deep soil which is used by the roots in water limited environments such as arid and semiarid regions or regions suffering from seasonal water shortages has been recognized wang et al 2015 an in depth understanding of the soil water status in the deep soil profile i e below 2 0 m is critical for the assessment of the response of plant growth to global climate change especially in cases of extreme drought but such information is scarce therefore in order to develop sustainable management systems for areas where water resources are limited it is essential to understand the soil water dynamics in the deep soil layer under different cropping systems in general the study of soil moisture in the deep soil profile is a huge challenge because the direct determination of soil moisture in the field is difficult time consuming and costly temporal stability techniques defined as the time invariant association between a spatial location and the classical statistical parameters of a given soil property vachaud et al 1985 has been demonstrated as an effective tool for estimating the spatial mean soil moisture in a study region by using the most time stable locations starks et al 2006 guber et al 2008 li and shao 2014 dari et al 2019 this strategy is advantageous because it can reduce time and labor costs while still providing a highly accurate estimate starks et al 2006 jia et al 2013 wang et al 2021 and it has attracted much attention for example baroni et al 2013 used this technique to identify locations in an agricultural field that adequately represented the mean soil water content for a given area in order to investigate the spatio temporal variability of soil moisture dynamics associated with different vegetation and soil properties neves et al 2017 also applied this technique to determine appropriate sampling locations and an appropriate soil water measurement frequency in an agroecosystem however the majority of such studies have focused on the temporal stability of the soil moisture in the horizontal direction with the exception of a recent study that examined the vertical temporal stability of soil moisture in a forest and grass ecosystem hu and si 2014 wang et al 2015 to our knowledge the vertical variation of the temporal stability of the soil moisture in the deep soil layer has not been evaluated in agricultural fields in addition the association between agriculture strategies for conservation and the temporal stability of the vertical distribution patterns of soil moisture in a dryland agroecosystem remains unclear therefore this study analyzed the crop yield soil water status and the temporal stability parameters related to the soil moisture in the 0 5 0 m soil depth under different cropping systems and tillage practices the objectives were to 1 assess the effects of cropping system and tillage practice on crop yield and water use 2 study the spatio temporal variability parameters of the soil moisture in the 0 5 0 m soil depth under three cropping systems with different tillage methods and 3 analyze the temporal stability pattern of the soil moisture in the vertical profile and identify a representative depth for estimating the mean soil moisture 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study was conducted at the heyang dryland agricultural research station of northwest a f university 35 19 n 110 4 e and 877 m altitude which is located in heyang county shaanxi province in the southeast region of the loess plateau china the regional climate is classified as temperate continental monsoon with an annual mean temperature of 11 5 and an annual evaporation of 1833 mm rainfall in this area is largely seasonal and highly variable from year to year with an average annual rainfall of approximately 526 mm accounting for more than 60 of rainfall from june to september li et al 2021 the field experiment was carried out in a flat field on level terrain with a dark loessial soil classified as a middle loam soil based on the fao unesco soil classification 1993 with a mean soil bulk density of 1 31 g cm 3 the temperature and precipitation dynamics during the experimental periods are shown in fig 1 2 2 experimental design and treatments this long term experiment started in 2007 and used conventional tillage and no fertilizer to cultivate spring maize in a homogeneous field followed by the scheduled cropping system and tillage practice after harvest the experiment was designed as a split plot design with cropping system as the main treatment and tillage practice as the sub treatment each plot was 5 0 m in width and 22 m in length 110 m2 three cropping systems were evaluated in the experiment continuous winter wheat wwc continuous spring maize smc and the rotation of winter wheat and spring maize wmr the three tillage practices tested in the experiment were no tillage nt subsoiling tillage st and conventional tillage ct tillage was done after the harvest of the previous crop for nt the straw was retained on surface of the field and no soil disturbances occurred until sowing for st the straw was retained on surface of the field and the soil was loosened 30 35 cm in depths using a subsoiling chisel with 60 cm adjustable wings for ct the soils were tilled to a depth of 22 25 cm using a tractor mounted moldboard plow and the straw was buried into arable layer with a bared soil surface during the study period no treatment was disturbed before the start of sowing winter wheat was sown in late september and harvested in mid june and spring maize was sown in late april and harvested in mid september the annual n p2o5 and k2o fertilizer inputs in the farmlands were 150 120 and 90 kg ha 1 respectively to incorporate the fertilizers into the soil rotary tillage at 10 cm soil depth was applied for all tillage treatments before sowing crop weeds pests and disease were controlled with registered pesticides and irrigation was not applied during the entire year 2 3 measurements and analysis 2 3 1 soil sampling and analysis soil samples were collected immediately after the harvest of the previous crop and before the sowing of the next crop in 2019 2021 the soil was sampled to a depth of 5 0 m at 20 cm intervals using a 5 cm internal diameter auger and the samples were brought to the laboratory to determine the soil water parameters soil moisture sm was determined by a gravimetric method and soil water storage sws available soil water storage asws and soil water depletion swd were calculated using the following equations zhang et al 2022 sm m 1 m 2 m 2 100 sws mm i 1 n sm i d i h i 10 asws mm sm i wp d i h i 10 swd mm sfc sm i d i h i 10 where m1 g is the weight of wet soil and m2 g is the weight of dry soil d i g cm 3 is the soil bulk density h i cm is the sampling thickness 0 2 m sfc is the stable field capacity i e 60 of the field capacity sm i is the soil moisture in the i th soil level of each treatment i 1 2 3 n n 25 and wp is the wilting point the soil bulk density was determined with a ring knife 5 cm in diameter and 5 cm in height at every 0 2 m in the 0 0 6 m soil layer and the bulk densities of the deep soil layers below 0 6 m were considered the same as the values for the 0 4 0 6 m layer because only small variations have been shown for deep soil layers zhang et al 2018 2 3 2 crop yield and water use efficiency three random quadrants of 3 0 m2 and 9 0 m2 were selected to measure the grain yields of winter wheat and spring maize at maturity for each cropping system the water use efficiency wue was calculated by the following equations et mm δ sws p wue kg ha 1 mm 1 grain yield et where et mm is total evapotranspiration during the growing season p mm is precipitation during the growing season and δsws mm is the difference in the soil water storage at a soil depth of 0 5 0 m from the beginning to the end of each growing season 2 3 3 evaluation of temporal stability in the present study the mean relative difference mrd the standard deviation of relative difference sdrd and the index of time stability its were used as the primary characteristics to evaluate the impact of the cropping system and the tillage on the vertical pattern of the temporal stability of the soil moisture in the experimental plots vachaud et al 1985 hu et al 2012 within a time series of relative difference rd the mean relative difference mrd of the soil moisture in the i th soil layer of each treatment is defined as rd ij sm ij s m j s m j mrd i 1 m j 1 m rd ij where sm ij is soil moisture in the i th soil layer at time j of each treatment s m j is the average sm at time j and m is the number of measurement times the term mrd was used to quantify the relative wetness of a specific soil layer compared to the mean soil water condition in a field during the observation period therefore soil layers with mrd values close to zero could be considered as representative for the monitoring of soil moisture the standard deviation of the relative difference sdrd describes the temporal variability of the rd and was calculated as sdrd i 1 m 1 j 1 n rd ij mrd i 2 2 specific soil layers with a high temporal stability of the soil moisture are associated with low sdrd values the index of temporal stability its was computed using a combination of mrd and relevant sdrd values using the following equation jacobs et al 2004 duan et al 2017 its mrd i 2 sdrd i 2 2 the sampled soil layers with the lowest its are thus the most temporally stable and a point with a high its shows the greatest variability in the soil moisture over time the coefficient of variation cv of each soil layer was calculated as cv i sd i s m i 1 m 1 j 1 n sm ij s m j 2 s m i where sd i is the standard deviation of the treatment in the i th soil layer 2 4 statistical analysis descriptive statistical properties e g minimum maximum mean standard deviation coefficient of variation

analyzed using the ibm spss statistical software package v 20 0 spss inc chicago il usa followed by the lsd treatment differences were considered statistically significant at p 0 05 and the figures were generated using origin v pro 2019 originlab corp northampton ma usa 3 results 3 1 overview of the crop yield performance crop yield was significantly affected by the cropping system and tillage method p 0 05 table 1 the mean grain yield was respectively increased by 198 3 and 88 9 for smc and wmr compared to wwc as for the tillage methods the average yield of st was higher compared to the other tillage methods the interaction between cropping system and tillage had a significant effect on the grain yield over the two cropping seasons 3 2 basic statistics of the soil water regime the soil moisture in the 0 5 0 m soil layer varied from 10 6 to 15 1 for wwc 11 3 15 8 for wmr and 14 4 16 8 for smc during the 2019 2021 experimental period table 2 the mean value of the soil moisture under different cropping systems was 12 6 14 1 and 16 1 for wwc wmr and smc respectively similar trends were observed for other soil water parameters i e soil water storage sws available soil water storage asws and soil water depletion swd as shown in table 2 the lowest value of the cv of the soil water parameters was also recorded for the smc cropping system differently than for the cropping systems no significant differences in the soil parameters were noted among the different tillage practices and conventional tillage ct had a relatively higher cv for the soil moisture in the surface layer 3 3 vertical distribution of soil moisture the vertical distribution of the soil moisture in the 0 5 0 m soil layer on the different sampling dates changed greatly among the various cropping systems fig 2 for different cropping systems with the same crop type the change pattern of the soil moisture showed a similar trend the soil moisture in the profile was much lower at the end of the growth period and the soil water consumption of spring maize mainly occurred in the 0 2 0 m soil layer however winter wheat used soil water below the 2 0 m soil depth and a dry soil layer at the 1 2 2 8 m soil depth was formed in the wwc system figs 2 and 3 this phenomenon was only observed in the wmr system in which the soil water was augmented by precipitation during the winter wheat fallow and maize growth periods little change in soil moisture was seen in smc during the experimental period although the soil water for wwc was supplemented by precipitation during the fallow period the rainfall infiltration depth was limited to only the 0 1 0 m soil profile figs 2 and 3 the variability of soil moisture in the vertical profile of the various cropping systems was also demonstrated by the diversity coefficient of variation cv in our study fig 4 the mean variations of soil moisture for wwc smc and wmr were 16 9 8 8 and 14 0 respectively in addition to the differences in the mean values the vertical distribution pattern of the cv was also different the cv of soil moisture in wwc system was extremely varied in the 0 3 0 m soil layer while it gradually decreased with increasing soil depth in the other cropping systems 3 4 soil water storage and water use efficiency time series for precipitation and soil water storage in the different soil layers are shown in fig 5 in the 0 2 0 m soil layer soil water storage fluctuated greatly for all cropping systems over the entire monitoring period but the changes in soil water storage in the deep soil layer were slight the soil water conditions were significantly affected by the cropping system over the study period p 0 05 but no significant differences in these parameters were observed for the different tillage practices fig 6 compared with smc the soil water depletion in wmr and wwc increased by 218 2 and 375 1 respectively the average water use efficiency wue was affected by both the cropping system and the tillage p 0 05 table 1 for the cropping system wue under smc was the highest in every cropping season and compared to smc the mean wue was respectively lower by 63 3 and 30 3 for wwc and wmr for tillage method wue was higher for st compared to that for the other tillage methods the interaction between cropping system and tillage had a significant effect on the wue during the two cropping seasons 3 5 spatial variability of temporal stability the ranked mean relative difference mrd of the soil moisture with the corresponding standard deviation of the relative difference sdrd as error bars along with the index of temporal stability its values is shown in fig 7 for the different cropping systems and tillage practices and the numerical values are shown in table 3 the soil moisture in the 0 2 0 m 0 3 0 m for wwc soil layer was lower than the mean value in the 0 5 0 m soil profile indicating that the mrd values were negative fig 7 the its of the soil moisture under wwc was highest in the 0 5 0 m soil profile respectively 34 7 and 53 9 higher than that of wmr and smc table 3 the vertical distribution of the its of soil moisture in the 0 5 0 m soil profile also changed with the various cropping systems the its of the soil moisture decreased with soil depth in smc and wmr but increased with soil depth in the 3 0 5 0 m soil layer for wwc fig 8 these results indicated that the spatial variability of the soil moisture was greater for the wwc system than for the other cropping systems and a cropping system containing maize might enhance the temporal stability of the soil moisture in the deep soil layer although the temporal stability of the soil moisture in the 0 5 0 m soil layer varied for different cropping systems and tillage practices the most temporally stable depth mtsd was found at a similar soil depth in the 2 0 3 0 m soil layer for each treatment fig 9 linear regression showed that the measured soil moisture at the mtsd was significantly correlated with the mean values in the 0 5 0 m soil layer for the different cropping systems p 0 05 fig 10 therefore the measured soil moisture values at the mtsd could be used as estimates of the mean soil moisture values in the soil profile for their respective cropping systems however the soil moisture values measured in the soil layers for the wwc system underestimated the mean soil moisture values fig 10 4 discussion 4 1 dynamics of soil water soil water regimes sws asws and swd in the 0 5 0 m soil depth were significantly affected by the cropping system over the study period p 0 05 but no significant differences in these parameters were observed among the different tillage practices fig 6 this was attributed to the fact that the tillage practices were mainly conducted in top soil layer 0 0 4 m and did not disturb the deep soil layer this is consistent with previous results celette et al 2008 wang et al 2018 zhai et al 2021 the spatio temporal variability of the soil moisture could be ascribed to climate conditions evapotranspiration crop yield and plant type starks et al 2006 jia and shao 2013 fry and guber 2020 wang et al 2015 revealed that soil water in the surface layer was greatly influenced by seasonal rainfall while the soil moisture in deep profile was mainly related to the root water uptake under homogeneous experimental conditions soil moisture was greatly decreased at the maturity stage and a dry soil layer was formed at a soil depth of 1 2 2 8 m in the wwc system figs 2 and 3 previous studies mainly focused on the soil profile within 0 2 0 m of agricultural fields guber et al 2008 baroni et al 2013 baskan et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 while our results showed that winter wheat can reduce the soil water at depths below 2 0 m therefore the detection depths used in previous studies contributed to underestimation of the soil water consumption for deep rooted crops studying the soil water regime in a shallow profile was not sufficient for deep rooted crops because it would lead to a poor understanding of soil water dynamics the deep soil water consumption of winter wheat was attributed to water uptake by the roots 87 of roots were distributed in the 0 1 2 m soil layer but these roots could extract water stored in deeper soil layers white and kirkegaard 2010 zhang et al 2016 furthermore the dry soil layer maintained its location in the spatial pattern and developed into a stable and persistent dry soil layer in the wwc system fig 3 it is difficult replenish the soil water when rainfall is limited wang et al 2011 this was well demonstrated by our results which showed that the precipitation only infiltrated into the 0 1 0 m profile even though it was abundant during the summer fallow period and the soil moisture below 1 0 m was still not replenished fig 2 this suggests that continuous winter wheat cropping causes land degradation and poses a greater potential barrier to the sustainable development of dryland agriculture therefore a different cropping system should be selected to achieve sustainable development of dryland agriculture in a rainfed ecosystem many studies have showed that winter wheat monoculture does not appear to be a sustainable management practice while crop rotation has the potential to improve agricultural sustainability in dryland regions huang et al 2003 wang et al 2008 in the present study the wwc system caused a dry soil layer to develop in the deep soil layer but this phenomenon did not occur in the wmr and smc systems figs 2 and 3 in these systems soil water consumption by spring maize was mainly detected in the 0 1 8 m soil layer because the maize roots were mostly concentrated in the 0 0 8 m soil layer and did not extract the deeper soil moisture zhou et al 2008 the crop rotation system combined deep rooted plants with shallow rooted plants realizing the complementary advantages of the two crops and the distribution of plant roots in a rotation system is likely to result in the recycling of soil water and nutrients below the root zone of shallow rooted plants huang et al 2003 zhou et al 2008 fry and guber 2020 in addition we speculated that this phenomenon was also related to the periodic wetting and drying conditions in crop rotation systems fig 3 the alternation of soil wetting and drying caused temporal changes in the pore volume the pore size distribution and the soil hydraulic properties hence enhancing the infiltration of rainfall and the utilization of deep water zhang et al 2019 yetbarek and ojha 2020 in the present study the dry soil layer was not adequately infiltrated during the winter wheat growing period after the fallow period of the wmr system from june of the first year to april of the next year but the soil water was completely replenished by precipitation after maize growth occurred because the amount of rainfall was sufficient to do so fig 2 a good soil water condition promoted wheat growth and allowed for a high grain yield and efficient water use table 3 especially for the soil water in the deep soil layer 4 2 temporal stability of soil moisture the temporal stability parameters of soil moisture were analyzed by various methods to identify the relationships between the soil moisture measured at the mtsd and the mean values in the 0 5 0 m soil layer the mrd indicated that the soil moisture during the experimental period in the 0 2 0 m 0 3 0 m for wwc soil layer was underestimated fig 7 the temporal stability of the soil moisture was also evaluated by the sdrd of the soil moisture and the points that had the lowest sdrd were considered as the most time stable teuling 2005 wang et al 2021 the mrd and sdrd clearly decreased with soil depth indicating that the soil water dynamics in the deeper soil layer were more stable with respect to time fry and guber 2020 in this study the its was used to determine the mtsd by combining the values of the mrd and sdrd jacobs et al 2004 zhao et al 2017 the depth with the lowest its value was considered as the most representative and the its in the deep soil layer was higher than that in the shallow layer fig 8 this is because the temporal stability of the shallow soil layer is more easily affected by climatic changes and surface hydrological conditions than that in the deeper layers starks et al 2006 wang et al 2015 although the mtsd under different cropping systems was similar in our study i e in the 2 0 3 0 m soil layer in each system the spatial variability pattern differed for each cropping system the its values in wmr and smc decreased with soil depth but increased in the deep soil profile below 3 0 m for the wwc system fig 8 this could be affected by the biomass the coverage and the root distribution and vitality of the different plant types zhou et al 2008 baroni et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 fortunately the mtsd as indicated by lower its values produced better estimates of the mean soil moisture in each cropping system fig 10 although the mtsd in the wwc system underestimated the soil moisture during the experimental period this may be related to the existence of the dry soil layer in the deep soil profile which was present at the mtsd in the wwc system previous results also suggested that drier soil corresponded to greater temporal stability martınez fernandez and ceballos 2003 li and shao 2014 therefore we speculated that the mechanism for the formation of the mtsd differed for different cropping systems the mtsd in wmr and smc was conducive to a balanced soil moisture content but was affected by the dry soil layer in the deep soil in the wwc these results provide a strong theoretical basis for understanding the formation of the mtsd and accurately estimating the soil moisture in a rainfed agroecosystem 4 3 crop yield and water use grain yield and wue were highly variable across every growing season which was mainly attributed to the various precipitation amount and distribution in dryland agriculture rusinamhodzi et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 li et al 2021 our experiment showed that the smc and wmr system had a significantly p 0 05 higher crop yield and a better potential for enhancing water use compared to wwc system table 1 this finding may be attributed to the rainfall distribution and crop water consumption in our study area the rainfall season coincides relatively with the maize growing season while the precipitation during wheat growth period cannot meet the needs of wheat growth thus leading to the lower grain yield li et al 2021 tillage is an important management practice for affecting soil water condition and crop yield from the rainfed production system rusinamhodzi et al 2011 sun et al 2018 in this experiment st significantly increased the crop yield and wue when compared with ct and nt for the three cropping systems these findings were supported by previous studies showing that st improves soil physical properties promote soil water storage and increasing crop productivity lópez fando and pardo 2009 li et al 2021 although the nt treatment had better soil water conditions than ct at the sowing stage but the poor soil structure over the long term under nt treatment limited the growth of crops leading to low crop yields and wue zhang et al 2018 therefore we believe that the adoption of rotational conservation tillage practices i e a combination of conservation and conventional tillage probably results in higher crop productivity and water use when compared to continuous single tillage practices 5 conclusions in this study we evaluated some soil water regimes sws asws and swd temporal stability of the soil moisture represented by the mrd sdrd and its and crop yield in an agricultural field on the loess plateau in china the wmr and smc systems combined with st practice showed the higher crop yield and water use efficiency compared to the wwc system long term continuous cropping of a deep rooted crop i e winter wheat caused serious soil water depletion and the formation of a dry soil layer in the deep soil profile however if reasonable management measures were taken such as rotating a deep rooted crop with a shallow rooted crop the negative effects caused by deep rooted crops were reduced the wmr and smc cropping systems reduced the soil water depletion and increased the temporal stability of the soil moisture especially in the deep soil layer in addition a more accurate estimate of the soil moisture was obtained for wmr and smc systems which would allow more effective monitoring of soil water conditions in the field therefore wmr and smc have the potential to improve dryland agricultural sustainability the results obtained from this study are of great significance to the sustainable utilization of limited water resources the evaluation of soil water availability and scientific management practices for arable lands in the major grain producing area of the loess plateau as well as

9321,the loess plateau is a typical dryland agricultural region where water shortages are the primary limiting factor for crop production deep soil moisture plays a crucial role in the regulation of seasonal water shortages however the distribution of soil water and its temporal variation in the deep soil profile i e below 2 0 m are usually unknown in a dryland agricultural field a field study of three cropping systems i e wwc continuous winter wheat smc continuous spring maize and wmr a rotation of winter wheat and spring maize and three tillage practices i e nt no tillage st subsoiling tillage and ct conventional tillage was carried out in a semi arid region and the crop yield vertical distribution patterns and temporal variability of the soil moisture in a 5 0 m soil profile were studied to evaluate the effect of the various management strategies on the soil water sustainability the results indicated that the wmr and smc systems combined with st practice obtained higher crop yield and water use efficiency compared to the wwc system and the time averaged soil moisture for the three cropping systems differed significantly p 0 05 the wwc system can utilize soil water below 2 0 m and caused greater soil water depletion in the 0 5 0 m soil layer however no significant differences in the soil water content were found among the different tillage practices the top soil layer showed a higher index of temporal stability its value for all cropping systems but the its increased with soil depth in the deep soil profile below 3 0 m with the wwc system ultimately the most time stable depth mtsd for estimating the mean soil moisture of the profile was determined to be the 2 0 3 0 soil layer for all three systems based on the its values but the mechanism by which the mtsd was formed differed for the various cropping systems the soil moisture at the mtsd under wmr and smc had high temporal stability and contributed to better soil water sustainability in a dryland agricultural field these findings may provide helpful base references for evaluating the effect of different management strategies on the soil water and the temporal stability parameters of soil moisture as well as their impact on the sustainability of the deep soil moisture in a dryland agricultural field keywords cropping system tillage practices temporal stability soil water sustainability crop yield dryland agriculture data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the loess plateau of china is a typical dryland agricultural region containing about 25 m ha of dryland farming area and accounting for more than 80 of the arable land in this area zhang et al 2014 continuous planting of winter wheat wwc continuous spring maize smc and the rotation of winter wheat and spring maize wmr are common cropping systems in this region sun et al 2018 however due to the variability of the annual precipitation crop productivity varies widely and is sensitive to soil water availability typically approximately 60 or more of the precipitation occurs during the summer but that is not coupled with the critical crop water demand period in this region wang et al 2018 considering the high risk of soil water loss and seasonal shortages crop productivity is extremely dependent on the water stored in the soil huang et al 2003 therefore increasing rainfall infiltration reducing soil evaporation and ensuring a good availability of soil water are essential to prevent water shortages in dryland agriculture recently conservation agricultural practices such as crop rotation conservation tillage and straw mulching have had positive effects on improving the soil structure and increasing the soil water storage syswerda and robertson 2014 wang et al 2018 therefore it is imperative to find appropriate agricultural management practices that will allow the sustainable development of limited water resources the soil water is the main source of the water taken up by plants data on the dynamics of changes in the soil water status is crucial for the efficient utilization of water resources field management and the sustainability of ecosystem productivity soil moisture varies temporally and geographically and is mainly determined by the soil properties topography vegetation type and climate conditions guber et al 2008 baskan et al 2013 misra 2014 zhang et al 2016 under different cropping systems and soil tillage practices soil properties and vegetation are unstable both in space and time and it is reasonable to predict the state of soil moisture fry and guber 2020 however as far as we know most previous studies have focused on the near surface soil moisture brocca et al 2009 coppola et al 2011 baskan et al 2013 sur et al 2013 he et al 2019 only a few studies have taken into account the soil moisture variability in the deep soil layers in agricultural fields celette et al 2008 li and shao 2014 wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 the important role of water in the deep soil which is used by the roots in water limited environments such as arid and semiarid regions or regions suffering from seasonal water shortages has been recognized wang et al 2015 an in depth understanding of the soil water status in the deep soil profile i e below 2 0 m is critical for the assessment of the response of plant growth to global climate change especially in cases of extreme drought but such information is scarce therefore in order to develop sustainable management systems for areas where water resources are limited it is essential to understand the soil water dynamics in the deep soil layer under different cropping systems in general the study of soil moisture in the deep soil profile is a huge challenge because the direct determination of soil moisture in the field is difficult time consuming and costly temporal stability techniques defined as the time invariant association between a spatial location and the classical statistical parameters of a given soil property vachaud et al 1985 has been demonstrated as an effective tool for estimating the spatial mean soil moisture in a study region by using the most time stable locations starks et al 2006 guber et al 2008 li and shao 2014 dari et al 2019 this strategy is advantageous because it can reduce time and labor costs while still providing a highly accurate estimate starks et al 2006 jia et al 2013 wang et al 2021 and it has attracted much attention for example baroni et al 2013 used this technique to identify locations in an agricultural field that adequately represented the mean soil water content for a given area in order to investigate the spatio temporal variability of soil moisture dynamics associated with different vegetation and soil properties neves et al 2017 also applied this technique to determine appropriate sampling locations and an appropriate soil water measurement frequency in an agroecosystem however the majority of such studies have focused on the temporal stability of the soil moisture in the horizontal direction with the exception of a recent study that examined the vertical temporal stability of soil moisture in a forest and grass ecosystem hu and si 2014 wang et al 2015 to our knowledge the vertical variation of the temporal stability of the soil moisture in the deep soil layer has not been evaluated in agricultural fields in addition the association between agriculture strategies for conservation and the temporal stability of the vertical distribution patterns of soil moisture in a dryland agroecosystem remains unclear therefore this study analyzed the crop yield soil water status and the temporal stability parameters related to the soil moisture in the 0 5 0 m soil depth under different cropping systems and tillage practices the objectives were to 1 assess the effects of cropping system and tillage practice on crop yield and water use 2 study the spatio temporal variability parameters of the soil moisture in the 0 5 0 m soil depth under three cropping systems with different tillage methods and 3 analyze the temporal stability pattern of the soil moisture in the vertical profile and identify a representative depth for estimating the mean soil moisture 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study was conducted at the heyang dryland agricultural research station of northwest a f university 35 19 n 110 4 e and 877 m altitude which is located in heyang county shaanxi province in the southeast region of the loess plateau china the regional climate is classified as temperate continental monsoon with an annual mean temperature of 11 5 and an annual evaporation of 1833 mm rainfall in this area is largely seasonal and highly variable from year to year with an average annual rainfall of approximately 526 mm accounting for more than 60 of rainfall from june to september li et al 2021 the field experiment was carried out in a flat field on level terrain with a dark loessial soil classified as a middle loam soil based on the fao unesco soil classification 1993 with a mean soil bulk density of 1 31 g cm 3 the temperature and precipitation dynamics during the experimental periods are shown in fig 1 2 2 experimental design and treatments this long term experiment started in 2007 and used conventional tillage and no fertilizer to cultivate spring maize in a homogeneous field followed by the scheduled cropping system and tillage practice after harvest the experiment was designed as a split plot design with cropping system as the main treatment and tillage practice as the sub treatment each plot was 5 0 m in width and 22 m in length 110 m2 three cropping systems were evaluated in the experiment continuous winter wheat wwc continuous spring maize smc and the rotation of winter wheat and spring maize wmr the three tillage practices tested in the experiment were no tillage nt subsoiling tillage st and conventional tillage ct tillage was done after the harvest of the previous crop for nt the straw was retained on surface of the field and no soil disturbances occurred until sowing for st the straw was retained on surface of the field and the soil was loosened 30 35 cm in depths using a subsoiling chisel with 60 cm adjustable wings for ct the soils were tilled to a depth of 22 25 cm using a tractor mounted moldboard plow and the straw was buried into arable layer with a bared soil surface during the study period no treatment was disturbed before the start of sowing winter wheat was sown in late september and harvested in mid june and spring maize was sown in late april and harvested in mid september the annual n p2o5 and k2o fertilizer inputs in the farmlands were 150 120 and 90 kg ha 1 respectively to incorporate the fertilizers into the soil rotary tillage at 10 cm soil depth was applied for all tillage treatments before sowing crop weeds pests and disease were controlled with registered pesticides and irrigation was not applied during the entire year 2 3 measurements and analysis 2 3 1 soil sampling and analysis soil samples were collected immediately after the harvest of the previous crop and before the sowing of the next crop in 2019 2021 the soil was sampled to a depth of 5 0 m at 20 cm intervals using a 5 cm internal diameter auger and the samples were brought to the laboratory to determine the soil water parameters soil moisture sm was determined by a gravimetric method and soil water storage sws available soil water storage asws and soil water depletion swd were calculated using the following equations zhang et al 2022 sm m 1 m 2 m 2 100 sws mm i 1 n sm i d i h i 10 asws mm sm i wp d i h i 10 swd mm sfc sm i d i h i 10 where m1 g is the weight of wet soil and m2 g is the weight of dry soil d i g cm 3 is the soil bulk density h i cm is the sampling thickness 0 2 m sfc is the stable field capacity i e 60 of the field capacity sm i is the soil moisture in the i th soil level of each treatment i 1 2 3 n n 25 and wp is the wilting point the soil bulk density was determined with a ring knife 5 cm in diameter and 5 cm in height at every 0 2 m in the 0 0 6 m soil layer and the bulk densities of the deep soil layers below 0 6 m were considered the same as the values for the 0 4 0 6 m layer because only small variations have been shown for deep soil layers zhang et al 2018 2 3 2 crop yield and water use efficiency three random quadrants of 3 0 m2 and 9 0 m2 were selected to measure the grain yields of winter wheat and spring maize at maturity for each cropping system the water use efficiency wue was calculated by the following equations et mm δ sws p wue kg ha 1 mm 1 grain yield et where et mm is total evapotranspiration during the growing season p mm is precipitation during the growing season and δsws mm is the difference in the soil water storage at a soil depth of 0 5 0 m from the beginning to the end of each growing season 2 3 3 evaluation of temporal stability in the present study the mean relative difference mrd the standard deviation of relative difference sdrd and the index of time stability its were used as the primary characteristics to evaluate the impact of the cropping system and the tillage on the vertical pattern of the temporal stability of the soil moisture in the experimental plots vachaud et al 1985 hu et al 2012 within a time series of relative difference rd the mean relative difference mrd of the soil moisture in the i th soil layer of each treatment is defined as rd ij sm ij s m j s m j mrd i 1 m j 1 m rd ij where sm ij is soil moisture in the i th soil layer at time j of each treatment s m j is the average sm at time j and m is the number of measurement times the term mrd was used to quantify the relative wetness of a specific soil layer compared to the mean soil water condition in a field during the observation period therefore soil layers with mrd values close to zero could be considered as representative for the monitoring of soil moisture the standard deviation of the relative difference sdrd describes the temporal variability of the rd and was calculated as sdrd i 1 m 1 j 1 n rd ij mrd i 2 2 specific soil layers with a high temporal stability of the soil moisture are associated with low sdrd values the index of temporal stability its was computed using a combination of mrd and relevant sdrd values using the following equation jacobs et al 2004 duan et al 2017 its mrd i 2 sdrd i 2 2 the sampled soil layers with the lowest its are thus the most temporally stable and a point with a high its shows the greatest variability in the soil moisture over time the coefficient of variation cv of each soil layer was calculated as cv i sd i s m i 1 m 1 j 1 n sm ij s m j 2 s m i where sd i is the standard deviation of the treatment in the i th soil layer 2 4 statistical analysis descriptive statistical properties e g minimum maximum mean standard deviation coefficient of variation were calculated to illustrate the basic of the soil water regimes i e soil moisture soil water storage available soil water storage and soil water depletion and their temporal stability the data were analyzed using the ibm spss statistical software package v 20 0 spss inc chicago il usa followed by the lsd treatment differences were considered statistically significant at p 0 05 and the figures were generated using origin v pro 2019 originlab corp northampton ma usa 3 results 3 1 overview of the crop yield performance crop yield was significantly affected by the cropping system and tillage method p 0 05 table 1 the mean grain yield was respectively increased by 198 3 and 88 9 for smc and wmr compared to wwc as for the tillage methods the average yield of st was higher compared to the other tillage methods the interaction between cropping system and tillage had a significant effect on the grain yield over the two cropping seasons 3 2 basic statistics of the soil water regime the soil moisture in the 0 5 0 m soil layer varied from 10 6 to 15 1 for wwc 11 3 15 8 for wmr and 14 4 16 8 for smc during the 2019 2021 experimental period table 2 the mean value of the soil moisture under different cropping systems was 12 6 14 1 and 16 1 for wwc wmr and smc respectively similar trends were observed for other soil water parameters i e soil water storage sws available soil water storage asws and soil water depletion swd as shown in table 2 the lowest value of the cv of the soil water parameters was also recorded for the smc cropping system differently than for the cropping systems no significant differences in the soil parameters were noted among the different tillage practices and conventional tillage ct had a relatively higher cv for the soil moisture in the surface layer 3 3 vertical distribution of soil moisture the vertical distribution of the soil moisture in the 0 5 0 m soil layer on the different sampling dates changed greatly among the various cropping systems fig 2 for different cropping systems with the same crop type the change pattern of the soil moisture showed a similar trend the soil moisture in the profile was much lower at the end of the growth period and the soil water consumption of spring maize mainly occurred in the 0 2 0 m soil layer however winter wheat used soil water below the 2 0 m soil depth and a dry soil layer at the 1 2 2 8 m soil depth was formed in the wwc system figs 2 and 3 this phenomenon was only observed in the wmr system in which the soil water was augmented by precipitation during the winter wheat fallow and maize growth periods little change in soil moisture was seen in smc during the experimental period although the soil water for wwc was supplemented by precipitation during the fallow period the rainfall infiltration depth was limited to only the 0 1 0 m soil profile figs 2 and 3 the variability of soil moisture in the vertical profile of the various cropping systems was also demonstrated by the diversity coefficient of variation cv in our study fig 4 the mean variations of soil moisture for wwc smc and wmr were 16 9 8 8 and 14 0 respectively in addition to the differences in the mean values the vertical distribution pattern of the cv was also different the cv of soil moisture in wwc system was extremely varied in the 0 3 0 m soil layer while it gradually decreased with increasing soil depth in the other cropping systems 3 4 soil water storage and water use efficiency time series for precipitation and soil water storage in the different soil layers are shown in fig 5 in the 0 2 0 m soil layer soil water storage fluctuated greatly for all cropping systems over the entire monitoring period but the changes in soil water storage in the deep soil layer were slight the soil water conditions were significantly affected by the cropping system over the study period p 0 05 but no significant differences in these parameters were observed for the different tillage practices fig 6 compared with smc the soil water depletion in wmr and wwc increased by 218 2 and 375 1 respectively the average water use efficiency wue was affected by both the cropping system and the tillage p 0 05 table 1 for the cropping system wue under smc was the highest in every cropping season and compared to smc the mean wue was respectively lower by 63 3 and 30 3 for wwc and wmr for tillage method wue was higher for st compared to that for the other tillage methods the interaction between cropping system and tillage had a significant effect on the wue during the two cropping seasons 3 5 spatial variability of temporal stability the ranked mean relative difference mrd of the soil moisture with the corresponding standard deviation of the relative difference sdrd as error bars along with the index of temporal stability its values is shown in fig 7 for the different cropping systems and tillage practices and the numerical values are shown in table 3 the soil moisture in the 0 2 0 m 0 3 0 m for wwc soil layer was lower than the mean value in the 0 5 0 m soil profile indicating that the mrd values were negative fig 7 the its of the soil moisture under wwc was highest in the 0 5 0 m soil profile respectively 34 7 and 53 9 higher than that of wmr and smc table 3 the vertical distribution of the its of soil moisture in the 0 5 0 m soil profile also changed with the various cropping systems the its of the soil moisture decreased with soil depth in smc and wmr but increased with soil depth in the 3 0 5 0 m soil layer for wwc fig 8 these results indicated that the spatial variability of the soil moisture was greater for the wwc system than for the other cropping systems and a cropping system containing maize might enhance the temporal stability of the soil moisture in the deep soil layer although the temporal stability of the soil moisture in the 0 5 0 m soil layer varied for different cropping systems and tillage practices the most temporally stable depth mtsd was found at a similar soil depth in the 2 0 3 0 m soil layer for each treatment fig 9 linear regression showed that the measured soil moisture at the mtsd was significantly correlated with the mean values in the 0 5 0 m soil layer for the different cropping systems p 0 05 fig 10 therefore the measured soil moisture values at the mtsd could be used as estimates of the mean soil moisture values in the soil profile for their respective cropping systems however the soil moisture values measured in the soil layers for the wwc system underestimated the mean soil moisture values fig 10 4 discussion 4 1 dynamics of soil water soil water regimes sws asws and swd in the 0 5 0 m soil depth were significantly affected by the cropping system over the study period p 0 05 but no significant differences in these parameters were observed among the different tillage practices fig 6 this was attributed to the fact that the tillage practices were mainly conducted in top soil layer 0 0 4 m and did not disturb the deep soil layer this is consistent with previous results celette et al 2008 wang et al 2018 zhai et al 2021 the spatio temporal variability of the soil moisture could be ascribed to climate conditions evapotranspiration crop yield and plant type starks et al 2006 jia and shao 2013 fry and guber 2020 wang et al 2015 revealed that soil water in the surface layer was greatly influenced by seasonal rainfall while the soil moisture in deep profile was mainly related to the root water uptake under homogeneous experimental conditions soil moisture was greatly decreased at the maturity stage and a dry soil layer was formed at a soil depth of 1 2 2 8 m in the wwc system figs 2 and 3 previous studies mainly focused on the soil profile within 0 2 0 m of agricultural fields guber et al 2008 baroni et al 2013 baskan et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 while our results showed that winter wheat can reduce the soil water at depths below 2 0 m therefore the detection depths used in previous studies contributed to underestimation of the soil water consumption for deep rooted crops studying the soil water regime in a shallow profile was not sufficient for deep rooted crops because it would lead to a poor understanding of soil water dynamics the deep soil water consumption of winter wheat was attributed to water uptake by the roots 87 of roots were distributed in the 0 1 2 m soil layer but these roots could extract water stored in deeper soil layers white and kirkegaard 2010 zhang et al 2016 furthermore the dry soil layer maintained its location in the spatial pattern and developed into a stable and persistent dry soil layer in the wwc system fig 3 it is difficult replenish the soil water when rainfall is limited wang et al 2011 this was well demonstrated by our results which showed that the precipitation only infiltrated into the 0 1 0 m profile even though it was abundant during the summer fallow period and the soil moisture below 1 0 m was still not replenished fig 2 this suggests that continuous winter wheat cropping causes land degradation and poses a greater potential barrier to the sustainable development of dryland agriculture therefore a different cropping system should be selected to achieve sustainable development of dryland agriculture in a rainfed ecosystem many studies have showed that winter wheat monoculture does not appear to be a sustainable management practice while crop rotation has the potential to improve agricultural sustainability in dryland regions huang et al 2003 wang et al 2008 in the present study the wwc system caused a dry soil layer to develop in the deep soil layer but this phenomenon did not occur in the wmr and smc systems figs 2 and 3 in these systems soil water consumption by spring maize was mainly detected in the 0 1 8 m soil layer because the maize roots were mostly concentrated in the 0 0 8 m soil layer and did not extract the deeper soil moisture zhou et al 2008 the crop rotation system combined deep rooted plants with shallow rooted plants realizing the complementary advantages of the two crops and the distribution of plant roots in a rotation system is likely to result in the recycling of soil water and nutrients below the root zone of shallow rooted plants huang et al 2003 zhou et al 2008 fry and guber 2020 in addition we speculated that this phenomenon was also related to the periodic wetting and drying conditions in crop rotation systems fig 3 the alternation of soil wetting and drying caused temporal changes in the pore volume the pore size distribution and the soil hydraulic properties hence enhancing the infiltration of rainfall and the utilization of deep water zhang et al 2019 yetbarek and ojha 2020 in the present study the dry soil layer was not adequately infiltrated during the winter wheat growing period after the fallow period of the wmr system from june of the first year to april of the next year but the soil water was completely replenished by precipitation after maize growth occurred because the amount of rainfall was sufficient to do so fig 2 a good soil water condition promoted wheat growth and allowed for a high grain yield and efficient water use table 3 especially for the soil water in the deep soil layer 4 2 temporal stability of soil moisture the temporal stability parameters of soil moisture were analyzed by various methods to identify the relationships between the soil moisture measured at the mtsd and the mean values in the 0 5 0 m soil layer the mrd indicated that the soil moisture during the experimental period in the 0 2 0 m 0 3 0 m for wwc soil layer was underestimated fig 7 the temporal stability of the soil moisture was also evaluated by the sdrd of the soil moisture and the points that had the lowest sdrd were considered as the most time stable teuling 2005 wang et al 2021 the mrd and sdrd clearly decreased with soil depth indicating that the soil water dynamics in the deeper soil layer were more stable with respect to time fry and guber 2020 in this study the its was used to determine the mtsd by combining the values of the mrd and sdrd jacobs et al 2004 zhao et al 2017 the depth with the lowest its value was considered as the most representative and the its in the deep soil layer was higher than that in the shallow layer fig 8 this is because the temporal stability of the shallow soil layer is more easily affected by climatic changes and surface hydrological conditions than that in the deeper layers starks et al 2006 wang et al 2015 although the mtsd under different cropping systems was similar in our study i e in the 2 0 3 0 m soil layer in each system the spatial variability pattern differed for each cropping system the its values in wmr and smc decreased with soil depth but increased in the deep soil profile below 3 0 m for the wwc system fig 8 this could be affected by the biomass the coverage and the root distribution and vitality of the different plant types zhou et al 2008 baroni et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 fortunately the mtsd as indicated by lower its values produced better estimates of the mean soil moisture in each cropping system fig 10 although the mtsd in the wwc system underestimated the soil moisture during the experimental period this may be related to the existence of the dry soil layer in the deep soil profile which was present at the mtsd in the wwc system previous results also suggested that drier soil corresponded to greater temporal stability martınez fernandez and ceballos 2003 li and shao 2014 therefore we speculated that the mechanism for the formation of the mtsd differed for different cropping systems the mtsd in wmr and smc was conducive to a balanced soil moisture content but was affected by the dry soil layer in the deep soil in the wwc these results provide a strong theoretical basis for understanding the formation of the mtsd and accurately estimating the soil moisture in a rainfed agroecosystem 4 3 crop yield and water use grain yield and wue were highly variable across every growing season which was mainly attributed to the various precipitation amount and distribution in dryland agriculture rusinamhodzi et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 li et al 2021 our experiment showed that the smc and wmr system had a significantly p 0 05 higher crop yield and a better potential for enhancing water use compared to wwc system table 1 this finding may be attributed to the rainfall distribution and crop water consumption in our study area the rainfall season coincides relatively with the maize growing season while the precipitation during wheat growth period cannot meet the needs of wheat growth thus leading to the lower grain yield li et al 2021 tillage is an important management practice for affecting soil water condition and crop yield from the rainfed production system rusinamhodzi et al 2011 sun et al 2018 in this experiment st significantly increased the crop yield and wue when compared with ct and nt for the three cropping systems these findings were supported by previous studies showing that st improves soil physical properties promote soil water storage and increasing crop productivity lópez fando and pardo 2009 li et al 2021 although the nt treatment had better soil water conditions than ct at the sowing stage but the poor soil structure over the long term under nt treatment limited the growth of crops leading to low crop yields and wue zhang et al 2018 therefore we believe that the adoption of rotational conservation tillage practices i e a combination of conservation and conventional tillage probably results in higher crop productivity and water use when compared to continuous single tillage practices 5 conclusions in this study we evaluated some soil water regimes sws asws and swd temporal stability of the soil moisture represented by the mrd sdrd and its and crop yield in an agricultural field on the loess plateau in china the wmr and smc systems combined with st practice showed the higher crop yield and water use efficiency compared to the wwc system long term continuous cropping of a deep rooted crop i e winter wheat caused serious soil water depletion and the formation of a dry soil layer in the deep soil profile however if reasonable management measures were taken such as rotating a deep rooted crop with a shallow rooted crop the negative effects caused by deep rooted crops were reduced the wmr and smc cropping systems reduced the soil water depletion and increased the temporal stability of the soil moisture especially in the deep soil layer in addition a more accurate estimate of the soil moisture was obtained for wmr and smc systems which would allow more effective monitoring of soil water conditions in the field therefore wmr and smc have the potential to improve dryland agricultural sustainability the results obtained from this study are of great significance to the sustainable utilization of limited water resources the evaluation of soil water availability and scientific management practices for arable lands in the major grain producing area of the loess plateau as well as

introduction pecans are a main crop in new mexico s lower rio grande valley lrgv new mexico is one of the major pecan producers in the united states where the shell nuts production was 35 74 million kilograms in 2020 usda nass 2021 pecan is also known as a major water consumer in the lrgv where the annual evapotranspiration et is estimated to be as high as 1400 mm samani et al 2009 pecan production is highly depended on irrigation in the lrgv because of shortages in precipitation the high water consumption combined with two decades of drought have created an urgent need for better understanding of pecan water use in the area a recent climate change study in lrgv showed that the increased temperature and prolonged growing season in the lrgv have resulted in increased pecan seasonal consumptive use mokari et al 2021 flood irrigation is the common irrigation method for pecan in the lrgv understanding the real time crop consumptive use and proper irrigation scheduling are critical factors in increasing irrigation efficiency low irrigation efficiency contributes to less water availability for crops and results in less productivity and water use efficiency ahadi et al 2013 calculated basin wide irrigation efficiencies in lrgv using et values estimated from satellite imageries and ground level on farm water delivery record they showed that on farm irrigation efficiency in the lrgv pecan orchards varied from 15 to 95 with average efficiency of 60 the low irrigation efficiencies in the area are the result of improper irrigation scheduling lack of information on real time crop water and improper field and water management system design pecan water use varies throughout the growing season with peak consumptive use occurring at mid summer there are various methods for estimating pecan consumptive use the methods range from theoretical approach which uses crop coefficients kc and reference evapotranspiration etr allen et al 1998 to real time et measurement using eddy covariance method samani et al 2009 the advances in remote sensing technology have provided a powerful tool to estimate real time pecan water use in large scale samani et al 2009 2011 wang et al 2007 however the spatial resolution provided by multispectral satellite imagery does not provide sufficient resolution needed for small scale farms piñón villarrea aldo et al 2020 the availability of satellite images is often limited due infrequent satellite overpass and cloudiness in addition to the complexity of data analysis and the lag time associated with data availability

objective of this study is to extend the methodology developed by mokari et al 2022 for application of flood irrigated pecan orchards when the canopy cover is changed in the growing season the extended methodology is then used to estimate the real time pecan water use as well as the seasonal irrigation efficiency in addition the estimated seasonal irrigation efficiency is compared to the simplified chloride tracing method which is a practical and low cost method for estimating on farm irrigation efficiency 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study was carried out in a flood irrigated pecan orchard located in the leyendecker plant science research center psrc of new mexico state university the area of the orchard is about 1 1 ha with pawnee pecan trees planted in a 9 m 9 m pattern the orchard is under flood irrigation and a total of 9 irrigations was applied in the orchard during 2021 growing season the sources of irrigation were surface water and groundwater the soil is classified as clay loam 74 and silty loam 26 the orchard is under similar tillage operations management including chiseling before first irrigation disking and cultivating followed by land leveling 2 2 uav thermal imaging based et model the modified simplified surface energy balance ssebop model proposed by mokari et al 2022 estimates real time actual evapotranspiration eta using thermal images taken from uav mounted thermal sensor this model is the modified version of ssebop model which was first developed by senay 2018 to calculate eta using satellite images the ssebop model applies an energy balance approach in which the latent heat flux is solved at the daily time to make the ssebop model work when thermal images from a uav are used the modified ssebop model mokari et al 2022 was proposed as follow 1 et a k 1 t c t a t d t a et 0 where eta is the actual evapotranspiration mm d k is the scaling coefficient which was found 0 75 for the pecan partial canopy mokari et al 2022 tc is the average temperature in the sensor scene ta is the air temperature td is the dry spot surface temperature in the sensor scene and et0 is reference evapotranspiration mm d in this study the coefficient k in eq 1 was calculated by a model proposed by samani et al 2011 they proposed a coefficient to correct the effect of partial canopy in pecan orchards as follow 2 k 0 6035 f c 0 480 where k is the correction factor and fc is the canopy cover which was calculated as 0 544 in this study 2 3 chloride tracing method chloride is a natural anion present in soil and water which can be used as a tracing element to track the water movement in irrigated fields it works as a natural tracer to evaluate movement and transport of soluble nutrients in water present in soils pratt et al 1978 and samani et al 2005 showed that the fraction of irrigation water percolating below the root zone can be calculated using the chloride concentration in irrigation water and soil moisture below the root

the studied flood irrigated pecan orchard at 70 80 m height above the ground during 2021 growing season fig 1 shows a typical image taken from a uav in the visible and thermal ranges ta was obtained from the weather station located in psrc of new mexico state university the climatic data from weather station were used to calculate daily et0 following the fao penman monteith equation allen et al

schedule for the studied flood irrigated pecan orchard re was calculated following the proposed method by usda scs 1967 to determine cli irrigation water samples were taken at the beginning of the orchard soil samples below the root zone at the end of growing season in different locations of the orchard were taken in order to determine clp after that the chloride concentration of samples were measured in the lab in this study the average chloride concentration from irrigation water and the chloride concentration in soil below the root zone were used to calculate the seasonal irrigation efficiency using eq 4 3 results and discussion the proposed correction coefficient model eq 2 proposed by samani et al 2011 was validated using data obtained from mokari et al 2022 study to assure the validity of this model eq 2 for determining the k value which is crucial for estimating eta using uav thermal imaging model eq 1 the modified ssebop model eq 1 mokari et al 2022 was calibrated and validated k 0 75 using historical water consumption for a pecan orchard where the canopy cover fc was 45 this model did not account for the effect of fc on the k coefficient there is potential of underestimation or overestimation in eta when fc is not taken into account thus the constant scaling coefficient of 0 75 needs to be modified when fc is changed table 2 shows the comparison of estimated eta for mokari et al 2022 study using two different approaches of calculating k value with applied water based on eta it is clear that the estimated eta using k value calculated by eq 2 were in strong agreement with estimated eta using k value of 0 75 obtained from a calibration validation approach where the rmse values were found 8 78 mm month and 8 87 mm month with respect to applied water based on eta respectively table 2 fig 2 shows the temporal variations of daily pecan eta during 2021 growing season pecan eta increased quite sharply over the time period day of year doy 91 april 1 to doy 166 jun 15 then pecan eta decreased gradually for the rest of the time period pecan eta is variable during the growing season as the climatic factors are changed findings showed that the maximum pecan eta occurred in jun because of increased temperatures in this month resulted in more water demand by pecan trees table 3 shows and compares irrigation efficiency in a flood irrigated pecan orchard using two different approaches the comparison showed almost the same irrigation efficiency by both approaches although the obtained irrigation efficiencies were within the expected irrigation efficiency from surface irrigation methods there is potential to improve on farm irrigation efficiency ahadi et al 2013 reported the pecan irrigation efficiency in the lrgv ranging from 15 to 95 with average of 60 which shows the great potential of improving surface irrigation efficiency in the area through proper irrigation scheduling and water management the high irrigation efficiency reported by ahadi et al 2013 is most likely due to deficit irrigation caused by improper irrigation scheduling the uav thermal imaging method provide an efficient tool for improving pecan irrigation efficiency through precise determination of pecan water requirement and proper irrigation scheduling the relatively high irrigation efficiency in this study is due to proper irrigation scheduling and short length of run in this particular orchard 4 conclusion this study presents a methodology for calculating real time pecan water use by extending the k coefficient calculation based on pecan canopy the methodology can be extended for a wide range of pecan canopy cover which is typical of pecan cover variability in the lrgv the methodology was used to calculate real time seasonal water use and irrigation efficiency the comparison shows that the seasonal irrigation efficiency estimated by this method compares well with the on farm irrigation efficiency calculated through chloride tracing

9322,pecans are a major crop in new mexico s lower rio grande valley lrgv where about 30 of pecans are produced in usa due to low amount of precipitation in the lrgv pecans are highly depended on irrigation from surface and ground water the area has gone through two decades of drought which has significantly reduced the availability of surface water there is an urgent need for proper estimation of crop water use and irrigation scheduling to improve water use efficiency and productivity the objective of this study is to extend a recently developed model for calculating real time pecan water use eta from uav thermal imaging when the canopy cover is variable the extended methodology was used to calculate eta and seasonal irrigation efficiency the calculated seasonal irrigation efficiency was compared with irrigation efficiency estimated by chloride tracing method the results showed the proposed methodology can be used to calculate eta and on farm irrigation efficiency in the area when pecan canopy cover is changed keywords evapotranspiration flood irrigation irrigation efficiency pecan thermal imaging data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction pecans are a main crop in new mexico s lower rio grande valley lrgv new mexico is one of the major pecan producers in the united states where the shell nuts production was 35 74 million kilograms in 2020 usda nass 2021 pecan is also known as a major water consumer in the lrgv where the annual evapotranspiration et is estimated to be as high as 1400 mm samani et al 2009 pecan production is highly depended on irrigation in the lrgv because of shortages in precipitation the high water consumption combined with two decades of drought have created an urgent need for better understanding of pecan water use in the area a recent climate change study in lrgv showed that the increased temperature and prolonged growing season in the lrgv have resulted in increased pecan seasonal consumptive use mokari et al 2021 flood irrigation is the common irrigation method for pecan in the lrgv understanding the real time crop consumptive use and proper irrigation scheduling are critical factors in increasing irrigation efficiency low irrigation efficiency contributes to less water availability for crops and results in less productivity and water use efficiency ahadi et al 2013 calculated basin wide irrigation efficiencies in lrgv using et values estimated from satellite imageries and ground level on farm water delivery record they showed that on farm irrigation efficiency in the lrgv pecan orchards varied from 15 to 95 with average efficiency of 60 the low irrigation efficiencies in the area are the result of improper irrigation scheduling lack of information on real time crop water and improper field and water management system design pecan water use varies throughout the growing season with peak consumptive use occurring at mid summer there are various methods for estimating pecan consumptive use the methods range from theoretical approach which uses crop coefficients kc and reference evapotranspiration etr allen et al 1998 to real time et measurement using eddy covariance method samani et al 2009 the advances in remote sensing technology have provided a powerful tool to estimate real time pecan water use in large scale samani et al 2009 2011 wang et al 2007 however the spatial resolution provided by multispectral satellite imagery does not provide sufficient resolution needed for small scale farms piñón villarrea aldo et al 2020 the availability of satellite images is often limited due infrequent satellite overpass and cloudiness in addition to the complexity of data analysis and the lag time associated with data availability and analysis mokari et al 2022 a more practical and low cost alternative is the use of unmanned aerial vehicles uavs uavs provide a low cost alternative for real time irrigation without the limitations associated with satellite images mokari et al 2022 this technique can improve water use efficiency crop productivity and compatibility in irrigated agriculture uavs can be operated easily

uav based wdi index for estimating et values gautam et al 2021 developed a uav based technique to estimate kc in order to monitor the spatial variability of water requirements in a vineyard this uav based approach enhances irrigation precision as the spatial variability of kc is taken into account mokari et al 2022 investigated the application of a uav based thermal sensor to develop a model for estimating pecan water use in a drip irrigated young pecan orchard with 45 canopy cover they calibrated and validated their proposed model using applied irrigation water based on actual et the

9323,water rights trading volume wrtv is an integral part of an effective transaction at present in china wrtv is mostly based on the water demand of the transferee not the transferor some transactions last for a long time yet lack proper measures to adjust trading volume making theoretical and quantitative studies on wrtv necessary and essential therefore based on the theory of property rights this study first analyzed the concept of wrtv and proposed that wrtv must consider the tradable water volume twv of the transaction parties for that this paper divided water rights trading into two stages initial stage and operation stage to analyze how to measure wrtv in different stages second currently industry or sector is a major player of water rights trading twv of industry is hence the difference between the initial water rights volume iwrv and water demand of industry significant for calculating wrtv in different stages for that this study employed the ratio method to calculate the iwrv of industry and the grey model gm 1 1 to predict the water demand of industry last this paper carried out a case study on the inter league and inter city water rights trading between bayannur city and ordos city in inner mongolia china results show that the twv of industry of bayannur and ordos in 2030 are 904 966 million m3 and 87 135 million m3 respectively implying insufficient twv for the transferee which may lead to transaction breakdown the theory and calculation method of wrtv proposed in this study lay a theoretical foundation for wrtv measurement and can help facilitate the orderly development of water rights trading in china graphical abstract ga1 abbreviations wrtv the water rights trading volume twv the tradable water volume iwrv the initial water rights volume gm1 1 grey model 1 1 mwr china s ministry of water resources keywords wrtv twv stages of water rights trading data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water is the foundation of human survival and development yet the global water resources are limited and unevenly distributed world population growth economic development and climate change dramatically increase global water consumption and worsen water crisis null and prudencio 2016 according to the report of food and agriculture in 2020 issued by fao 3 2 billion people in the world suffer from water shortage and about 1 2 billion people live in agricultural areas with serious water issues china is also suffering from insufficient drinkable water and uneven spatiotemporal distribution of water resources to be specific statistics show that nearly two thirds of china s cities are short of water in varying degrees and 110 cities lose cny 200 billion annually due to water issues qian et al 2015 globally water shortage has become a serious obstacle to the socioeconomic development fang and zhang 2020 even endangering national security each country has a distinctive history of water rights trading from the late 1990s to the beginning of the 21st century water governance models have been transformed in a profound way around the world one critical transformation is transition of the demand side management from a state led and construction focused approach to a market oriented approach wang et al 2019 water rights trading as an effective water governance model is outstanding in optimizing the allocation of water resources via market mechanism and alleviating the uneven spatiotemporal distribution of water resources y b wang et al 2017 y h wang et al 2017 water rights markets in australia the united states and chile are well developed serving as global examples mexico and peru learn from chile s water rights trading system and introduce the market mechanism to allocate its water resources meanwhile the water rights market in spain relies on strong governmental intervention with a legal framework designed to keep improving water rights market in south asia especially in india jia et al 2016 and pakistan informal water rights trading is preferred in the irrigation sector in the meantime in iran the inefficient water allocation system forces policy makers and water resources planners to consider introducing the market mechanism as a solution jansouz et al 2017 globally to optimize the allocation of water resources water rights trading plays a significant role china s water rights trading started between dongyang and yiwu in zhejiang province in 2000 later gansu ningxia and inner mongolia also started trading water rights in 2014 china s ministry of water resources mwr proposed to pilot different types of water rights trading in seven provinces and regions ningxia jiangxi hubei inner mongolia henan gansu and guangdong to extensively promote water rights system at present water rights trading has been conducted in dongjiang river basin of guangdong province shule river basin of gansu province bayannur and ordos of inner mongolia jiwotian channel administration in guanling county and guizhou kong on cement co ltd of guizhou province in a word water rights trading breaks the conventional water distribution by administrative means and reflects the positive effects of market mechanism on water distribution in china y b wang et al 2017 y h wang et al 2017 many scholars studied the water rights system and water rights trading from different angles in terms of construction and internal mechanism of water rights system bauer 1997 drew from chile s experience in developing water market and proposed that the operation of water market is subject to multiple factors like law politics system economy and culture hence the need to be cautious by reviewing the status of water rights market in china and other countries y b wang et al 2017 y h wang et al 2017 systematically explored how china s unique characteristics influence the structure of its water rights market and emphasized the importance of establishing the mode and rules of water rights trading supervision system and water price policy li and gu 2019 analyzed the foundations of china s water rights trading from legal system initial water rights market platforms hardware facilities and external motivations and proposed relevant policy suggestions in terms of market efficiency based on the australian water market pigram 1993 pointed out that the external problems of market reform cannot be solved by private ownership f p wu et al 2018 c f wu et al 2018 analyzed the effect of return flows of third party in water rights trading and deemed it a challenge to the efficiency and fairness of water rights market tian 2019 proposed to enhance the whole process supervision of water rights trading to prevent market failures in terms of influencing factors of water rights trading bjornlund and mckay 2002 found that the cost of water rights market includes system cost and cost of water conservancy facilities higher cost would affect market formation and development shen et al 2016 put forth that water rights trading includes necessary conditions such as clear laws and regulations enough water quantity monitoring measurement cost system and externalities like the third party li et al 2018 analyzed the eco environment of water rights trading from the angles of river runoff groundwater eco flow water ecosystem and water quality and highlighted the importance of eco environmental effects in a word water rights trading contains multiple parts f p wu et al 2018 c f wu et al 2018 proposed that water rights trading includes transaction parties price volume and period all of which are critical to the validity of transaction in addition many scholars treated transaction price as the essential factor and carried out in depth research murdock et al 1991 suggested that pricing of water rights trading should consider social economy population natural environment and other factors additionally scholars drew from the rational expectations theory michelsen et al 2000 the game theory x c liu et al 2018 x q liu et al 2018 the shadow pricing method wu and li 2019 and the improved rpi x ni et al 2019 for the pricing of water rights trading compared with studies on pricing wrtv also an integral part of water rights trading has not received enough attention countries vary in wrtv regulations in 1982 the california drought water bank of the united states allowed water suppliers to transport the remaining purified water outside their jurisdictions chen 2012 defining the source of wrtv in the water rights markets in brazil and spain water rights trading requires sufficient information on wrtv and infrastructure for measuring and transporting water resources mariño and kemper 1999 in japan twv is actual water withdrawal by right owners in the previous year minus the amount sold to the market then plus the amount purchased twv directly influences wrtv according to regulation on the administration of the license for water drawing and the levy of water resource fees issued by mwr of china wrtv is water quantity saved by adjusting product and industrial structure improving technology and taking water saving measures furthermore scholars have probed into wrtv from various perspectives for example hu et al 2014 suggested to treat actual water users as subjects of water rights turn water drawing rights into water consumption rights and define water rights as water consumption rights to facilitate property ownership and the development of water rights trading moreover wang 2018 carried out a qualitative analysis on the potential of water rights trading in qingdao city china c f wu et al 2018 f p wu et al 2018 looked into the framework of water rights trading and proposed to calculate wrtv based on water saving potential chen et al 2021a 2021b in accordance with policies and practices in china put forth the concept of tradable controlled quantity compared it with twv analyzed the behaviors of quasi transaction parties and performed an empirical analysis on changsha city of china chen et al 2021a 2021b deemed agriculture a critical transferor in water rights trading put forward methods to calculate agricultural twv based on repaying iwrv excess and analyzed twv of hetao irrigation district in inner mongolia however wrtv is mostly determined in a unidimensional and static way for example wrtv of dongyang yiwu water rights trading the first practice in china is determined as 49 99 million m3 based on the water demand of yiwu city the transferee with little attention paid to the transferor wrtv between zhongning county and ningxia jingneng zhongning power station in ningxia hui autonomous region was determined by the water status of transaction parties with transaction period of 15 years lacking efficient methods to adjust wrtv to deal with future changes in water resources there are still unsolved problems in current studies 1 wrtv is an integral element of water rights trading of practical significance to theoretical research 2 wrtv must consider the twv of both transferor and transferee and there are not enough studies on how to quantify wrtv based on the water status of transaction parties 3 wrtv changes with the twv of transaction parties but how such variation affects mid and long term water rights trading 1 1 according to the china water exchange website the transaction period of water rights trading varies along with the forms of trading the period of irrigation water rights trade is usually one year while the periods of water drawing rights trading and regional water rights trading are different 25 years at most in this paper transaction period of more than 5 years is defined as mid and long term water rights trading still needs exploring studies of chen et al 2021a 2021b explored twv solely from the perspective of the transferor nonetheless this study considered both transferor and transferee to calculate wrtv in a more precise way in detail based on property rights and twv chen et al 2021a 2021b this study conducted a theoretical and quantitative study on wrtv and considered the twv of both transferor and transferee in determining wrtv to be more specific twv is the difference between iwrv and water demand iwrv is a mandatory government regulation while water demand the minimum water quantity for the guarantee of agricultural industrial and domestic use according to china s water rights trading cases this study divided water rights trading into two stages initial stage and operation stage as iwrv and water demand vary wrtv would change in different stages yielding various effects on water rights trading therefore this study applied the method of determining wrtv to the inter league and inter city water rights trading in inner mongolia of china providing relevant policy suggestions research framework is shown in fig 1 2 basic theory of wrtv 2 1 analysis on wrtv based on property rights theory property rights as an important concept in new institutional economics is the most fundamental part of human social structure a token of one s socioeconomic status in utilizing scarce resources bel 2018 with the rapid development of economy and society water becomes scarcer gradually turning into a typical economic product even a huge hindrance to social development talbot jones and bennett 2019 in 2019 china issued the guiding opinions on coordinating and promoting the reform of property rights system for natural resources assets it proposed to establish a property rights system for natural resources assets with clear ownership rights and responsibilities and effective supervision to promote the intensive utilization and protection of natural resources therefore water rights are how property rights is embodied in water use compatible with the general theories of property rights in china water belongs to the state so to give full play to the use value of water resources china allocates the right to use water to separate the ownership and right of use and water rights trading is to transfer the right to use water resource on the basis of excludable water rights and clear initial allocation of water rights wrtv is the object of water rights trading foundation for optimizing the allocation of water resources and premise of a successful transaction thus wrtv measurement is of great significance which must consider the water status of each transaction party and twv reflects such status from the perspective of property rights to be specific twv equals iwrv after the latter meets the production living and ecological needs of transaction parties china s current initial allocation of water rights is from the state to basins then to provinces autonomous region municipality cities county township industries and finally users dou and wang 2017 provincial and municipal iwrv is allocated according to the national distribution plan meanwhile end users of water resources are large in number yet scattered in distribution consuming relatively small amount of water and to determine their initial water rights the ratio method is commonly used in addition industry or sector is the dominant player of water rights trading in china yet the iwrv of industry lacks clear policy guidance making the calculation of iwrv of industry imperative in addition water rights trading boosts the water flow from inefficient industries or users to efficient ones and in china one common tendency is water transfer from agriculture to industry agriculture consumes and wastes plenty of water resulting in low water efficiency while industry has high water efficiency yet insufficient water resources according to the interim measures for the administration of water right trading by mwr of china in 2016 in regional water rights trading the amount of water transferred by the transferor takes up the quota for the total water consumption and river water allocation of the administrative region while amount of water actually received by the transferee do not take up the quota water rights trading between agriculture and industry conforms to the relevant provisions of water license the proportion of water consumption of industry over the past years was applied in this study to calculate iwrv of industry as the ratio method considers the water demand of industry oluwaseun and desmond 2019 it is suitable for calculating iwrv allocation additionally this study chose gm 1 1 to predict water demand for it compared with other methods can produce more precise results with less data and poorer information liu et al 2014 and with strong applicability twv of transaction parties equals the difference between iwrv and water demand for production living and ecology and can be positive negative or zero different types of twv yield various effects on the behaviors of transaction parties detailed analysis is shown in table 1 2 2 analysis on wrtv in different stages according to the water rights trading period and changes of water resources in china this study divided water rights trading into two stages initial stage and operation stage according to regulation on the administration of the license for water drawing and the levy of water resource fees 2017amendament issued by the state council the water drawing license is generally valid for 5 years no more than 10 years in this study the initial stage is when transaction parties reach an agreement that lasts for no more than 5 years with small changes in the water resources of transaction parties the operation period on the other hand starts from the 6th years to the end of transaction with large changes in water resources of transaction parties of course there are various ways to determine wrtv in different stages 2 2 1 wrtv in the initial stage a driving force of water rights trading is strong intention of transaction parties 2 2 driving forces of water rights trading include twv water use efficiency and trading revenue this paper took wrtv as the main research object without considering other factors one party may encounter an economic hinderance due to water shortage thus urgent to buy water rights and the transferor happens to have sufficient water resources willing to exchange water rights for economic benefits in the initial stage the intention of the transferee is stronger than that of the transferor and the foundation of a successful transaction is that the transferor has enough tradable water to meet the transferee s demand if the amount of water from the transferor fails to meet the demand of the transferee the transferee may stop trading again for cost and benefit concerns and switch to another transferor that can meet its demand therefore wrtv in this stage is transferor s tradable water volume that meets the demand of the transferor w t e e 2 2 2 wrtv in the operation stage twv affects wrtv and the market trend of water rights trading in the operation stage as economy and society advance water demand also changes constantly carrying out new projects requires more water while new water saving technologies and measures could improve water use efficiency and cut water consumption at the same time in response to the climate change national water policies also get modified constantly which also leads to modifications in iwrv therefore as for mid and long term water rights trading twv of both transferor and transferee varies along with iwrv and water demand resulting in different wrtv in the operation period as shown in table 2 table 2 shows that in the operation period a precondition for the transaction to go on is positive twv of the transferor the transferor is able to keep providing water supply for the transferee when the transferor s twv is negative the transaction may break down meanwhile water status of the transferee may be different from that in the initial stage so wrtv would change accordingly 3 method 3 1 twv of industry as mentioned above industry is a major part of water rights trading and twv of industry a premise of wrtv calculation twv of industry is the difference between iwrv and water demand of industry 3 1 1 allocation of iwrv of industry this study employed the ratio method to calculate iwrv of industry hence according to the proportion of water consumption of industry over the past years in the total water consumption the distribution ratio of iwrv of industry in the regional iwrv is determined as shown in eq 1 1 w i a w a ν i w a t 1 m q i t t 1 m q t where w ia is the iwrv of the industry i million m3 w a the regional iwrv million m3 v i the distribution ratio of the iwrv of industry i in the regional iwrv q it the water consumption of industry i at year t million m3 and q t the regional water consumption at year t million m3 3 1 2 predicting water demand of industry based on gm 1 1 in this study based on the water consumption of industry over the past years gm 1 1 liu et al 2014 was used to predict water demand of industry the original sequence is where z 0 k 0 k 1 2 3 n refers to the water consumption of industry over the past years the grade ratio of the sequence should be within the tolerance interval e 2 n 1 e 2 n 1 if the grade ratio cannot meet the requirement the original sequence needs to be modified to fall into the tolerance interval taking the constant p for translation transformation as shown in eq 2 2 x 0 k z 0 k p k 1 2 3 n first order accumulated generating operation 1 ago sequence was used to make the original sequence less random and volatile as shown in eq 3 3 x 1 x 1 1 x 1 2 x 1 n moreover first order univariate differential equation was used to fit the whitening equation of gm 1 1 4 d x 1 d t α x 1 μ the parameters were obtained via the least squares method 5 α μ t b t b 1 b t y n where 6 b 1 2 x 1 1 x 1 2 1 1 2 x 1 2 x 1 3 1 1 2 x 1 n 1 x 1 n 1 7 y n x 0 2 x 0 3 x 0 n the time response equation

industry as shown in eq 14 14 w i t w i a w i d where w it represents the twv of industry i million m3 w ia the iwrv of industry i million m3 and w id the water demand of industry i million m3 3 2 calculating wrtv wrtv is determined based on the twv of both transferor and transferee there are different methods to calculate wrtv in different stages 3 2 1 wrtv in the initial stage the key to water rights trading is that the transferor has surplus water within the scope of iwrv and has enough twv to meet the water demand of the transferee in this stage wrtv is the absolute value of twv of the transferee as shown in eq 15 15 w v w t e e w t o r 0 w t e e 0 w t o r w t e e where w t o r represents the twv of the transferor million m3 w t e e the twv of the transferee million m3 and w v the wrtv million m3 3 2 2 wrtv in the operation stage in the operation stage the water status of transaction parties may change as may the twv of transaction parties therefore to guarantee a successful transaction the transferor should be able to keep providing water resources in this stage wrtv should be within the twv of the transferor as shown in eq 16 16 w v w t o r w t o r 0 twv of the transferor must be above 0 if it is less than 0 the transferor suffers from water shortage and has no surplus water so the transaction has to stop while the twv of the transferee may be in a variety of situations 4 study area and data 4 1 study area 4 1 1 progress of water rights system in inner mongolia inner mongolia enjoys abundant natural resources and a large population since china initiated the reform and opening up policy the economy of inner mongolia has boomed making it an energy and heavy chemical base in china however water scarcity has become a bottleneck restricting the socioeconomic development of inner mongolia hence to solve water related issues inner mongolia has established water rights system carried out trading practices and eventually made major breakthroughs the progress of water right trading in inner mongolia is shown in the fig 3 in a word inner mongolia provides profuse experience and serves as an example for promoting water rights system and water rights trading in china 4 1 2 hetao irrigation district in bayannur city and industrial enterprises in ordos city 4 1 2 1 background bayannur city is located in the west of inner mongolia hetao irrigation district is located in bayannur the north end of the ji shaped bend of the yellow river over 200 km in length from east to west and 40 60 km in width from south to north with a total land area of about 1 1194 million hm2 it is one of the three super large irrigation districts in china and the largest artesian water diversion irrigation district in asia hetao irrigation district is located in the desert and arid area with low rainfall and high evaporation about 130 mm of average annual rainfall and 2300 mm of average annual evaporation the main source of its agricultural water is the yellow river and it totally depends on irrigation for agriculture and living environment li and zhang 2017 in addition hetao irrigation district is a key base for marketable grain and oil production in china according to bayannur water affairs bureau from 2009 to 2020 the city conducted multiple agricultural water saving projects reconstructed about 100 700 hm2 of water saving irrigation area and built about 318 700 hm2 of high efficiency water saving irrigation area now hetao irrigation district has become a critical transferor of water rights trading in inner mongolia located in the southwest of inner mongolia and on the ordos plateau ordos city connects bayannur in the north covering an area of 86 600 hm2 with an altitude of 1000 1500 m ordos city is in the arid and semi arid area with only 2 629 billion m3 of annual average total water resources and little underground and surface water 190 400 mm of annual average rainfall and 2500 mm of annual average evaporation in addition special geographical conditions give ordos rich reserves of coal oil natural gas and other energy and mineral resources as well as profuse chemical resources like natural alkali and mirabilite dong et al 2019 and industrial progress also drives the economy of ordos x c liu et al 2018 x q liu et al 2018 in recent years ordos as the energy and heavy chemical industry base in inner mongolia has implemented major projects on coal electric power and chemical industry zhou et al 2020 however these projects are hindered by a major obstacle water shortage the map of ordos city and hetao irrigation district in bayannur city is shown in fig 4 4 1 2 2 water rights trading between hetao irrigation district in bayannur and industrial enterprises in ordos in 2014 inner mongolia decided to carry out pilot projects of water rights trading of the main stream cities of yellow river according to the china water exchange website 79 transactions have been made in inner mongolia since 2016 with a total wrtv of 2 6191025 billion m3 among them 23 deals were struck between bayannur and ordos with a total wrtv of 687 8525 million m3 and the transaction period of 25 years the transferor was the general administration of hetao irrigation district of inner mongolia but its wrtv actually came from agricultural water of hetao irrigation district the transferee was the industrial enterprises of ordos city these deals were signed between 2017 and 2020 with a 25 year transaction period and by 2030 the deals are all in the operation period so this study only predicted wrtv in the operation period 4 2 data in 1987 based on the actual water consumption in 1980 the state council of china analyzed the irrigation scale growth of industrial and urban water consumption in provinces and regions along the yellow river and implemented an allocation plan on the available water of yellow river called the yellow river water allocation scheme scheme 87 in short according to scheme 87 water consumption quota of the yellow river allocated to inner mongolia is 5 86 billion m3 per year and inner mongolia further allocates its quota to the leagues and cities and determines their iwrv to be specific the annual iwrv of bayannur is 4 billion m3 and that of ordos is 700 million m3 scheme 87 takes water consumption as the standard for allocation but in reality the conversion of water consumption and water withdrawal is affected by many factors resulting in unstable data in 2012 opinions of the state council on applying the strictest water resources control system was issued by the state council to address growing water challenges and require all regions to control the total amount of water consumption and conduct regular assessment the opinion paved the way ahead for water consumption management in china and this study took the total amount of water consumption as the regional iwrv in 2015 opinions of bayannur municipal people s government on applying the strictest water resources management system stipulated that the total water consumption of bayannur city should be controlled within 4 980 billion m3 by 2030 regarded as the iwrv of bayannur in 2030 in this study in 2014 notice of ordos municipal people s government on tasks of the strictest water resources management system stipulated that the total water consumption of ordos in 2030 must be within 1 994 billion m3 regarded as the iwrv of ordos in 2030 in this study hetao irrigation district a key grain producing area in bayannur consumes plenty of agricultural water therefore this study used agricultural water consumption in bayannur to represent the agricultural water consumption of hetao irrigation district and ordos did not allocate iwrv for each industrial enterprise making it difficult to calculate the twv of industrial enterprises therefore this study used the industrial water consumption of ordos to represent the water consumption of industrial enterprises that had already been involved in water rights trading data on agricultural water consumption in bayannur and industrial water consumption in ordos during 2013 2019 was collected from inner mongolia water resources bulletin as shown in table 4 according to table 4 and eq 1 the proportion of agricultural water consumption in bayannur is 88 93 and that of industrial water consumption in ordos is 17 41 5 results 5 1 twv of hetao irrigation district of bayannur in 2030 5 1 1 agricultural iwrv of hetao irrigation district in 2030 in 2030 iwrv of bayannur city is 4 980 billion m3 and the proportion of agricultural water consumption is 88 93 indicating that the iwrv of hetao irrigation district in 2030 equals 4 428714 billion m3 5 1 2 predicting agricultural water demand of hetao irrigation district in 2030 according to the grey system theory gm 1 1 of agricultural water demand of hetao irrigation district in bayannur in 2030 is as follows 17 x ˆ a g r 1 k 3395 4043 e 0 0126 k 3355 2143 k 1 2 3 n the model fitting results are shown in table 5 the mean squared error ratio of agricultural water demand prediction model of hetao irrigation district is c 0 3835 correlation degree is ς 0 9995 relative error is low meeting the accuracy requirement the development coefficient is 0 0126 less than 0 3 proving that the model is suitable for mid and long term prediction liu et al 2014 according to eq 17 the agricultural water demand of hetao irrigation district in 2030 is 5 33368 billion m3 5 1 3 calculating twv of hetao irrigation district in 2030 according to the eq 14 twv of hetao irrigation district of bayannur city in 2030 is 904 966 million m3 5 2 twv of ordos in 2030 5 2 1 iwrv in industrial sector of ordos in 2030 in 2030 iwrv of ordos city is 1 994 billion m3 and the proportion of industrial water consumption is 17 41 indicating that the iwrv in industrial sector of ordos city in 2030 is 347 1554 million m3 5 2 2 predicting industrial water demand of ordos in 2030 according to the grey system theory industrial water consumption of ordos during 2012 2019 is not within the tolerance interval assuming the constant p 2 meets the requirements of the model so gm 1 1 of industrial water demand in ordos in 2030 is as follows 18 x ˆ i n d 1 k 72 1194 e 0 0336 k 69 1994 k 1 2 3 n the model fitting results are shown in table 6 the mean squared error ratio of the prediction model of industrial water demand in ordos is c 0 2171 correlation degree is ς 0 9695 and relative error is low meeting the accuracy requirements the development coefficient is 0 0336 less than 0 3 indicating that the model is suitable for mid and long term prediction liu et al 2014 according to eq 18 the industrial water demand of ordos in 2030 is 434 29 million m3 5 2 3 calculating industrial twv of ordos in 2030 according to eq 14 the industrial twv of ordos in 2030 is 87 135 million m3 5 3 predicting and analyzing wrtv between bayannur and ordos in 2030 based on the calculation above twv of hetao irrigation district in bayannur is 904 966 million m3 in 2030 and industrial twv of ordos 87 135 million m3 according to eq 16 since the twv of hetao irrigation district is less than 0 in 2030 its iwrv no longer meets the water demand hence no surplus water available for the transfer as a result hetao irrigation district can no longer participate in water rights trading as a transferor and also needs to take water saving measures or buy water rights as a transferee in 2030 industrial twv of ordos is less than 0 meaning that the city s iwrv cannot meet the water demand and it still needs to take water saving measures and participate in water rights trading as a transferee however as current research results suggest the drastic changes in water status of the transferor bayannur makes it not suitable to be the source of wrtv further making water rights trading difficult to go on in 2030 so it is hard to determine the wrtv between bayannur city and ordos city 6 discussion based on the theory of property rights this study analyzed the wrtv and proposed that wrtv must consider the twv of the transaction parties according to the practices in china this study divided water rights trading into two stages initial stage and operation stage and analyzed the foundation for determining wrtv in different stages at present in china industry or sector is a major player of water rights trading and twv of industry difference between iwrv and water demand of industry is pivotal to calculating wrtv in different stages therefore this study employed the ratio method to calculate iwrv of industry and used gm 1 1 model to predict water demand of industry moreover this study further applied this method to the water right trading between bayannur and ordos in inner mongolia china and the calculation results show that hetao irrigation district of bayannur has insufficient twv to trade with ordos in 2030 so that their water right trading faces the risk of breakdown next this study performed theoretical analysis on wrtv wrtv the transaction object refers to the water quantity transferred by the transferor to the transferee in water rights trading like the transaction period and transaction price wrtv is also an integral part and influencing factor of water rights trading c f wu et al 2018 f p wu et al 2018 current studies focus on the transaction price of water rights trading yet few focus on wrtv nonetheless this study included wrtv related theories from the perspective of property rights laying a theoretical foundation for future research from different angles in addition a quantitative calculation method on wrtv was proposed in this study current studies focus on the qualitative analysis of wrtv hu et al 2014 wang 2018 however in reality wrtv needs to be quantified clearly so a qualitative analysis is insufficient hence this study put forward a quantitative calculation method on wrtv and revealed that wrtv is affected by twv and wrtv is the difference between iwrv and water demand the calculation method on wrtv in this study is simple and feasible and can be widely applied next this study considered the status of both parties while probing into wrtv at present there is no unified method to calculate wrtv and in most transactions wrtv is only determined by the demand of the transferee seldom by the water status current studies focus on the amount of transferor s twv di et al 2020 chen et al 2021a b however wrtv is influenced by the water status and the twv of both transferor and transferee so considering the twv of both transferor and transferee produces more scientific results moreover this study analyzed wrtv in different stages based on the transaction period in china transactions of water drawing rights and regional water rights last for a long time and the water status of transaction parties may change as time goes by consequently wrtv would also change with twv only a few current studies have looked into different stages of water rights trading and analyzed wrtv accordingly nonetheless this study divided water rights trading into the initial stage and operation period analyzed wrtv accordingly so as to provide advice for determining mid and long term wrtv moreover this study made an empirical analysis on wrtv of inner mongolia a typical region of water rights trading in china and found that in 2030 both the transferor and transferee may face the risk of transaction breakdown due to changes in the amount of twv of the transferor so this study further probed into wrtv from new perspectives transaction period and water status of transaction parties in other word focusing on the changes of wrtv can help adjust the transaction period in a timely manner guarantee an orderly process of water rights trading and help transaction parties make clear of their own water status the limitations of this study are 1 the prediction of water demand is affected by many factors and only considering the factor of water consumption may lead to not so precise results 2 how the coupling of factors like twv and water use efficiency affects water rights trading needs further analysis 3 the impact of wrtv on transaction price and transaction period also needs further in depth study 7 conclusion to determine wrtv the object of water rights trading the water status of transaction parties is a critical factor therefore based on the theory of property rights this study theoretically analyzed wrtv and its influence on water rights trading and found that another critical factor in determining wrtv is the twv of transaction parties for that this study divided water rights trading into the initial stage and operation stage and found that in different stages changes in the water demand and twv of transaction parties lead to modifications of wrtv in detail in the initial stage wrtv equals the water quantity that the transferor has to meet the water demand of the transferee in the operation period wrtv is within the twv of the transferor additionally in the mid and long term water rights trading adjustment of wrtv would dramatically affect water rights trading even leading to transaction breakdown this study applied the calculation method of wrtv to the water rights trading between bayannur city and ordos city in inner mongolia and predicted wrtv in 2030 here are the results 1 in 2030 twv of hetao irrigation district in bayannur city is 904 966 million m3 industrial twv of ordos city is 87 135 million m3 in a word both parties suffer from insufficient water resources causing water rights trading to stop and even face the risk of breakdown 2 in 2030 iwrv of hetao irrigation district of bayannur city and industrial enterprises in ordos city cannot meet the water demand so the two parties need to take various water saving measures or buy water rights as the transferee in the mid and long term water rights trading wrtv is a critical precondition therefore precise prediction of wrtv is of great practical significance furthermore based on wrtv prediction a reasonable transaction period should meet the demand of transaction parties and help give full play to relevant infrastructure as wrtv alters the transaction price dynamically changes to maximize the benefits of water rights trading in a word it is necessary to establish a regular mechanism to monitor and adjust wrtv to further adjust the process of water rights trading credit authorship contribution statement wu f p put forward the research ideal chen x n designed the

9323,water rights trading volume wrtv is an integral part of an effective transaction at present in china wrtv is mostly based on the water demand of the transferee not the transferor some transactions last for a long time yet lack proper measures to adjust trading volume making theoretical and quantitative studies on wrtv necessary and essential therefore based on the theory of property rights this study first analyzed the concept of wrtv and proposed that wrtv must consider the tradable water volume twv of the transaction parties for that this paper divided water rights trading into two stages initial stage and operation stage to analyze how to measure wrtv in different stages second currently industry or sector is a major player of water rights trading twv of industry is hence the difference between the initial water rights volume iwrv and water demand of industry significant for calculating wrtv in different stages for that this study employed the ratio method to calculate the iwrv of industry and the grey model gm 1 1 to predict the water demand of industry last this paper carried out a case study on the inter league and inter city water rights trading between bayannur city and ordos city in inner mongolia china results show that the twv of industry of bayannur and ordos in 2030 are 904 966 million m3 and 87 135 million m3 respectively implying insufficient twv for the transferee which may lead to transaction breakdown the theory and calculation method of wrtv proposed in this study lay a theoretical foundation for wrtv measurement

introduction water is the foundation of human survival and development yet the global water resources are limited and unevenly distributed world population growth economic development and climate change dramatically increase global water consumption and worsen water crisis null and prudencio 2016 according to the report of food and agriculture in 2020 issued by fao 3 2 billion people in the world suffer from water shortage and about 1 2 billion people live in agricultural areas with serious water issues china is also suffering from insufficient drinkable water and uneven spatiotemporal distribution of water resources to be specific statistics show that nearly two thirds of china s cities are short of water in varying degrees and 110 cities lose cny 200 billion annually due to water issues qian et al 2015 globally water shortage has become a serious obstacle to the socioeconomic development fang and zhang 2020 even endangering national security each country has a distinctive history of water rights trading from the late 1990s to the beginning of the 21st century water governance models have been transformed in a profound way around the world one critical transformation is transition of the demand side management from a state led and construction focused approach to a market oriented approach wang et al 2019 water rights trading as an effective water governance model is outstanding in optimizing the allocation of water resources via market mechanism and alleviating the uneven spatiotemporal distribution of water resources y b wang et al 2017 y h wang et al 2017 water rights markets in australia the united states and chile are well developed serving as global examples mexico and peru learn from chile s water rights trading system and introduce the market mechanism to allocate its water resources meanwhile the water rights market in spain relies on strong governmental intervention with a legal framework designed to keep improving water rights market in south asia especially in india jia et al 2016 and pakistan informal water rights trading is preferred in the irrigation sector in the meantime in iran the inefficient water allocation system forces policy makers and water resources planners to consider introducing the market mechanism as a solution jansouz et al 2017 globally to optimize the allocation of water resources water rights trading plays a significant role china s water rights trading started between dongyang and yiwu in zhejiang province in 2000 later gansu ningxia and inner mongolia also started trading water rights in 2014 china s ministry of water resources mwr proposed to pilot different types of water rights trading in seven provinces and regions ningxia jiangxi hubei inner mongolia henan gansu and guangdong to extensively promote water rights system at present water rights trading has been conducted in dongjiang river basin of guangdong province shule river basin of gansu province bayannur and ordos of inner mongolia jiwotian channel administration in guanling county and guizhou kong on cement co ltd of guizhou province in a word water rights trading breaks the conventional water distribution by administrative means and reflects the positive effects of market mechanism on water distribution in china y b wang et al 2017 y h wang et al 2017 many scholars studied the water rights system and water rights trading from different angles in terms of construction and internal mechanism of water rights system bauer 1997 drew from chile s experience in developing water market and proposed that the operation of water market is subject to multiple factors like law politics system economy and culture hence the need to be cautious by reviewing the status of water rights market in china and other countries y b wang et al 2017 y h wang et al 2017 systematically explored how china s unique characteristics influence the structure of its water rights market and emphasized the importance of establishing the mode and rules of water rights trading supervision system and water price policy li and gu 2019 analyzed the foundations of china s water rights trading from legal system initial water rights market platforms hardware facilities and external motivations and proposed relevant policy suggestions in terms of market efficiency based on the australian water market pigram 1993 pointed out that the external problems of market reform cannot be solved by private ownership f p wu et al 2018 c f wu et al 2018 analyzed the effect of return flows of third party in water rights trading and deemed it a challenge to the efficiency and fairness of water rights market tian 2019 proposed to enhance the whole process supervision of water rights trading to prevent market failures in terms of influencing factors of water rights trading bjornlund and mckay 2002 found that the cost of water rights market includes system cost and cost of water conservancy facilities higher cost would affect market formation and development shen et al 2016 put forth that water rights trading includes necessary conditions such as clear laws and regulations enough water quantity monitoring measurement cost system and externalities like the third party li et al 2018 analyzed the eco environment of water rights trading from the angles of river runoff groundwater eco flow water ecosystem and water quality and highlighted the importance of eco environmental effects in a word water rights trading contains multiple parts f p wu et al 2018 c f wu et al 2018 proposed that water rights trading includes transaction parties price volume and period all of which are critical to the validity of transaction in addition many scholars treated transaction price as the essential factor and carried out in depth research murdock et al 1991 suggested that pricing of water rights trading should consider social economy population natural environment and other factors additionally scholars drew from the rational expectations theory michelsen et al 2000 the game theory x c liu et al 2018 x q liu et al 2018 the shadow pricing method wu and li 2019 and the improved rpi x ni et al 2019 for the pricing of water rights trading compared with studies on pricing wrtv also an integral part of water rights trading has not received enough attention countries vary in wrtv regulations in 1982 the california drought water bank of the united states allowed water suppliers to transport the remaining purified water outside their jurisdictions chen 2012 defining the source of wrtv in the water rights markets in brazil and spain water rights trading requires sufficient information on wrtv and infrastructure for measuring and transporting water resources mariño and kemper 1999 in japan twv is actual water withdrawal by right owners in the previous year minus the amount sold to the market then plus the amount purchased twv directly influences wrtv according to regulation on the administration of the license for water drawing and the levy of water resource fees issued by mwr of china wrtv is water quantity saved by adjusting product and industrial structure improving technology and taking water saving measures furthermore scholars have probed into wrtv from various perspectives for example hu et al 2014 suggested to treat actual water users as subjects of water rights turn water drawing rights into water consumption rights and define water rights as water consumption rights to facilitate property ownership and the development of water rights trading moreover wang 2018 carried out a qualitative analysis on the potential of water rights trading in qingdao city china c f wu et al 2018 f p wu et al 2018 looked into the framework of water rights trading and proposed to calculate wrtv based on water saving potential chen et al 2021a 2021b in accordance with policies and practices in china put forth the concept of tradable controlled quantity compared it with twv analyzed the behaviors of quasi transaction parties and performed an empirical analysis on changsha city of china chen et al 2021a 2021b deemed agriculture a critical transferor in water rights trading put forward methods to calculate agricultural twv based on repaying iwrv excess and analyzed twv of hetao irrigation district in inner mongolia however wrtv is mostly determined in a unidimensional and static way for example wrtv of dongyang yiwu water rights trading the first practice in china is determined as 49 99 million m3 based on the water demand of yiwu city the transferee with little attention paid to the transferor wrtv between zhongning county and ningxia jingneng zhongning power station in ningxia hui autonomous region was determined by the water status of transaction parties with transaction period of 15 years lacking efficient methods to adjust wrtv to deal with future changes in water resources there are still unsolved problems in current studies 1 wrtv is an integral element of water rights trading of practical significance to theoretical research 2 wrtv must consider the twv of both transferor and transferee and there are not enough studies on how to quantify wrtv based on the water status of transaction parties 3 wrtv changes with the twv of transaction parties but how such variation affects mid and long term water rights trading 1 1 according to the china water exchange website the transaction period of water rights trading varies along with the forms of trading the period of irrigation water rights trade is usually one year while the periods of water drawing rights trading and regional water rights trading are different 25 years at most in this paper transaction period of more than 5 years is defined as mid and long term water rights trading still needs exploring studies of chen et al 2021a 2021b explored twv solely from the perspective of the transferor nonetheless this study considered both transferor and transferee to calculate wrtv in a more precise way in detail based on property rights and twv chen et al 2021a 2021b this study conducted a theoretical and quantitative study on wrtv and considered the twv of both transferor and transferee in determining wrtv to be more specific twv is the difference between iwrv and water demand iwrv is a mandatory government regulation while water demand the minimum water quantity for the guarantee of agricultural industrial and domestic use according to china s water rights trading cases this study divided water rights trading into two stages initial stage and operation stage as iwrv and water demand vary wrtv would change in different stages yielding various effects on water rights trading therefore this study applied the method of determining wrtv to the inter league and inter city water rights trading in inner mongolia of china providing relevant policy suggestions research framework is shown in fig 1 2 basic theory of wrtv 2 1 analysis on wrtv based on property rights theory property rights as an important concept in new institutional economics is the most fundamental part of human social structure a token of one s socioeconomic status in utilizing scarce resources bel 2018 with the rapid development of economy and society water becomes scarcer gradually turning into a typical economic product even a huge hindrance to social development talbot jones and bennett 2019 in 2019 china issued the guiding opinions on coordinating and promoting the reform of property rights system for natural resources assets it proposed to establish a property rights system for natural resources assets with clear ownership rights and responsibilities and effective supervision to promote the intensive utilization and protection of natural resources therefore water rights are how property rights is embodied in water use compatible with the general theories of property rights in china water belongs to the state so to give full play to the use value of water resources china allocates the right to use water to separate the ownership and right of use and water rights trading is to transfer the right to use water resource on the basis of excludable water rights and clear initial allocation of water rights wrtv is the object of water rights trading foundation for optimizing the allocation of water resources and premise of a successful transaction thus wrtv measurement is of great significance which must consider the water status of each transaction party and twv reflects such status from the perspective of property rights to be specific twv equals iwrv after the latter meets the production living and ecological needs of transaction parties china s current initial allocation of water rights is from the state to basins then to provinces autonomous region municipality cities county township industries and finally users dou and wang 2017 provincial and municipal iwrv is allocated according to the national distribution plan meanwhile end users of water resources are large in number yet scattered in distribution consuming relatively small amount of water and to determine their initial water rights the ratio method is commonly used in addition industry or sector is the dominant player of water rights trading in china yet the iwrv of industry lacks clear policy guidance making the calculation of iwrv of industry imperative in addition water rights trading boosts the water flow from inefficient industries or users to efficient ones and in china one common tendency is water transfer from agriculture to industry agriculture consumes and wastes plenty of water resulting in low water efficiency while industry has high water efficiency yet insufficient water resources according to the interim measures for the administration of water right trading by mwr of china in 2016 in regional water rights trading the amount of water transferred by the transferor takes up the quota for the total water consumption and river water allocation of the administrative region while amount of water actually received by the transferee do not take up the quota water rights trading between agriculture and industry conforms to the relevant provisions of water license the proportion of water consumption of industry over the past years was applied in this study to calculate iwrv of industry as the ratio method considers the water demand of industry oluwaseun and desmond 2019 it is suitable for calculating iwrv allocation additionally this study chose gm 1 1 to predict water demand for it compared with other methods can produce more precise results with less data and poorer information liu et al 2014 and with strong applicability twv of transaction parties equals the difference between iwrv and water demand for production living and ecology and can be positive negative or zero different types of twv yield various effects on the behaviors of transaction parties detailed analysis is shown in table 1 2 2 analysis on wrtv in different stages according to the water rights trading period and changes of water resources in china this study divided water rights trading into two stages initial stage and operation stage according to regulation on the administration of the license for water drawing and the levy of water resource fees 2017amendament issued by the state council the water drawing license is generally valid for 5 years no more than 10 years in this study the initial stage is when transaction parties reach an agreement that lasts for no more than 5 years with small changes in the water resources of transaction parties the operation period on the other hand starts from the 6th years to the end of transaction with large changes in water resources of transaction parties of course there are various ways to determine wrtv in different stages 2 2 1 wrtv in the initial stage a driving force of water rights trading is strong intention of transaction parties 2 2 driving forces of water rights trading include twv water use efficiency and trading revenue this paper took wrtv as the main research object without considering other factors one party may encounter an economic hinderance due to water shortage thus urgent to buy water rights and the transferor happens to have sufficient water resources willing to exchange water rights for economic benefits in the initial stage the intention of the transferee is stronger than that of the transferor and the foundation of a successful transaction is that the transferor has enough tradable water to meet the transferee s demand if the amount of water from the transferor fails to meet the demand of the transferee the transferee may stop trading again for cost and benefit concerns and switch to another transferor that can meet its demand therefore wrtv in this stage is transferor s tradable water volume that meets the demand of the transferor w t e e 2 2 2 wrtv in the operation stage twv affects wrtv and the market trend of water rights trading in the operation stage as economy and society advance water demand also changes constantly carrying out new projects requires more water while new water saving technologies and measures could improve water use efficiency and cut water consumption at the same time in response to the climate change national water policies also get modified constantly which also leads to modifications in iwrv therefore as for mid and long term water rights trading twv of both transferor and transferee varies along with iwrv and water demand resulting in different wrtv in the operation period as shown in table 2 table 2 shows that in the operation period a precondition for the transaction to go on is positive twv of the transferor the transferor is able to keep providing water supply for the transferee when the transferor s twv is negative the transaction may break down meanwhile water status of the transferee may be different from that in the initial stage so wrtv would change accordingly 3 method 3 1 twv of industry as mentioned above industry is a major part of water rights trading and twv of industry a premise of wrtv calculation twv of industry is the difference between iwrv and water demand of industry 3 1 1 allocation of iwrv of industry this study employed the ratio method to calculate iwrv of industry hence according to the proportion of water consumption of industry over the past years in the total water consumption the distribution ratio of iwrv of industry in the regional iwrv is determined as shown in eq 1 1 w i a w a ν i w a t 1 m q i t t 1 m q t where w ia is the iwrv of the industry i million m3 w a the regional iwrv million m3 v i the distribution ratio of the iwrv of industry i in the regional iwrv q it the water consumption of industry i at year t million m3 and q t the regional water consumption at year t million m3 3 1 2 predicting water demand of industry based on gm 1 1 in this study based on the water consumption of industry over the past years gm 1 1 liu et al 2014 was used to predict water demand of industry the original sequence is where z 0 k 0 k 1 2 3 n refers to the water consumption of industry over the past years the grade ratio of the sequence should be within the tolerance interval e 2 n 1 e 2 n 1 if the grade ratio cannot meet the requirement the original sequence needs to be modified to fall into the tolerance interval taking the constant p for translation transformation as shown in eq 2 2 x 0 k z 0 k p k 1 2 3 n first order accumulated generating operation 1 ago sequence was used to make the original sequence less random and volatile as shown in eq 3 3 x 1 x 1 1 x 1 2 x 1 n moreover first order univariate differential equation was used to fit the whitening equation of gm 1 1 4 d x 1 d t α x 1 μ the parameters were obtained via the least squares method 5 α μ t b t b 1 b t y n where 6 b 1 2 x 1 1 x 1 2 1 1 2 x 1 2 x 1 3 1 1 2 x 1 n 1 x 1 n 1 7 y n x 0 2 x 0 3 x 0 n the time response equation

industry as shown in eq 14 14 w i t w i a w i d where w it represents the twv of industry i million m3 w ia the iwrv of industry i million m3 and w id the water demand of industry i million m3 3 2 calculating wrtv wrtv is determined based on the twv of both transferor and transferee there are different methods to calculate wrtv in different stages 3 2 1 wrtv in the initial stage the key to water rights trading is that the transferor has surplus water within the scope of iwrv and has enough twv to meet the water demand of the transferee in this stage wrtv is the absolute value of twv of the transferee as shown in eq 15 15 w v w t e e w t o r 0 w t e e 0 w t o r w t e e where w t o r represents the twv of the transferor million m3 w t e e the twv of the transferee million m3 and w v the wrtv million m3 3 2 2 wrtv in the operation stage in the operation stage the water status of transaction parties may change as may the twv of transaction parties therefore to guarantee a successful transaction the transferor should be able to keep providing water resources in this stage wrtv should be within the twv of the transferor as shown in eq 16 16 w v w t o r w t o r 0 twv of the transferor must be above 0 if it is less than 0 the transferor suffers from water shortage and has no surplus water so the transaction has to stop while the twv of the transferee may be in a variety of situations 4 study area and data 4 1 study area 4 1 1 progress of water rights system in inner mongolia inner mongolia enjoys abundant natural resources and a large population since china initiated the reform and opening up policy the economy of inner mongolia has boomed making it an energy and heavy chemical base in china however water scarcity has become a bottleneck restricting the socioeconomic development of inner mongolia hence to solve water related issues inner mongolia has established water rights system carried out trading practices and eventually made major breakthroughs the progress of water right trading in inner mongolia is shown in the fig 3 in a word inner mongolia provides profuse experience and serves as an example for promoting water rights system and water rights trading in china 4 1 2 hetao irrigation district in bayannur city and industrial enterprises in ordos city 4 1 2 1 background bayannur city is located in the west of inner mongolia hetao irrigation district is located in bayannur the north end of the ji shaped bend of the yellow river over 200 km in length from east to west and 40 60 km in width from south to north with a total land area of about 1 1194 million hm2 it is one of the three super large irrigation districts in china and the largest artesian water diversion irrigation district in asia hetao irrigation district is located in the desert and arid area with low rainfall and high evaporation about 130 mm of average annual rainfall and 2300 mm of average annual evaporation the main source of its agricultural water is the yellow river and it totally depends on irrigation for agriculture and living environment li and zhang 2017 in addition hetao irrigation district is a key base for marketable grain and oil production in china according to bayannur water affairs bureau from 2009 to 2020 the city conducted multiple agricultural water saving projects reconstructed about 100 700 hm2 of water saving irrigation area and built about 318 700 hm2 of high efficiency water saving irrigation area now hetao irrigation district has become a critical transferor of water rights trading in inner mongolia located in the southwest of inner mongolia and on the ordos plateau ordos city connects bayannur in the north covering an area of 86 600 hm2 with an altitude of 1000 1500 m ordos city is in the arid and semi arid area with only 2 629 billion m3 of annual average total water resources and little underground and surface water 190 400 mm of annual average rainfall and 2500 mm of annual average evaporation in addition special geographical conditions give ordos rich reserves of coal oil natural gas and other energy and mineral resources as well as profuse chemical resources like natural alkali and mirabilite dong et al 2019 and industrial progress also drives the economy of ordos x c liu et al 2018 x q liu et al 2018 in recent years ordos as the energy and heavy chemical industry base in inner mongolia has implemented major projects on coal electric power and chemical industry zhou et al 2020 however these projects are hindered by a major obstacle water shortage the map of ordos city and hetao irrigation district in bayannur city is shown in fig 4 4 1 2 2 water rights trading between hetao irrigation district in bayannur and industrial enterprises in ordos in 2014 inner mongolia decided to carry out pilot projects of water rights trading of the main stream cities of yellow river according to the china water exchange website 79 transactions have been made in inner mongolia since 2016 with a total wrtv of 2 6191025 billion m3 among them 23 deals were struck between bayannur and ordos with a total wrtv of 687 8525 million m3 and the transaction period of 25 years the transferor was the general administration of hetao irrigation district of inner mongolia but its wrtv actually came from agricultural water of hetao irrigation district the transferee was the industrial enterprises of ordos city these deals were signed between 2017 and 2020 with a 25 year transaction period and by 2030 the deals are all in the operation period so this study only predicted wrtv in the operation period 4 2 data in 1987 based on the actual water consumption in 1980 the state council of china analyzed the irrigation scale growth of industrial and urban water consumption in provinces and regions along the yellow river and implemented an allocation plan on the available water of yellow river called the yellow river water allocation scheme scheme 87 in short according to scheme 87 water consumption quota of the yellow river allocated to inner mongolia is 5 86 billion m3 per year and inner mongolia further allocates its quota to the leagues and cities and determines their iwrv to be specific the annual iwrv of bayannur is 4 billion m3 and that of ordos is 700 million m3 scheme 87 takes water consumption as the standard for allocation but in reality the conversion of water consumption and water withdrawal is affected by many factors resulting in unstable data in 2012 opinions of the state council on applying the strictest water resources control system was issued by the state council to address growing water challenges and require all regions to control the total amount of water consumption and conduct regular assessment the opinion paved the way ahead for water consumption management in china and this study took the total amount of water consumption as the regional iwrv in 2015 opinions of bayannur municipal people s government on applying the strictest water resources management system stipulated that the total water consumption of bayannur city should be controlled within 4 980 billion m3 by 2030 regarded as the iwrv of bayannur in 2030 in this study in 2014 notice of ordos municipal people s government on tasks of the strictest water resources management system stipulated that the total water consumption of ordos in 2030 must be within 1 994 billion m3 regarded as the iwrv of ordos in 2030 in this study hetao irrigation district a key grain producing area in bayannur consumes plenty of agricultural water therefore this study used agricultural water consumption in bayannur to represent the agricultural water consumption of hetao irrigation district and ordos did not allocate iwrv for each industrial enterprise making it difficult to calculate the twv of industrial enterprises therefore this study used the industrial water consumption of ordos to represent the water consumption of industrial enterprises that had already been involved in water rights trading data on agricultural water consumption in bayannur and industrial water consumption in ordos during 2013 2019 was collected from inner mongolia water resources bulletin as shown in table 4 according to table 4 and eq 1 the proportion of agricultural water consumption in bayannur is 88 93 and that of industrial water consumption in ordos is 17 41 5 results 5 1 twv of hetao irrigation district of bayannur in 2030 5 1 1 agricultural iwrv of hetao irrigation district in 2030 in 2030 iwrv of bayannur city is 4 980 billion m3 and the proportion of agricultural water consumption is 88 93 indicating that the iwrv of hetao irrigation district in 2030 equals 4 428714 billion m3 5 1 2 predicting agricultural water demand of hetao irrigation district in 2030 according to the grey system theory gm 1 1 of agricultural water demand of hetao irrigation district in bayannur in 2030 is as follows 17 x ˆ a g r 1 k 3395 4043 e 0 0126 k 3355 2143 k 1 2 3 n the model fitting results are shown in table 5 the mean squared error ratio of agricultural water demand prediction model of hetao irrigation district is c 0 3835 correlation degree is ς 0 9995 relative error is low meeting the accuracy requirement the development coefficient is 0 0126 less than 0 3 proving that the model is suitable for mid and long term prediction liu et al 2014 according to eq 17 the agricultural water demand of hetao irrigation district in 2030 is 5 33368 billion m3 5 1 3 calculating twv of hetao irrigation district in 2030 according to the eq 14 twv of hetao irrigation district of bayannur city in 2030 is 904 966 million m3 5 2 twv of ordos in 2030 5 2 1 iwrv in industrial sector of ordos in 2030 in 2030 iwrv of ordos city is 1 994 billion m3 and the proportion of industrial water consumption is 17 41 indicating that the iwrv in industrial sector of ordos city in 2030 is 347 1554 million m3 5 2 2 predicting industrial water demand of ordos in 2030 according to the grey system theory industrial water consumption of ordos during 2012 2019 is not within the tolerance interval assuming the constant p 2 meets the requirements of the model so gm 1 1 of industrial water demand in ordos in 2030 is as follows 18 x ˆ i n d 1 k 72 1194 e 0 0336 k 69 1994 k 1 2 3 n the model fitting results are shown in table 6 the mean squared error ratio of the prediction model of industrial water demand in ordos is c 0 2171 correlation degree is ς 0 9695 and relative error is low meeting the accuracy requirements the development coefficient is 0 0336 less than 0 3 indicating that the model is suitable for mid and long term prediction liu et al 2014 according to eq 18 the industrial water demand of ordos in 2030 is 434 29 million m3 5 2 3 calculating industrial twv of ordos in 2030 according to eq 14 the industrial twv of ordos in 2030 is 87 135 million m3 5 3 predicting and analyzing wrtv between bayannur and ordos in 2030 based on the calculation above twv of hetao irrigation district in bayannur is 904 966 million m3 in 2030 and industrial twv of ordos 87 135 million m3 according to eq 16 since the twv of hetao irrigation district is less than 0 in 2030 its iwrv no longer meets the water demand hence no surplus water available for the transfer as a result hetao irrigation district can no longer participate in water rights trading as a transferor and also needs to take water saving measures or buy water rights as a transferee in 2030 industrial twv of ordos is less than 0 meaning that the city s iwrv cannot meet the water demand and it still needs to take water saving measures and participate in water rights trading as a transferee however as current research results suggest the drastic changes in water status of the transferor bayannur makes it not suitable to be the source of wrtv further making water rights trading difficult to go on in 2030 so it is hard to determine the wrtv between bayannur city and ordos city 6 discussion based on the theory of property rights this study analyzed the wrtv and proposed that wrtv must consider the twv of the transaction parties according to the practices in china this study divided water rights trading into two stages initial stage and operation stage and analyzed the foundation for determining wrtv in different stages at present in china industry or sector is a major player of water rights trading and twv of industry difference between iwrv and water demand of industry is pivotal to calculating wrtv in different stages therefore this study employed the ratio method to calculate iwrv of industry and used gm 1 1 model to predict water demand of industry moreover this study further applied this method to the water right trading between bayannur and ordos in inner mongolia china and the calculation results show that hetao irrigation district of bayannur has insufficient twv to trade with ordos in 2030 so that their water right trading faces the risk of breakdown next this study performed theoretical analysis on wrtv wrtv the transaction object refers to the water quantity transferred by the transferor to the transferee in water rights trading like the transaction period and transaction price wrtv is also an integral part and influencing factor of water rights trading c f wu et al 2018 f p wu et al 2018 current studies focus on the transaction price of water rights trading yet few focus on wrtv nonetheless this study included wrtv related theories from the perspective of property rights laying a theoretical foundation for future research from different angles in addition a quantitative calculation method on wrtv was proposed in this study current studies focus on the qualitative analysis of wrtv hu et al 2014 wang 2018 however in reality wrtv needs to be quantified clearly so a qualitative analysis is insufficient hence this study put forward a quantitative calculation method on wrtv and revealed that wrtv is affected by twv and wrtv is the difference between iwrv and water demand the calculation method on wrtv in this study is simple and feasible and can be widely applied next this study considered the status of both parties while probing into wrtv at present there is no unified method to calculate wrtv and in most transactions wrtv is only determined by the demand of the transferee seldom by the water status current studies focus on the amount of transferor s twv di et al 2020 chen et al 2021a b however wrtv is influenced by the water status and the twv of both transferor and transferee so considering the twv of both transferor and transferee produces more scientific results moreover this study analyzed wrtv in different stages based on the transaction period in china transactions of water drawing rights and regional water rights last for a long time and the water status of transaction parties may change as time goes by consequently wrtv would also change with twv only a few current studies have looked into different stages of water rights trading and analyzed wrtv accordingly nonetheless this study divided water rights trading into the initial stage and operation period analyzed wrtv accordingly so as to provide advice for determining mid and long term wrtv moreover this study made an empirical analysis on wrtv of inner mongolia a typical region of water rights trading in china and found that in 2030 both the transferor and transferee may face the risk of transaction breakdown due to changes in the amount of twv of the transferor so this study further probed into wrtv from new perspectives transaction period and water status of transaction parties in other word focusing on the changes of wrtv can help adjust the transaction period in a timely manner guarantee an orderly process of water rights trading and help transaction parties make clear of their own water status the limitations of this study are 1 the prediction of water demand is affected by many factors and only considering the factor of water consumption may lead to not so precise results 2 how the coupling of factors like twv and water use efficiency affects water rights trading needs further analysis 3 the impact of wrtv on transaction price and transaction period also needs further in depth study 7 conclusion to determine wrtv the object of water rights trading the water status of transaction parties is a critical factor therefore based on the theory of property rights this study theoretically analyzed wrtv and its influence on water rights trading and found that another critical factor in determining wrtv is the twv of transaction parties for that this study divided water rights trading into the initial stage and operation stage and found that in different stages changes in the water demand and twv of transaction parties lead to modifications of wrtv in detail in the initial stage wrtv equals the water quantity that the transferor has to meet the water demand of the transferee in the operation period wrtv is within the twv of the transferor additionally in the mid and long term water rights trading adjustment of wrtv would dramatically affect water rights trading even leading to transaction breakdown this study applied the calculation method of wrtv to the water rights trading between bayannur city and ordos city in inner mongolia and predicted wrtv in 2030 here are the results 1 in 2030 twv of hetao irrigation district in bayannur city is 904 966 million m3 industrial twv of ordos city is 87 135 million m3 in a word both parties suffer from insufficient water resources causing water rights trading to stop and even face the risk of breakdown 2 in 2030 iwrv of hetao irrigation district of bayannur city and industrial enterprises in ordos city cannot meet the water demand so the two parties need to take various water saving measures or buy water rights as the transferee in the mid and long term water rights trading wrtv is a critical precondition therefore precise prediction of wrtv is of great practical significance furthermore based on wrtv prediction a reasonable transaction period should meet the demand of transaction parties and help give full play to relevant infrastructure as wrtv alters the transaction price dynamically changes to maximize the benefits of water rights trading in a word it is necessary to establish a regular mechanism to monitor and adjust wrtv to further adjust the process of water rights trading credit authorship contribution statement wu f p put forward the research ideal chen x n designed the

main crop mc and ratoon crop rc however rainfed treatment during the ratoon season significantly decreased the rc yield by 14 4 and 9 2 in 2020 and 2021 respectively the reduction of stubble height prolonged the growth duration decreased the panicle number and increased the spikelets panicle 1 total spikelets and leaf area index compared with sh45 sh20 and sh0 increased the rc yield by 20 7 and 6 8 in 2020 respectively whereas no significant difference in rc yield was observed among different stubble heights in 2021 moreover the grain yield of rc at low stubble heights was more susceptible to rainfed treatment specifically rainfed treatment averagely decreased the rc yield by 4 9 12 7 and 17 2 at sh45 sh20 and sh0 respectively the grain yield of rc was positively correlated with the panicle number total spikelets and biomass accumulation while low stubble heights particularly sh20 had a greater magnitude of slope furthermore panicle number exhibited stronger correlations with spikelets panicle 1 and biomass accumulation at low stubble heights overall our results suggest that more attention should be paid to water management in the ratoon season and increasing the panicle number is crucial to the improvement of yield and yield stability of rc at low stubble heights keywords grain yield ratoon rice stubble height water management yield stability data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rice ratooning which is also known as twice harvesting after one sowing is an ancient technology in china with a history of around 1700 years wang et al 2020 however rice ratooning has only been practiced as a measure to reduce the loss of rice yield caused by natural disasters such as flooding and lodging for a long time research on the biological characteristics and cultivation techniques of ratoon rice can be traced back to 1960s yang 1958 when the grain yield of ratoon crop rc was only 0 75 0 90 t ha 1 xu et al 2021 in the late 1970 s the planting area of ratoon rice began to increase rapidly with the development of hybrid rice for example the rc yield of the hybrid variety shanyou63 reached 3 00 3 75 t ha 1 xiong et al 2000 in 1997 the total harvested area and average grain yield of rc reached 750 000 ha and 2 0 t ha 1 respectively li et al 2009 however the planting area subsequently decreased sharply due to the serious shortage of rural labor the planting area of ratoon rice in hubei province which is located in central china sharply declined from 73 000 ha in 1994 to 6 700 ha in 2010 fei et al 2013 wang et al 2021 after 2010 mechanized rice ratooning technology has attracted the renewed interest in ratoon rice currently the planting area of ratoon rice in china and hubei province is about 1000 000 ha and 200 000 ha respectively wang et al 2021 rc yields exceeding 6 0 t ha 1 have been achieved in field trials in qichun county hubei province yang et al 2021 zheng et al 2021 rc grows from the sprout buds of the stubble left after the harvest of the main crop mc wang et al 2020 therefore rc can save the costs of land preparation seeds and crop establishment and thereby substantially increase the profits for farmers due to the shorter growth duration of rc than that of mc ratoon rice is particularly suitable for areas where light and temperature resources are surplus for one season crop but inadequate for two season crops dou et al 2016 ratoon rice can generate much higher net profits than single and double season rice the two dominant rice systems practiced in central china yuan et al 2019 compared with double season rice ratoon rice can reduce the carbon footprint by 27 4 owing to the lower carbon footprint in the ratoon season xu et al 2022 moreover rc was reported to have higher grain quality than the late season rice huang et al 2020 due to these advantages ratoon rice has developed rapidly and is expected to become one of the major cropping systems in china improvement of the yield and yield stability of rc is important for the development of ratoon rice there have been relatively more studies of the effect of fertilizer management on the yield of ratoon rice wang et al 2019 yang et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 while few studies have been focused on the effect of water management it has been reported that soil drying at the maximum tilling stage and middle late grain filling stage of mc can promote the growth of root system lin et al 2015 similarly zhang et al 2019 found that alternate wetting and drying awd irrigation in the main season could contribute to a higher rc yield than continuous flooding however heavy soil drying during the grain filling stage of mc would restrict the growth of ratoon buds and therefore reduce the yield of rc xiong and chinawong 1995 for rc mengel and wilson 1981 found that immediate flooding irrigation after mc harvest can improve the yield while shiraki et al 2020 reported that the dry regime before and after mc harvest has a more positive effect on rc yield compared with the saturated regime however water management in ratoon season is generally neglected by local farmers for the low water demand due to the relatively low temperature in ratoon season thus it is necessary to study the optimization of water management for ratoon rice stubble height of mc harvest is another important factor affecting rc yield a decrease in stubble height tends to reduce the total panicle number but increase the panicle number from basal nodes the panicle size and the growth duration xu et al 2021 the suitable stubble height is largely determined by the climatic conditions in rice production areas generally a lower stubble height of mc is believed to increase the rc yield depending on the climate conditions and rice cultivars harrell et al 2009 petroudi et al 2011 previous studies have reported that rc yield is positively correlated with ratooning ability chen et al 2018 a higher stubble height can preserve more ratoon buds from upper nodes thereby improving the yield and yield stability of rc cao et al 2020 nakano et al 2021 also proposed that retaining more leaves on the stubble could contribute to an increase in rc yield torres et al 2020 demonstrated that cutting stubble of 30 40 cm resulted in higher rc yield compared with 0 cm when mc was lodged before maturity in central china stubble heights of about 40 45 cm are recommended to ensure the safe heading of ratoon rice before 15 september based on local climatic conditions for the early harvest of mc the stubble height can be appropriately reduced to obtain high yield of rc however the response of rc yield at different stubble heights to water management in the main and or ratoon season remains elusive rice production is sensitive to changes in precipitation and climate change which highlights the importance of irrigation practices chandio et al 2021 as mentioned above there has been few studies focusing on the interactive effects of water management practices and stubble height on the agronomic performance of ratoon rice to address this question two year field experiments were conducted to explore the effects of different water management practices flooded vs rainfed during the main and ratoon season on the yield performance of mc and rc and compare the yield and yield stability of rc at different stubble heights 45 20 and 0 cm we hypothesized that 1 rainfed treatment would negatively affect the yield of rc and 2 a lower stubble height might increase the yield potential but decrease the yield stability of rc relative to a higher stubble height 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description field experiments were conducted in farmer s fields at jiupu village 30 16 n 115 37 e qichun county hubei province central china in 2020 the experiments were repeated in an adjacent field in 2021 the study area is located in a subtropical monsoon humid climate ratoon rice is the major rice cropping system in this region which is usually grown from march to october in the following non rice season the fields are left fallow before fertilizing and transplanting five soil cores were collected diagonally from the 0 20 cm soil

data including daily minimum temperature maximum temperature solar radiation and precipitation were collected from a weather station aws 800 campbell scientiﬁc inc usa located near the experimental field during the rice growth period from the transplanting of mc to the maturity of rc 2 2 experimental design and crop management the experiments were arranged in a split split plot design with water treatment in the main season as the main plot water treatment in the ratoon season as the sub plot and stubble height as the sub sub plot with four replications the plot size was 25 m2 5 5 m during the growth period both the main and ratoon season consisted of two water treatments flooded and rainfed treatments for the flooded treatment a 3 5 cm field water layer was maintained from transplanting to 7 10 d before the harvest of mc and then continuous flooding was kept after the harvest of mc to 7 10 d before the harvest of rc for the rainfed treatment irrigation was performed once in the main season for transplanting and once in the ratoon season after mc harvest after each irrigation the irrigation water depth was determined and the total water consumption of irrigation and rainfall in the main and ratoon season were calculated mc was harvested manually at maturity with three stubble heights 45 cm sh45 20 cm sh20 and 0 cm sh0 sh45 and sh20 could preserve the 2nd and 3rd node from the top respectively and sh0 could retain the basal node a two line hybrid rice cultivar fengliangyouxiang1 flyx1 which has been widely grown for rice ratooning in central china was used in this study pre germinated seeds were sown into seedbed on march 21 in 2020 and 2021 seedbeds were covered with transparent plastic film to protect seedlings from low temperature the seedlings were transplanted into the paddy field on april 29 2020 and april 26 2021 at a hill spacing of 13 3 30 0 cm with two seedlings per hill the mc was harvested by hand at maturity august 5 2020 and 2021 a total of 180 kg n ha 1 was applied in three splits for mc 40 at 1 day before transplanting 30 at 10 days after transplanting and 30 at panicle initiation for rc a total of 150 kg n ha 1 was split equally and applied at 12 days after heading of mc and 2 days after harvest of mc about 40 kg p ha 1 60 kg k ha 1 and 5 kg zn ha 1 were applied at 1 day before transplanting of mc and 60 kg k ha 1 was applied at 12 days after heading of mc the n p k and zn fertilizers were applied in the form of urea calcium superphosphate potassium chloride and zinc sulfate heptahydrate respectively to prevent water exchange between plots all bunds were covered with plastic film inserted into the soil weeds diseases and insects were strictly controlled by chemicals throughout the entire two year experimental period 2 3 sampling and measurements twelve hills excluding the three border hills were sampled from each plot at heading stage of rc and at maturity of mc and rc at the heading of rc the plant samples were divided into stubble left from mc and regenerated parts and the regenerated parts were further separated into stem leaf and panicle the green leaf area was measured using a leaf area meter li 3100 c li cor lincoln ne usa leaf area index lai was calculated as leaf area per unit land area the dry weight of each organ was determined after oven drying at 80 c to constant weight at the maturity of mc and rc the plant height and panicle number were recorded for the mc the plant samples were divided into straw and panicle for the rc the plant samples were separated into stubble left from mc and regenerated parts and the regenerated parts were further separated into straw and panicle the panicles were hand threshed timely filled spikelets were separated from the unfilled ones by submerging them in tap water three subsamples of 30 g filled spikelets and all unfilled spikelets were counted to calculate the number of spikelets the dry weights of stubble straw rachis filled

weather conditions and growth duration fig 1 shows the daily maximum temperature and minimum temperature solar radiation and precipitation during the rice growth season from the transplanting of mc to the maturity of rc during the main season the average daily maximum temperature was 30 0 and 30 5 the minimum temperature was 22 6 and 22 6 and the daily solar radiation was 14 2 and 14 6 mj m 2 d 1 in 2020 and 2021 respectively during the ratoon season the average daily maximum temperature was 26 5 and 28 1 the minimum temperature was 18 4 and 19 7 and the daily solar radiation was 12 1 and 12 6 mj m 2 d 1 in 2020 and 2021 respectively for mc the total precipitation was 789 4 and 483 7 mm in 2020 and 2021 respectively table 1 the average total water consumption of rainfed treatment decreased by 14 6 and 25 9 compared with flooded treatment in 2020 and 2021 respectively across different years the soil content under rainfed treatment was 63 4 80 2 table s1 for rc the total precipitation was 414 2 and 343 5 mm in 2020 and 2021 respectively table 2 the average total water consumption of rainfed treatment decreased by 26 3 and 28 8 compared with flooded treatment in 2020 and 2021 respectively across different years the soil content under rainfed treatment was 38 4 61 9 table s2 it should be noted that from mid june to early july in 2020 the study area experienced heavy rainfall of 580 mm and the field was flooded for about 10 days at the flowering stage in the main season the highest water level exceeded 1 2 of the plant height table 3 presents the phenology data including the sowing transplanting panicle initiation heading maturity dates of mc and the heading and maturity dates of rc the growth duration of mc was about 137 days while that of rc was 67 109 days the growth duration of rc was only 49 80 that of mc and increased with decreasing stubble height specifically the growth duration of rc at sh20 and sh0 was averagely 11 and 29 days longer than that of sh45 respectively in addition the growth duration of rc in 2020 was consistently longer than that in 2021 at different stubble heights 3 2 grain yield and yield attributes of mc the grain yield and yield attributes of mc are presented in table 4 in both years there was no significant difference in these yield traits between flooded and rainfed treatments in the main season however the grain yield in 2020 was 19 0 lower than that in 2021 due to a significant reduction of grain filling percentage and harvest index which could be attributed to the continuous heavy rainfall at the flowering stage as mentioned above 3 3 grain yield and yield components of rc water management in the main season exhibited no significant effect on the grain yield of rc in both years table s3 however water management in the ratoon season had a significant impact on the grain yield of rc in both years as for the stubble height it only showed a significant effect on the grain yield of rc in 2020 the grain yield and yield components of rc are shown in table 5 and table 6 compared with flooding rainfed treatment in the ratoon season in 2020 and 2021 significantly reduced the grain yield by 14 4 and 9 2 respectively however rainfed treatment in the ratoon season showed inconsistent effects on yield components between two years to be specific the yield reduction in 2020 under rainfed treatment could be ascribed to the reduction of spikelets m 2 which was mainly caused by a decrease in panicle number whereas in 2021 the yield decrease under rainfed treatment could be attributed to poor grain filling stubble height only showed a significant effect on the yield of rc in 2020 and a lower stubble height seemed to result in a higher yield as the grain yield of rc at sh20 and sh0 was 20 7 and 6 8 higher than that at sh45 respectively the stubble height had significant effects on the yield components and its effects on the panicle number spikelets panicle 1 and spikelets m 2 were consistent in both years with decreasing stubble height the panicle number decreased while the spikelets panicle 1 increased on average sh20 and sh0 had 19 2 and 29 6 smaller panicle number while 33 7 and 84 3 higher spikelets panicle 1 and correspondingly 8 2 and 29 7 higher spikelets m 2 than sh45 respectively in both years sh0 resulted in the lowest grain filling percentage however the stubble height exhibited inconsistent effects on grain weight in two years 3 4 other yield attributes of rc the plant height lai at heading cgr biomass accumulation hi and ratooning ability of rc are presented in table 7 and table 8 water management in the main season had no effect on these yield attributes in 2020 while rainfed treatment resulted in higher plant height lai cgr and biomass production at the pre heading stage in 2021 compared with flooding rainfed treatment in the ratoon season significantly reduced the plant height in both years moreover rainfed treatment in the ratoon season of 2020 significantly decreased the cgr and biomass accumulation at the post heading stage and ratooning ability by 35 7 36 7 and 11 8 respectively however in 2021 rainfed treatment in the ratoon season significantly decreased the pre heading cgr and hi by 4 2 and 7 3 respectively as for the stubble height it had significant impacts on all these indices in both years table s4 sh45 resulted in higher plant height than sh0 in 2020 but it was the opposite case in 2021 sh0 led to significantly higher lai than sh45 and sh20 in both years compared with sh20 and sh0 sh45 resulted in higher cgr but lower biomass accumulation at the pre heading stage which could be attributed to its shorter pre heading period by contrast sh0 had higher biomass accumulation at the pre heading stage than sh45 and sh20 due to its longer growth duration although different stubble heights resulted in significant differences in cgr at the post heading stage they had no significant effect on the biomass accumulation the hi of sh20 was significantly higher than that of sh45 and sh0 which was consistent in two years the reduction of stubble height tended to cause a significant decrease in ratooning ability 3 5 correlation analysis the correlations between yield and yield attributes were not consistent among different stubble heights fig 2 grain yield was significantly and positively correlated with panicles m 2 and spikelets m 2 and sh0 had a lower r2 value while sh20 had a higher slope among the three stubble heights grain yield was positively correlated with spikelets panicle 1 only at sh20 grain yield was positively correlated with biomass accumulation before heading at sh20 and after heading at sh20 and sh0 there was no significant relationship between yield and hi at the three stubble heights the panicles m 2 was significantly positively correlated with spikelets m 2 at sh20 fig 3a there was a stronger correlation between panicles m 2 and biomass accumulation before and after heading at low stubble heights sh20 and sh0 compared with that at sh45 fig 3b and c 4 discussion to date little research has been carried out on water management in ratoon rice a recent study by zhang et al 2019 reported that simplified awd irrigation during the main season could increase the yield of mc and rc by 3 7 and 6 8 respectively compared with continuous flooding however our results demonstrated that water management flooded vs rainfed in the main season has no effect on the yield of either mc or rc according to valipour et al 2020 field water evapotranspiration is affected by several meteorological factors including rainfall temperature and wind speed rainfall is a determinant factor affecting the yield of rainfed rice and frequent rainfall during the main season appeared to prevent soil moisture deficit in our study fig 1e and f particularly during the main season in 2020 heavy rainfall of 789 4 mm caused the flooding of rainfed plots for a long time thus supplying adequate water for rice growth similarly a previous study by yao et al 2012 conducted in an adjacent area showed no significant difference in grain yield between awd and flooded regimes in single season rice systems in contrast for rc water management flooded vs rainfed during the ratoon season significantly affected the grain yield our results revealed that continuous flooding increased the grain yield of rc by an average of 13 5 compared with rainfed treatment similarly mengel and wilson 1981 reported that immediate irrigation after mc harvest and continuous flooding until rc maturity could improve the yield of rc however rainfed treatment during the ratoon season showed inconsistent effects on yield attributes between two years in 2020 the yield reduction under rainfed treatment could be attributed to significant decreases in panicles m 2 spikelets m 2 and cgr and biomass accumulation after heading whereas in 2021 the yield reduction under rainfed treatment could be ascribed to significantly lower grain filling percentage pre heading cgr and hi these distinct results between the two years might be caused by the differences in rainfall pattern during the ratoon season fig 1e and f according to the study of mengel and wilson 1981 irrigation during 0 20 days after mc harvest directly affects the growth of ratoon tillers in this study the rainfall during this period was 92 and 214 mm in 2020 and 2021 respectively thus leading to a significant reduction in panicle number in 2020 moreover the rainfall during the heading stage 20 50 days after mc was 191 and 40 mm in 2020 and 2021 respectively serious soil moisture deficit at this stage in 2021 resulted in poor grain filling and low hi stubble height is a crucial agronomic practice that greatly determines the grain yield of rc in central china the stubble height of about 40 45 cm is generally recommended to ensure the safe heading of rc in this study the rc yield of sh20 and sh0 was significantly higher than that of sh45 in 2020 while the yield advantage of low stubble heights was not observed in 2021 generally low stubble heights result in a higher yield potential than high stubble heights but the effect is dependent on the local climatic conditions santos et al 2003 for example in west sumatra indonesia farmers typically re cut stubbles from 20 cm to 5 cm at 7 d after mc harvest which is known as the salibu system and was reported to increase grain yield of rc by 75 7 pasaribu et al 2018 however the salibu system might not be applicable in naypyidaw myanmar shiraki et al 2020 previous studies have reported that a decrease in stubble height from 40 cm to 20 cm could lower the growing point of axillary buds increase the spikelets panicle 1 and prolong the growth duration of rc harrell et al 2009 in the present study sh45 resulted in the shortest growth duration of rc which was 11 and 29 days shorter than that of sh20 and sh0 respectively table 3 compared with sh45 sh20 and sh0 led to 19 2 and 29 6 lower panicles m 2 while 33 7 and 84 3 higher spikelets panicle 1 thereby resulting in 8 2 and 29 7 higher spikelets m 2 respectively moreover the lai at the heading stage increased along with decreasing stubble height these results suggested that lowering the stubble height could simultaneously improve the source ability and sink size of rc yet the realization of its potential yield is dependent on the remaining temperature and light resources however in the present study low stubble heights seemed to result in a lower yield stability of rc on the one hand the yield advantage of rc at low stubble heights was only observed in 2020 which was attributed to more panicles m 2 and longer growth duration compared with those in 2021 it has been well documented that the nutrient status of the stem in the main season is significantly correlated with the panicle number of rc turner and jund 1993 he et al 2019 yang et al 2021 the more panicles m 2 of rc in 2020 might be explained by the fact that the poor grain filling in the main season led to the accumulation of more nutrients such as carbohydrates and mineral elements in the stem which promoted the sprouting of ratoon buds the longer growth duration might be ascribed to the lower temperature and radiation during the ratoon season in 2020 on the other hand low stubble heights led to significantly lower rc yield under rainfed treatment which was consistently observed in both years similar results were reported in the studies of harrell et al 2009 and nakano et al 2020 which were conducted at roughly the same latitude in south usa and southwestern japan respectively harrell et al 2009 indicated that 20 cm stubble height increased the rc yield in only one year of a two year study compared with 40 cm height and nakano et al 2020 reported that 50 cm stubble height contributed to a higher grain yield of rc than 20 cm height furthermore our results demonstrated that different stubble heights would lead to different relationships between rc yield and the yield attributes fig 2 although grain yield was significantly and positively correlated with panicles m 2 and spikelets m 2 at all three stubble heights low stubble heights particularly sh20 exhibited a greater magnitude of slope than sh45 moreover the yield and biomass accumulation only had a significant relationship at low stubble heights these results further proved that a lower stubble height would decrease the yield stability panicles m 2 was positively correlated with spikelets m 2 and biomass accumulation at sh20 and sh0 but not at sh45 fig 3 suggesting that increasing panicle number in the ratoon season is crucial for realizing the yield potential at low stubble heights according to previous studies the panicles m 2 of rc can be increased by selection of varieties with stronger ratooning ability and optimization of management during the main season such as increasing the panicle number improving the photosynthesis ability at the grain filling stage and controlling the pests and diseases wang et al 2020 xu et al 2021 yang et al 2021 overall our study highlights the importance of water management for rice yield during the ratoon season especially at low stubble heights although this study was conducted in central china the conclusion may be more applicable to rice growing areas in lower latitude where low stubble height is often recommended due to the higher accumulated temperature during rice growing season wang et al 2021 however this study ignored the genotypic difference and the growth dynamics of ratoon buds from different nodes which should be clarified in future study on the other hand specific high yield and water saving irrigation methods for rc under various environmental conditions still need to be explored 5 conclusions in central china the rainfall pattern varies widely between the main and ratoon season with more rainfall occurring in the main season water management during the main season has no effect on the grain yield of either mc and rc however rainfed treatment during the ratoon season significantly decreases the grain yield of rc lowering the stubble height increases the yield potential of rc due to the synchronous improvement of source ability and sink size whereas decreases the yield stability under suboptimal management practices and climate conditions increasing the panicle number in the ratoon season might be crucial for high yield and yield stability of rc at low stubble heights declaration of competing interest the authors

9324,rice ratooning system is becoming an important rice planting system to ensure food security in china and improvement of grain yield and yield stability has always been the primary goal in the development of ratoon rice here field experiments were conducted in central china from 2020 to 2021 to explore the effects of water management flooded vs rainfed and stubble height 45 20 and 0 cm abbreviated as sh45 sh20 and sh0 respectively on the yield performance of ratoon rice the results demonstrated that water management during the main season had no effect on the grain yield of either main crop mc and ratoon crop rc however rainfed treatment during the ratoon season significantly decreased the rc yield by 14 4 and 9 2 in 2020 and 2021 respectively the reduction of stubble height prolonged the growth duration decreased the panicle number and increased the spikelets panicle 1 total spikelets and leaf area index compared with sh45 sh20 and sh0 increased the rc yield by 20 7 and 6 8 in 2020 respectively whereas no significant difference in rc yield was observed among different stubble heights in 2021 moreover the grain yield of rc at low stubble heights was more susceptible to rainfed treatment specifically rainfed treatment averagely decreased the rc yield by 4 9 12 7 and 17 2 at sh45 sh20 and sh0 respectively the grain yield of rc was positively correlated with the panicle number total spikelets and biomass accumulation while low stubble heights particularly sh20 had a greater magnitude of slope furthermore panicle number exhibited stronger correlations with spikelets panicle 1 and biomass accumulation at low stubble heights overall our results suggest that more attention should be paid to water management in the ratoon season and increasing the panicle number is crucial to the improvement of yield and yield stability of rc at low stubble heights keywords grain yield ratoon rice stubble height water management yield stability data availability data

al 2020 however rice ratooning has only been practiced as a measure to reduce the loss of rice yield caused by natural disasters such as flooding and lodging for a long time research on the biological characteristics and cultivation techniques of ratoon rice can be traced back to 1960s yang 1958 when the grain yield of ratoon crop rc was only 0 75 0 90 t ha 1 xu et al 2021 in the late 1970 s the planting area of ratoon rice began to increase rapidly with the development of hybrid rice for example the rc yield of the hybrid variety shanyou63 reached 3 00 3 75 t ha 1 xiong et al 2000 in 1997 the total harvested area and average grain yield of rc reached 750 000 ha and 2 0 t ha 1 respectively li et al 2009 however the planting area subsequently decreased sharply due to the serious shortage of rural labor the planting area of ratoon rice in hubei province which is located in central china sharply declined from 73 000 ha in 1994 to 6 700 ha in 2010 fei et al 2013 wang et al 2021 after 2010 mechanized rice ratooning technology has attracted the renewed interest in ratoon rice currently the planting area of ratoon rice in china and hubei province is about 1000 000 ha and 200 000 ha respectively wang et al 2021 rc yields exceeding 6 0 t ha 1 have been achieved in field trials in qichun county hubei province yang et al 2021 zheng et al 2021 rc grows from the sprout buds of the stubble left after the harvest of the main crop mc wang et al 2020 therefore rc can save the costs of land preparation seeds and crop establishment and thereby substantially increase the profits for farmers due to the shorter growth duration of rc than that of mc ratoon rice is particularly suitable for areas where light and temperature resources are surplus for one season crop but inadequate for two season crops dou et al 2016 ratoon rice can generate much higher net profits than single and double season rice the two dominant rice systems practiced in central china yuan et al 2019 compared with double season rice ratoon rice can reduce the carbon footprint by 27 4 owing to the lower carbon footprint in the ratoon season xu et al 2022 moreover rc was reported to have higher grain quality than the late season rice huang et al 2020 due to these advantages ratoon rice has developed rapidly and is expected to become one of the major cropping systems in china improvement of the yield and yield stability of rc is important for the development of ratoon rice there have been relatively more studies of the effect of fertilizer management on the yield of ratoon rice wang et al 2019 yang et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 while few studies have been focused on the effect of water management it has been reported that soil drying at the maximum tilling stage and middle late grain filling stage of mc can promote the growth of root system lin et al 2015 similarly zhang et al 2019 found that alternate wetting and drying awd irrigation in the main season could contribute to a higher rc yield than continuous flooding however heavy soil drying during the grain filling stage of mc would restrict the growth of ratoon buds and therefore reduce the yield of rc xiong and chinawong 1995 for rc mengel and wilson 1981 found that immediate flooding irrigation after mc harvest can improve the yield while shiraki et al 2020 reported that the dry regime before and after mc harvest has a more positive effect on rc yield compared with the saturated regime however water management in ratoon season is generally neglected by local farmers for the low water demand due to the relatively low temperature in ratoon season thus it is necessary to study the optimization of water management for ratoon rice stubble height of mc harvest is another important factor affecting rc yield a decrease in stubble height tends to reduce the total panicle number but increase the panicle number from basal nodes the panicle size and the growth duration xu et al 2021 the suitable stubble height is largely determined by the climatic conditions in rice production areas generally a lower stubble height of mc is believed to increase the rc yield depending on the climate conditions and rice cultivars harrell et al 2009 petroudi et al 2011 previous studies have reported that rc yield is positively correlated with ratooning ability chen et al 2018 a higher stubble height can preserve more ratoon buds from upper nodes thereby improving the yield and yield stability of rc cao et al 2020 nakano et al 2021 also proposed that retaining more leaves on the stubble could contribute to an increase in rc yield torres et al 2020 demonstrated that cutting stubble of 30 40 cm resulted in higher rc yield compared with 0 cm when mc was lodged before maturity in central china stubble heights of about 40 45 cm are recommended to ensure the safe heading of ratoon rice before 15 september based on local climatic conditions for the early harvest of mc the stubble height can be appropriately reduced to obtain high yield of rc however the response of rc yield at different stubble heights to water management in the main and or ratoon season remains elusive rice production is sensitive to changes in precipitation and climate change which highlights the importance of irrigation practices chandio et al 2021 as mentioned above there has been few studies focusing on the interactive effects of water management practices and stubble height on the agronomic performance of ratoon rice to address this question two year field experiments were conducted to explore the effects of different water management practices flooded vs rainfed during the main and ratoon season on the yield performance of mc and rc and compare the yield and yield stability of rc at different stubble heights 45 20 and 0 cm we hypothesized that 1 rainfed treatment would negatively affect the yield of rc and 2 a lower stubble height might increase the yield potential but decrease the yield stability of rc relative to a higher stubble height 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description field experiments were conducted in farmer s fields at jiupu village 30 16 n 115 37 e qichun county hubei province central china in 2020 the experiments were repeated in an adjacent field in 2021 the study area is located in a subtropical monsoon humid climate ratoon rice is the major rice cropping system in this region which is usually grown from march to october in the following non rice season the fields are left fallow before fertilizing and transplanting five soil cores were collected diagonally from the 0 20 cm soil

data including daily minimum temperature maximum temperature solar radiation and precipitation were collected from a weather station aws 800 campbell scientiﬁc inc usa located near the experimental field during the rice growth period from the transplanting of mc to the maturity of rc 2 2 experimental design and crop management the experiments were arranged in a split split plot design with water treatment in the main season as the main plot water treatment in the ratoon season as the sub plot and stubble height as the sub sub plot with four replications the plot size was 25 m2 5 5 m during the growth period both the main and ratoon season consisted of two water treatments flooded and rainfed treatments for the flooded treatment a 3 5 cm field water layer was maintained from transplanting to 7 10 d before the harvest of mc and then continuous flooding was kept after the harvest of mc to 7 10 d before the harvest of rc for the rainfed treatment irrigation was performed once in the main season for transplanting and once in the ratoon season after mc harvest after each irrigation the irrigation water depth was determined and the total water consumption of irrigation and rainfall in the main and ratoon season were calculated mc was harvested manually at maturity with three stubble heights 45 cm sh45 20 cm sh20 and 0 cm sh0 sh45 and sh20 could preserve the 2nd and 3rd node from the top respectively and sh0 could retain the basal node a two line hybrid rice cultivar fengliangyouxiang1 flyx1 which has been widely grown for rice ratooning in central china was used

transplanted into the paddy field on april 29 2020 and april 26 2021 at a hill spacing of 13 3 30 0 cm with two seedlings per hill the mc was harvested by hand at maturity august 5 2020 and 2021 a total of 180 kg n ha 1 was applied in three splits for mc 40 at 1 day before transplanting 30 at 10 days after transplanting and 30 at panicle initiation for rc a total of 150 kg n ha 1 was split equally and applied at 12 days after heading of mc and 2 days after harvest of mc about 40 kg p ha 1 60 kg k ha 1 and 5 kg zn ha 1 were applied at 1 day before transplanting of mc and 60 kg k ha 1 was applied at 12 days after heading of mc the n p k and zn fertilizers were applied in the form of urea calcium superphosphate potassium chloride and zinc sulfate heptahydrate respectively to prevent water exchange between plots all bunds were covered with plastic film inserted into the soil weeds diseases and insects were strictly controlled by chemicals throughout the entire two year experimental period 2 3 sampling and measurements twelve hills excluding the three border hills were sampled from each plot at heading stage of rc and at maturity of mc and rc at the heading of rc the plant samples were divided into stubble left from mc and regenerated parts and the regenerated parts were further separated into stem leaf and panicle the green leaf area was measured using a leaf

weather conditions and growth duration fig 1 shows the daily maximum temperature and minimum temperature solar radiation and precipitation during the rice growth season from the transplanting of mc to the maturity of rc during the main season the average daily maximum temperature was 30 0 and 30 5 the minimum temperature was 22 6 and 22 6 and the daily solar radiation was 14 2 and 14 6 mj m 2 d 1 in 2020 and 2021 respectively during the ratoon season the average daily maximum temperature was 26 5 and 28 1 the minimum temperature was 18 4 and 19 7 and the daily solar radiation was 12 1 and 12 6 mj m 2 d 1 in 2020 and 2021 respectively for mc the total precipitation was 789 4 and 483 7 mm in 2020 and 2021 respectively table 1 the average total water consumption of rainfed treatment decreased by 14 6 and 25 9 compared with flooded treatment in 2020 and 2021 respectively across different years the soil content under rainfed treatment was 63 4 80 2 table s1 for rc the total precipitation was 414 2 and 343 5 mm in 2020 and 2021 respectively table 2 the average total water consumption of rainfed treatment decreased by 26 3 and 28 8 compared with flooded treatment in 2020 and 2021 respectively across different years the soil content under rainfed treatment was 38 4 61 9 table s2 it should be noted that from mid june to early july in 2020 the study area experienced heavy rainfall of 580 mm and the field was flooded for about 10 days at the flowering stage in the main season the highest water level exceeded 1 2 of the plant height table 3 presents the phenology data including the sowing transplanting panicle initiation heading maturity dates of mc and the heading and maturity dates of rc the growth duration of mc was about 137 days while that of rc was 67 109 days the growth duration of rc was only 49 80 that of mc and increased with decreasing stubble height specifically the growth duration of rc at sh20 and sh0 was averagely 11 and 29 days longer than that of sh45 respectively in addition the growth duration of rc in 2020 was consistently longer than that in 2021 at different stubble heights 3 2 grain yield and yield attributes of mc the grain yield and yield attributes of mc are presented in table 4 in both years there was no significant difference in these yield traits between flooded and rainfed treatments in the main season however the grain yield in 2020 was 19 0 lower than that in 2021 due to a significant reduction of grain filling percentage and harvest index which could be attributed to the continuous heavy rainfall at the flowering stage as mentioned above 3 3 grain yield and yield components of rc water management in the main season exhibited no significant effect on the grain yield of rc in both years table s3 however water management in the ratoon season had a significant impact on the grain yield of rc in both years as for the stubble height it only showed a significant effect on the grain yield of rc in 2020 the grain yield and yield components of rc are shown in table 5 and table 6 compared with flooding rainfed treatment in the ratoon season in 2020 and 2021 significantly reduced the grain yield by 14 4 and 9 2 respectively however rainfed treatment in the ratoon season showed inconsistent effects on yield components between two years to be specific the yield reduction in 2020 under rainfed treatment could be ascribed to the reduction of spikelets m 2 which was mainly caused by a decrease in panicle number whereas in 2021 the yield decrease under rainfed treatment could be attributed to poor grain filling stubble height only showed a significant effect on the yield of rc in 2020 and a lower stubble height seemed to result in a higher yield as the grain yield of rc at sh20 and sh0 was 20 7 and 6 8 higher than that at sh45 respectively the stubble height had significant effects on the yield components and its effects on the panicle number spikelets panicle 1 and spikelets m 2 were consistent in both years with decreasing stubble height the panicle number decreased while the spikelets panicle 1 increased on average sh20 and sh0 had 19 2 and 29 6 smaller panicle number while 33 7 and 84 3 higher spikelets panicle 1 and correspondingly 8 2 and 29 7 higher spikelets m 2 than sh45 respectively in both years sh0 resulted in the lowest grain filling percentage however the stubble height exhibited inconsistent effects on grain weight in two years 3 4 other yield attributes of rc the plant height lai at heading cgr biomass accumulation hi and ratooning ability of rc are presented in table 7 and table 8 water management in the main season had no effect on these yield attributes in 2020 while rainfed treatment resulted in higher plant height lai cgr and biomass production at the pre heading stage in 2021 compared with flooding rainfed treatment in the ratoon season significantly reduced the plant height in both years moreover rainfed treatment in the ratoon season of 2020 significantly decreased the cgr and biomass accumulation at the post heading stage and ratooning ability by 35 7 36 7 and 11 8 respectively however in 2021 rainfed treatment in the ratoon season significantly decreased the pre heading cgr and hi by 4 2 and 7 3 respectively as for the stubble height it had significant impacts on all these indices in both years table s4 sh45 resulted in higher plant height than sh0 in 2020 but it was the opposite case in 2021 sh0 led to significantly higher lai than sh45 and sh20 in both years compared with sh20 and sh0 sh45 resulted in higher cgr but lower biomass accumulation at the pre heading stage which could be attributed to its shorter pre heading period by contrast sh0 had higher biomass accumulation at the pre heading stage than sh45 and sh20 due to its longer growth duration although different stubble heights resulted in significant differences in cgr at the post heading stage they had no significant effect on the biomass accumulation the hi of sh20 was significantly higher than that of sh45 and sh0 which was consistent in two years the reduction of stubble height tended to cause a significant decrease in ratooning ability 3 5 correlation analysis the correlations between yield and yield attributes were not consistent among different stubble heights fig 2 grain yield was significantly and positively correlated with panicles m 2 and spikelets m 2 and sh0 had a lower r2 value while sh20 had a higher slope among the three stubble heights grain yield was positively correlated with spikelets panicle 1 only at sh20 grain yield was positively correlated with biomass accumulation before heading at sh20 and after heading at sh20 and sh0 there was no significant relationship between yield and hi at the three stubble heights the panicles m 2 was significantly positively correlated with spikelets m 2 at sh20 fig 3a there was a stronger correlation between panicles m 2 and biomass accumulation before and after heading at low stubble heights sh20 and sh0 compared with that at sh45 fig 3b and c 4 discussion to date little research has been carried out on water management in ratoon rice a recent study by zhang et al 2019 reported that simplified awd irrigation during the main season could increase the yield of mc and rc by 3 7 and 6 8 respectively compared with continuous flooding however our results demonstrated that water management flooded vs rainfed in the main season has no effect on the yield of either mc or rc according to valipour et al 2020 field water evapotranspiration is affected by several meteorological factors including rainfall temperature and wind speed rainfall is a determinant factor affecting the yield of rainfed rice and frequent rainfall during the main season appeared to prevent soil moisture deficit in our study fig 1e and f particularly during the main season in 2020 heavy rainfall of 789 4 mm caused the flooding of rainfed plots for a long time thus supplying adequate water for rice growth similarly a previous study by yao et al 2012 conducted in an adjacent area showed no significant difference in grain yield between awd and flooded regimes in single season rice systems in contrast for rc water management flooded vs rainfed during the ratoon season significantly affected the grain yield our results revealed that continuous flooding increased the grain yield of rc by an average of 13 5 compared with rainfed treatment similarly mengel and wilson 1981 reported that immediate irrigation after mc harvest and continuous flooding until rc maturity could improve the yield of rc however rainfed treatment during the ratoon season showed inconsistent effects on yield attributes between two years in 2020 the yield reduction under rainfed treatment could be attributed to significant decreases in panicles m 2 spikelets m 2 and cgr and biomass accumulation after heading whereas in 2021 the yield reduction under rainfed treatment could be ascribed to significantly lower grain filling percentage pre heading cgr and hi these distinct results between the two years might be caused by the differences in rainfall pattern during the ratoon season fig 1e and f according to the study of mengel and wilson 1981 irrigation during 0 20 days after mc harvest directly affects the growth of ratoon tillers in this study the rainfall during this period was 92 and 214 mm in 2020 and 2021 respectively thus leading to a significant reduction in panicle number in 2020 moreover the rainfall during the heading stage 20 50 days after mc was 191 and 40 mm in 2020 and 2021 respectively serious soil moisture deficit at this stage in 2021 resulted in poor grain filling and low hi stubble height is a crucial agronomic practice that greatly determines the grain yield of rc in central china the stubble height of about 40 45 cm is generally recommended to ensure the safe heading of rc in this study the rc yield of sh20 and sh0 was significantly higher than that of sh45 in 2020 while the yield advantage of low stubble heights was not observed in 2021 generally low stubble heights result in a higher yield potential than high stubble heights but the effect is dependent on the local climatic conditions santos et al 2003 for example in west sumatra indonesia farmers typically re cut stubbles from 20 cm to 5 cm at 7 d after mc harvest which is known as the salibu system and was reported to increase grain yield of rc by 75 7 pasaribu et al 2018 however the salibu system might not be applicable in naypyidaw myanmar shiraki et al 2020 previous studies have reported that a decrease in stubble height from 40 cm to 20 cm could lower the growing point of axillary buds increase the spikelets panicle 1 and prolong the growth duration of rc harrell et al 2009 in the present study sh45 resulted in the shortest growth duration of rc which was 11 and 29 days shorter than that of sh20 and sh0 respectively table 3 compared with sh45 sh20 and sh0 led to 19 2 and 29 6 lower panicles m 2 while 33 7 and 84 3 higher spikelets panicle 1 thereby resulting in 8 2 and 29 7 higher spikelets m 2 respectively moreover the lai at the heading stage increased along with decreasing stubble height these results suggested that lowering the stubble height could simultaneously improve the source ability and sink size of rc yet the realization of its potential yield is dependent on the remaining temperature and light resources however in the present study low stubble heights seemed to result in a lower yield stability of rc on the one hand the yield advantage of rc at low stubble heights was only observed in 2020 which was attributed to more panicles m 2 and longer growth duration compared with those in 2021 it has been well documented that the nutrient status of the stem in the main season is significantly correlated with the panicle number of rc turner and jund 1993 he et al 2019 yang et al 2021 the more panicles m 2 of rc in 2020 might be explained by the fact that the poor grain filling in the main season led to the accumulation of more nutrients such as carbohydrates and mineral elements in the stem which promoted the sprouting of ratoon buds the longer growth duration might be ascribed to the lower temperature and radiation during the ratoon season in 2020 on the other hand low stubble heights led to significantly lower rc yield under rainfed treatment which was consistently observed in both years similar results were reported in the studies of harrell et al 2009 and nakano et al 2020 which were conducted at roughly the same latitude in south usa and southwestern japan respectively harrell et al 2009 indicated that 20 cm stubble height increased the rc yield in only one year of a two year study compared with 40 cm height and nakano et al 2020 reported that 50 cm stubble height contributed to a higher grain yield of rc than 20 cm height furthermore our results demonstrated that different stubble heights would lead to different relationships between rc yield and the yield attributes fig 2 although grain yield was significantly and positively correlated with panicles m 2 and spikelets m 2 at all three stubble heights low stubble heights particularly sh20 exhibited a greater magnitude of slope than sh45 moreover the yield and biomass accumulation only had a significant relationship at low stubble heights these results further proved that a lower stubble height would decrease the yield stability panicles m 2 was positively correlated with spikelets m 2 and biomass accumulation at sh20 and sh0 but not at sh45 fig 3 suggesting that increasing panicle number in the ratoon season is crucial for realizing the yield potential at low stubble heights according to previous studies the panicles m 2 of rc can be increased by selection of varieties with stronger ratooning ability and optimization of management during the main season such as increasing the panicle number improving the photosynthesis ability at the grain filling stage and controlling the pests and diseases wang et al 2020 xu et al 2021 yang et al 2021 overall our study highlights the importance of water management for rice yield during the ratoon season especially at low stubble heights although this study was conducted in central china the conclusion may be more applicable to rice growing areas in lower latitude where low stubble height is often recommended due to the higher accumulated temperature during rice growing season wang et al 2021 however this study ignored the genotypic difference and the growth dynamics of ratoon buds from different nodes which should be clarified in future study on the other hand specific high yield and water saving irrigation methods for rc under various environmental conditions still need to be explored 5 conclusions in central china the rainfall pattern varies widely between the main and ratoon season with more rainfall occurring in the main season water management during the main season has no effect on the grain yield of either mc and rc however rainfed treatment during the ratoon season significantly decreases the grain yield of rc lowering the stubble height increases the yield potential of rc due to the synchronous improvement of source ability and sink size whereas decreases the yield stability under suboptimal management practices and climate conditions increasing the panicle number in the ratoon season might be crucial for high yield and yield stability of rc at low stubble heights declaration of competing interest the authors
